<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Motivation is vivid and particular—she returns not to complete but to forgive—and her choices under pressure (opening the case, writing, then leaving the verdict blank) align with a coherent moral calculus. Interiority is embodied through tools and gestures (the thorn’s kiss, blood as ink). Contradictory impulses—duty to finish vs. mercy through restraint—are present in scene, not summarized. The renunciation at the end forecloses a path with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive is taught early and held; images and actions accrue toward a clear Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing closure. Orientation is clean within the first lines (who/where/purpose), and set-ups (key, unfinished scroll, unlinking strokes) pay off at the end. The cost is legible in the refusal to complete and the conscious return of power (key) to rest. The final reconfiguration—leaving a blank margin as verdict—lands on the page with conceptual weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The sanctuary, aurora, and stalactites are not mere décor; they shape method (key hums, air cradle), tempo (drips as metronome), and tone that charges the last image. Object-as-setting (thorn, case) constrains choices and enables the opening. World rules (patient trespass; lock as silence) are learned through action. The environment decisively charges the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around one stake: completion versus merciful restraint. The meaningful tightening arrives as she chooses to leave the margin blank and replant the thorn, renouncing power; the cost is exile renewed and work left open. Escalation in the accumulative mode is a density increase and cadence shift rather than a reversal, and it reads. The ending’s stance crystallization is earned by prior beats (unlinking as mercy).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: mercy as an act of unlinking and patience, justice disguised as cursive, forgiveness of the unfinished. Recurring images reweight at the end (key, blank margin, thorn taking root), offering a resonant answer without moralizing. The single explicit defense (“I did not betray you…”) is justified by scene and does not cheapen the subtext. The afterimage—room left for grief/time—is potent and earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>A distinct, coherent lyric voice with disciplined diction and patterned motifs that the text teaches early. The POV’s perceptual signature—craft idiom refracted through mercy—remains consistent and plausible. Rhythm modulates with pressure (measured strokes to a spacious final exhale). No head‑hopping or stance leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High information density with minimal scaffolding; figurative language is controlled and purpose‑driven. Parallel constructions feel patterned rather than looped, and images rarely blur sense. A few intensifiers verge on ornamental, but they don’t dull the closure. The final third is clean and precise.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—calligraphic mercy, a key that opens silence, a thorn as living nib—feels singular and inevitable in hindsight. Risks in concept and diction heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. Turns arise from established motifs rather than late rule changes. The piece resists template solutions and achieves authentic strangeness tethered to human cost.</comment>
