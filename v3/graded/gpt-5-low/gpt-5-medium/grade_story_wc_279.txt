<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The narrator’s interiority is vivid and character‑particular (“chalk is a listening stone”), and her micro‑choice to interject versus letting the hush self‑govern reveals a real value trade‑off. Contradictory impulses (facilitate vs. not smoothing with “lovely lies”) are present without being over‑tidy. Secondary figures are sketched efficiently with specific tells (the bearded man’s “small landslide,” the moss‑shawled child). The cost is subtle—she chooses mess over mastery—yet legible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the hush densifies, the tile reweights the circle, and the ending’s cadence shift (“rode home in breathing”) lands a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is clear from the outset (grotto, unlearning, facilitator). The decisive tightening occurs at the interjection and tile placement; cost is the relinquishment of certainty and slogans. Closure is earned though more explicit consequence could sharpen stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is exquisitely integrated: the whispering grotto’s acoustics and mist actively shape tactics, and the tile functions as micro‑setting that “angles listening.” Environmental detail evolves with action (wheel → tide map; grotto breathing) and decisively charges the final image. The world rules (ordinary magic of attention, sound leaning) are consistent and learned through use.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—discovering meaning without smoothing—tightens when the bearded man’s deflection threatens to ossify the mandala and the narrator intervenes. The tile placement and the child’s relay of the hush deepen pressure by reorienting the group’s stance. The price is conceptual (releasing slogans, accepting mess) rather than visceral, which slightly softens impact at the peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme coheres through particulars: attention as distributive magic, mess over certainty, teeth that “know when to bite and when to chew.” The final image reprices prior material—the hush becomes a portable ethic—not a stated moral. One line edges toward explicit thesis (“ordinary magic of attention distributing possibility fairly”), but it’s earned by scene work.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice with consistent POV bias; syntax and diction feel inseparable from the narrator’s way of seeing. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful and subtextual (“how his laughter shaped our circle”). Rhythm modulates with pressure, and elisions are taught early and paid off. No head‑hopping or register slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density with images doing double duty (wheel → tide map enacts thematic shift). Metaphoric texture is lush yet coherent; no notable loops or scaffolding. A few stacked metaphors verge on saturation, but clarity holds, and the closure image is clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis—ritual listening, a contraband whispering‑gallery shard, and communal unlearning—feels singular and necessary. Turns arise from established logic (the interjection, the tile’s placement, the child’s articulation). Bold but not gimmicky; the piece commits to its premise without retreat. The originality is emotional as much as conceptual.</comment>
