<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation is vivid and specific (“mirror the sky inside walls”), and prosopagnosia productively shapes perception and choices. Micro-choices under pressure—rubbing the coin, matching arcs to rings, testing pigment, bargaining for “one more minute”—reveal values and limits without tidy moralizing. Internal conflict is quiet (craft vs. clock) but credible; the endurance/readiness at the end feels earned. A touch more contradiction in-the-moment (e.g., a real risk of abandoning the mural) could have deepened the crucible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Hybrid drive with an accumulative climax: the hush/countdown + craft layers build to a charged poise as the building falls and the sky “survives.” Causal beats are clean (coin → safe → pigments → layered glazes → completion before blast), with the foreman’s “one more minute” tightening options. Closure lands on the page with cost (time, risk of collapse, acceptance of limits) and a reweighted world-rule (the room remembers dawn). Orientation is crisp from the outset.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The tree-hollow library is not mere backdrop; its rings enable the coin’s star-map method, its hollow physically holds through the blast, and its bark is the mural’s living surface. Sensory detail is precise and purposeful (“breath chooses careful places”), with environment dictating tactics. The final image (“dawn still glows on the bark”) is inseparable from place. World rules (guild craft, pigments, demolition pressure) stay consistent and legible.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finish a sky that can endure the fall) is clear and coherently pressured by the countdown and missing recipe. Escalation arrives via two decisive tightenings: solving the coin/safe puzzle to acquire pigments, and the ticking demolition forcing “breath-thin” layers and a negotiated minute. The visible costs (time, pigment fracture boundary, bodily stillness) channel into an earned endurance. A sharper on-page risk of failure mid-paint (e.g., a real misstep that costs a layer) might have heightened the pinch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: limits discovered through craft under time pressure; memory preserved when bodies and buildings fail; a face-blind artist reading weight/pressure rather than faces to paint character in sky. The guild’s letter risks thesis-stating, but it’s operationalized into tactics (“breath thin layers,” “meter of storms”). The final repricing—that a room can “remember dawn” and survive collapse through attention and limit—lingers without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature—edge/weight bias, tree-reading logic—infuses diction and image with control. Rhythm modulates with pressure (countdown hush → procedural puzzle → breath-led painting → charged poise), with no head-hopping. Elevated lyric register fits the artist’s mind and remains consistent under stress. Brief quoted pressures (foreman, radio) are clean and tonal glue rather than exposition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Line craft is highly controlled: images carry multiple jobs (theme, setting, tension) and momentum rarely stalls. Figurative density is high but coherent to the POV (“shoulders of clouds,” “coin’s music”) and avoids muddle or mixed vehicles. Minimal scaffolding and no noticeable loops; syntax varies to match breath-pressured moments. A couple of stacked metaphors flirt with saturation, but clarity and propulsion hold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: a face-blind portraitist painting a sky inside a tree-library under demolition, unlocking pigments via a coin read as a star map against growth rings. The craft puzzle is specific and irreplaceable, and the hush/pressure palette feels singular. Risks (lyric density, quiet climax) pay off with an inevitable-feeling final image. The piece commits fully to its premise without hedging.</comment>
