<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Clear, embodied motivation (“descend into necessary darkness”) drives concrete micro‑choices: mapping suits to shelves, choosing the stair, improvising a wick. Contradictory impulses—self‑salvage vs. saving a place she doesn’t own—surface (“save a lighthouse…or save her eye”) and inform the act. Emotional texture stays character‑particular (artist’s attention to faces/lenses) without therapy‑speak. The closing inscription credibly seals a stance change with a felt cost of responsibility.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Hybrid drive with causal spine: discovery of threaded cards → inference of redesign → descent → rewicking → light. Closure lands on the page with cost and commitment: she burns a new wick made from the deck’s threads and declares, “I will keep the light tonight,” reconfiguring her role. Orientation is crisp from the opening and supports the payoff. The pieces the keeper left function as a persistent constraint that shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The lighthouse library isn’t decorative; its gearhouse, lens, wick, and damp stacks tangibly constrain choices and enable the solution. Sensory detail is specific and purposeful (“stones sweating brine,” “rust ticked like a clock”). The environment keys the final image—the column of light stitching her to the weather. Objects recur as setting-forcing tools (cards, twine, wick housing) that charge the ending.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—rekindle the light to re‑aim herself—tightens as weather thickens and the wick proves perished. The decisive deepening is the choice to braid thread through the wick housing, risking loss of the deck to gain light. The price is understated but legible: relinquishing idle rumination for keeper‑duty, and sacrificing the “broken” divination tool to make guidance real. Tension operates at image and beat scale without relying on coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Threads, faces, and lenses braid into a theme of guidance reconfigured from fragments; the “fragmented reality” is repurposed into a working beam. The keeper’s line about untangling threads is reweighted at the end by action, not proclamation. The closing vow reframes fate from tarot to stewardship, a resonant answer to “Who answers the Keeper’s log when the Keeper is gone?” Ambiguity remains humane without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The lyrical, sea‑salted voice is controlled and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature (artist’s lexicon of faces, lenses, wicks). Psychic distance shifts are intentional and sharpen pressure rather than blur it. No head‑hopping or unwarranted certainty; elisions are patterned and paid off. Rhythm modulates effectively from hushed observation to flame’s urgency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lines carry high information density and purposeful metaphor; momentum rarely stalls. A few stacked images (“breath unclenched,” “light argued”) flirt with excess, but coherence holds and the closure beat is clear. Sentence variety and verb strength keep propulsion. Minimal scaffold; no paraphrase loops dull the peaks.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lighthouse‑library plus threaded tarot repurposed into a wick is a fresh, specific synthesis. The redesign puzzle taught by a vanished keeper reads inventive rather than gimmicky. Emotional truth (faces she failed to paint surfacing in the draft) complicates the concept in a memorable way. Risks in diction and structure heighten stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
