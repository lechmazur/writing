<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Motivation is clear from the outset—“to thaw mistrust with transparency”—and evolves into a risky, public confession that costs social capital and status. Contradictory impulses (keeper of ledgers/hush vs. hoarder of the lens/cowardice) act simultaneously and drive the decisive choice. Embodied moments (“my heartbeat is a drum in my wrists,” the lens “glows in my palm”) ground emotion. The closing renunciation (admitting fault, inviting judgment) feels earned by prior beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Hybrid drive with a causal dominant at closure: reading doodles → realizing non-culpability → choosing public projection → communal reconciliation. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when), and the beats link via because/therefore without teleports. Closure lands on-page with visible cost and a before/after in trust; the final image (water scene rolling; city tuned) confirms resolution. No structural slips; single-scene coherence holds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The “crystal forecourt after rain” and puddles actively shape action and final image—wet screen, chiming crystals, light behavior—beyond postcard description. The projector lens functions as micro-setting/tool constraining tactics and charging the end. Sensory selection is purposeful and POV-filtered; the world’s rule (“after words become unnecessary”) is learned through use rather than exposition. Atmosphere and place decisively color stakes and choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restoring trust) is signaled early, and pressure tightens as the narrator shifts from private holding to public risk. The decisive escalation is the choice to project evidence in front of all, foreclosing secrecy and risking censure. The city’s response (bolts and reel produced, communal nod) reads as earned via the protagonist’s action, not luck. Cost is social and reputational, felt in the moment before projection.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme—transparency and communal trust—emerges through images (lens, light, reflections, “ambiguously clear” proofs) rather than didactic statements. The ending reweights prior material: nonverbal proof and shared seeing restore a social contract (water oath). A single explicit line (“learning to be freed by honesty”) edges on stating the thesis, but it’s earned and supported by scene pressure. Resonance lingers in the charged quiet rather than a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinctive lyric voice with tactile, image-driven perception remains consistent under stress. Psychic distance tightens at peak beats (the hush, raised hands) with controlled modulation. Elision and metaphor are pattern-taught and legible; no head-hopping or register drift. The POV’s certainty aligns with access; inference reads as inference.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density with images that do multiple jobs; rhythm varies and carries momentum. Lush metaphors largely cohere to light/water/glass without muddle; minimal redundancy and no template cadence. A hint of purple risk is managed by clarity at turns and closure. Line-level choices support propulsion into the public confession and gentle denouement.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis—post-verbal city, crystal forecourt, lens as truth-taster, doodle-evidence projected to heal mistrust—feels fresh and necessary. Turns arise from established particulars rather than twisty contrivance. The final reconfiguration (shared seeing as civic repair) is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Bold tonal and worldbuilding choices heighten stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
