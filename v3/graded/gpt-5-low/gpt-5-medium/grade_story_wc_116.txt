<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear, specific interiority and a credible ethos (“sworn to witness change without judgment”) guide micro‑choices like counting pleats and refusing to protest the mushroomed alphabet. The tension between loosened grip on reality and the oath is present but not deeply dramatized in a single pressured beat. Embodied moments (mortar seasoning tea, finger tracing tunnels) keep emotions grounded. The endurance/renunciation at the end reads earned, if quiet.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive holds: pressure accrues via flood, bricked niche, and the obsidian room’s discovery toward an Earned Stasis. Orientation is early and stable (catacomb library, river, swan). Closure lands as a resonant recommitment to witnessing tethered by “regenerative silence,” with conceptual cost (renouncing judgment, living with decay). The causal threads are soft but coherent for this mode.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is vividly tactile and POV‑filtered (“aisles veined with moss,” “obsidian refuge”) and constrains choices (burrowing, retreating, self‑mending shelves). The river and catacomb architecture actively shape action and stakes. Recurring objects (swan, ledger, shelves) function as micro‑settings that charge the final image. World rules remain consistent within the lyric logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—enduring as a nonjudgmental witness amid decay—tightens during the flood, forcing the burrow and sanctuary retreat. The meaningful deepening is the on‑page recognition that “regenerative silence” is glue, not magic. Costs are felt in renunciation and ongoing fragility (crumbling peace, loosened judgments) rather than dramatic loss. Escalation is modest but coherent for an accumulative design.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme coheres through particulars: composting silence, mushrooms reordering text, and the swan’s folds recast maps as patience. The ending reweights the premise—listening as repair—without moralizing, offering a resonant non‑literal answer. Subtext of authority versus humility (keeper who refuses the gavel) hums beneath actions. It’s rich, with no late, forced symbols.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinct, confident lyric voice with disciplined metaphoric control; syntax and rhythm modulate well (“Sometimes…” anaphora used purposefully). POV is stable and plausibly bounded. Diction stays coherent to the keeper’s sensibility without register slips. The voice carries pressure rather than obscuring it.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density with images doing multiple jobs; minimal scaffolding or loops. Figurative language is abundant but largely precise and legible, with few overreaches. Momentum holds through variation in sentence rhythm and image work. The lushness presses the ceiling a bit, but clarity at closure remains intact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The origami swan as navigational method, “regenerative silence,” and the obsidian cellar synthesize into an uncommon, unified vision. Risks in conceit and diction pay off, with implications followed through. Turns grow from established pattern (flood → niche → room → re‑pricing of silence). The piece feels singular rather than templated.</comment>
