<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The summoner’s motive—hushing a coded prophecy—is clear and consistent, with agency enacted through restraint and attention. Interiority is conveyed via embodied listening (“lantern of calm,” “measured breathing”), though internal contradiction remains subtle rather than pressurizing. The choice not to “erase” but to “release” reveals character, yet the cost reads more as discipline than sacrifice. Overall, persuasive and particular, if a touch emotionally buffered.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: pressure mounts through pattern–density and cadence until the code’s resistance (“clinging to a stone like frost”) meets a focused counter-tactic (breath-guided attention). Closure lands on the page as a resonant reconfiguration: the code unknots, and what remains is “room,” with the cost of humility and ongoing vigilance (“did not claim victory... keep listening”). Orientation is clean early; pattern taught and paid off. The final image reweights the premise with felt conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The brook, alder, cedar, and night form an integrated micro‑ecology that actively shapes tactics (using water’s flow to map silence) and charges the ending (“the brook’s arithmetic relaxed into music”). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful across sound, touch, and sight (foam peaks, “moonmilk,” moth‑like whispers). The wing and water entwine to make setting a functional instrument, not a backdrop. Minor note: the broader world rules stay lyrical but consistent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes are singular and legible: prevent “iron noon” by releasing the code. Escalation proceeds via density and a midpoint snag (“the code balked at vanishing”), prompting a tactical adjustment—measured breathing and attention guiding. The price is largely internal (patience, non‑triumphal restraint), credible for this mode, though not viscerally costly. The tightening is sufficient and earned under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme coheres around listening as mercy versus mechanized destiny (“a sun trapped in gears”). Recurring images (flow, grammar, wing) reconfigure by the end into a modest, duty‑bound ethic (“Go... keep listening”). One explicit line (“I do not erase; I release...”) edges toward thesis, but it’s grounded by concrete action and not overbearing. The piece invites reflection without sermonizing, with lingering ambiguity about future vigilance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature that marries ritual precision to natural imagery. Rhythm modulates with pressure (from lush imagery to tightened arithmetic at the knotting beat) without opacity. The single spoken line is apt and restrained, and focalization remains steady. Patterned diction is taught early and paid off cleanly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line‑level craft shows high information density and clean momentum; images seldom feel redundant and metaphors cohere to water, listening, and code. Occasional flourish (“moonmilk,” “terrestrially cosmic”) risks purple but stays legible and voice‑true. No paraphrase loops or template cadences blunt the closure image. Syntax varies to match pressure, landing a resonant final cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mapping silence via a paper wing on a star‑shimmering brook to unwind a coded prophecy feels singular and fully committed. The fox’s punctuation tail and “grammar of water” synthesize risk and freshness without gimmickry. The ending’s reweighting—room instead of erasure—feels non‑obvious yet inevitable. Strong, memorable integration of concept, object, and ethic.</comment>
