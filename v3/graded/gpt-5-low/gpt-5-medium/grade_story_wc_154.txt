<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and specific: a translator whose compulsion to “graft new meaning onto old wounds” governs tactful, embodied micro‑choices (turning the coral, starting with the boy’s boats). The relationship pressure with mother and uncle is delicately staged and alters their state by the end. Internal contradiction is quiet but present—balancing reverence for grief with the audacity to interpret a child’s cast into a bridge. The cost is emotional exposure and the risk of misstep in a fraught space, credibly borne.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure builds through waiting, decoding, and the family’s arrival, resolving in a resonant reconfiguration when the room “unclenches.” Orientation is clean from the opening (atrium, anesthetic, role, stakes). Closure lands with cost through a charged poise rather than a decisive act—their small connection, enabled by the child’s “Also Us,” reweights the scene. The surgeon’s news avoids deus ex machina by not solving the core bridge, which has already begun.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting and object are integral: misted atrium, hospital soundscape, and especially the coral fragment function as micro‑setting and tool, constraining pauses and charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and voice‑filtered (“monitors speak pelagic syllables,” kestrels as commas). The environment coheres with the thematic weather/sea lexicon without feeling touristic. The fog’s “treaty we can read only by touch” is a precise environment‑inflected closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can the translator soften a live divide during the surgical wait—tightens as the family returns and the interpreter chooses tactic: start with the boy’s cartoon, not history. The visible price is vulnerability and the gamble of reframing their fears as “shared,” with failure implying renewed estrangement beside a child’s uncertain outcome. Escalation is quiet but coherent under the accumulative lens, with a meaningful turn when the mother mouths the Reka word. The surgeon’s news adds relief but doesn’t undercut the earlier earned bridge.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme—translation as an ethics of holding rain without drowning—emerges through coral/cast/boats motifs rather than lecture. Subtext operates in the child’s “Also Us,” the smudged inks, and the fog‑as‑treaty, culminating in the understated “we brought ourselves.” One explicit mission line risks thesis‑speak, but it’s backed by enacted choices. The resonance lingers without neat moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The voice is a confident, sea‑inflected lyric with a distinct perceptual signature; metaphors are consistent to role and place. POV is stable and modest, with no head‑hopping; reported dialogue carries subtext and goal pursuit. Rhythm modulates with pressure, tightening around key reveals. Elevated diction fits the narrator’s sensibility and never breaks plausibility.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Line craft is strong: high information density, purposeful images doing double duty, and controlled cadence. Figurative texture is rich yet coherent; minimal redundancy and no scaffold loops. A few lines tilt toward overt metaphor stacking, but they don’t blur sense or slow momentum. The final line recharges earlier motifs with clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: a conflict‑zone translator decoding a child’s rain‑smudged cast, using coral as punctuation and treaty, feels singular and inevitable in hindsight. Risk‑taking in design (lyric accumulative pressure, object‑as‑setting) heightens stakes without gimmickry. The “Also Us” move elegantly reconfigures opposition. Minor familiarity in war‑and‑healing thematics is outweighed by executional specificity.</comment>
