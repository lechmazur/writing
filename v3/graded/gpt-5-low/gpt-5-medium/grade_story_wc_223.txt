<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The narrator’s motive—archiving “small gestures” in a hostile regime—is vivid and enacted through concrete micro‑choices (coaching walkers, choosing words, refusing spectacle). Contradictions (former “crisis actor” vs. real survivor; “benevolently ruthless”) play on the page, not just in labels. The renunciation of the victim script creates a credible before/after with cost. Secondary figures are sketched but functionally pressure the POV without stealing focus.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens is taught early (walking‑as‑writing; echo as archive) and held to closure. The ending lands as a charged poise/earned stasis: the narrator resolves to leave only the board and lantern, accepting anonymity and risk as the price of a people’s archive. Orientation (interregnum, whispering gallery) is clear and feeds the final image. Causal tightness is less important than the cadence shift, which is precise and felt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The whispering gallery’s acoustics and the lantern’s shadow actively constrain choices (walking words, outlawed recordings, echo as contraband). The chessboard functions as micro‑setting/tool that charges the final image. Environmental logic stays consistent and integrated with action. The place isn’t mere backdrop; it directly enables the method and stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around making an illicit record without spectacle; escalation accrues through the sequence of words (water → stay → hear/here → hush) and the pawn substitution. Stakes deepen via outlawed recordings and the looming regency, culminating in the decision to leave artifacts and vanish. Costs are implied rather than dramatized in conflict beats, keeping this short of peak intensity. Still, the tightening is unmistakable under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Themes of witness, solidarity, and decolonizing spectacle emerge from particulars (pawns vanishing, button as comet, hear/here split) rather than moralizing. The final choice reweights the premise: history as footfall and echo rather than recorders and rulers. A few declarative lines (“I unbind the record from spectacle…”) tread close to thesis, but they are earned by scene pressure and images. Resonance lingers without neat closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A distinctive, controlled lyric voice with coherent POV distance; syntax and diction match a mind trained on pattern and sound. Patterned elisions (echoes “reading without eyes”) are taught and kept legible. Dialogue fragments serve action/subtext and don’t break the spell. No head‑hopping or register drift undermines the stance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is precise and musical with high information density; metaphors (nomadic penumbra, rivered marble) are coherent and non‑redundant. Rhythm modulates purposefully (quicker during spelling beats, breathing at the close). A rich figurative load skirts purple without tipping into muddle. No loops or scaffolding dilute momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis—archiving via choreographed footsteps in a whispering gallery during an interregnum, guided by a “nomadic penumbra”—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risks (lyric conceit, conceptual closure) heighten meaning rather than obscure it. Objects and concepts are uniquely leveraged (missing pawns, outlawed recordings, echo as contraband). Emotional truth undergirds the novelty.</comment>
