<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Motivation is clear—salvage and “reimagine passage”—and choices align with craft-competence under pressure. Interiority is textured and embodied (“trusting grain the way surgeons trust arteries”). Internal contradiction is mild (resolve outweighs doubt), which slightly softens complexity. Still, the vow at the end reads as an earned endurance shift rather than a tidy epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: pressure accrues from storm → lantern projection → collaborative build → dawn gate. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: a new gate exists and a vow reframes future journeys, with conceptual cost (renunciation of haste, commitment to patient joins). Orientation is strong early; causality is lyrical but coherent. Cost is felt though not punishing, keeping it just shy of the top band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The storm, archway, driftwood, and lantern are tactile and integral, constraining tactics and charging the final image. Environmental specifics guide choices (shelter under arch, scavenging tideline) and the weather modulates action and tone. World rules stay consistent and are learned through doing. The gate as object-setting is excellent micro‑setting payoff.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reimagining passage—tightens as the storm’s pressure meets the build; the lantern’s reveal deepens options and accelerates commitment. Escalation is steady rather than sharply turning; no hard reversal, but density and agency increase credibly. The price (labor in storm, surrendering haste) is present though understated. Earned resolution stems from protagonist’s choices, not luck.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of patient joining vs. blunt haste is dramatized through materials, technique, and alliances across time; images shift meaning at the end. Subtext hums in the grandmother/future girl coalition and the gate “through, not out.” A couple of explicit articulations (“not magic for spectacle”) flirt with telling but don’t undercut the resonance. The final vow reweights the premise cleanly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A distinct, confident lyric POV with consistent lexicon and rhythmic control; sensory noticing feels character‑particular. Psychic distance is steady; elisions are purposeful. No head‑hopping and no info the narrator couldn’t plausibly infer. Minor risk of lushness is managed by clarity under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lines carry high information density; images often do multiple jobs (craft, theme, mood) without muddle. A few heightened metaphors cluster, but they cohere to sea/wood/craft rather than mixing vehicles. Syntax varies and momentum holds; no paraphrase loops or cadence templates. Final images are clean and unblurred by purple excess.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: driftwood craft + magic lantern “timewoven alliances” is striking and cohesive. Risks (lyric density, conceptual slide) heighten stakes and pay off with a tangible gate and conceptual repricing. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight given the established grammar of joining. Memorable voice and images avoid template solutions.</comment>
