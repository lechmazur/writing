<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation is clear—“transpose life into a new key”—and choices align (taking the specs to the lighthouse, choosing “You already know”). Interiority is distinct and embodied (“hands sticky with sugar and salt”). The keeper dynamic adds light pressure and textured status play without stealing focus. Cost is subtler than harrowing, but the social reconfiguration and risk of exposure register credibly at this length.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: envelope → decision to repurpose specs → lighthouse projection → town-wide repricing of “open secrets.” Orientation lands early (island/harbor/night) and the two-shard movement to the lighthouse is legible. Closure is a conceptual repricing/charged poise that lands on the page (“You already know” lighting the town), with a felt social cost. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural with causal spine and holds through the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The lighthouse is not mere backdrop; its lens becomes the tool that shapes tactics and charges the final image. Harbor/dock/night textures are specific and POV-filtered (“neon fizzed out like a tired constellation”). World rules stay coherent as the lens projects fortunes across kitchens. Setting actively constrains and empowers the plan, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—publicly surfacing what the town already knows—tightens from private handling of the envelope to a public broadcast. The key escalation is the choice to enlist the lighthouse and stamp microdots, foreclosing the safer path of secrecy. Price is social and strategic (agent deceived, town reoriented), if quiet. Tension rides sentence-level pressure and a decisive middle turn rather than multiple reversals, fitting the form.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Themes of communal complicity, mercy in exposure, and arrangement over revelation emerge from particulars, not pronouncement. The final line “see what you have done” elegantly reweights agency and responsibility. Recurring images (light, fortunes, water/flow) accrue meaning and shift at the end without moralizing. The piece invites reflection on power and truth-telling with earned ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A singular, lyrical first-person voice with consistent diction and selective noticing. Dialogue is sparse but charged with subtext (“You are making a habit of orchestrating the weather”). Elision is purposeful; confidence and modesty of knowledge remain plausible. Rhythm modulates well from textured observation to decisive action.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line-level craft is dense yet precise; images do double duty (“microdots…like pupils”). Very few redundancies; momentum holds through lyric compression. A high metaphor count risks purple drift, but control and clarity are maintained, especially around the closure image. Syntax varies and punctuation is clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fortune cookies + microdots + lighthouse projection is a striking, coherent synthesis. The “open secrets” reframing via communal illumination feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking serves meaning rather than gimmickry. The voice and world cohere into a memorable, non-template stance.</comment>
