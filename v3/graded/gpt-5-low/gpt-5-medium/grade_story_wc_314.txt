<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and character‑particular: she refuses to read the formulas, privileging wonder and embodied listening. Contradictory impulses (ledger vs. lullaby) are dramatized through micro‑choices (small flame, ribbon ritual, placing the reliquary under roots). The felt cost is a renunciation of control/certainty in favor of calibrated trust. Quiet but credible change culminates in “walked out carrying nothing but balance.”</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: signs (starlings’ geometry, waterfall moods, copper light) tighten toward the sealing act. Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration: orchard “remembers,” roots and sap change, and Iri forecloses the path of recitation. Cost is legible in the chosen restraint and surrender of the reliquary. Orientation is clean early (Iri, orchard behind cascading veils; the “before final transformation” clock).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and charged; details are selective and purposeful (roots shielding crystal from flame, copper phase cueing her vow). The environment constrains tactics and charges the final image: hidden orchard, kaleidoscopic waterfall, stone “worn smooth by generations of waiting.” Rules are learned through action (birds as law/map; crystal as memory). The final tone-home synthesis arises from place.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (balance before transformation) tightens via pattern accumulation and a decisive refusal (not reading formulas). Escalation is subtle but coherent: birds teach, hour ripens, ember patience, copper cue, then sealing. The price is internal—relinquishing certainty and possession—which fits the lens but keeps jeopardy low. Resolution is earned by her altered stance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of harmonizing logic and intuition is woven through recurring objects (flame, crystal, ribbon, birds) and reprised with new weight at the end. The grandmother’s counsel arrives as image‑language within the world’s logic, not as moralizing. The final “home” tone reweights prior material without stating a thesis. Ambiguity is purposeful, not confusing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third‑person with a distinct perceptual signature; metaphors align with the world’s idiom (alchemy, birds, water, math). Distance and stance stay stable; purposeful elision is taught and paid off. Rhythm modulates with pressure, avoiding head‑hopping or register breaks. No dialogue needed; the voice carries subtext.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density; most lines do double duty in image and action. Figurative language is frequent but coherent and pattern‑consistent, with minimal redundancy. Syntax varies and momentum is maintained through micro‑actions. Slight flourish risk is balanced by clarity at peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: starlings as theorem, crystal as memory, flame as calibrated restraint, waterfall moods signaling phases. The turn (choosing wonder over formulas) feels inevitable in hindsight given seeded motifs. Risks in diction and design heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. The final reconfiguration is distinctive and memorable.</comment>
