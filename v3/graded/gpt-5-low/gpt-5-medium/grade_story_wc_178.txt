<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrator’s frugality, skepticism, and reverence create a credible contradiction that tightens into a vow. Choices on the page—aligning wires, pouring water, pressing the bead, pledging maintenance—flow from those traits. Embodied detail (“the air hummed against my teeth,” “pepper and rain”) grounds interiority. Cost is explicit: oil, hours, and a renunciation of spectacle for stewardship.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hybrid with an accumulative/textural dominance: a clear because/therefore chain (tile → schematic → arcs → alcove → urn → disk → map → vow) builds to Earned Stasis. Closure lands in the pledge to maintain the wires and arithmetic, with a tangible price. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when). The pressure remains quiet but coherent and unbroken.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The palace-as-observatory actively shapes tactics—bronze pins, wires, star risings, drains, alcoves, grooves. Sensory specificity is rich without touring: pepper and rain, soot shivering, violet‑silk dusk. Objects recur to charge the final image (wires “singing sometimes” after the vow). Environment and tools constrain choices and frame the covenant.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether and how to answer the palace’s “encrypted devotion”—tightens via Saturn’s timing, the note, the urn, and the map’s ask. The meaningful turn is accepting stewardship rather than seeking treasure; cost is sustained maintenance under scarcity. Escalation is inward but legible, each discovery demanding a deeper commitment. The vow forecloses spectacle and power-seeking paths.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme coheres as faith through meticulous attention, not spectacle; “empirically ironic” devotion is earned through concrete acts. Recurring images (wires, sums, dusk/note) shift meaning at the end into a quiet sacrament of maintenance. One slightly on‑the‑nose line (“People will call it superstition…”) edges toward statement, but the closing image restores resonance. The conceptual cost—choosing stewardship over grandeur—lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A distinctive, controlled first‑person with precise, profession‑colored noticing. Aphoristic flashes (“Frugality is a lens”) are voice‑motivated and tethered to action. Distance and certainty stay within what this observer can know; no leakage or head‑hopping. Rhythm modulates well from procedural to numinous.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density with clean propulsion; images do multiple jobs without bloat. Figurative language is vivid yet coherent (“violet silk torn to ribbons,” “soot that shivered”) and rarely overstacked. Minimal scaffolding and no paraphrase loops. Syntax varies to support the unfolding ritual.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original fusion of astronomy, Babylonian architecture, and covenantal ritual via arithmetic and maintenance. The tile, wires, and dusky note reconfigure devotion in a fresh, inevitable way by the pledge. Risks a quiet, anti‑spectacle climax and makes it land. Specificity and conceptual integrity feel singular.</comment>
