<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Arlen’s motive—to forge “safe zones for inquiry” from an abandoned site—is clear and embodied through specific, tactile choices (salvaging shards, warming a kiln, placing vessels). His habit of narrating tasks reveals temperament and coping, not quirk. The internal conflict (“old fear that science and tenderness could not share a bench”) culminates in a credible renunciation. Cost is modest but legible (fatigue, scarcity, and a principled commitment that forecloses retreat).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive holds: the melt, kiln brightening, and crafted vessels steadily reweight the stake. Closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration: he sets the bookmark at “care and risk,” plans a gathering, and chooses to hold the room. Constraints (dead grid, fuel dependence, cold) shape tactics and the final image. Cost is on the page (“arms shook,” limited fuel), and the before/after is legible without a forced decisive act.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The control room’s cold, thaw, and dead grid constrain action and texture every choice; the bookmark and console recur as charged micro‑settings. Sensory specificity is vivid across senses (lace‑melting ice, dust deltas, propane and salt). Environment directly shapes tactics (fuel‑bred heat; repurposing lab glass; green lamps). The final placement of vessels on the console and the bookmark’s re‑shelving charge the ending.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes are quiet but coherent: can he establish a tender, safe practice in a harmful legacy space. Escalation is a measured intensification—kiln to orange, assembling vessels, then committing to host others. The narrowing is ethical and procedural rather than peril‑driven; a viable alternative (abandoning the project) is foreclosed. The price is endurance and ownership of risk, if not a dramatic external loss.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme integrates through action and image: thaw as moral and material process; “safeness is not a wall” becomes operational in how he crafts vessels and space. Subtext in the bookmark and imagined technician reframes rules as care rather than constraint. A few lines verge on aphorism (“the purpose is to notice what hurts and make space”), but they’re earned by the preceding particulars. The final image reweights the premise without a didactic bow.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The voice is singular—ceremonial, gently wry—and remains anchored in Arlen’s perception. Patterned narration of tasks is consistent and character‑made, not authorial flourish. Rhythm modulates with heat and thaw, and whispers read as lived action rather than speechifying. No head‑hopping or register slips undermine credibility.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is strong: rich figurative texture with clear sequencing and minimal scaffolding. A high metaphor density risks purple, but coherence holds and images rarely crowd each other. Refrains (“he narrated”) serve pattern rather than padding. Minor sentimentality in the final aphorism trims the ceiling.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A glassblower repurposing an Arctic control room into a sanctuary for inquiry via ceremonial narration feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The bookmark motif elegantly bridges abandonment and care without cliché. The melt as ethical and physical engine is a smart synthesis of world and theme. The risks in tone and structure pay off without obscuring clarity.</comment>
