<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and particular—an unpaid, “functionally creative” intern determined to engineer hope—and actions align concretely (rerouting water, power, air). Interiority is specific and embodied through tools and tasks rather than abstractions. The janitor’s presence adds relational texture without diluting the protagonist’s agency. The change is credible but quiet, with cost framed as ongoing maintenance rather than a sharp sacrifice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Hybrid drive with an accumulative cadence: a sequence of functional fixes (because/therefore) builds toward a charged, purposeful stasis. Orientation is clean; causality tracks from diagnostics to interventions to visible outcomes (sinks, fans, heat, light). Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—the terminal’s purpose re-aimed, with tomorrow’s burden implied. Cost is understated but legible in the commitment to maintenance and the rejection of grander, rocket-era fantasies.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The terminal is tactile, constraint-rich, and shapes every choice (drainage, power, ventilation, light), while the sextant micro-setting charges bearings and the final image. Details are selective and POV-filtered through an engineer’s priorities. Environmental change responds causally to actions, deepening atmosphere and stakes. The setting’s rules remain consistent and operative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes center on resurrecting function for community need; pressure tightens via actionable fixes, a wary janitor, and the mother’s arrival, culminating in an earned quiet readiness. Tension is gentle but cumulative; the key deepening is aligning intention (intern + janitor) which reconfigures the maze into a workable plan. The cost is present as sustained labor and redefined ambition, though it could bite harder. No undercutting coincidence; agency drives resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme—hope as a system—emerges from specific acts (valves, breakers, rerouting) and the sextant’s non-literal guidance. The final moments reweight the premise toward maintenance and communal care without sentimentality. One explicit line (“hope is engineered...”) edges toward stating the thesis, but it’s earned by prior scene work. Subtext in the janitor’s laugh and the sinks “speaking mathematics” lands with restrained grace.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A distinct, lyrical yet pragmatic voice with consistent focalization and measured modulation under pressure. Dialogue is sparse, natural, and status-aware, advancing stakes with implication (“paid in tickets”). Diction coheres to the character’s lexicon (flows, gradients, vanes) without register drift. Rhythm varies effectively, supporting both wonder and work.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density with purposeful figurative language tied to function; minimal scaffolding or loops. Metaphors (“silence took inventory of echoes,” “sinks speak mathematics”) feel coherent to voice and do not blur action. Syntax and paragraphing control momentum from diagnostic to remedial to reflective beats. Minor lyric flourish remains legible and never cloys.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of civil-engineering praxis with post-carnival spaceport melancholy and a sextant as moral instrument. Turns arise from grounded choices, not gimmicks, and the final repricing of hope is non-obvious yet inevitable. The risk—quiet, procedural lyricism—pays off in specificity and integrity. It reads singular rather than templated.</comment>
