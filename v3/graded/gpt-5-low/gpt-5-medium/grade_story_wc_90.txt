<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Motivation is precise and consistent (open the lock without violence), and tactics arise from traits (joy/grief weight, pacifism). Contradictory impulses operate in scene: she must “push” while refusing harm, calibrating buoyancy instead of forcing. Embodied emotion (boots kiss the deck; hinges scream) keeps interiority concrete. The final pledge to unseal only what can be tended is an earned renunciation with cost (self‑limitation and ongoing solitude).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Hybrid with an accumulative/textural dominance: patterned images (weight, tears, stitching) build toward the opening, and causality is clean where it matters (balance → lock yields). Orientation is crisp early (last caretaker on a recycled ship, a physical lock with rules). Closure lands on the page: the chamber opens, its nature reprices the mission, and the pledge forecloses conquest. Cost is legible in the earned stasis: ongoing self‑discipline and custodianship instead of release or victory lap.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The ship and its micro‑settings actively constrain choices: bulkhead scale, greenhouse, comet anchor, portholes mapping the lock. Recurring objects (albums, kwan yin’s tear) function as setting‑tools shaping tactics and the end image. Sensory detail is selective and lived‑in (“salt veins,” “rag of comet”) and world rules stay consistent. The environment charges the final poise (keeping the ship warm; sprouts rising) and feels indispensable.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear and tight: open the dimension without violating pacifist ethics. Pressure coheres and deepens through one meaningful tightening: calibrating affect to weight while integrating shadow work to avoid both flight and sink. The door’s demand for a story adds an on‑page test that narrows options and exacts a price (vulnerability, grief integration). Resolution is earned through sustained restraint rather than a single wrenching turn, fitting the chosen lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme arises organically: compassion that includes shadow, beginnings over conquest, grief as map. The library‑not‑armory reveal and the vow reweight the premise without moralizing. Recurring images (tears, weight, stitching) shift meaning at the end, delivering a resonant, non‑literal answer. The emotional aftereffect is concrete and unsentimental: custodial joy tempered by accepted burden.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The lyric first‑person voice is distinct and controlled, with metaphors anchored in the lived physics of the piece. Distance and stance remain stable; elisions feel purposeful and pattern‑taught early. Diction coheres with the narrator’s sensibility (“secondhand shine,” “forgiving weight”). No head‑hopping or register drift; rhythm modulates to match pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sentence‑level craft is tight, with high information density and minimal scaffold. Figurative language is vivid yet disciplined; images interlock rather than compete (weight/gravity, salt/tears, stitch/promise). Rhythm varies cleanly, and the final lines recharge opening motifs without redundancy. No loops or muddled metaphors to dull the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The premise and its execution feel singular: affect‑tuned gravity, a lock judged by balanced joy/sorrow, maps of dried tears as navigation, and a library of beginnings. Turns grow from seeded logic rather than late rule drops. The risk of quiet, non‑combative stakes pays off in a charged poise ending. The synthesis reads inevitable in hindsight and memorable in texture.</comment>
