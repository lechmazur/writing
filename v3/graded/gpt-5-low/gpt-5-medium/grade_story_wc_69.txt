<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mara’s motive and contradictions are vivid: “stubborn practice rather than effortless gift,” “expectantly resigned yet offering breath.” Micro-choices (placing the rosette between Rafi and Ola, denoting rests, passing the pencil) reveal values under pressure. Secondary portraits (Rafi, Ola, Jin) are specific through sonic signatures and behavior. The change—shouting to listening, hostility to shared cadence—reads earned with a felt cost of relinquished judgments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds from the opening hush to the final “denoted” silence. Closure lands as a charged poise: the final rest and passing of the rosette reprice the premise with the cost of unlearning and restraint. Orientation is clean early (velvet library, cabinet of scores, Mara’s role), and the set-ups pay off (rests, rosette, subtracting noise). The on‑page exchange—Rafi catching and offering the rosette—crystallizes the turn without violating the lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The velvet library and autumnal hush are not backdrop; the room “listens,” shaping tactics toward silence and trust. The rosette as micro‑setting constrains a meeting when placed between Rafi and Ola and charges the final image as it’s passed through the rows. Sensory selection is purposeful and POV‑filtered (curtains like patient throats, shelves breathing). The environment’s stillness coheres with the method of subtracting noise and the ending’s silence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—braiding divided voices—tightens through the rehearsal to performance arc. The key pressure point is the Rafi–Ola face‑off reoriented by the rosette and rests; later, the audience’s suspicion/hope “taps” align. Costs are quiet but legible: relinquishing anger’s timing and risking public imperfection. Escalation is accumulative rather than adversarial yet narrows options toward shared silence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme (“listening over slogans,” “subtracting noise”) arises from practice and image, not mere assertion, and reweights at the end. A few explicit lines (“listening is a muscle,” “caretakers of vanishing arts”) skate close to telling, but they are earned by scene pressure and object history. Subtext runs through gesture (the rosette offered like safe passage) and structural rests. The final silence and warm rosette crystallize a non‑moralized answer: fragile harmony is an enacted discipline.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The voice is lyrically controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature and steady first‑person distance. Diction and metaphor feel character‑bound (music pedagogy inflects syntax and image). Rhythm modulates cleanly from stillness to shared breath and back to silence without head‑hopping. No dialogue is needed; the narration’s cadence carries subtext.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished: metaphors are fresh and coherent (“silence landed like a bird that trusts an open palm”). Sentences work double duty—image and action—and momentum never stalls. Minor aphoristic moments are balanced by concrete beats and do not clog closure. No loops or scaffolding artifacts evident.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of choir pedagogy, a zither rosette heirloom, and the method of “subtracting noise” feels distinctive. Risks—lyric accumulative structure and object‑as‑compass—heighten meaning without obscuring clarity. The Rafi–Ola exchange via the rosette and the final communal passing are fresh, inevitable in hindsight. It stops short of radical invention but reads singular and memorable.</comment>
