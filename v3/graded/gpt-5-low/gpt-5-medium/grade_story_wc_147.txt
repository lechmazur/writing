<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and specific (save the sub by exploiting the temple’s acoustics) and the interiority is embodied and character‑particular. The contradictory impulse of panic vs. chosen stillness (“by overriding instinct”) recurs and meaningfully shapes tactics. Micro‑choices under pressure—unsnarling the line, where to place the transmitter, when to hold still—reveal values without speechifying. The endurance at the end reads as an earned stasis with cost (time/air risk accepted).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Hybrid with causal dominance: each move (“stop,” unsnarl, place transmitter, vial as coupler, exhale tones) tightens options and produces the answer signal. Orientation is crisp from the first two lines (who/where/why) and maintained. Closure lands on‑page with cost: the signal takes and an answer thrums, but depth and dwindling air remain, charging the return swim. The persistent constraints (line drag, acoustics, air) shape all tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The temple’s acoustics, the fissure, the line drag, and the corridor narrowing all constrain choices, not just decorate them. Sensory detail is vivid across senses (pressure, silt, hush, “fish avoid”) and stays goal‑filtered. The transmitter and vial function as micro‑settings that charge the ending image (“a small bell of collected silence”). World rules (sound travel, silt, current) remain consistent and actionable.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible early and escalates through concrete turns: corridor squeeze and silt panic, the unsnarling relief, the timed exhalation, then the surge that tests commitment. The choice to become still twice undercuts panic and forecloses flailing, a meaningful renunciation with cost. The “answer far above my head” is earned by prior steps, not luck. Time/air pressure and the drag line supply ongoing prices that alter tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from action: harnessing the ephemeral (scent, hush, prayer) to make rescue tangible; science and reverence in tension but ultimately in synthesis. The vial’s memory‑touch reframes rescue as coaxing meaning from what resists capture, culminating in “collected silence.” The ending offers a resonant answer without moralizing: survival depends on attention, stillness, and re‑tuning the world’s hush. Ambiguity lingers productively (sacred vs. acoustic, memory vs. signal).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric I‑voice with consistent focalization and pressure‑aware modulation. Diction and cadence fit the character’s practiced attention without becoming mannered under stress. Purposeful elision (mythic “temple,” “gathered hush”) is taught early and paid off in the tactic and closure. No head‑hopping or stance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High information density; images do multiple jobs (anemones as eyes that also mark age/quiet). Metaphor frequency is high but coherent to the sensory logic of depth and sound; momentum rarely stalls. Minimal redundancy; syntax varies to match breath and calm vs. panic. No notable artifacts or filter stacks that obscure cause/effect.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—distress tech, mythic acoustics, and a scent vial that “touches memories” as a signaling coupler—is fresh and non‑obvious. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight given the established hush/temple logic. The final reweighting (rescue coaxed from what refuses to be held) is both conceptually and emotionally novel. Risk‑taking in tone and premise heightens stakes without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
