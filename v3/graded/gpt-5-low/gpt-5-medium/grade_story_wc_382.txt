<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation is clean and specific (to learn the building’s language) and actions align, culminating in accepting the seal. Interiority is vivid and embodied through sensory attention to pipes, timber, and ritual. Internal conflict is subtle—curiosity vs. the ethics of “agreed upon lies”—but not deeply dramatized as struggle. The final renunciation/acceptance (take the seal; “do not be cruel with truth”) lands with a felt, if quiet, cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: the pattern of ritual, silence, and listening densifies until the rooftop cadence shift. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the world reweights when the building speaks and the narrator inherits duty. Orientation is clear early (stairwell, neighbor, teas) and the final act (pressing the seal) pays off prior rules. Cost is legible as responsibility and complicity in merciful fictions.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is richly particular (stairwell syntax, roof garden, coping stones) and filtered through the narrator’s ear for architecture. The antique seal functions as micro‑setting/tool that charges and constrains the closing act. The meteor shower is not postcard; it reframes the building’s “bones” and cues the listening threshold. World rules (buildings keep our lies) are learned in action without dumps.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes center on whether the narrator earns the building’s language and the ethic of its lies; pressure deepens via the forbidden question and the stamping act. The key tightening is the choice to interrogate and then to press the seal, accepting cost. Escalation is tonal and conceptual rather than adversarial, consistent with the chosen lens. The price is quiet but present: custody of truth and complicity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme coheres: shelter, “agreed upon lies,” and the ethics of mercy braided with architecture. Subtext is carried in ritual and silence (wax seal before difficulty; the corridor that never existed), avoiding sermonizing. The ending reweights everything—buildings as repositories of human weather—and offers a resonant answer: be precise, merciful, and responsible with truth. No platitudes; the insight is earned through particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The first‑person voice is distinctive, textured, and controlled, with a consistent perceptual signature (architecture as language). Dialogue is sparse, charged with subtext (“Only as much as the Latin in the cornice”). Psychic distance stays steady; lyric elision is taught and paid off. Rhythm modulates well at the rooftop turn without head‑hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is dense yet purposeful; metaphors track to an architectural/weather lexicon, avoiding muddle. Sentences do multiple jobs and propel; minimal scaffolding and virtually no loops. A few images verge on lush, but cadence control prevents purple drift and clarity holds at closure. Final image is crisp and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original fusion of architectural listening, ethical lies, and a “dead language tutor” feels inevitable by the end. The seal/ritual mechanism and the corridor deception are fresh and specific. Risk‑taking in a lyric, accumulative structure pays off with lucid closure. Emotional truth outpaces cleverness; the piece reads singular.</comment>
