<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s purpose and constraint (keeper of the covenant who wilts near lies) drive credible micro‑choices under pressure. The embodied cost—nausea, knees buckling—keeps her from reading as invincible. Internal contradiction exists (duty vs. physical revulsion), though it’s sketched more than deeply argued. The ending shows earned endurance rather than a neat epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: diagnosis → shadow contact → tether/vision → corrective light → restored song/light. Closure lands on the page with cost (she nearly collapses) and a decisive change (shadow shatters; box plays true; light returns). The single transition into the vision is motivated and contained. The drive lens reads Causal throughout and holds at the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The Resonance Chamber, clock tower, and tools are vivid and POV‑filtered (“every sound was amplified into meaning”). Objects function as micro‑setting that charge action (stone chip; shadow on mainspring). The environment frames her vocation and the final light image, though it rarely constrains tactics directly. Sensory specificity remains purposeful rather than touristic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear early: cleanse a dishonesty poisoning the song. Pressure tightens when the shadow touches her and the only viable tactic is the dangerous tether. The cost is legible (physical collapse risk; spiritual nausea) and resolved by agency rather than luck. While elegant rather than harrowing, the escalation is coherent and sufficient at this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Truth vs. falsehood is dramatized through actions (calibrating toward authenticity) rather than moralizing, with the final light image reweighting the premise. The vision’s consequence (erosion of honor) grounds the theme in a specific human failure. The piece leans luminous, sometimes tidy, but avoids sermonizing. The restored cadence delivers a resonant, non‑literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Consistent, lyric third‑person with a distinct lexicon (“tinkersong,” “covenant of rust”) that feels character‑true. Narrative certainty stays within Elara’s purview; the vision is diegetically justified. Rhythm tightens under stress without losing clarity. No head‑hopping or register slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sentences carry multiple jobs—world, action, and theme—without clutter. Occasional elevated phrasing skirts purple but remains controlled by voice and scene needs. No noticeable scaffold loops; momentum is clean through the tether and correction. The final line recycles and charges earlier diction effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis feels fresh: a mechanic‑mystic bound by a “covenant of rust,” a Resonance Chamber, and a philosopher’s chip used as ethical instrument. The tethering to a lie’s source is a distinctive turn that pays off. Emotional truth is modest but authentic, anchored in bodily cost. Risks in diction and metaphysics heighten coherence rather than feeling ornamental.</comment>
