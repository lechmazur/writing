<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation—“to salvage something pure”—is clear and consistent, and her cautious method (“weaves truth carefully”) governs her choices. Interiority is specific (cold, breath, tactile handling of the globe) and not generic. The main limitation is a lack of on‑page contradictory impulses under pressure; she never wavers in tactic or aim. The change at the end (relinquishing the charged object and the ghost’s presence) feels earned and paid for emotionally.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: shrine → dream survey → identification → object retrieval → truth revelation → crafted dream → release. Closure lands on the page with an RR/DC hybrid: candles flare/settle, warmth returns, the object goes inert, and the ghost releases—cost is the relinquishment of the connection and the charged window. Orientation is strong by ~120 words, and the lens stays causal through to the final image. The only slight softness is that the cost is largely emotional rather than a foreclosed external option.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The glacier shrine is vividly realized (borrowed light, living cold) and returns at closure with a charged environmental shift (candles flare, warmth arrives). The micro‑setting and the recurring object (snow globe) both charge the final image. Details are purposeful and filtered through Elara’s profession and temperament. Minor note: the setting’s physical constraints don’t force a tactical pivot, but they do meaningfully frame tone and outcome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—granting the ghost peace by completing a promise—is clear and escalates from identification to reframing his death to delivery. The tightening comes with the revelation that the anchor is love/promise, not shame, which reweights the goal and tactics. However, external resistance is low; the path from insight to resolution unfolds without a concrete obstacle testing commitment. The felt price sits in letting go and closing the window rather than in a contested action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Themes of intention vs. outcome and “borrowed vs. earned light” are woven through images (ice glow, starlight) and culminate in a reweighting: peace comes from delivering intent, not salvaging bodies. The snow globe’s reprised meaning elegantly embodies conceptual repricing. No overt moralizing; the final image invites reflection. Slight neatness keeps it just shy of profound ambiguity, but the resonance is strong.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third‑person close with consistent psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature (professional tactility and reverence). Patterned elision around the dream mechanics is taught and paid off. The lone spoken line in the dream lands as action, not exposition. Diction stays coherent without register slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sentences are concentrated, rhythmic, and carry multiple jobs (world, character, theme). Imagery is rich but not muddled; recurring metaphors (borrowed/earned light, window) cohere. A slight lushness edges toward purple in places but does not impede clarity or momentum. No evident loops, scaffold, or filter‑verb stacks dulling immediacy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis—wreck diver turned dream‑salvager in an ice shrine using strangers’ dreams to locate a stuck soul—is fresh and specific. The melted snow globe as a charged, reweighted object is memorable. Risks are aesthetic rather than structural, and they pay off. While the arc is gentle, the angle on ghost resolution feels distinctive.</comment>
