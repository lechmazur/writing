<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s motives are clear and coherent—she wants to reframe a civilization and prove empathy over conquest—and her micro-choices (covering mirrors, choosing to “listen,” composing a eulogy) reveal a credible evolution from fighter to mourner-scholar. Interiority is specific and embodied through tactile actions with the shard and the ritual. The internal contradiction (defunct revolutionary vs. poet-archaeologist) is present if a touch tidy by the end. The final stance feels earned, though the cost registers more as reframed identity than a concrete loss.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the storm’s approach, the mirror ritual, and the shard’s revelations intensify toward a conceptual repricing at the close. Orientation is clean from the opening, and the set-ups (mirror ritual, shard, dispute) all pay off. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she chooses a eulogy over combat, with the shard as proof. The cost is primarily conceptual/identity-based, not dramatic, which keeps it just below the top tier.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The Palace of Reflected Hours, visible time, and the mirror ritual are vivid and integrated into action; the environment shapes tactics (covering mirrors, working by shard-light) and charges the final reveal when the cloths come off. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful; the temporal storm affects behavior and mood. The recurring object-as-setting (mirrors/shard) grounds atmosphere and choice. Strong, distinctive worldbuilding without over-explaining.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake (reframing the civilization against Aris’s thesis) is clear and tightened by the storm’s peak and the shard’s interpretive turn. Escalation is a deepening of meaning rather than hard reversal, appropriate to the lens, culminating in her decision to present a eulogy rather than a counterattack. The price is internal (renunciation of a combative frame) and lands, though it’s relatively gentle. One solid tightening beat (storm peak → translation decision) carries the piece.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through ritual, object, and final choice: grief as moral reckoning, mirrors as refusal to indulge self-regard, and history rewritten by empathy. The final image reweights prior material without prescribing a moral, though some lines verge on explicit thesis (“a bearer of a kinder truth”). The shard’s lament reframes conquest with remorse in a way that lingers. Subtext is largely image-driven (cloths, shard-stars, reflection) rather than didactic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The voice is lyrically controlled and consistent with a poet-archaeologist perspective, with precise diction and clean focalization. Rhythm modulates well from ceremonial to charged as the storm peaks. No dialogue is needed; the inward texture sustains pressure without opacity. Occasional elevated abstractions fit the register and do not break plausibility.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lines carry atmosphere and action efficiently; imagery like the “auroral curtain” and “burnished sorrow” is strong and mostly unforced. Minor repetition of thematic terms skirts purple but does not blur sense or momentum. Sentences vary in rhythm, with few scaffolding phrases or loops. The final cadence lands with clarity and resonance.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Visible time, a baroque asteroid palace, and a mirror-covering ritual against temporal storms give the piece a fresh speculative texture. Recasting imperial legacy through a lament-bearing shard is a novel, humane inflection of the archaeology trope. The turn from argument to eulogy feels earned rather than gimmicky. It’s distinctive and confident without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
