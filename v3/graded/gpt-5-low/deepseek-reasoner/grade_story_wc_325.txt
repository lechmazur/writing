<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s claustrophobia and mission to honor the forgotten scientists are clearly embedded in action, and her micro‑choices (ignoring the hum, forcing herself down the ladder, trusting the insane protocol) feel motivated. Embodied stress is convincing under pressure, though “panic clawing at her throat” leans clichéd. The ending shows credible endurance and recommitment rather than a tidy epiphany. Limited contradiction beyond fear vs duty keeps it from the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Under a causal lens, each turn links because/therefore: infiltration → Codex activation → facility purpose reveal → tidal collapse → phase‑return. The Emergency Return Protocol is a convenient save but pre‑grounded by the array and the Codex’s calibrator role, preserving coherence. Closure lands with a decisive change (escape) and a modest conceptual cost (leaving the dead behind, new obligation). Orientation is clear from the opening; scope stays within one continuous window.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The abyssal environment is vivid and actively constrains choices (pressure, collapsed entry, narrow ladder, failing structure). The lab’s machinery and Codex are integrated into action, not mere scenery. The sea’s “crashing hush” and the bone‑like facility texture reinforce mood without stalling momentum. World rules (resonance array, pressurization) are consistent and learned through use.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stakes are survival vs fidelity to the mission; the meaningful tightening arrives with the tidal shift collapsing the way out. The protagonist’s agency drives the turn—choosing an experimental, identity‑risking extraction rather than a physical escape. The price is implicit but legible: accepting the unknown risks of phase transition and abandoning the site’s remains. Pressure remains coherent and escalates cleanly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>“Tracking invisible things” refracts thematically into remembering the unremembered; the Codex’s glow and the “crashing hush” of the deep become moral and acoustic motifs. The final image—surface air thin and sweet, Codex dormant—reweights the mission as beginning rather than end. No moralizing; resonance arises from particulars and choice. Slightly didactic console exposition keeps it from the very top.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The close third voice is controlled, with rhythmic modulation that tightens under stress and relaxes at the end. Diction is elevated but suits the character’s sensibility and the setting; no head‑hopping or stance drift. Exposition through the console reads within voice plausibility. No dialogue, but narrative cadence carries subtext and urgency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Clean, propulsive lines with sensory precision; sentences often do multiple jobs (world, pressure, interiority). A few familiar phrasings and mild info‑block about the array slightly slow the peak, but clarity holds. Figurative language is controlled and not overstacked in the climax. The final line lands with image rather than summary.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Abandoned deep‑sea lab tropes gain freshness through the acoustic/phase‑calibration Codex and the moral stance toward the forgotten. Turns feel earned and specific to this setup. Not radically new, but the synthesis of spelunking claustrophobia and quantum resonance extraction is distinctive. Risk‑taking is measured and coherent.</comment>
