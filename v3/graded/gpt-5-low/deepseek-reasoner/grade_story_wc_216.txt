<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—grasping the “texture of time” under a death sentence—is clear and consistently drives her choices (cataloging, coded sales). The interiority is specific (emerald silo, labored breathing) and avoids therapy‑speak. Internal tension (counting days vs. seeking continuity) is present but often summarized rather than dramatized in a pressured moment. The final renaming of her role feels earned, if a touch neat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: fragment → coded listings → contact → attic diaries → revaluation of the phantom year → identity shift. The closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing with a legible cost (mortality reframed; the “frantic counting” ceases). Orientation is strong from the outset; the hybrid lens holds without contradiction. A slightly expository reveal in the attic keeps it just shy of the very top.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The emerald silo, flood‑warped capsule, and attic trunk are vivid and purposeful; the space’s isolation constrains tactics (hence coded sales). Sensory detail feels curated through Elara’s priorities, lending atmosphere without bloat. Recurring objects (the fragment, the shelves) charge the final image. Strong integration with tone and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—meaning against erasure—tightens via the fragment discovery and the deliberate outreach method, culminating in the attic confrontation with the town’s cover‑up. The cost is felt through her physical limits and the relinquishment of “frantic counting.” Escalation is primarily deepening knowledge rather than sharp reversal, but it coheres and narrows options. Quiet, earned resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Time as material (texture, objects) and as civic fiction (phantom year) converge into a continuum/keeper lineage without didacticism. The urn fragment’s reweighting and the translator framing provide an implicit answer to mortality vs. memory. A few lines verge on tidy statement (“not as an artifact, but as a promise”), but the imagery largely carries the resonance. The aftereffect lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Controlled close third with a consistent, gently lyric register that fits Elara’s sensibility. Dialogue is minimal but functional and subtextual (“The date you wrote…”). Diction and rhythm modulate well around key beats (discovery, attic, return). No head‑hopping or stance leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is tight, image‑forward, and largely free of scaffold; sentences do double duty (setting and psychology intertwined). Figurative language is apt and not overstacked; no muddled metaphors. Minor neatness in the last paragraph edges toward abstraction but doesn’t dull the closure image. Rhythm supports momentum through the reveal.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—emerald silo, phantom year recalibration, coded garage‑sale breadcrumbs, and the keeper lineage—feels fresh and non‑obvious. The turns arise from prior particulars rather than gimmickry. The risk is quiet, concept‑led closure, which lands. Distinctive sensibility throughout.</comment>
