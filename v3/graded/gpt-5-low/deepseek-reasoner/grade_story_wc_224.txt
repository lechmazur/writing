<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation (to understand “the shape of home”) and her avoidance ritual create a credible, contradictory engine that tightens as the stone resists erasure. Concrete micro-choices—the descent, the impulsive touch of the feather, the second touch of the stone—reveal her hierarchy of values under pain. The final renunciation of her nightly substitution reads earned and costly. Minor abstraction in phrasing occasionally distances embodiment, but not at pivotal beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the sequence builds cleanly: nightly substitution → stone’s resistance → descent and research → feather-triggered eruption → reconfiguration and vow. Closure lands with conceptual repricing and an earned stance shift (“Tonight, she would not substitute her reality”). Cost is explicit (pain of remembering; relinquishing her coping ritual). The feather’s catalytic role is a small coincidence but seeded and paid off in-scene.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The mountain-bookstore is vivid and purposeful, its dust, vellum, and vaults filtering through Elara’s sensibility, and it charges the ending (“not her prison, but her garden”). Recurring objects (stone, feather) function as micro-settings/tools that shape action. While the environment rarely constrains access, it persistently supplies resources and frames the metaphorical turn. Sensory selection is disciplined and character-biased.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to endure the pain of true memory—tightens through the stone’s refusal to be edited and the eruptive decoding when touch meets texture. The turn forecloses a path (the nightly substitution) and opens a costlier one. Escalation is primarily internal but coherent and pressure-bearing for this length. A slight ease in the final acceptance keeps it shy of the highest band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Themes of preservation, home as act, and memory’s pain emerge through objects and choice, culminating in the sower image. Some lines state the thesis a touch overtly (“The shape of home was not a place, but an act”), softening subtext. Nonetheless, the final reweighting—hidden thunder as purpose—rings emotionally honest. Recurrences (stone, feather, thunder) meaningfully shift meaning at the end.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The voice is lyrically controlled and consistent with Elara’s perceptual signature (mercury-glass eyes, sensory language as knowledge). Psychic distance is steady; no head-hopping or unearned certainty. Diction modulates with pressure without register slips. No dialogue, but narrative rhythm carries momentum and tone.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Line-level craft is dense yet purposeful; images do double duty and avoid mixed metaphors. Repetition motifs (“hidden thunder,” “shape of home”) feel intentional rather than looped scaffolding. A few abstract assertions skirt telliness but don’t blunt the closure image. Syntax varies and supports the accumulative cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The fusion of a mountain-spanning bookstore, touch-based lost language, and feather-mediated memory feels fresh and organically motivated. The stone’s resistance to edits and the tactile-linguistic decoding produce a non-obvious turn. While the “lost archive/remembering” premise has precursors, its specific mechanics and final sower mapping distinguish it. Risk is controlled and coherent rather than gimmicky.</comment>
