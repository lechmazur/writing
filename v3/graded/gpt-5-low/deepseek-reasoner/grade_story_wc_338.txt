<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara’s drive—curiosity tempered by empathy—consistently motivates her tactics (the film study, the precise test of the stone) and culminates in a costly renunciation (not documenting the find). Interiority is specific and embodied (“heart hammered,” the tactile press). The competing impulses—scholarship versus protection—coexist in scene rather than alternating in summary. The final refusal reads earned by what we’ve seen of her values and method.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: patient investigation → flicker discovery → test → opening → choice to conceal. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise with an on‑page cost (foregoing documentation and resealing the chamber). Orientation is clean early (vault, henge, project), and set‑ups (tear on map; whisper legend; silent films) pay off directly. The price reshapes the premise: the map’s tear becomes purposeful absence, not lack.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The rain‑scoured vault and henge are not backdrop; they constrain access and physically enable the decisive act (recessing stone) and the resealing. Sensory texture is balanced (rain’s sigh, cold rock, damp earth) and filtered through a map framer’s eye. The environment charges the final image—the sealed pillar protecting a silence—and coheres with theme. World rules are consistent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>One dominant stake—uncover and decide how to treat the hidden space—tightens through the flicker discovery and the opening. The key reversal is internal: from pursuit of knowledge to protective secrecy, with a clear cost to her professional impulse. Pressure escalates credibly under the causal lens via her deliberate methods rather than external antagonists. The ending’s choice forecloses future options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme—silence as a living, protected archive—emerges from particulars (root‑woven walls humming with prayers) and is reweighted by her renunciation. The map’s tear is repurposed from ignorance to ethical shield, a resonant conceptual repricing. One explicit articulation risks telling, but the imagery and action carry the weight. The quiet final act invites reflection without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is steady, precise, and character‑specific, folding occupational perception into cadence. The lyric register modulates with pressure (from meticulous watching to the visceral press and hum) without drift. No head‑hopping or withheld knowledge tricks; elision serves tension. The voice sustains a controlled, reverent tone that suits the material.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sentences are clean, varied, and purposeful; images do more than one job (rain as atmosphere and thematic sigh). Minimal scaffold and no notable loops; figurative language remains coherent and grounded. Slight explanatory lines appear but do not stall momentum. The final image is crisp and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis—portolan restoration, silent‑film parallax, and a root‑grown chapel humming with absorbed prayers—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The investigative method is inventive rather than contrived and drives the turn. The thematic reframing of erasure as protection avoids cliché. Risk‑taking is controlled and coherent.</comment>
