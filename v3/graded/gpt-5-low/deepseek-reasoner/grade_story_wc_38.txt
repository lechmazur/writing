<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s motives and methods are concrete and embodied—she deciphers by feeling the scientist’s grief and translating it into movement. The internal tension between taking the die (power/burden) and liberating knowledge is present if slightly under-argued. Her micro‑choices (not touching the terminal, pressing wall points in rhythm, finally taking the die) align with her lyrical, empathic competence. Emotion appears through body and environment rather than labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Clear causal chain: journal decryption → choreographic solution → mechanism yields → character test → burdened choice → vault opens with structural cost. Closure lands with cost as the lab begins to flood and she escapes with the reweighted die. A small wobble remains around the “power vs liberate” dichotomy resolved by “taking the burden,” but the sequence holds. The lens reads Causal with a clean on‑page DC.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The sunken lab and abyssal pressure aren’t just backdrop; they constrain tactics and charge the final image (equalizing hiss, seams bursting, ascent). Object‑as‑setting (the die’s cage, brass mechanism) is integrated into action. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through her practiced focus. World rules remain consistent and legible.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake is established early (liberate knowledge without sealing the vault) and tightens through the character test. The decisive act (taking the die) triggers a visible, escalating price (compromised integrity, rising water) that forces immediate adaptation (sprint/escape). Agency drives each turn; pressure coheres to the end. The moral calculus is present without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Themes of vulnerability-as-strength, burdened stewardship, and translating grief into knowledge accrue through particulars (dance as algorithm, reweighted die). The final image re-prices the “hangman’s” object into a key, carrying conceptual and emotional charge. One slightly on-the-nose sentence (“greatest strength of all”) trims subtlety. Overall resonance is strong and earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A controlled close third with lyrical texture; diction and rhythm match Elara’s perceptual bias. Voice remains steady under pressure, modulating cleanly into the action beat without head‑hopping or register slips. Patterned lyricism (dance/code metaphors) is taught early and kept legible. No artificial exposition intrudes.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentences carry multiple jobs and maintain forward motion; imagery is layered but not overgrown. Minimal scaffold or loops; choreography remains clear in the high‑pressure beat. A few elevated phrases flirt with purple, but cadence control keeps clarity intact. The opening and closing lines land as images rather than explanations.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: a codebreaker who solves through dance, a ritualized die as ethical mechanism, and abyssal pressure as both literal and thematic constraint. Turns feel earned by setup rather than gimmick. The moral test’s twist (taking the die as burden) is intriguing, even if slightly under‑argued. The piece risks lyric method in a puzzle scene and makes it work.</comment>
