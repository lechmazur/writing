<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Aris’s motive (sterilize loss via data) is clear and contradicted by her embodied tenderness (righting the stool, peeling the wing), yielding an earned internal shift. The scientist lens colors perception without flattening feeling. The final renunciation—accepting drama as part of the point—reads motivated and costs her a protective strategy. No safety‑hedging; the grief is lived through action and image.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each observed detail tightens toward a Conceptual Repricing at the end. Orientation is crisp in the opening and the single‑scene design is coherent. Closure lands in the final image (dust on fingertip; “participant”), with the cost of relinquishing her numbing framework. The flood functions as catalyst not resolution, fitting the mode.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The storm‑damaged greenhouse and flood silt are sensuously rendered and integral to discovery. Environment actively charges the final image (butterfly dust patterns only exist because of this specific space and damage). Professional bias shapes noticing (cosmologist’s pattern‑seeking). Vivid without excess, balanced across tactile, visual, and acoustic detail.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to process loss—tightens through the discovery of the dust patterns and the wing’s residue. The key turn is her revaluation of “decay” into creation and accepting involvement, foreclosing her initial coping tactic. Pressure is quiet but coherent for the lens, with a visible internal price. Slight softness in external stakes keeps it just below the very top band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme (gradual change, creation within decay, science meeting humility) arises from particulars and culminates in a resonant final image. A few lines verge on thesis (“The drama… was the point”), slightly over‑articulating what the images already carry. Still, the counterweight between sterile preprocessing and embodied attention yields durable aftereffect. Subtext hums in the wing dust and flood‑made lacework.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third‑person closely tracks a scientist’s sensibility without losing warmth. Diction and syntax modulate well from observation to hush at closure. No head‑hopping or stance drift; inference reads as inference. Minor elevated phrasing stays plausible for this POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Clean, image‑rich sentences with varied rhythm and strong verbs; information density is high. A few abstract restatements and conceptual sentences could be tightened, but they don’t stall momentum. Figurative choices cohere (dust as canvas/artist) without mixed metaphors. The final line lands cleanly without purple overreach.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—neutron star researcher gleaning post‑flood butterfly dust patterns as a physics of grief—is fresh and specific. Turns feel earned by character logic and place rather than cleverness for its own sake. The piece risks a high‑lyric register and largely justifies it through coherent vision. Memorable object‑world and thematic integration lift it above template grief pieces.</comment>
