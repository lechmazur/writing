<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Leo’s fear-versus-pull micro‑choice to take the bead reads motivated and specific, and Elara’s “lovingly venomous” guidance gives their dynamic texture. Interiority is concise but concrete (the chill, the bead’s weight, the hum in his bones). Contradictory impulses are present but lightly sketched, with minimal degradation under stress. The closing acceptance feels earned, with the visible cost of losing Elara’s presence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal drive is clean: Elara appears → offers bead → Leo touches → awakening → Elara dissolves. Orientation is established early (greenhouse/orchard, Leo, ghost), and the closure lands on the page with palpable cost. The single-scene structure tightens at the pattern break (“She did not fade”). Minor convenience in the bead’s late arrival is mitigated by prior seeding through her task and debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The greenhouse/orchard is vividly rendered (crystalline equations, black snow) and charges the final image as the leaves take on permanent radiance. The environment is not merely decorative; it defines the stakes (healing the fields) and inflects choice. The bead functions as a micro‑setting/object that anchors the climax. Texture and tone remain coherent across sensory details.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (repay the debt/awaken the orchard) is legible early and tightens when Elara breaks her cameo pattern. Leo’s agency in accepting the bead triggers the irreversible cost of Elara’s dissolution. Pressure escalates once, appropriately scaled for the length. The price—solitude in exchange for renewal—is clear in the closing hum and light.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Themes of love-as-debt, stewardship, and renewal emerge organically from the orchard’s rules and the final repricing of “greenhouse as crucible.” The last image reweights prior motifs without sermonizing; a slight explicitness (“not just a garden; it was a crucible”) brushes close to telling but remains earned. Subtext in “mournful elation” complicates victory. Resonance lingers in the cost/peace trade.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>A stable close third with lyrical control suits the gothic-alchemical register; no head-hopping or stance slippage. Diction is elevated but cohesive and character-consistent for a fable‑tinged mode. Rhythm modulates well at the climax (“She did not fade,” “a sound like a sigh of release”). Absence of dialogue is a feature, not a gap.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Imagery is lush yet mostly precise; lines carry multiple jobs (world‑rule, mood, action). Minor purple tendencies don’t blur sense, and repetition is minimal. Momentum holds as sentences shorten at pressure points. No notable scaffold or filter-verb stacks; the final image lands cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The orchard of crystalline equations and the bead-triggered “resonant awakenings” synthesize ghost‑bride tropes into a fresh, specific conceit. The pattern break of cameos → presence → dissolution feels inevitable in hindsight. Emotional truth (love repaid as opportunity, not reunion) elevates beyond surface novelty. Risks in tone and imagery pay off without obscuring clarity.</comment>
