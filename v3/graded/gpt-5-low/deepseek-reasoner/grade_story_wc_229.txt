<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s motive is crystalline and enacted through concrete micro-choices: cleaning the lens, clutching the cork, choosing to beckon rather than shout. Embodied perception (scent, thin air, fatigue) grounds her inner life without therapy-speak. Internal contradiction is mild—she’s steady in her belief—so complexity skews more to poise than friction. The offstage head keeper provides pressure and contrast but doesn’t force a relational choice on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: scent → beckon → cork falls → lens stutters → cobalt beam → trawler’s turn. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing of the lighthouse’s purpose, with the small, felt cost of the lost talisman and a heart-stopping stutter in the light. Hybrid lens reads coherent to the end, with no orientation debt. The cost is modest but present and tied to the decisive beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The Fresnel lens, rotating mechanism, and cobalt tower are tactile, lived-in, and the environment directly affects outcome (the cork striking the mechanism; the dawn breeze carrying scent). Sensory spread is excellent, with the nocturnal garden scent reweighting space and action. The setting charges the final image of a cobalt beam purifying intent. Strong integration without postcard excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove whispers out-reach shouts—tightens when the mechanism halts and then transforms, testing Elara’s ethos under risk. The decisive action (beckoning) creates the complication (dropped cork) that yields the new state. External and internal stakes marry in the trawler’s turn, though the price paid is gentle. Tension is steady rather than knife-edged, but it rises appropriately for the length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The whisper/shout dialectic is dramatized rather than preached, culminating in a cobalt “welcome” that reframes lighthouse function. Recurring motifs (scent, lens, cobalt) accrue subtext around intent, care, and guidance. The ending’s quiet assurance invites reflection without a moral. A few explicit belief statements lightly telegraph theme but don’t undercut resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person close is consistent, lyrical, and precise; a brief, clean POV shift to the trawler is sectionally legible and serves closure. Diction and cadence fit Elara’s sensibility and the piece’s lyric register. No head-hopping or register drift; rhythm modulates with pressure. The line “screaming tenderness” is risked and earned by context.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sentences carry layered work—image, action, and theme—with good propulsion and varied rhythm. Figurative language is vivid and mostly disciplined; a few intensifiers (“so full of fierce, quiet need”) flirt with purple but remain clear. No scaffolding loops or template cadences slow momentum. Final images are sharp and uncluttered.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A lighthouse broadcasting intent—manifested as cobalt light that clarifies mist—is a fresh synthesis of tool, setting, and theme. The cork-triggered stutter is a concrete, idiosyncratic turn, not a generic epiphany. Risks in diction and concept pay off without confusion. Familiar lighthouse tropes are transformed by the purity-of-intent premise and scent-guided poetics.</comment>
