<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Leo’s resilient positivity and duty-driven competence are clear and consistent, and his actions (radio call, steering to coordinates, placing/turning the hourglass) align with those traits. Interiority is present but light; we don’t feel much contradictory impulse or genuine doubt under pressure. The “instinctual” understanding skirts convenience and softens struggle. The closing repricing of his role as “keeper of the timeline” lands, but the felt cost is modest.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: anomalies → radio palimpsest → coordinate pattern → grotto → hourglass turn → re-synchronization. Orientation is crisp early (ferry deckhand, commute, fog), and the single POV holds through two shards with one transition. Closure is on-page and legible (Decisive Change with a conceptual repricing), though the cost is conceptual rather than visceral. A hair more resistance or risk during the grotto sequence would deepen the payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Specific, lived details (steel deck, salty spray, unnatural fog) evolve into the spectral grotto that materially constrains choice via the pedestal-hourglass mechanism. The radio and hourglass function as micro-setting tools that guide tactics. World rules are learned in action (sideways clocks, lateral sand) without expository bloat. The environment charges the final image of the stabilized ferry and the paperweight hourglass.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reconciling timelines—tightens coherently from thinning passengers to a shipless void to the grotto decision. The decisive turn (“Turn it”) is protagonist-driven, but the path is relatively low-friction and risk-light. There’s little visible price or foreclosed option beyond the abstract burden of understanding. Tension is steady rather than intensifying toward a sharp cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Themes of transience vs. continuity and labor as guardianship emerge organically through ferry ritual and the hourglass. The final repricing—he didn’t fix time, he synchronized it—resonates but edges into told moral. Subtext glints in the “permanent transient” frame and the paperweight’s quiet demotion. A touch less explicit statement would heighten the afterimage.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt, with controlled lyricism and clean mechanics; the radio’s heteroglossia is handled clearly. Diction suits the character and setting, avoiding register drift. The brief dialogue (“Turn it.” “Thanks, Leo.”) lands with subtextual charge without overexplaining. Rhythm varies appropriately through pressure and release.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and economical, with purposeful imagery (“sand flowing sideways,” “projections on water”) and minimal redundancy. A few familiar phrasings (“unnatural fog,” “weave the frayed threads”) soften edge but don’t stall momentum. Syntax and paragraphing carry propulsion cleanly to the closure beat. No notable artifacts or loops impair clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The ferry-deckhand lens on a time-fracture, the radio palimpsest, and the sideways sand are distinctive and coherent. The grotto-hourglass device nods to genre tradition yet feels freshly grounded by occupational detail. Emotional risk is gentler than the conceptual risk, limiting shock of new. Still, the synthesis reads intentional and earned.</comment>
