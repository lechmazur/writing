<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is specific and embodied, with a clear through‑line from ghostwriter detachment to risking exposure. The nest discovery convincingly catalyzes her shift. Internal conflict (keeper of secrets vs. desire to connect) is present, though friction could tighten under pressure. The final renunciation of anonymity reads earned, if a touch tidy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the beats cohere: rain → nest with her words → decision → installation → communal reveal. Closure arrives as a resonant reconfiguration when she reframes her role publicly, with a conceptual cost (relinquishing ghosthood). The thrush’s use of her draft is a neat coincidence but doesn’t break causality. The on‑page cost is more implied than felt, keeping this just shy of elite.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The lotus temple, lily pond, and post‑rain atmosphere are vivid and purposeful, culminating in the candlelit projection on stone and water. Setting functions as more than backdrop: the temple’s surface and pond reflection literally carry the text, charging the final image. Sensory selection stays character‑filtered and consistent. Small economy of detail avoids tourist listing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes center on whether she remains a hidden conduit or risks public connection; escalation is chiefly textural, culminating in the live unveiling. Pressure is coherent but gentle; there’s no counterforce beyond her own hesitation. The decisive act (lighting the installation) lands but feels low‑risk on the page. A beat of resistance—ethical risk, social pushback—would sharpen cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme (secrets transformed into shared light) is organically tied to events and recurring images (nest, thread, projection). The final tableau reweights “keeper of secrets” into communal witness. Occasional explicit statements (“no longer a ghostwriter, but an architect of connection”) edge toward didactic, slightly blunting subtext. Still, the lantern image meaningfully lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The lyric third‑person close maintains a consistent perceptual signature—sensory‑rich, metaphor‑attuned, profession‑colored. Rhythm modulates well from quiet observation to ceremonial climax. No head‑hopping or stance slips; elision is clean. Slight fondness for coined abstractions (“prismatic quiet”) is voice‑coherent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is polished with strong image economy; several lines do double duty for scene and theme. Minor purple glints and repeated formulations (“prismatic quiet,” “thread”) flirt with redundancy but rarely stall momentum. Syntax varies and carries momentum into the closing image. No clarity or grammar issues.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforming ghostwriting into a public lantern of anonymized love is a fresh, memorable synthesis. The thrush‑nest conduit and candle projection feel inventive and inevitable in hindsight. A few familiar metaphors surface, but the core move is distinctive. Risk‑taking is quiet yet confident, landing without obscuring clarity.</comment>
