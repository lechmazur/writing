<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is clear, consistent, and escalates under pressure—from patient listening to broadcasting to the renunciatory tactic of fracturing the message. Interiority is specific (sanctuary/prison, chalking the walls), with a credible push-pull between despair and whimsical hope. The final choice costs her authorship and control, reading as an earned renunciation. Minor limitation: internal contradiction could be dramatized even more directly at the peak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: listening → assembling teachings → broadcasting → antagonistic jamming → strategic pivot to dispersion. Closure lands as a Decisive Change with visible conceptual cost (she relinquishes clarity and centrality) and fits a Causal lens. Orientation is early and firm; scope discipline holds. Slight summary spans (her long scribing period) are efficient and don’t blur the closing cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stormlit observatory and the cobalt portico are vivid, filtered through Elara’s priorities and repeatedly reweighted (barrier → lens). The environment plausibly conditions tactics (radio reliance, isolation, storm windows) and charges the final image. Textures across weather, light, and ruin are purposeful rather than touristic. Not quite environment-as-constraint at the choice beat, but near.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving the integrity of the message—tightens sharply when the Unified Dawn jams her signal. The escalation is coherent and forces a trade-off: she rejects power-for-power tactics, paying the price of dispersion and ambiguity. Internal/external conflicts mesh at the turn. The cost is felt rather than merely stated.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The piece embodies its theme—plurality versus enforced unity—through concrete action (splitting the broadcast) and recurring images (portico as lens). The ending offers a resonant answer without moralizing: listeners now receive “a hundred questions.” A few explicit philosophical lines flirt with didacticism, but they are dramatized through Elara’s scribing and the faction’s distortion. The final repricing of “message” as puzzle lands.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lyric yet controlled voice with a distinct perceptual signature (“sapphire shards,” “secret passed on the wind”). POV remains stable; quoted broadcasts function as pressure rather than exposition. Rhythm modulates with tension; diction feels consistent with Elara’s sensibility. No head‑hopping or unearned omniscience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sentences carry high information density with minimal scaffolding; metaphors are coherent and in-scene. A touch of elevated diction is voice-justified and doesn’t blur beats; no paraphrase loops or template cadence. The final image is crisp and not over-explained. Minor risk of purple at times, but momentum and clarity hold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis—fracturing a prophet’s message to preserve multiplicity in a storm-top observatory—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The pivot from broadcast power to distributed whispers is a non‑obvious, character-driven solution. Recurring objects/images are transformed rather than tokenized. Bold without obscuring clarity.</comment>
