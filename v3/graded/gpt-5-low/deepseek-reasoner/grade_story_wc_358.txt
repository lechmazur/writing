<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elias’s motive and professional mindset are clear and embodied through his tools and habits, yielding credible, goal-driven choices. The interiority is specific (“woolen quiet,” teeth ache) and filtered through his investigator’s bias. However, there’s little contradictory impulse or visible emotional cost; he executes with near-frictionless competence. The patch tugs at him, but the tension remains intellectual more than conflicted.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Orientation, drive lens (Causal), and a clean because/therefore chain are strong: survey → wind map → inference → epicenter → power disconnect. Closure lands on-page as a Decisive Change when he rips the coupling and the hum ceases. The cost is modestly felt (physiological pressure, risk), but the narrowing of options is legible and earned. No stray setups or plot patches undermine causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The shipping-container labyrinth and infrasound ecology are vividly rendered and integral, shaping both navigation and the weaponization of sound. Tools (anemometer, tablet) and micro-currents operate as micro-setting that constrains choice and guides action. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered by expertise, with atmospheric tone aligned to threat. World rules stay consistent and applied through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>One dominant stake (stop the town’s catatonia) escalates through data accumulation to a focused approach and decisive act. The tightening is coherent under the Causal lens, with the wind-map revelation narrowing options to a single high-pressure locus. The price reads mostly as situational hazard rather than a tough trade-off, so pressure feels slightly safe. Still, agency—especially the final physical intervention—drives the resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Themes of unintended consequences, systems amplifying error, and foresight’s burden emerge from particulars (containers as amplifier, the patch as bitter emblem). The “accident not weapon” realization reweights the premise without sermonizing, and the final “natural quiet” resonates. Subtext is present but remains more conceptual than deeply emotional. The resonance lingers, though not profoundly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and plausibly expert; diction and imagery create a distinct perceptual signature (“hazy precision”). Explanatory moments arise as inference, not omniscience. The voice tightens under pressure without losing clarity. No dialogue is needed; narrative stance remains consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is controlled, image-rich, and momentum-forward; sentences carry multiple jobs with minimal scaffolding. Figurative density flirts with lushness (“chaotic symphony,” “woolen quiet”) but stays coherent and purposeful. No paraphrase loops or cadence templates dull the beat. The final line is clean and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The infrasound-in-a-container-maze premise and the wind-mapping method feel fresh and well-integrated. The aircraft-engine twist reframes threat plausibly without contrivance. Emotional risk remains limited, keeping ingenuity more conceptual than visceral. Still, the synthesis reads specific and memorable.</comment>
