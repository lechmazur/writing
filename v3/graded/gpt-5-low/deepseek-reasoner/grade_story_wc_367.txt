<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Silas’s interior is vivid and specific—the “shadowed elation,” dread at the involuntary laugh, and craft habits ground him under pressure. His contradictory impulses (to guide with light vs. recognizing salvation through shadow) act simultaneously in the storm. The final acceptance of a new role reads earned by on-page events. Cost is present but subtle, centered on relinquishing certainty in the old method.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal drive holds: storm → ship veers despite beam → involuntary laugh → helmsman’s counterintuitive turn → safe shadow channel → Silas’s role reprice. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing with on-page evidence (glass wick glowing; “required not just light, but the wisdom of shadow”). Orientation is clean and timely. The cost is conceptual rather than visceral but legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The lighthouse, reef, lens, and storm are sensorially integrated and actively constrain choices (the ship must either follow the beam or risk the shadow). The environment directly shapes the turn—the hidden channel exists only within the light’s shadow. Object micro-setting (glass wick) charges the final image. Weather pressure evolves causally and is tactically relevant.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes are clear (a galleon’s survival) with escalation from routine to crisis when the ship ignores the beam. The tightening beat is Silas’s loss of conventional tactic and the compulsion to laugh, forcing a nontraditional solution. Resolution is earned via the helmsman’s risky steer into darkness reweighted by Silas’s laugh. The price is more thematic than material, slightly softening impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Light versus shadow and guidance through paradox accrue naturally and culminate in a resonant final image. The laugh as compass recontextualizes warning/aid binaries. A small deduction for explicit thematic articulation (“required not just light, but the wisdom of shadow”), which edges toward stating the thesis. Nevertheless, the imagery does most of the heavy lifting.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person with controlled distance suits the mythic tone and storm tempo. Brief mid-piece POV shift to the helmsman is clear and purposeful but slightly breaks single-POV purity. Diction remains coherent to the piece’s elevated register. Rhythm modulates with pressure, keeping clarity under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is polished and propulsive with strong sensory economy; images like “waves like black mountains” and the “glass palace” are effective. Occasional purple lean and direct statements at the end slightly flatten subtlety, but momentum never stalls. No notable loops or scaffold. Syntax and cadence are varied and purposeful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—prophetic laughter as navigational instrument, salvation in the light’s shadow, and a glass wick omen—feels fresh and cohesive. The turn toward darkness as safe water is earned and surprising without gimmickry. Risks in tone and conceit heighten meaning while staying clear. Only minor familiarity in lighthouse-myth trappings prevents a higher score.</comment>
