<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lyra’s goal is clear and embodied—rekindling the realm—expressed through concrete micro‑choices (climbing, harvesting light, weaving, then singing). Interiority is textured (borrowed memories, ache), but internal contradiction is light; she rarely wavers or pays a personal price besides exertion. Competence reads high, struggle low, so change feels more attainment than sacrifice. The earned stasis (ongoing tending) lands but doesn’t expose a deeper flaw or conflict on her side.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the ritual accrues from vision capture → weaving → song → communal echo, culminating in a charged poise (saved for now). Orientation is immediate (keeper in greenhouse night) and the closure cost is explicit: constant tending and daily singing. Causality within the lyric mode is clean; no teleporting beats. The single tightening is credible and sufficient at this length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The greenhouse and its memory‑trees, wrought‑iron vines, and mica window are vivid and purposeful; the environment dictates tactics (she must climb and extract dawn from stone). Sensory detail is specific and biased to Lyra’s vocation (ozone, nostalgia, threads of light). The setting charges the final image (a self‑made day in an endless night). World rules are consistent and learned by doing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rekindling light) is clear, and pressure tightens via the ritual’s phases, culminating in community uptake. However, opposition remains abstract—no counterforce or credible risk of failure on the page—so escalation skews gentle rather than testing. The “price” is future labor rather than a present trade‑off. Still, the cadence shift from silence to chorus satisfies the lens’s demand for a decisive intensification.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Memory becoming light and song as social fabric cohere without moralizing; “The song was the thread, and they were the fabric” resonates and reweights earlier images. The ending offers earned stasis with conceptual cost (daily tending) that complicates hope. Subtext (isolation versus communal remembrance) is carried in action, not thesis. A hair of neatness—universal harmonizing—keeps it just shy of exceptional.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third‑person with a consistent perceptual signature (embodied noticing of threads, scents, textures). Rhythm modulates well from hush to rising song. No head‑hopping or stance drift; elisions feel purposeful. Slight risk of elevated diction stacking in places, but clarity holds.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong images and verbs (“plucked threads of light,” “wove dawns”) deliver high information density; sentences vary and propel. Some metaphor recurrence skirts purple (light/threads/tapestry reiterated), but coherence is maintained and loops are minimal. No mechanical errors or muddled vehicles. The final paragraph lands cleanly without scaffolding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The alchemical orchard of memory‑fruit and woven dawns feels fresh; the mica‑sourced sunrise and communal song as infrastructure elevate the premise. The closure image (self‑made day perforating night with ongoing cost) is distinctive and earned. Risk‑taking is lyrical rather than structural, but the synthesis reads singular rather than templated.</comment>
