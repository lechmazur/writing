<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s motive is concrete and consistent—rescue and reveal rather than destroy—and her internal contradiction (urge to burn vs. new promise of connection) peaks credibly at the final tapestry. Interiority is specific (tools, soot, chemical control) rather than label-speak. Her micro-choices (surgical fire, prying the slab, embedding coordinates) reveal values under pressure. Slight glossing of immediate risk keeps the struggle a touch idealized rather than fully embodied.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: break-in → surgical fire → archive discovery → public tapestry with coordinates → decision to leave it. Closure lands as an earned renunciation with cost: she risks exposure and relinquishes sole guardianship. The drive lens reads Hybrid (causal spine with accumulative lyric charge) and holds to the end. A minor plausibility stretch (precise fire revealing a century-hidden slab) doesn’t fracture the logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Settings are tactile and purposeful—the linoleum annex over a sealed chamber, the cool, dusty archive, the university wall at dawn—each shifts stakes and tactics. The environment shapes action (chemical fire to excavate downward; the wall as public megaphone). Sensory economy stays POV-driven without postcard listing. Not quite 9+ only because environmental constraint is deft but not deeply oppositional.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes are primarily ethical and reputational, cohering around secrecy vs. public gift; tension tightens at the moment she chooses not to burn the final tapestry. Escalation is a single, meaningful deepening rather than multiple turns. Cost is legible but danger remains mostly atmospheric, not actively pressing back. The absence of a live antagonist or immediate consequence keeps the pressure strong but not searing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Themes of ownership vs. commons and art as counter-history emerge organically from action and image, culminating in the charged public tapestry. The “vandalized self-portrait” reframes her arc without moralizing, and the final child’s recognition reweights the premise. No didactic summary undercuts the resonance. The complexity remains humane and specific.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The close third voice has a distinct texture—measured, precise, and sensorial—with controlled lyricism that matches Elara’s mind. POV confidence stays consistent; no head-hopping or over-explaining. Rhythm modulates effectively at the end into charged poise. Minor flourish repetition (“volcanic” images) skates near excess but remains voice-motivated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Line-level craft is tight, with high information density and purposeful figurative choices. A few repeated lava/volcano metaphors and occasional elevated diction flirt with purple but don’t blur sense or pacing. Syntax varies; transitions propel rather than stall. The final image is crisp and unencumbered by scaffolding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The premise—an arsonist librarian using surgical fires to exhume an archive and then disseminating it via clandestine tapestries—is striking and coherently realized. The Kythians’ woven historiography and the coordinates-as-border design feel fresh and inevitable in hindsight. It takes a bold stance on knowledge economies without preachiness. Small plausibility elisions keep it shy of the very top.</comment>
