<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias’s motive (seed‑sowing as penance/hope) is clear and credibly complicated by the fledgling’s emergency, forcing a values trade‑off. Interiority is specific (dead languages, bird calls) and embodied through tactile choices (water in hat, sacrificing grubs and seeds). The renunciation/repricing—broadening his mission from soil to creatures—feels earned. Slight tidiness in the final calm may shave some ambiguity of cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ritual → interruption by the bird → reconfigured ritual with a visible price → charged final image. Orientation is crisp; causality is clean (bird forces a pivot, tactics change, seeds are spent). Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with cost on the page (spent seeds, altered vow), crystallized by the first shoots. The convenience of immediate sprouting edges toward fable but supports the chosen lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and functional: the jetty’s cracks and rock cleft directly enable tactics and the pact. Atmosphere (“corpse‑gray sea,” metallic air, bleached coral) is filtered through Elias’s purpose and constrains where life can take hold. The environment charges the final image (narrow jetty holding vastness; first shoots at the sentinel bird). Detail remains selective and purposeful without static cataloguing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (renewal vs. desolation) is signaled early and tightens when the starving bird forces a trade‑off. The decisive adaptation—sacrificing precious pods and changing the method to include creatures—narrows options with a real cost. Tension is quiet but coherent under the accumulative lens. Escalation is single‑turn and effective for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Themes of memory, repair, and interspecies concord emerge from concrete acts rather than statements. The “dead languages” reframed by a “living call” offers a resonant non‑literal answer at the end. Recurring objects (pods, jetty) reweight meaning without moralizing. Ambiguity remains humane—renewal is possible, not guaranteed.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third‑person with a distinct perceptual bias (languages, birds, soil) stays consistent. Rhythm modulates to pressure without head‑hopping or register drift. Purposeful diction choices feel organic to Elias’s worldview. No dialogue is needed; the voice carries subtext.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lines are polished, varied, and work double duty for image and action; momentum is steady with minimal scaffold. Figurative language is dense but coherent and scene‑specific, avoiding mixed metaphors. Props and moves are clear; no looped phrasing or template cadence. A hair from purple in places, but control holds, including at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—coachman of “dead languages,” reef‑death aftermath, bird‑mediated pact, garden as battlefield reclamation—reads fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The “submerged concord” built rather than found is a non‑obvious, deftly realized angle. Risk lies in the fable‑lyric register, and it pays off without obscuring clarity. Specificity of tools/acts lifts the conceit beyond ornament.</comment>
