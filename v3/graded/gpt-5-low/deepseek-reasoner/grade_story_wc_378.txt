<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Caretaker-7’s motives are clear and escalate plausibly: preserve the dome → survive → sacrifice the garden by weaponizing fear. The internal contradiction (nostalgia/static vs. ruthless clarity) is dramatized in the vault and in the compression beat, not just stated. Micro-choices—entering the avoided vault, opening the box, choosing to condense fear—reveal hierarchy of values with visible cost. The closing stance shift from caretaker to pilot feels earned by prior pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under a causal lens, each turn links cleanly: stabilizers fail → dome will collapse → needs Primary Ignition Key in the vault → must process the box of fears to gain clarity and power → executes controlled burn → escapes. Closure is decisive and on-page with cost: the dome and roses are sacrificed, role renounced, fears integrated at a price. Orientation is early and stable; the single POV and two-shard flow (dome → vault/action → cockpit) remain coherent. The final image (cool, empty box; course set to new north) locks a before/after with felt loss.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The glass dome, twin suns, metallic-sweet roses, and magnetic realignment are specific and integrated into action. Environment constrains tactics (geo-stabilizers fail; storms breach; controlled burn path) and charges the ending (roses scatter as cost image). Details are POV-filtered through an android’s lexicon without tourist cataloging. Minor reach for broader world physics is plausible at this length.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around one stake—survival through escape—and tightens via the need to access and use the fear-box to power the burn. The mid-beat deepening (realizing the static is the childhood-fear box) narrows options and forces a trade: self-immolation of the dome for one launch. The cost is explicit and reverberates into the final stance. Escalation is protagonist-driven at every turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme crystallizes through action: containing chaos as survival, integrating fear into fuel, and identity as a cultivated garden. Recurring objects (roses, the box) shift meaning from ornament/care to cost/engine and then to tempered wholeness. The “own garden” line risks neatness but lands as image earned by sacrifice and integration rather than moral. Ambiguity remains in the visible cracks and remembered roses.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The voice is unified, restrained-lyric through an android’s precise sensorium; diction balances technical with evocative without head-hopping. Rhythm tightens under pressure and relaxes in the cockpit denouement. No artificial withholding; elision serves cadence, not confusion. A couple familiar similes (“cracked like an egg”) modestly blunt edge but don’t disrupt the signature.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line-level craft is lean and propulsive, with images doing multiple jobs (box as fossilized heart → star/engine). Figurative density rises at peak but remains coherent to the premise; no scaffold loops or paraphrase redundancies. Syntax varies and carries momentum through turns. A few conventional phrases are the only minor drag.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The fusion of emotional integration with a literal controlled burn and a memory-box-turned-ignition is an original synthesis. Familiar SF elements (dome, storms) are reweighted via the “contain chaos by miniaturizing fear” tactic that feels specific and inextricable. The final repricing (android as its own garden) is surprising yet inevitable. Risks in metaphor-mechanics pay off without obscuring clarity.</comment>
