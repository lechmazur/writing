<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lyra’s motive—to reclaim meaning after exposure—is clear, embodied, and consistently drives her quiet actions (tending, inviting, proffering). Her guarded generosity toward Leo reveals contradiction (self‑protective yet offering contact) without therapy‑speak. The relationship dynamic is delicately staged through the offering and his phone put‑away choice. The change—solitary refuge to shared, risky co‑creation—reads earned with a felt cost of renewed exposure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural, with closure as a charged poise/Conceptual Repricing; the final image of thaw patterns reweights their stance toward public wounds. Orientation is immediate (abandoned data center garden; viral confession context; who/where/why are crisp). Causal links are soft but coherent: Leo’s arrival intensifies pressure, Lyra’s proffer alters the dynamic, Leo’s phone away signals cost. The ending lands on the page with cost and a clear before/after in stance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The data‑center‑turned‑moss‑garden is vivid, sensorial, and functionally used (moss from a CPU becomes the offering; the glass ceiling enables the algorithmic drip). Environmental specifics charge the final image and constrain choices toward quiet, tactile action over speech. The setting’s tech‑organic tension supports theme without overstatement. Spatial and sensory choreography remain coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (can vulnerability be safely shared after public exposure?) clarifies early and tightens with Leo’s entrance. Escalation is a textural deepening: from solitude to a risky invitation to his acceptance signaled by pocketing the phone. The visible price is small but legible (renouncing the phone/world’s gaze, risking intimacy). The quiet design maintains pressure without contrivance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Resilience, reclamation, and re‑patterning emerge organically through moss, amber, and melt‑map images. The final “reading new patterns” reprices the premise without didactic moralizing, though “It’s resilient” edges toward on‑the‑nose. Subtext in gesture (proffering instead of thrusting) and silence carries the argument. The emotional aftereffect is gentle and earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The close third centers Lyra’s perceptual signature—pattern‑seeking, tactile, quiet—without head‑hopping beyond a minor “He understood,” which fits the scene’s visible cues. Dialogue is sparse and natural, carrying subtext and restraint. Rhythm and diction suit a lyric yet controlled voice. Psychic distance modulates purposefully at the close.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is polished, with strong imagery (moss on skeletal racks; “algorithm of meltwater”) and minimal redundancy. A few elevated phrases risk purple but stay controlled and scene‑true. Sentences carry multiple jobs, maintaining momentum in a quiet register. Opening and final lines dovetail effectively without scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—moss garden in an abandoned data center, thaw‑algorithm as healing, viral confessions reframed through tactile offering—feels fresh and integral. Risks are aesthetic rather than structural and pay off in coherence. The turns grow from character and place instead of clever grafts. The final reweighting feels both inevitable and non‑obvious.</comment>
