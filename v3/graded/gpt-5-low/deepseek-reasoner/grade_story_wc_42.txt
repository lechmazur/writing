<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Elara’s vocation, composure, and motive (“to harness the ephemeral”) are clear and drive her choices under pressure. We glimpse embodied focus and an earned endurance rather than panic, but contradictory impulses are minimal; she rarely wavers beyond a poised calm. The pivot from image‑keeper to silence‑forger suggests a subtle renunciation, though the cost is mostly tonal. Strong single‑POV interiority, if a touch idealized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Single‑scene arc is clean: worsening tremors → omen object → interior method → decisive stabilization. Closure lands on the page with a Decisive Change (station steadied) and a conceptual repricing (silence over image), consistent with a Hybrid drive dominated by accumulative/textural focus. Causality holds within the story’s fable‑logic, though the technical bypass via clock hand skirts plausibility. Cost is present but soft, more resonant than material.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The observatory’s low‑gravity, gyro‑dependent environment directly shapes stakes and tactics. The clock hand functions as a charged micro‑setting object that constrains and then resolves choice, returning in the final image. Sensory selection is purposeful and filtered through a technician’s bias. Vivid without touristing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (orbital loss) is signaled early, and pressure coheres through tremors and the spinning hand. Escalation deepens via the internal method and culminates in a single decisive intervention. The price paid is largely inward—attention and reorientation—so felt risk outweighs visible loss. A touch more resistance or trade‑off would heighten the peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme integrates: preservation versus impermanence reframed from image to silence, with the leaf‑sound method as the vehicle. The final quiet reweights the opening pursuit without stating a moral. Occasionally the language edges toward luminous abstraction, but resonance is earned through specific images (nebulae, the hand’s stillness). Subtext lives in the choice to value attention over force.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a controlled, lyric texture that modulates under stress. Diction suits a contemplative technician; rhythms mostly carry momentum. A few elevated phrases verge on purple, but the voice remains coherent and purposeful. No head‑hopping or stance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lines are generally clean and propulsive with vivid, economical detail. Some phrasing leans ornate (“a note of absolute zero, of entropy halted”) and repeats concepts of silence and stillness, flirting with redundancy. Syntax varies well; information density stays high. The final image is clear and not dulled by figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The fusion of mystical attentional practice with hard‑tech peril feels fresh and specific to this character. The spinning clock hand repurposed as a regulator is a striking, memorable turn. Slight familiarity in the “will‑imprinted” fix and high lyric register tempers the surprise. Still, the synthesis is coherent and distinctive.</comment>
