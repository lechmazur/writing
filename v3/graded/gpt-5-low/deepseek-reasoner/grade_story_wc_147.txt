<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation (to harness silence as rescue-by-witness) is clear and governs each micro‑choice, especially the crucial override of recoil to offer her own memories. Contradictory impulses—urge to withdraw vs. chosen reciprocity—are dramatized rather than summarized. The emotional cost lands in the exchange and in accepting the sender’s death. Slight safety in her competence (things go right once she calibrates) keeps it from reaching the very top.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: arrival → entry → contact with memories → negotiated exchange → unsnarling → extraction → death tone → charged final image. Closure is on the page with cost: the sender dies as the vial seals, reweighting her mission from rescue to preservation. The because/therefore logic holds without soft resets or conveniences. The final cadence is earned and decisively reconfigures the premise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The underwater temple is vivid and functional; its properties (preternatural stillness, sphere behavior) dictate tactics and enable the memory‑exchange mechanism. Micro‑setting details (Aethel’s lights, heavy water, altar geometry) are purposeful and filtered through her urgent focus. The closing ascent with the vial leverages place to charge the final image. A hair shy of 9+ only because environmental constraints don’t force a mid‑scene work‑around beyond the emotional key.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early and tightens via time pressure and the moral pivot from extraction to exchange. The key turn—choosing to give memories rather than pull—narrows options and carries a felt price. The ending’s loss underscores consequence. Slightly limited escalation breadth; once she chooses reciprocity, the path unfolds without additional complications.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Witness vs. rescue, silence as mass, and reciprocity fuse into a resonant answer: preservation of presence through chosen quiet. The vial, hush, and Chopin fragment accrue meaning without sermonizing; the final image recasts “harnessing the ephemeral” as ethical stewardship. Ambiguity lingers productively around costs and consent. Minor neatness in the resolution prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The third‑person limited voice is controlled and sensuously precise, with modulation that matches pressure (from awe to intimate exchange to elegiac close). No leakage or head‑hopping; inference stays within what Elara could know. Lyricism remains legible under stress. A few elevated turns risk purple but stay earned by tone and context.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong diction and image economy; most lines do dual work (world + pressure). Rhythm varies well, with no significant scaffold loops or cadence templates. A touch of lushness (“lonesome splendor,” repeated intensifiers) skirts excess but doesn’t blur sense. Mechanics are clean and the final line lands sharply.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The gathered hush as a harvestable silence, exchanged via emotional counter‑frequency anchored to a perfume vial, feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The off‑page sender’s Chopin loop repurposed as a plea for witness elevates the premise beyond rescue tropes. Risks in concept and tone pay off without obscuring clarity. The synthesis of science‑fantastic logic and elegiac ethics is memorable.</comment>
