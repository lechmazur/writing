<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation is crystalline and drives continuous action, with a few embodied beats (stomach lurch, frantic run) under time pressure. However, internal contradiction is minimal—she’s capable and composed, rarely torn—so the arc reads as endurance/competence rather than a conflicted change. The closing duty shift lands but at low emotional cost on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: predicted inversion → access → pattern completion → retrieval → threshold escape. Closure lands on page with a decisive change (pod obtained, world righted) and a felt cost pressed by the collapsing hour. The lens reads primarily Causal with situational tightening; no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and operative: inversion and the mist threshold dictate access and exit; pulsing fungi function as an in-world clock. Spatial choreography is clear through the run and leap. Details are selective and purposeful, charging the final image with place-rooted consequence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake is live from the outset and tightens credibly as tremors, flickering fungi, and the narrowing window force bolder moves. The leap across the threshold under collapsing inversion is a strong earned test; cost is danger/time rather than moral trade-off, but it’s legible and escalatory.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Resonance emerges from “knowledge grown” and “seeds of vigilance” reframing preservation as a living guard against forgetting. The final image reweights the quest, though the explicit summation (“not just a sequence… but the union…”) edges toward telling and trims subtlety. Still, it invites reflection beyond plot.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Consistent close-third with a distinct, precise lexicon (“prism-minded,” “latent blaze”) that flexes under pressure without head-hopping. The voice holds certainty appropriate to her expertise and modulates cleanly in the sprint to the exit. No dialogue to test, but narrative stance remains controlled.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lines are lean for the mode, with vivid yet controlled figurative language and sound rhythm. Minimal redundancy; images often do double duty (fungi as light and clock). A mild tendency toward elevated diction is justified by the voice; clarity stays high in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Gravity inversion as timed access, a prism-mind, and consciousness seeds combine into a fresh, coherent synthesis. The puzzle-from-a-doodle and threshold physics feel specific rather than templated. Not a radical reinvention, but confidently novel and integrated with character and stakes.</comment>
