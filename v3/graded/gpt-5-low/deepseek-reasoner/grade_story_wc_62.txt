<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—“to discover the shape of collective grief”—is clear and consistently enacted through concrete choices (following the ribbon, attentive witnessing). Interiority is embodied and character‑particular (craft detail, tactile perception), though genuine internal conflict is minimal, producing a relatively frictionless progression. The final reorientation of her craft reads earned by prior perception. A stronger moment of doubt or competing value under pressure could have deepened the arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure accrues via ribbon → conservatory → spectral family → repriced understanding. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing—she reframes her vocation with felt calm and cost of prior narrowness. Orientation is clean and the spectral logic stays consistent; cost is present but soft. The sequence is legible without mechanical “and‑then,” though escalation is gentle rather than tightening options hard.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The shop and greenhouse are vividly, purposefully rendered (dust of dusk, dragonfly panes, nectar air), and setting images mirror the theme. The ribbon as object‑setting charges discovery and the final image, and the greenhouse houses the vision and migration. While the environment doesn’t strongly constrain tactics, it meaningfully colors and carries the turn. Sensory balance is strong, especially tactile and auditory.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear (find/form collective grief), and pressure deepens as attention intensifies, culminating in the family’s poem ritual. Escalation is primarily density and cadence rather than forced choice, with one meaningful intensification at the vision. The cost remains internal and conceptual; no option is visibly foreclosed on the page. A sharper trade‑off or loss would heighten the stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Grief as dialogue/poem coheres via recurring particulars (ribbon flowers as stanzas; recital ritual; carving as poem‑space). Thematic answer arrives through images and reweighted objects, though the last paragraph edges into explicit statement (“grief…was not an end but a dialogue”). Resonance lingers, but a touch less telling would let the images carry more of the load. Subtext is otherwise effective and honest.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Steady close third with a confident, lyrical cadence; diction and rhythm suit Elara’s temperament and craft. Perceptual signature is consistent (tool/texture bias) and the spectral register is handled without over‑explaining. No head‑hopping or stance drift. A few overt thematic sentences slightly flatten the otherwise controlled voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Sentence rhythms vary and imagery is often precise (“thundering calm,” “living river”), with minimal scaffolding. Some density approaches purple but remains coherent; minimal redundancy. Information density is good and momentum holds across paragraphs. Line‑level could be tightened by trimming a few abstract reiterations in the final third.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The synthesis—gravestone artisanry, spectral mentorship, migration, and poem‑ritual—feels fresh and thematically integrated. The turn from object (ribbon) to communal memory is elegant and non‑obvious. While not radical, the execution shows authenticity and avoids template beats. Greater risk in conflict or a bolder formal move could push it higher.</comment>
