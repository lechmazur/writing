<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—to give voice to the ghost and, implicitly, recover her own—is clear and embodied through tactile action on the iron plate. Awe and trepidation coexist credibly, but the process reads a bit frictionless, with little on‑page cost or error. Still, her regained note at the end feels earned by the work we witness. More visible struggle or a risky tradeoff would elevate.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: atmosphere and patterned images build to the lightning‑timed completion and reconfiguration of the space. Closure lands on the page via the ghost’s stabilization and Elara’s regained voice (RR with a touch of DC). Orientation is solid from the first paragraph. The cost is largely implied (emotional/energetic), not dramatized, which slightly tempers impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The courtyard above clouds, storm charge, and mist cohere into a lived atmospheric engine that frames and colors every action. The iron plate functions as an object‑as‑setting centerpiece that charges the final image (shimmering murals). While the environment guides tone and cadence, it rarely constrains a tactical choice. Vivid specificity and integration outweigh the minor lack of constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes are coherent (voice the ghost or it remains adrift; Elara’s voice remains trapped), and escalation arrives with the plate’s activation and memory flood, culminating in the lightning strike. Agency drives the turn: she chooses to encode and completes it. The pressure feels more ceremonial than contested, with minimal risk or loss on the page. A sharper tradeoff or complication would sharpen cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of giving voice to the voiceless through art/translation emerges organically from the act of encoding and the muralized afterstate. The final clear note—complementing the new hum—offers a resonant answer without overt moralizing. It trends a touch tidy and redemptive, with limited counterpressure or ambiguity. Nonetheless, the graffiti thread and “tinkersong wonder” inflect the theme persuasively.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Consistent, singable lyric voice with controlled diction and rhythmic modulation under stress. POV is steady, with sensory focus narrowing appropriately during the encoding and storm. Inventive phrasing (“tinkersong wonder”) feels character‑specific rather than generic ornament. No dialogue needed; the prose carries subtext through image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lines are polished, largely free of scaffold, and pull double duty in image and action. A few stacked modifiers and lush turns flirt with purple but maintain clarity and propulsion. No noticeable loops or cadence templates; punctuation and sequencing remain clean. Density suits the accumulative design.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>“Ghost in code” communicating via graffiti and interfacing through a flower press bolt plate is a fresh synthesis. The conversion of data‑longing into a balladized, muralized presence feels distinctive and thematically apt. While the arc itself is familiar (mutual recognition heals), the particulars read original and integrated. Risk‑taking in imagery pays off without obscuring clarity.</comment>
