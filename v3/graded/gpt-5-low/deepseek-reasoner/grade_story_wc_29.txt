<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—cautious hope sharpened into a defensive gambit—is clear and consistent, with embodied detail (grease-smudged hands, stinging eyes). We get a credible internal tension (hope vs. fear of bait), though contradictory impulses don’t visibly clash under peak pressure. Competence slightly outweighs struggle; the solution lands without meaningful self-doubt or error on the page. The closing endurance (fatigue, solitary burden) reads earned but low-cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: town division → covert plan → transmission → unraveling of the signal → communal release. Closure is a Decisive Change with a modest but legible cost (risk, exhaustion, social stakes). Orientation is clean early; the single-scene structure stays coherent. The resolution is a touch convenient (clean tone of confirmation), but it remains earned by her prior setup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The university station materially constrains and enables tactics (piggybacking on classical broadcast, rooftop dish, equipment hum). Sensory and professional details are selective and purposeful, filtered through her expertise. The setting charges the final image (“quiet station, charts still”) with a felt aftereffect. Not maximal lushness, but economical and integral.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>One dominant stake is clear (inoculate a divided community), and pressure tightens through the “nothing happens” beat before the tone confirms success. Agency drives the turn; however, the escalation is relatively smooth, with no secondary cost or forced trade-off beyond fatigue. The psychological warfare premise raises stakes, but on-page tension is more poised than fraught. Earned, if low-friction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme coheres around countering division with subtle, precise resistance—“a whisper” over “a shout.” Recurring images (charts, low frequencies, the hum) support a non-didactic close. Some thematic claims are stated outright (“power plays on a galactic scale,” “inoculated”), slightly blunting subtext. The final shift to quiet peace reweights prior material effectively.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Consistent close-third voice with a confident, lightly lyrical technical register that fits Elara’s mind. Rhythmic control is steady; no head-hopping or stance breaks. A few elevated turns risk grandiosity, but they remain within the established idiom. The modulation toward stillness at the end lands cleanly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Clear, efficient lines with purposeful images (“deep hum through the soles,” “ink‑heavy lines”). Minor purple inflections (“balanced equation,” “ethereal grit”) don’t impede clarity or momentum. No meaningful loops or scaffold; information density is solid. The cadence supports the scene’s arc from pressure to release.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The subsonic inoculation via a university classical broadcast is an elegant, specific twist on the alien-signal trope. The “whisper as weapon” strategy gives the piece character-inflected freshness. While the premise sits in a known SF pocket, execution feels particular to Elara’s voice and tools. Risk is moderate and coherent.</comment>
