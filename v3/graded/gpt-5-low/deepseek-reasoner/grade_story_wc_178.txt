<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Kalanu’s motive (precision over plunder) drives action, and his guilt and “empirical irony” add texture under pressure. His shift from seeking power to accepting wardenship reads earned through his decoding choice. Interiority is specific to a numbers‑driven mind, though contradictory impulses could be embodied more viscerally at the peak. The priestess provides credible pressure and status tension without stealing focus.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: discovery → confrontation → counter‑method → uncloak → covenant. Orientation is early and clean; each turn arises from prior choices (her chant burns his charts; he answers with calculation). Closure lands on the page with a clear cost—he becomes warden, not master—and the final image reweights the premise. No teleporting props or soft resets.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The palace’s “dusky harmony,” bas‑relief, and regime‑vacancy detail create a tactile, selective atmosphere filtered through an astronomer’s priorities. The tile functions as an object‑setting that constrains choice and charges the final image. World rules are shown through action (chant burning charts; numbers as lattice) rather than explained. Minor note: the space’s physicality guides mood more than movement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (control vs surrender/guardianship) is signaled early and tightened when the priestess attacks by consuming his representations. Escalation is coherent: his rational method changes options under pressure, culminating in the uncloak command. The cost is legible—burden accepted, tools sacrificed (charts), path foreclosed. One scene, one decisive deepening; efficient and earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme—logic as devotion, power as guardianship rather than dominion—emerges organically from events and images (magic square as prison lattice). The ending reweights the quest with conceptual cost and refuses a tidy triumphal moral. Subtext in the priestess’s “surrender” line vs his “deciphering” frames a complex debate without sermonizing. The reprise of “dusky harmony” seals resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is steady and plausibly bounded; diction is elevated yet character‑coherent for a learned astronomer. Prose modulates under stress, and dialogue is spare, goal‑driven, and status‑aware. No head‑hopping or unearned certainty about the entity; inference reads as inference. A few high‑register phrases flirt with lyricism but remain controlled.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lines are tight and purposeful with strong image‑action density; little scaffold or repetition. Figurative language (“dusky harmony,” “divine machinery”) is consistent and largely unmixed. Rhythm varies, with pressure‑driven acceleration at the uncloak beat. Slight purple edges occasionally, but clarity and propulsion hold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh fusion of mathematics, Babylonian myth, and the redefinition of “covenant” as wardenship; the magic square as prison lattice is an original, satisfying turn. Stakes stay human‑scaled yet conceptually large. Risks (logic countering ritual) pay off without contrivance. Specificity lifts it above trope.</comment>
