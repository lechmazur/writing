<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s motives are clear and character‑particular—her preference for listening over noise is embodied in her sensory acuity and craft competence. The lever failure forces micro‑choices (jury‑rigging, waiting for glue, weighing duty vs. hush) that reveal simultaneous contradictory impulses. The refusal at zero hour reads as an earned renunciation with a palpable emotional cost. A minor quibble: her competence and calm slightly blunt felt struggle under peak pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Situational lens holds: a coherent external pressure (test deadline, lever failure, hymn’s emergence) forces a stance crystallization. The causal chain is clean—breakage → rope workaround → glue wait → zero hour hush → hymn → refusal—with no teleporting information. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise; cost is implied (defying mandate, risking late warning) and legible in the foreclosed pull. The price could be sharpened by one concrete on‑page consequence, but the final image carries weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The sanctuary above the clouds, the horn, and the cathedral rope are vivid and functionally integrated—setting supplies the tool, enforces isolation, and the wind’s cessation shapes the pivotal beat. Sensory detail is purposeful (ozone, pressure drop, rope’s rough hemp) and POV‑filtered by a weather‑attuned professional. The rope returns as a charged final image that constrains choice. World logic is consistent and economical.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear early: duty to sound the siren vs. preservation of listening/hush. Escalation tightens through the mechanical failure, the glue‑clock, and the sudden hymn at zero hour, culminating in a trade‑off that forecloses the official path. The refusal is protagonist‑driven and ethically charged, with internal and external stakes interweaving. Slight softness in explicit on‑page cost prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of listening versus noise, trust in communal attunement, and the value of restraint emerges organically from action and image (the hymn versus the siren). The final image reweights prior particulars without needing exposition. A single thesis‑like line (“To favor listening over noise… was an active choice”) edges toward didactic clarity, slightly reducing subtextual charge. Overall resonance is strong and honest.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third‑person close voice is steady, lyrical without drift, and filtered through Elara’s perceptual signature (microclimate attention, tool focus). Diction and rhythm modulate with pressure; no head‑hopping or stance wobbles. No dialogue needed; silence itself functions as counterpoint. A touch of elevated phrasing in peak beats is controlled and voice‑justified.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is clean, sensorially precise, and economical; sentences carry multiple jobs without scaffolding. Rhythm varies well and supports momentum through the glue‑wait and the hush. Minor purple inflections and a near‑explanatory sentence or two do not drag clarity or pressure. No loops or figurative muddles that touch the closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The storm‑siren tester on a solstice hush with a rope‑jury‑rig and a refusal at the alarm’s zero hour feels fresh and coherent. The “switch” doubling—mechanism and purpose—is a smart, non‑obvious synthesis that lands in hindsight. Emotional truth is specific rather than templated. Not radically experimental, but confidently singular.</comment>
