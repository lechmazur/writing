<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—“to capture one last spark before oblivion”—is clear and consistently embodied in her tactics. Interiority is specific (heartbeat receding, weariness after) and aligned with her vocation. The piece lacks strong contradictory impulses or visible struggle beyond discipline, keeping the arc slightly one‑note. Still, the final earned stillness/emptiness carries a modest cost that reads.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the pressure tightens via stillness → pattern discernment → infusion. Closure lands on the page with cost (chip turned grey, her “weary and hollowed out” state) and a reweighted final image (faint smile). Orientation is clean early; single‑scene coherence is strong. The path is friction‑light, but the cadence shift at the infusion beat is decisive.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The aurora‑lit skyborne grotto is vividly realized and integrated (the photon “dance” becomes a functional key). Spatial anchors (marble table, silver dish) are coherent and tactile; sensory economy is excellent. The environment charges tone and method more than it constrains choice, limiting the ceiling. Still, the final image is atmospherically earned by place.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible from the start; escalation occurs as density and focus rather than adversarial reversal, fitting the lens. The decisive act (infusion) is protagonist‑driven with a visible price (exhaustion, spent chip). Pressure remains coherent though gentle; a sharper complication could have deepened the cost. As executed, the single tightening beat is sufficient and clean.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme—dignity in death, memory as final beauty, preservation against oblivion—emerges organically through image and action. Recurring green/aurora/stone motifs reweight meaning at the end without didacticism. The last charged calm (ghost‑smile, greyed chip) provides resonant, non‑literal answer to the premise. Slight neatness in success keeps it just shy of the top band.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third‑person with distinct diction (“radiant hush,” “lucidly watchful”) remains stable and apt. Rhythm modulates effectively from meditative to charged calm at the infusion. No dialogue, but interior focalization stays plausible and consistent. Minor risk of elevated register drift is managed by the mythic frame.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Line craft is polished: sentences carry multiple jobs (world, action, theme) with few redundancies. The lyric density nears purple but maintains clarity, especially in peak beats. No evident scaffold loops; images are coherent and carefully chosen. Slight lushness in modifiers modestly slows momentum in places.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—mortuary craft as spiritual beautification, geologic memory extraction via an auroral grotto—is fresh and specific. The emerald’s revaluation and the “patterns in static” method feel original and inevitable in hindsight. Risks in tone and concept pay off without gimmickry. The conflict’s gentleness slightly limits the sense of radical ingenuity.</comment>
