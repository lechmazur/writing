<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation and interior contradiction are clear and embodied: he performs mandated neutrality while privately tending grief. Micro‑choices (the flat narration, choosing not to narrate the outdoor ritual) reveal values under pressure. The tear and the decision to risk a private memorial earn the final stance. Minor label use (“morally ambiguous”) edges toward telling but doesn’t undercut credibility.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: routine hum → pattern break (turbines stop) → deepened choice culminating in a charged, chosen quiet. Closure arrives on the page as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: he reconfigures the hush from imposed to chosen, with felt cost (risk of re‑education, surrender of his shield). Orientation is clean from the opening. The final image (bird on bouquet in still air) crystallizes before/after.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and functional: the turbines’ hum/cessation pressures choices and charges atmosphere; farmhouse details (table, shavings, bouquet) are lived‑in and purpose‑driven. Recurring objects (bird, bouquet, knife) serve as micro‑setting and shape action. The environment directly triggers the turn (sudden stillness). A hairline deduction for a lightly generalized “clean energy/clean, happy world” note.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—authentic mourning vs mandated cheer—tightens when the turbines stop, forcing a shift from performative narration to unsheltered grief. The outdoor act is a deliberate escalation with cost (dropping the protective performance, risking detection). External pressure (re‑education) remains offstage, slightly softening perceived threat. Nonetheless, the internal price is unmistakable and carries the resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Themes of imposed happiness versus earned lightness arise through specific acts (whittling down the bird and the self) and the reweighted hush at the end. Subtext operates in the refusal to narrate the ritual and the charged objects. A small deduction for a couple of direct thematic labels (“morally ambiguous act,” “gaudy, required thing”). The final image offers a resonant, non‑literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is steady and controlled; the voice balances laconic precision with lyrical texture. The mock‑documentary self‑narration is character‑specific and modulates convincingly when it fails at the peak. Rhythm varies with pressure, and diction matches the focalizer. No head‑hopping or stance drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sentences are clean, purposeful, and carry multiple jobs; images are concrete (shavings like pale tears, translucent bird) without purple overload. Momentum holds across paragraphing; the turbines’ stillness cleanly pivots cadence. Minor repetition of thematic terms (“hush,” “mandate”) is intentional and not loop‑like. Copy is tight with no noticeable artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>“Happiness mandate” dystopia is familiar, but the synthesis—wind‑farm hush, self‑narrated compliance, grief carved thinner—feels fresh. The pattern break via environmental silence is a non‑obvious pressure point that reconfigures meaning. Emotional truth grounds the speculative frame. Not radical, but confidently singular.</comment>
