<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—obsessively locating the “deleted”—is clear and consistently drives her choices through to the risky disclosure. The career-vs-truth dilemma surfaces credibly at the end, with a concrete act (uploading) that forecloses safety. Interiority is specific (metadata ghosts, sensed absence) but internal contradiction is lightly sketched rather than deeply embodied in moment-to-moment pressure. The character reads unique, though her struggle could carry more visceral cost on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Under a causal lens, the chain from metadata anomalies → hidden server → partial log → warehouse → safe → chip → upload is coherent and escalatory. Closure lands via a decisive change with cost: she publicizes the truth, risking her career and inviting corporate retaliation. A few conveniences (coordinate numerology, undiscovered safe) are brisk but seeded and paid off. Orientation is clear early and the single-POV flow stays intact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The archive’s “humming cavern” and the derelict warehouse are vivid and purposeful, with tools/objects (server, panel, safe, patch, chip) shaping tactics and charging the final image. Environmental detail aligns with Elara’s professional gaze, filtering specificity through her priorities. The setting constrains options (off-schematic server; obsolete encryption; physical safe) rather than serving as postcard décor. It supports tone and theme without overdescription.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes are unified: expose truth vs protect career. Pressure tightens through concrete turns—digital ghosts to physical proof—culminating in a non-reversible action. The price is legible and thematically coherent (corporate reprisal, loss of career standing). While there’s no antagonist on the page, the institutional pressure is felt and escalates appropriately.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story coherently explores memory, erasure, and honor, with the “deleted files” conceit reweighted by the final act. The patch and numbers recur as moral waypoints rather than mere clues. A touch of thesis-forward phrasing in the closing rhetorical frame slightly flattens ambiguity. Overall, resonance endures beyond plot mechanics.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The close third voice is controlled, lyrical without opacity, and consistent with Elara’s perceptual signature. Diction modulates well between forensic clarity and elegiac tone. No dialogue is needed; the narration carries action and subtext cleanly. Minor high-register phrases land as character-apt, not generic.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lines are tight, image-rich, and purposeful; sentences vary rhythmically with good momentum. Figurative language (ghosts in metadata, digital sea) is coherent and not overstacked. No scaffold loops or filter-verb stacks slow the peak beats, and the final image is clean. Information density stays high without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The corporate archivist unearthing a buried space-mission truth isn’t novel per se, but the integration of social archive forensics with a tactile relic (patch/chip) and numerological spoor feels fresh. Turns are earned and avoid contrivance beyond genre norms. The tonal weave of elegy and thriller is deft. It’s strong and distinctive, if not fully groundbreaking.</comment>
