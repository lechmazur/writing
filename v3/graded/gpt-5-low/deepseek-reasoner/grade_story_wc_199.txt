<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation (to decode the leaves) is clear and seeds a credible internal contradiction—orderly taxonomist compelled into a chaotic act of faith. Embodied moments (dust‑stained fingers, the cry of “mossy delight”) ground emotion. The renunciation of her identity as “orderly” for “sower” lands, though the pivot feels swift and lightly resisted. A touch more friction at the decision would deepen cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal. Beats link cleanly—discovery of the speck, experimentation on leaves, reweighted prophecy, decisive planting, and on‑page transformation. Closure is a Decisive Change with conceptual cost (relinquishing ordering for sowing) shown in the final action and image. The inciting coincidence (finding the speck) is acceptable; cost is present but softly rendered.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The ashen skyborne arbor and living workbench are vivid, purposeful, and charged in the final image as the world itself transforms. The moonstone tool‑object and the bench constrain choices and deliver payoff. Sensory selection stays POV‑true to a meticulous sorter, with world rules taught through action (leaves illuminating, the arbor glowing). Description supports momentum rather than pausing it.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes center on the meaning of the leaves versus the demand to enact them; escalation arrives when the final leaf reframes her role from reader to sower. The choice forecloses a path (cataloging), with agency driving the turn (she plants). Pressure is coherent but gentle, with minimal on‑page resistance or loss beyond identity trade. The cadence shift is clear and sufficient at this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Themes of interpretation vs. enactment and past vs. future are woven through recurring particulars (leaves, cairns, bench) and reweighted in the ending: “The message was never in the falling, but in the planting.” Subtext works in the shift from artifact as “key” to “seed.” The resonance is earned without moralizing. Slight neatness limits further complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A consistent, lyrical third‑person close distance matches Elara’s sensibility; the diction’s botanical and mineral palette feels character‑bound. Rhythm modulates well at turns (the frantic dance vs. the hush). No head‑hopping; certainty aligns with what she can infer. Minor flourish leans ornamental at times but stays legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished, with varied syntax and strong verb choices; images often do double duty. Occasional purple pressure (“a perfect, minuscule dome of captured moonlight,” “a shard of pure myth”) skates close to excess but preserves clarity. Minimal scaffold or paraphrase loops. The final line cleanly recharges earlier motifs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The skyborne arbor ecology, moonstone‑as‑constellation seed, and the shift from reading to sowing feel fresh and integrated. The object’s revaluation is earned and surprising yet inevitable. Risks are aesthetic rather than structural, and they pay off. Only the low resistance at the choice point tempers absolute distinction.</comment>
