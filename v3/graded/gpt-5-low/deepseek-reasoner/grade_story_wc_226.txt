<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Kaelen’s motive—splitting a single truth into many—is clear and embodied through the crystal-poetry act under communal pressure. His internal texture (defiance threaded with dread and later sorrow) reads credible, though contradictions in-the-moment are modest rather than richly layered. Micro‑choices are evident (stepping to the plate, lifting the prism, choosing a poem of the “forgotten”). The final cost—losing his voice—lands as an earned renunciation rather than a convenient martyrdom.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Orientation is immediate (canyon, bone towers, impending ritual) and the causal chain is clean: he prepares → performs → Elders reframe → he becomes the sacrifice. Closure is on‑page and costly: the Stone of Forgetting to his lips reconfigures the stake decisively. The scene keeps to one window and pays off its set‑ups without teleports or resets. The ritual’s persistent constraint shapes both tactics (echoes) and ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The canyon of echoes, bone towers, and pale spire are vivid, integrated, and functional—the echoing architecture literally enables his attempted tactic. The Stone and the spire’s reprise charge the final image with loss and reweighted meaning. Sensory cues (light, bone surfaces, mist) are selective and POV‑filtered rather than touristic. World rules feel consistent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around one stake: challenge communal doctrine versus the cost of erasure. The key tightening is the Elder’s reframing—his act makes him the new sacrifice—foreclosing options and reversing his hoped‑for outcome. Agency drives escalation: his choice to perform triggers the price. The cost is unmistakable and carried to the final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme arises organically: unity versus plural truths, and communal peace as amnesia with a price. The final conceptual reweighting—his refracted truth becoming “another ghost”—lingers without moralizing. Recurring images (hush, spire, echoes, crystal) accrue subtext rather than shouting it. A few direct lines (“cowardly amnesia”) trend declarative but don’t flatten the resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The close third voice is controlled and lyrical without losing clarity; diction suits the mythic register. Dialogue is spare and weighted (the Elder’s line lands as an action). Rhythm modulates well from poised hush to the clipped fatality at the end. No head‑hopping or stance leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is tight, image‑rich, and mostly multi‑tasking; the echo/light/bone lexicon stays coherent. A high figurative density skirts purple but remains legible and purposeful under pressure. Sentence rhythm varies, with clean choreography and minimal scaffold. The final line resolves by image without blur.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The refracted‑voice tactic in a bone‑echo canyon is a fresh synthesis, and the price‑of‑forgiveness twist avoids cliché by targeting voice rather than life. The spire’s repricing and the hush returning “heavier” feel inevitable in hindsight. Risks (lyric register, ritual frame) heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. The vision reads singular, not templated.</comment>
