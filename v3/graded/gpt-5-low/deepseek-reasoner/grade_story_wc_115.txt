<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Leo’s motive (to weigh a dead man’s confession) is clear, character‑specific, and drives each choice from tunnel to valve. His “religiously skeptical” stance usefully contradicts his felt experience, sharpening his need to test rather than believe. Embodied stress reads credibly (shaking headlamp, burning muscles), and the final exhaustion feels earned. A minor limit: interior conflict is strong but could sharpen once more at the wheel (a flicker of doubt vs. risk) to hit peak depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: static confession → tunnel advance → boiler discovery → valve test → release/absolution. Closure is on‑page and costly: the wheel yields with a scream and the “colossal sigh” reconfigures the room and Leo’s stance (Decisive Change with Resonant Reconfiguration). Orientation is anchored promptly; single scene scope holds. The cost is legible in the final image (spent body, quiet burden) and the lens remains coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful: tunnel acoustics heighten vigilance; the boiler room’s heat, hum, and the beaded wheel constrain and direct action. The environment shapes tactics (finding, gripping, forcing the valve) and charges the final image (steam’s “relief” as truth vented). Sensory detail is selective and POV‑filtered, avoiding museum‑tour excess. A couple of familiar metaphors (“cathedral of decay”) don’t blunt function.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (test truth with real consequence) is signaled early and tightens at the wheel; the ghost shift intensifies pressure into a decisive act. Agency drives the turn; the release carries a visible and conceptual price (effort, risk, and acceptance of complicity/absolution). Internal and external pressures interlock well. A slight additional foreclosed option (e.g., the danger of not turning) could have sharpened the tradeoff.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of truth’s weight and industrial ghosts as pressure (not apparitions) emerges through action, not moralizing. The beaded wheel and vent transform into an image of confession released; skepticism repriced into embodied absolution. The ending resonates without tidy sermon. Subtext around labor exploitation and hushed disasters sits felt beneath the scene.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>POV is stable, close, and confident; diction and rhythm modulate with pressure (from velvet hush to tearing metal to quiet relief). The perceptual signature—materialist yet sensually alert—feels distinct. Lyric touches mostly serve mood and stakes. No head‑hopping or unearned certainty intrudes.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is tight and propulsive with high information density; images often do double duty (hum as held breath, steam as confession). A few lush metaphors risk purple (“cathedral of decay,” “necklace of grimy glass beads”) but remain coherent and legible. Syntax varies well; no scaffold loops or filter‑verb stacks. Final cadence lands cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The “factory ghost shift” realized as pressure and sound, and the radio‑psychic triangulation as investigative method, feel fresh. The climactic release reframes haunting as unresolved process rather than apparitions, giving the premise a non‑obvious angle. Specific objects (beaded wheel) and tactics tie originality to character and setting. Risk is controlled and purposeful without gimmickry.</comment>
