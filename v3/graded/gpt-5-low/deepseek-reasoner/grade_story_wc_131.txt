<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Silas’s yearning “to become visible” drives concrete micro-choices (pocketing the tape, playing it, shifting his practice to caching comfort books). Interiority is specific and embodied (dust motes, pipe chases, the groaning machine). The internal tension—desire for visibility vs. commitment to invisibility—registers, though it never bites as sharply as it could. The ending earns an endurance choice with a modest felt cost: he remains unseen to be what others need.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive: the outage hush, the fragment, the voice, the remembered care all layer to a cadence shift where Silas redefines his method. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when), and causality holds: tape → memory → renewed purpose. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with the final image (“kindness as data”) and the accepted cost of continued invisibility. Stakes are quiet but coherent and tightened by the tape-triggered pivot.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The library’s ductwork, vents, and dawn hush constrain tactics and enable his ghostlike aid; the micro‑setting is used with tactile specificity. The tape reader and vents are integrated tools, not décor, and the “sapphire hush” tones the action and closure. Environmental logic remains consistent and character‑filtered. The final image is charged by place and object together.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes center on whether Silas can realize a form of visibility; the meaningful tightening is the tape’s voice reweighting his method. Escalation is subtle and internal; no antagonist, but pressure coheres as purpose crystallizes. Cost is implied more than dramatized, keeping the tension elegant but soft. One decisive deepening suffices at this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Themes of human curation vs. systems and the ethics of presence emerge organically from particulars (“the hand that offers the right book”). The tape’s line skirts didacticism but is grounded in scene and paid off through action. The final repricing—kindness as the most important “data”—lingers without a neat moral. Ambiguity around his chosen invisibility keeps it honest.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A consistent, lyrical third‑person close voice with a distinct perceptual signature (“whisper‑thin spaces,” “sapphire hush”). Diction suits Silas’s clandestine caretaking; no head‑hopping or stance slippage. The lone bit of on‑page voice (Ms. Gable) contrasts cleanly without disrupting focalization. Rhythm modulates well from hush to purposeful movement.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is polished, with high information density and varied cadence; imagery is vivid but largely controlled. A few elevated turns approach purple, yet they remain anchored by concrete action and tools. No evident scaffolding loops or template cadence; momentum holds through the reflective pivot. The final line crisps motif without over‑explaining.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The crawl‑space librarian as benevolent “ghost in the machine” feels fresh, with the ferromagnetic fragment as an inspired trigger. The synthesis of obsolete media, ductwork tactics, and an ethic of curated kindness is distinctive. Turns are earned from established particulars rather than clever retrofits. Quiet risk‑taking in premise and tone pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
