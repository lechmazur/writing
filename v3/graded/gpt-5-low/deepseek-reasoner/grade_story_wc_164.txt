<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara’s drive is clear and particular, and her actions (placing the seed, conjecturing, planting the seedling) align with it. The contradiction of “cheerful gloom” plays credibly through her embodied work. However, pressure on her interior remains gentle—success arrives with minimal friction and little on‑page self‑doubt or error. The final acceptance reads earned but not hard-won.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: props and images accrue toward a Conceptual Repricing (“paths disappear… require a translator of heart”) with the seedling as costed emblem. Orientation is crisp from the outset, and the causal chain (seed → glyphs → reconstruction → planting) is coherent. The cost is felt—knowledge reframes loss—though the escalation is soft. Closure lands clearly and on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The geode cave, crater glass, and ocean are vivid and functional; the glass/tool actively shapes choices and charges the ending image. Sensory selection is purposeful (light fractured into watery hues; somber glyphs) filtered through her vocation. The planted seed at the geode entrance ties place to resolution. A minor lift could come from the environment constraining tactics more directly in the middle beat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: complete the fractured memory to answer why paths vanish. Pressure coheres via the missing pieces and the fading window; the seed arrival complicates then enables a decisive deepening. Escalation is modest and largely inward; no real foreclosed option besides ignorance. The price is conceptual rather than tactical, which keeps the tension elegant but gentle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Resonant meditation on loss, awe, and chosen sacrifice with strong image-systems (foam, glass, seed). The captain’s acceptance reframes “disappearance” with complexity. A direct thematic sentence (“Paths disappear not because…”) edges into on‑the‑nose and slightly blunts the subtext. Even so, the final planted seed converts theme into image with lingering charge.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person closely held to Elara, with controlled cadence and a distinct perceptual bias toward marine and prismatic textures. Diction is consistent and confident without head‑hopping or register slips. Rhythm modulates well at the climax (glyphs flaring, seed splitting). Minor tendency toward elevated declaration in the thesis line prevents a higher mark.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High information density; images often do double duty, and sentences carry momentum. Figurative language is lush but mostly disciplined, avoiding mixed metaphors. Minimal scaffold or loops; the prose breathes at turns without slack. A touch of purple in isolated lines and one explicit moral sentence slightly dulls the blade.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: a sea‑foam recollectionist using crater glass to transliterate emotions, cross‑pollinated by a Lamentation Tree seed is striking and coherent. The reframing of the “missing path” as a chosen sublime feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Bold but legible risk-taking with objects-as-ethics and cheerful gloom tone. Small softness in escalation is the only curb.</comment>
