<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elara’s motives and worldview are concrete and drive action (the deflection into the grotto), and Aric’s shift from frustration to awe reads earned via the on‑page event. Warm observation inflects her choices rather than remaining label‑only. The reconciliation is a bit tidy given the stakes, with cost largely conceptualized rather than enacted.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Clear causal chain: argument pause → grotto → jade contact → vision → reconfiguration of their stance. The closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/charged poise rather than a decisive change, with some cost implied by foreclosed futures. Orientation is strong and the single‑scene window holds. The supernatural device resolves pressure quickly, softening felt price at the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The coast and grotto are vividly and purposefully rendered; sensory details track Elara’s bias and the tide provides a subtle clock. The jade cicada and bioluminescent walls charge the final image and enable the turn. The environment is not postcard but instrument—object‑as‑setting constrains and reframes choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (the relationship’s direction) is clear early and deepens through the vision’s branching futures. The tightening comes via newly revealed options rather than external pressure; the cost is conceptual, not yet paid. Still, the third‑path stance feels like a real narrowing of options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme coheres around transition and the “texture of time,” elegantly refracted through tide, monsoon tracking, and the vision. The final repricing—“observatory”—lands but edges toward thesis statement. Subtext in gesture and image generally carries the weight, with minimal sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The close third maintains a distinct, lyrical perceptual signature aligned with Elara; occasional access to Aric’s understanding tracks cleanly with on‑page triggers. Dialogue is spare, functional, and subtextual. Rhythm modulates with pressure without head‑hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and controlled, with strong verbs and purposeful images; the lyricism rarely slides into purple. Momentum holds through description, and sentences do multiple jobs. Minor risk of over‑lushness is kept in check; no loops or scaffolding impede clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of a jade rain‑gauge cicada, tidal‑pool chronicling, and relational futures feels fresh and character‑true. The vision device is familiar but made specific by the hydrological/time‑texture frame. The ending image reweights earlier particulars without gimmickry.</comment>
