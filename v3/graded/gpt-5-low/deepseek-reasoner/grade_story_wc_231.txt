<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias’s motive—duty braided with loneliness—feels specific and embodied (the breath, the beam, the careful handling of the flower). His “observing gaps” method reveals character through choice, not summary. The renunciation at the end (relinquishing the boutonnière) reads as an earned cost. Slight neatness in his deductions trims the edge of complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clear causal chain: corpse with flower → retained boutonnière → inference of destination → walk to cove → photograph → delivery. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration; the final act reweights the whole piece with cost. The leap from “pointing past the lighthouse” to finding a specific cottage is tidy but not implausible. Single POV, two‑shard flow holds together with one meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Opal dock, mist, lens, and the lantern room create a tactile, mood‑true world filtered through a keeper’s eye. The Edelweiss and the beacon’s beam return to charge the final image. While the environment primarily deepens tone more than constraining tactics, it remains integrated and specific. No anachronism or rule drift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible early: decode and deliver the stranger’s message. Pressure coheres and deepens when Elias finds the cove’s Edelweiss patch, narrowing interpretation and compelling the mantelpiece choice. The cost is quiet—parting with the flower and accepting his solitude—but present. Escalation is measured rather than tense, fitting the chosen lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>“Observing gaps” refracts into a theme of meaning made from absence, culminating in the mantelpiece delivery. Isolation is witnessed, not sermonized, and reconfigured into connection by act rather than statement. The Edelweiss shifts from clue to fulfilled promise without sentimentality. Ambiguity lingers productively around the man’s life while the story’s stance remains clear.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The lyrical third‑person close is steady, with a distinct perceptual signature (“borrow memories,” “the mist was a perpetual witness”). Diction and cadence modulate with pressure and never over‑explain. No head‑hopping or stance slippage; inference stays within plausible knowledge. Compression is purposeful and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Clean, musical sentences with high information density and minimal scaffold; images do more than one job. Figurative language is controlled and coherent (light through the brittle flower, the mist as witness). No evident loops or tempo misfires, and the final line earns its cadence. Elegance without purple excess.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The lighthouse‑keeper mystery frame is familiar, but the Edelweiss and “gaps” method give it fresh texture and ethical clarity. The quiet act of message‑delivery as climax feels non‑obvious yet inevitable. Risks are tasteful rather than radical, but the synthesis is memorable. Emotional truth outpaces template.</comment>
