<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elara’s motive is precise and consistent, and her patience, tactile ritual, and final delivery align with that drive. Internal contradiction is light, but the embodied process (waiting, touching sprocket holes) gives her interiority texture. The elderly client’s presence at the end adds relational charge without dialogue. The change—shifting from locating a place to delivering a message—feels earned if quiet.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive holds: booth setup → incubation → psychometry vision → delivery. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration with cost: a lifetime of “unused love” redefined and returned, marked by the single tear. Orientation is clean from the outset; the causal thread is modest but coherent and sufficient for this mode. The final act (handing over the can) lands the change on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The Orpheum’s booth and auditorium are vivid and functionally necessary; tools (preview platen, projector beam) directly enable the reading. Sensory selection (“hushed thunder,” warm glass) is purposeful and filtered through the protagonist’s craft. The environment charges the final image in the empty auditorium. Specificity supports plausibility and mood without museum‑tour excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes are focused: uncover where unused love is stored and act accordingly. Escalation is a deepening under the accumulative lens: from waiting to vision to the realization that “place” is “intended recipient,” narrowing options to delivery. The cost is elegiac rather than perilous, but it’s felt in the recognition of time lost. One meaningful tightening suffices at this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme coheres: love as an act of creation awaiting its audience; memory as storage medium. Recurring images (film strip, melody, beam of light) reweight at the end without moralizing. The final line reframes the premise with earned poignancy: “not stored; … waiting.” Subtext hums in silence and gesture rather than declaration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third‑person close with a controlled lyric register suits the piece; no head‑hopping. Diction and rhythm modulate with pressure (ritual patience vs. vision’s quickened clarity). No withholding shenanigans; inference reads as inference. The perceptual signature—craft‑inflected noticing—remains consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is clean, with varied syntax and high information density. Figurative language is frequent but disciplined and legible; minimal scaffolding or loops. Pacing breathes at the right moments, and the closure image is crisp. No artifacts or muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The fusion of psychometry with analog cinema and a visual “goodbye letter” feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The execution privileges specificity over gimmick. Risks (lyric tone, quiet resolution) pay off without obscuring clarity. It’s not wholly unprecedented, but its synthesis reads singular and assured.</comment>
