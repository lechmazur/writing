<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elara’s drive is clean and character‑particular, and her renunciation (throwing the Hollywood shard) credibly earns the ending. Interiority is embodied through tactile attention to equipment and the city’s strain under perigee. The internal contradiction (add more vs. subtract to hear) is present but resolves a bit tidily. Still, the micro‑choices under pressure align with her credo and reveal values with a felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure coheres via progressive subtraction culminating in a conceptual repricing. Orientation is strong from the opening, and the perigee + city + console choreography is causal enough for the mode. Closure lands on‑page with cost (the shard’s sacrifice) and reweights the premise. The glowing shard coincidence serves as foil before being discarded, not a deus ex machina.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The suspended city of antennae and the moon’s physical pull saturate atmosphere and meaning. The environment constrains and charges choices: pointing the single dish, the perigee’s gravity, and the gorge as the literal void to receive the shard. Sensory specificity is selective and purposeful. World rules stay consistent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—isolating the signal/finding a beginning—tightens through a decisive tactic shift (powering down, stripping filters) and a visible price (discarding the shard). There’s no antagonist, but coherent pressure escalates as options narrow from “more” to “less.” The final tuning is a clear agency move that crystallizes stance. Stakes remain intimate yet consequential.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Themes of subtraction, origins within endings, and rejecting external validation emerge from concrete acts, not lecture. The star fragment motif meaningfully reconfigures at the end. A couple of lines (“It represented the assumption of external validation…”) verge on direct statement, slightly reducing subtlety. Overall resonance is strong and lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third‑person closely held to Elara with consistent diction and rhythm. The prose modulates with pressure, tightening around the renunciation and the “shard of hush.” No head‑hopping or stance drift; inference stays within what Elara can plausibly sense. Voice feels singular and apt to the conceptual stakes.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sentences carry multiple jobs with few redundancies; imagery is vivid without tipping into muddle. Minor elevated phrasing fits the voice and does not obscure action. Momentum holds through the reflective passages and into the peak image. No notable scaffold loops or figurative contradictions at the close.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis—cosmic listening as subtraction, a “shard of hush,” and a Hollywood terrazzo fragment as false allure—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risk is taken in committing to a quiet climax and a conceptual payoff that still lands viscerally. The suspended city and perigee mechanics elevate beyond trope. Innovation serves character and closure rather than ornament.</comment>
