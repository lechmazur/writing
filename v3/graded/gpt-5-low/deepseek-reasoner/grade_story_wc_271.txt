<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is concrete and embodied, with specific somatic markers and a credible freeze response that opposes the impulse to run. Her realism/optimism tension drives the final stance without sentimentality. Micro‑choices (grasping bark, reframing the photograph) reveal values under pressure. No safety‑hedging or tidy cure; the cost persists.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single‑scene accumulative structure tightens from jet-triggered flashback to a controlled return via tactile focus. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she reconfigures the photo’s meaning and recommits to tending, with the trauma intact as cost. Orientation is clean from the opening. No causality gaps; pressure coheres.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The arboretum and cliff setting is vivid and purposeful; wind‑shaped pines and sea-sound are not postcards but tools that constrain and enable her tactic (bark as anchor, waves distinct from drone). The lighthouse’s absence tones the environment and charges the final planting image. Sensory detail is selective and POV‑filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (regain the present to keep tending/being) is signaled early and tightened by the overhead jet and freeze, which forecloses flight. The counter-move—grounding through bark and breath—constitutes agency with a felt price. Resolution is earned by a stance crystallization rather than convenience or miracle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Resilience without facile optimism emerges through the “pearl of stillness” concept enacted, not preached; the final reweighting of the photograph as “evidence” reframes grief and hope. The lighthouse’s dark contrasts with her planting, avoiding tidy moralizing. Thematic resonance lingers beyond the scene.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third‑person close voice is steady, lyrical but controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature (tactile/somatic focus) that tightens under stress. Diction fits character and never slips into authorial intrusion. Rhythm modulates effectively through panic and recovery.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is clean and propulsive with high information density; images (wind‑sculpted pines, fossilized smile) do double duty. A few elevated phrases risk lyric saturation but remain coherent and purposeful. No loops or scaffold slow the momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The synthesis—arboretum keeper, lighthouse gone dark, trauma grounded through tactile anchoring—feels particular and lived. While the resilience arc is familiar, the execution avoids cliché and finds fresh textures (photo as evidence; wind-bent trees as mirror and tool). Risk is measured and effective rather than flashy.</comment>
