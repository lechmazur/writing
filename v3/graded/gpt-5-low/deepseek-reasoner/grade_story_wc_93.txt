<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Motivation is sharply etched and enacted through concrete micro-choices (stone‑placing, choosing alignment over control). The curse complicates his perception and complicates motive without collapsing into label‑speak. The renunciation at the end (to align, not control) reads as an earned change with a felt cost to identity. Slight lack of embodied stress responses undercuts peak pressure by a hair.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Clear causal spine: sequences → eels respond → void/mote appears → alignment choice → faint return of friction. Closure lands on the page as a Decisive Change with conceptual cost; the lens holds. Orientation is clean by ~120 words and no props teleport. The only softness is that the price is mostly conceptual rather than dramatized as immediate loss.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The tidal bluff and aurora are vividly selective and integrated with action (stones “drink” aurora light; frictionless world shapes motion). Environment constrains tactics and charges the final image (borrowed dawn → earned light). The eel paths and peat are used as living spatial choreography. World rules stay consistent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible early and escalates through a single purposeful tightening: the ritual fails/holds, then the eels’ answer catalyzes the mote. Agency drives the turn when he chooses alignment, not seizure. Cost is felt as surrender of control and acceptance of partial, fragile change, though no hard sacrifice is staged on the page. Tension is steady rather than jagged, fitting the piece’s cadence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Control vs balance culminates in the reframing of “harness” as alignment; the promise’s re‑pricing (“by him,” not “to him”) deepens meaning without moralizing. Recurring images (stones, eels, aurora) accrue thematic charge and reweight at the end. The quiet return of friction produces an earned, resonant afterimage. Ambiguity remains purposeful, not evasive.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Close third maintains a coherent, lyrical perceptual signature with disciplined diction and modulation at beats. No dialogue; the voice carries pressure through image and syntax without leakage or head‑hopping. Patterned elision (curse glimpses) is taught and paid off with the promise reveal. A few elevated phrasings brush the edge of abstraction but stay anchored in concrete action.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is concise, image‑rich, and purposeful; sentences do more than one job and propel momentum. Figurative language is controlled and consistent with the world’s physics; no paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. Final image lands cleanly without purple overreach. Minor density patches could breathe more under peak beats, but clarity holds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The frictionless world, eel‑guided mathematics, and collapsed stardust synthesis feels singular and inevitable in hindsight. Risks (lyric science‑mysticism, quiet climax) heighten stakes and coherence without obscuring clarity. Turns grow from prior particulars rather than late rule drops. Freshness resides in both premise and moral calculus of alignment over dominion.</comment>
