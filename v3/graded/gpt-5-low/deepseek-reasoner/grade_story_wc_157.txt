<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lysander’s motive—guarding his “spark of defiance”—is clear and consistently drives choice, culminating in the costly decision to ruin his own code and accept arrest. Interiority is textured through concrete embodiment (sweaty palm, chlorophyll-stained hands) and a credible tactical mind under pressure. The charming rogue aspect interacts well with the new austerity of silence. Slight limitation: internal contradiction is implied more than dramatized moment-to-moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: discovery → method → detection → emergency signal + destruction → arrest → proliferating noise that reweights the system. Closure lands with cost (imprisonment) and a conceptual repricing that the Auditors can tax thoughts but not chaotic fields. Orientation is firm early and the hybrid lens (causal action yielding an accumulative/noise outcome) holds. No major causality or setup debts.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The greenhouse and the gourd rattle seed are vivid and functional, literally shaping tactics and the climactic choice. Drones, gardens, herbs-as-lexicon, and humid insect soundscape fuse atmosphere with constraint. The final cricket song recharges setting as meaning. Detail is selective and POV-filtered rather than touristic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Pressure coheres and tightens: Auditors closing in force a decisive trade-off—preserve the code or preserve the people. The emergency “hawk” signal and destructive scramble foreclose a path with legible price. Stakes stay singular (protect the network/defiance) and escalate cleanly to an earned, consequential outcome. No soft resets or coincidence rescues.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Noise vs. signal, collectivized resilience, and the taxation of interiority emerge from concrete acts rather than thesis. The ending’s proliferation of gardens reframes meaning without over-explaining. A couple of lines edge toward statement (“They could tax a thought…”), but they’re supported by image. Resonance lingers through the cricket’s song and charged silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A confident, lyrical third-person closely tracking Lysander, with rhythms that tighten under stress. Diction is consistent with the world’s intellectual/lyric register and modulates at the climax. Dialogue is sparse but pointed (“For your nerves”), carrying subtext. No head-hopping or stance drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sentences carry multiple jobs with few redundancies and strong verbs; imagery is vivid without clogging momentum. A slight tendency toward stacked abstraction in the final third is still coherent and doesn’t blur action. Cadence varies well from humid stillness to urgent beats. Mechanics are clean and sequence is legible.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Taxable thoughts, insect linguistics, and gardens-as-code synthesize into a fresh, inevitable-feeling strategy and repricing. The gourd rattle seed as encoder and dispersal siren is an inspired specificity. Risks in concept and tone heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. The final noise-as-salvation turn is both inventive and grounded in prior particulars.</comment>
