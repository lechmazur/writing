<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s drive to “trace honest origins” is clear, embodied in tactile choices (navigating by memory, seeking the stamp) and a morally thorny final act. The internal contradiction—truth-seeking versus institutional harm—is dramatized rather than summarized. Her calm perceptual mode feels character‑particular and constrains tactics. A slightly greater on‑page visceral cost (fear of consequences, bodily stakes) could have deepened the turn.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: blackout → search for stamp → imprint → palimpsest reveal → decision to mislabel and hide. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she forecloses open disclosure now and accepts the burden of covert guardianship. Cost is legible in the final act and plan. Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph; the situational constraint of the blackout holds the lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The sunken library and blackout shape options (no logs, emergency lights, pressure‑groan), and the brass stamp functions as a charged micro‑setting/tool in the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV‑filtered (drip, settling shelf, water‑ceiling). World rules feel consistent and are learned through action. The environment directly constrains and enables the core choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth versus civic myth—tightens decisively at the palimpsest reveal, forcing a trade‑off. Pressure coheres under the blackout’s cover and her role’s responsibility. The price is moral complicity and a chosen delay; the final stamp action forecloses a path. Slightly more external friction could have intensified the squeeze.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Themes of origin, conquest, and archival complicity emerge through concrete acts (pressure imprint revealing surrender terms; flipping to “FALSE COPY”). “Reclaimed stillness” evolves from atmosphere to ethical space enabling a compromised stewardship. The ending offers a resonant, non‑literal answer: keep truth alive by hiding it now. No moralizing; complexity lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A consistent, controlled close third with a distinct perceptual signature—tranquil, precise, tactile. Elevated diction matches the archivist’s sensibility without drifting into abstraction. No dialogue needed; modulation aligns with pressure. Elision is minimal and earned.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and image‑dense with strong nouns and verbs (palimpsest, polymer, water‑ceiling). Minor repetition (“reclaimed stillness,” “dappled”) feels intentional rather than padded. Figurative control holds; no template cadence or loops. A hair more concision in a few descriptive clauses could sharpen momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The underwater archive, tactile pressure‑imprint revealing a buried surrender text, and the ethical pivot to conceal-for-preservation feel fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The antique stamp as mechanism and symbol is an ingenious turn. The piece avoids genre cliché through specific, material choices. Strong synthesis without gimmickry.</comment>
