<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Alistair’s motive (to “capture the shape of possibility”) is clear, embodied, and tested by the concrete act of unsnapping the clasps. His hesitation at the first clasp and accelerating release show credible internal conflict under pressure. The final inner shift—allegiance to release rather than power—feels earned by the on‑page ritual. Cost is conceptual more than visceral, but the renunciation of the old script reads.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Hybrid lens with accumulative texture and a causal hinge: each unsnapping intensifies pressure and culminates in a reconfigured world (“a new, blank page”). Closure lands on the page via the decisive act and the charged final image (mini‑knight self‑willed), with a felt conceptual price (“unsnap the old”). Orientation is clean and single‑scene. The cost is more metaphysical than material, but it’s legible and tied to the choice.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The greenhouse/orchard is vividly sensorial (ozone, glowing dew, equations of light) and functionally constraining: the solidified‑light clasps, the path of stones, and the tree of silver bells all gate tactics and enable the ritual. The setting charges the ending image and sustains tone throughout. World rules are learned through action, not exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear early (repeat old play vs. step into possibility). Escalation is delivered through the sequence of clasps—each release deepens tremors and synchronizes with the greenhouse “breathing.” The price is mostly a renunciation rather than a concrete loss, which softens impact slightly, but agency drives the peak turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Thematic throughline—freeing possibility by “unsnapping the old”—emerges from particulars (program → puppet → release) and reweights allegiance. The orchard’s voice avoids didacticism, though “As reality shifts, it offers a choice” edges toward overt statement. The final image (luminous idea as squire) resonates without a tidy moral. Ambiguity lingers productively.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyrical third‑person close with a distinct perceptual signature (metal, light, equations, dew) holds steady. Rhythm modulates with pressure (hesitation → faster unsnapping) and remains legible. No head‑hopping; the orchard’s nonverbal voice integrates cleanly into the POV texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is polished, image‑dense, and purposeful; sensory choices advance action and mood. A few lofty phrases risk purple, but they rarely blur sense and the cadence supports momentum. Minimal scaffold or repetition; clarity holds at the climax and ending.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—alchemical orchard, marionette program as ritual script, and “unsnapping” possibility—feels fresh and coherent. The mini‑knight’s transformation is earned by prior images rather than a late rule change. Risk‑taking in concept and diction heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
