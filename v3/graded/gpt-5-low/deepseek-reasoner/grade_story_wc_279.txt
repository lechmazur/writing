<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara’s motive (to find meaning and defuse tension) is clear and her choices (building the mandala, tapping the tile) align with being socially perceptive. Interiority is conveyed via tactile attention to sand and sound, but internal contradiction and visible cost are mild. The strangers function more as pressure than characters, yet they credibly force her nonverbal intervention. The ending shows earned endurance rather than a risky trade‑off.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural held throughout; pressure accrues via atmosphere, mandala construction, and the emergent hush, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph, and the tile’s fall sets a contained causal chain. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing (connection over single truth) with a felt hush that reweights the scene, though the cost is soft. The single‑scene arc is coherent and legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The Whispering Grotto, mist, and tile system are vivid and integrated; the space acoustically enables the hush and supplies the flake that becomes a keystone. Sensory detail is selective and POV‑filtered (sand hiss, cool tile, lilac air). The environment constrains options (silence as medium) and charges the final image. World rules (whispering tiles) stay consistent and are learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake: transform collective unease into understanding; escalation tightens when the arguing pair enters and Elara must act. The decisive act (tapping the keystone tile) halts the argument and reframes options. Costs and foreclosed paths are understated—no sharp sacrifice beyond the choice to speak through silence—keeping the pressure strong but not searing. Still, the cadence shift is clear and earned under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of meaning through connection and the fertile quiet between fragments arises from particulars (mandala geometry, hush, tile’s “listen”). The final repricing of “lilac unease” into the air “before a dawn” resonates without didactic moralizing, though the sentence stating “meaning wasn’t found in a single, perfect truth” edges toward explicitness. Subtext operates in image and sound rather than debate. The emotional after‑image is cohesive and reflective.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The lyrical third‑person close is consistent, textural, and confident; diction matches Elara’s sensory, pattern‑seeking mind. Dialogue snippets feel natural and serve pressure rather than exposition. Rhythmic control is steady, with only slight purple tendencies that don’t blur action. Psychic distance remains stable and apt.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is lush yet controlled; images work double duty (mandala as map, hush as agent). Minimal redundancy and strong verb choices sustain momentum. A few heightened phrases verge on purple, but metaphors stay coherent and integrated with setting. The final line resolves by image with a clean cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of chalk artist, whispering tiles, and a sand‑mandala‑mediated hush feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The nonverbal intercession is an original tactical choice that grows from the world’s logic. Risks are taken in committing to quiet, accumulative resolution without resorting to overt magic or heavy plot mechanics. The piece avoids template beats and offers a memorable conceptual turn.</comment>
