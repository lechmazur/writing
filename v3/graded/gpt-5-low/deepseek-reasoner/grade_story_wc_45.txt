<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s motives are precise and embodied—urgent maternal need tempered by “forgiving skepticism” and the urge to “turn mistakes into constellations.” Her relief colliding with empathy at the bassinet is a credible contradiction that guides the choice to help the Fae. Micro‑choices (probing the wrist, returning the tooth) align with character. The internal shift to a “wiser, more generous kind of knowing” is earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds cleanly: discovery → maze → negotiation → healing → exchange reweighted. Orientation is crisp from the clearing to the garden, with a single continuous scene. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—the final image reweights skepticism into acceptance with a felt, if quiet, ethical cost. The price is more conceptual than visceral, but it’s legible on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Vivid, purposeful setting—the hedge maze and silver blossoms create tactile pressure and charge the final image. World rules are learned through action (the failed vessel, the garden’s life), not exposition. The blossom as a guide back subtly functions as a tool. Constraint is present but not deeply tested beyond transit.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear (recover the child), with a meaningful tightening when Elara chooses to set the Fae’s bone before claiming the boy. The ethical trade—returning the tooth—reweights the transaction and narrows the “take and flee” option. The cost is soft but present as empathy over retribution. Tension is steady rather than harrowing, appropriate to the quiet fable mode.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Themes of skepticism, fairness, and generosity arise from action rather than sermon. The tooth and blossom shift meaning at the end, offering a non‑literal answer about reimagining certainty. A couple of lines edge toward statement (“not from a nightmare, but from a secret”), but they stem from earned moments. The afterimage lingers as acceptance with cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third‑person close maintains a consistent, lyrical yet controlled register. Dialogue is spare, natural, and carries subtext (the Fae’s sorrow, the tacit bargain). The perceptual signature (“shrewdly innocent”) shapes diction without drifting into grandiosity. Psychic distance modulates well at peak beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is tight, image‑rich, and mostly multi‑tasking; rhythm varies with pressure. Occasional elevated phrases (“nostalgic innovation”) flirt with abstraction but do not obscure sense. No significant loops or scaffold, and the closure image is clean. Figurative language is controlled and coherent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Changelings are familiar, but the bone‑setting act and the tooth‑return recast the trope with humane specificity. The “forgiving skeptic” lens and the garden’s tactile sorrow feel fresh. Risks are measured rather than radical. The synthesis is thoughtful, not groundbreaking.</comment>
