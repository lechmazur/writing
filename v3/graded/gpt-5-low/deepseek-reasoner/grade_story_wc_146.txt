<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara’s motive and method are clear, and her embodied way of “listening with her bones” gives her interior a distinct texture. The piece is light on contradictory impulses or visible internal cost beyond endurance, so complexity is limited. Still, her final committed walk reads as a credible, earned expression of her defining patience. Absence of a second on‑page character keeps relational pressure minimal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: days of calibrated walking accumulate toward the evening declaration and the town’s reply. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: echoes appear, align, then fade, leaving a charged stasis. Cost is present but soft—her restoration is fleeting, not permanent—which reweights the final quiet. Orientation is clean and single‑scene coherence holds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful: the archway functions as datum and later “remembers,” the cobbles transmit rhythm, the culvert and lintel ground labor. Sensory detail is filtered through her craft; the ebony fork as object‑as‑setting charges the final image. The environment subtly constrains tactics (she must walk the stones, use the keystone). A hair shy of 9+ only because constraint is gentle rather than a hard limit.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reviving the town’s balance—is signaled early and tightens when she shifts from diagnostic steps to a declarative rhythm. The escalation is primarily textural, but the turn to the center‑of‑square invocation is a clear agency beat. Cost clarity is modest (the revival is brief; solitude persists), yet sufficient at this length. No antagonist, but pressure coheres around endurance and ritual.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of balance between physical place and communal memory emerges through concrete acts, not thesis. The final image reweights prior details—the fork, archway, cobbles—into a shared chord that fades, implying the price of transience. No moralizing; resonance lingers in the charged quiet. The ambiguity is purposeful and earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>POV is steady and confident; diction and rhythm suit a patient craftsperson attuned to vibration. Lyric sentences stay legible, and the narrative certainty matches what she can sense. Voice modulates effectively from observational patience to incantatory cadence at the climax. No head‑hopping or unearned omniscience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is controlled and musical with high information density; images (woody tone, stones “remembering”) are vivid without muddle. Minor purple tilts never obscure sense, and repetition is purposeful rather than looped scaffold. Sentence rhythms vary to support momentum and hush. Final lines land cleanly on a charged image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The bell‑tuner reviving a town through percussive footfall is a fresh, specific synthesis. The ebony fork’s inverted acoustics and “listening by bone” feel original and necessary to the conceit. The risk is a quiet, accumulative structure, but it pays off with a distinctive closure image. Emotional truth arises from craft and endurance rather than trope.</comment>
