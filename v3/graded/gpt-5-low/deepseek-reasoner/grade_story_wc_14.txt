<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s motive is clear and consistent, and her attention-as-agency reads credibly through concrete micro-choices (closing her eyes, translating hum to line). The discovery reconfigures her understanding without contradiction. However, internal contradiction is minimal; she encounters little resistance beyond time’s narrow window. The cost is gentle (the moment passes), so her endurance/renunciation remains understated.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Orientation is strong early (who/where/when), and the accumulative/textural lens holds as hum-density escalates to visions and returns to ordinary hum at daybreak. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: the hum as carrier wave and the notepad as translator, sealed by the cadence shift at dawn. The cost is subtle but present (the window closes, the resonance recedes). Quiet but coherent causality supports the lyric turn.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The bonsai labyrinth, pagoda, and fluorescent lamp are vividly rendered and filtered through Elara’s sensibility. The setting constrains the action via dawn, isolation, and the specific lamp, charging the final image of the mapped page. Sensory economy is strong across smell, temperature, and light. World rules remain consistent and legible.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stake is focused—capture the dawn’s unique resonance—and pressure coheres around a single temporal window. Escalation occurs as the hum refracts into layered histories, then collapses back at true dawn. The felt price remains modest, with little adversarial force beyond time and attention. Still, the tightening cadence is clear and earned under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of time’s textures and the ethics of attention emerges through motif and action rather than moralizing. The final image reweights prior details, inviting reflection on perception and record. One line states the thesis overtly (“The hum was a carrier wave for time itself”), slightly reducing subtextual subtlety. Overall resonance lingers without tidy prescription.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The voice is steady, lyrical, and controlled, with a consistent close-third distance shaped by Elara’s observational bias. Diction and rhythm modulate with the intensification and settling of the hum. No head-hopping or stance drift. The lyric register remains plausible for the POV throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Line-level craft is polished: varied syntax, high information density, and purposeful imagery. Occasional elevated phrasing approaches purple but stays coherent and scene-serving. Minimal scaffolding or repetition; momentum remains intact. The final cadence is clean and image-driven.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The premise—charting a fluorescent hum at dawn to refract time—feels fresh and organically tied to character and tool. The notepad-as-translator twist is well seeded and paid off. The quiet risk is executed with confidence, avoiding gimmickry. Emotional truth is understated but specific.</comment>
