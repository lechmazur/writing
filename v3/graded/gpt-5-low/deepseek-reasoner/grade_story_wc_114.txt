<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is clear and intensifies—from fever-clear duty to physical risk to the grim acceptance of consequence. Interiority stays embodied (“baptism of ice,” the bare hand she’ll regret) and character-specific (fault tolerance vs. clarity). The contradictory impulses—despair vs. obligation—coexist in scene and drive the “margins” choice. The final endurance (sending the alert, then bearing the knowledge) reads as an earned cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: fever break → data dissonance → failed external check → principle recall → conduit verification → alert. The closure is a charged poise/earned stasis: she alters the day with the alert yet must bear the fixed cost of what she knows. Orientation is anchored early and the single transition (inside → gantry → conduit → interior) is coherent. Cost is on-page (“with seconds to spare,” the hand, the emotional anchor of the last image).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The weather station, gantry, ice, and service conduit directly constrain tactics and escalate risk; the mountain environment isn’t decorative. The botanical illustration functions as micro-setting/object charging the final image. World rules (drones, sensors, backups) are learned through action and feel plausible. Atmosphere aligns with pressure, enriching theme without stalling.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>One dominant stake (confirm or refute catastrophic flood) escalates through a concrete tightening: outside check fails, options narrow, she turns to the overlooked margin. Physical and temporal prices sharpen the choice, culminating in an alert “with seconds to spare.” Stakes remain coherent and personal even as they’re vast. The internal and external pressures interlock to the end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Themes of fragility, error tolerance vs. clarity, and systems failing at margins emerge from concrete actions, not assertion. The extinct flower illustration returns charged, reweighting the ending with loss beyond plot. The final acceptance reframes “fault-tolerance” as a human burden, not just a system spec. Ambiguity remains meaningful: she saves lives yet grieves what certainty costs.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The close third is stable, precise, and colored by a technical-professional lexicon without drift. Diction modulates with stress, maintaining a distinct perceptual signature (“auroral sorrow,” “occupying margins”). Purposeful elision (her remembered training) is paid off in action. No head-hopping or unearned omniscience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is lean yet lyrical, with varied rhythm and strong verbs; images do double duty for mood and mechanism. Minor elevated phrases (“auroral sorrow”) feel voice-true and don’t smother clarity. Repetition is purposeful, not looped scaffold. Information density and momentum remain high through the peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The fusion of a “fault-tolerant oracle” with mountain-station procedure and the “margins” heuristic is fresh and specific. The solution arises from character and training rather than a late rule. The extinct-flower motif adds an original moral calculus to a tech-forward premise. Risks in tone and concept cohere without gimmickry.</comment>
