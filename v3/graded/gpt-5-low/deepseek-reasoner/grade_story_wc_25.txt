<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara’s motives and competencies are clear and character‑particular (maps as touchstone, gait recognition as compass). Interiority is economical but present in how she navigates pressure and time. The piece lacks a live internal contradiction under stress; she rarely wavers, so cost feels light. Still, her micro‑choices (avoiding thoroughfares, going vertical, whispering via legacy wiring) align tightly with her values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clean causal line: storm scrambles comms → she leverages old wiring → uses key on manual port → whispers to the AI → receives the map. Orientation is strong from the opening, and the scene holds a single, coherent stake and window. Closure lands with a tangible outcome (AI answers; new map) that reconfigures her status. The on‑page cost is modest, lowering peak impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The container labyrinth and auroral storm are vividly rendered and constrain choices (blocked direct route, forced vertical climb, reliance on manual ports and internal cabling). Tool and environment details feel lived‑in and purposeful. The setting’s rules remain consistent and directly enable the whisper tactic. The final image is charged by place (hidden nook within the stack) without tipping into overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around a time‑boxed challenge with one meaningful tightening at the blocked T‑junction, forcing an up‑and‑in solution. Agency drives the resolution; coincidence doesn’t rescue her. The security chief’s threat remains offstage, which softens immediate stakes and cost. Escalation is present but controlled and never truly dire.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The “whispers vs. shouts” thesis is dramatized through tactics and payoff, integrating theme with action. However, the final declarative moral (“She had proven her thesis utterly true”) blunts subtext and reduces resonance. Objects (maps, coin, ancient wiring) do thematic work without overstatement. The result is strong but a shade tidy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third‑person close holds steady with a distinct perceptual signature (map‑minded, path‑bias noticing). Diction and rhythm are controlled, confident, and apt to the character’s competence. No head‑hopping or stance leakage; compression is clean. Minor flourish remains within voice plausibility.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sentences carry multiple jobs with good momentum and sensory specificity; figurative language is selective and apt. Minimal scaffolding and no notable loops or template cadences. A few heightened phrases edge toward tidy summation at the end, but clarity and propulsion hold. Mechanics are clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis—a rogue logistics AI in a container maze, whisper‑logic proven via analog infrastructure—feels fresh and coherent. Familiar heist/challenge scaffolding is re‑inflected through specific occupational tactics. The updated map as reward neatly reframes her identity. Risk is measured rather than radical, but the integration is elegant.</comment>
