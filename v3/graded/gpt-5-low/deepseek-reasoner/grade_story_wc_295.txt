<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s goal is clear from the first line and her choices (seeking Alaric, decoding, then using the dream‑lens) align with it. Interiority is present and tactile (the floral telegram against cold stone), though her struggle feels consistently low‑friction and largely competent. The brother relationship is motivating but functions mostly as an off‑page pressure rather than a crucible. The final shift to “chronicler of shared history” is earned but the cost to her is lightly felt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The causal chain is clean: telegram → star method → conceptual click → dream‑message → evacuation confirmed. The closure lands via Decisive Change/Conceptual Repricing—temples redefined as events and the city’s fear recast—though the decisive consequence (evacuation) occurs off‑stage. Orientation is strong early; the single transition is legible. The lack of a sharper on‑page price at the end limits impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The observatory’s brass, oak, and instruments are vivid and purpose‑driven; the tools enable the crucial decoding and dream‑message. Sensory choices (scented telegram, cold stone, old metal) are selective and character‑filtered. The setting constrains tactics: she must move from dream‑lens to celestial wing to solve it. The final tower view recharges the world without feeling postcard‑static.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes are clear (prevent a cataclysm, save Kael), and pressure escalates from private vigilance to urgent decoding to intervention. However, obstacles are minimal; Alaric supplies the key without resistance and the send‑message action faces no friction. The major price is conceptual rather than felt on the page. The tightening exists but doesn’t bite.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Shared burden shifting into shared history is a coherent, resonant thematic arc. Stars as language and healing through words entwine elegantly without overt moralizing. The final image of the city’s altered dreams provides a quiet, earned thematic answer. Slight neatness in the “burden lifted” telegram limits ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The voice is lucid, lyrical, and controlled, with a consistent POV; diction suits the observatory’s contemplative midnight mood. Dialogue is sparse but efficient and distinct (Alaric’s aphoristic cadence versus Elara’s directness). No head‑hopping or stance drift. Rhythm modulates well around the revelation beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is polished with strong image economy; lines often do double duty (setting as character lens). Figurative language is present but not overgrown, and syntax varies with good momentum. Minimal scaffold or loops; transitions are clean. A few elevated turns verge on tidy rather than tensile, but clarity remains high.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The telescope aimed at dreams, variable stars as inscriptions, and a scented telegram are a fresh synthesis. The temple‑as‑event reframing feels non‑obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Risk is taken with a quiet, conceptual closure that avoids spectacle. Slight conventionality in the off‑stage success tempers the daring.</comment>
