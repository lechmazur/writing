<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Kaelen’s motive (escape paralysis to become whole) is clear and pressure-tested through concrete micro‑choices: recoiling, holding his ground, then actively welcoming the torrent. The internal contradiction (hollow calm vs. overwhelming feeling) is dramatized rather than summarized. Rin’s pressure functions as a crucible without softening truths. A slight on‑the‑nose tendency in her didactic lines trims the ceiling.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal. Each step links cleanly—Rin frames the task; touch triggers raw memory; calm-as-bowl tactic enables welcoming the torrent; integration lands with tears and the jar going dark. Closure is a decisive change with felt cost, reconfiguring options (numbness foreclosed). The single-scene arc remains coherent and anchored.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The floating obsidian dojo in a “screaming aether” is vivid and purpose-driven: an anchor outside time enabling the integration. The brain-in-jar micro-setting charges the final image when it goes dark. The world’s rewrite briefly halting meaningfully mirrors/marks his internal shift. A hair shy of 9+ because environment constrains tactics implicitly more than explicitly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early (overcome numbness via custody/integration) and tightens when the memory-barrage forces a stance. The key turn—choosing to contain then welcome the storm—narrows options by sacrificing his anesthetic shield. Cost is visible (tears, relived grief/joy) and directly earned by his agency. No extraneous reversals dilute the pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of integration through complementary opposites emerges from action (calm as bowl, storm as water) and culminates in a resonant re-weighting when the world stills. The “neglected child” and “custody” frame deepens the moral calculus without sermonizing. A touch of aphoristic instruction from Rin edges toward didacticism, slightly muting subtextive ambiguity. The final image invites reflection beyond the scene.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and filtered through Kaelen’s sensibility, with a measured lyric register that holds under stress. Dialogue functions as action, with Rin’s concise lines applying pressure and subtext (no comfort, only truth). Diction and rhythm modulate well at the climax. Occasional aphoristic polish keeps it a notch below singularly distinctive voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is tight, clear, and propulsive; sentences do more than one job and avoid scaffolding. A few high-register metaphors (“grief so deep it could drown stars”) verge on familiar, but they don’t obscure causality or the closure image. Rhythm varies naturally, and paragraphing supports escalation. No material artifacts or loops dull momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis—ego-death survivor integrating a labeled brain duplicate in a time-anchored dojo—feels fresh and thematically coherent. “Custody battle” reframed as self-integration is a sharp conceptual turn. The Zen‑master dynamic is familiar, but specific world choices and the charged object avoid template drift. Risk is real and lands without gimmickry.</comment>
