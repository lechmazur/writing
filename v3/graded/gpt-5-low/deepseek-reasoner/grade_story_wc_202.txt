<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear, character‑particular interiority and motive (“translator of things unseen,” “to honor overlooked histories”) drive choices across the scene. Micro‑choices—bartering a story, following the pull, aiming at anguish—align with that ethic. Internal tension (adrift intuition vs. compulsion to release the story) is present but mild; pressure never fractures her certainty. The ending’s identity shift to “keeper of their light” feels earned, though the on‑page cost remains largely conceptual.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Hybrid drive leaning accumulative: sensory and symbolic density builds toward the activation of the lens, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration (“no longer just a translator, but a keeper”). Causality holds—intuition pull → stall → painting → choice to release—and the charged final image lands on the page. Cost is implied (taking on the burden of others’ histories) rather than dramatized in consequence, keeping it shy of the top band. Orientation is clean and the single-scene scope is tight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The market in the sky is vivid (“ozone, rare herbs, metallic tang”) and filtered through the narrator’s sensibility, and the lens functions as a charged tool. Space is coherent (bridges, canvas‑shrouded stall) and integrated with action (the pull off the main thoroughfare). The environment enables and colors tactics rather than constraining them, but the object‑as‑setting (lens) decisively charges the final image. Economy of detail is strong with multisensory texture.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (re‑anchoring intuition/honoring hidden histories) is signaled early and tightens when the narrator chooses to “unfasten” the moment. Escalation is largely internal and accumulative, peaking at the activation and “eternal instant.” The cost is felt but not sharply priced on the page, so tension never fully bites. Still, agency at the climax is clear and resolves the pressure credibly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme integrates through image and action: translation as stewardship, light as witnessed history, anchor as ethical mooring. The lighthouse lens reweights the premise at the end without moralizing; the final acceptance reframes the narrator’s vocation. A few early declaratives verge on thesis (“understanding is the highest form of honor”), but the climax earns the insight. Resonance lingers via the keeper’s burden rather than a tidy moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A confident, lyrical first‑person voice with a distinct perceptual signature (“compass that pointed to regret,” “metallic tang of possibility”) remains consistent under pressure. Diction suits a translator‑poet consciousness without drifting into opaque ornament. Minimal dialogue is clean and character‑revealing. Psychic distance modulates well at the climax without head‑hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lines carry multiple jobs with strong image economy; rhythm varies and momentum holds. A few purple touches (“metallic tang of possibility”) graze cliché, but most metaphor is fresh and coherent. No paraphrase loops or scaffold clutter, and the peak beat reads cleanly. Syntax and punctuation are controlled with clear sequencing.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis—alchemist’s market, bartering a dead‑language story, a lighthouse lens as mnemonic key, and paintings as temporal locks—feels singular. Turns arise from the narrator’s ethic and trained seeing, not late rule drops. The “eternal instant” is a strong risk that pays off. Only the lightly priced cost keeps it from the topmost band.</comment>
