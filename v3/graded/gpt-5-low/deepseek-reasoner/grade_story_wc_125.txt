<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Kael’s drive (“to discover the texture of time”) is clear and consistent, and his ethically playful bent is dramatized through his pattern‑making and ultimate renunciation. Interiority is concrete (heart rhythm, ache from the mandala) and contradictory impulses clash on the page. The final refusal feels earned and costly. A slight tilt toward abstract summarizing at the end trims the peak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single‑scene Situational lens holds: the grotto encounter coheres toward a forced stance once the vision frames the cost. Closure lands on the page via an Earned Stasis choice (unmaking the key) with explicit cost (forfeiting his life’s desire). Orientation is crisp from the outset; no causality breaks. The price shapes the final image (rope left on altar) cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The terra‑cotta grotto, pedestal, and rope are specific, tactile, and charged through action. The rope-as-object functions as micro‑setting that constrains choice and charges the final image. Atmosphere (twin moons, contained lightning) supports theme without postcard excess. World rules are learned through observation (light‑language) rather than exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early and tightens decisively when the vision reframes the rope as a key with catastrophic consequence. The ethical calculus is sharp, forcing a trade‑off between knowledge and erasure of a hopeful lineage. Resolution comes from Kael’s agency with a felt price. Minor modesty: stakes remain conceptual rather than viscerally embodied in the erased lives.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—knowledge versus responsibility—emerges organically from the rope, grotto, and light‑language patterning. The final renunciation reweights the premise effectively, but the last lines state the moral (“not a fabric to be felt, but a responsibility to be held”) a bit overtly. Subtext otherwise operates in images (unmade pattern, quiet starlight exit). The piece invites reflection without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third‑person close remains steady with a lyrical yet controlled diction that matches Kael’s sensibility. Rhythm modulates well from hushed discovery to charged choice. No head‑hopping or stance leakage; inference reads as inference. A few abstract notes near the end slightly flatten the otherwise distinct texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sentences carry multiple jobs (imagery, stakes, character) with clean momentum; minimal scaffold. Figurative language is vivid but mostly restrained and legible at peak beats. No loops or cadence templates dull the closure beat. A touch of abstraction in the concluding aphoristic lines prevents a higher mark.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Energy beings as concept‑language and a rope as time‑key synthesize into a fresh ethical dilemma delivered through patterning. The poet’s playful ethics and tactile pattern work feel specific rather than templated. The final reconfiguration grows inevitably from planted elements. Not radically experimental, but confidently singular.</comment>
