<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elara’s pacifist ethic, rooted against her bounty‑hunter father’s legacy, motivates concrete choices: she stands her ground, instructs “You must sheathe that,” and offers the rose. Her embodied fear (“senselessly perceptive dread”) coexists with calm action, showing credible contradiction. The soldier reads as a human pressure rather than a prop, though his interiority stays thin by design. The final gift of the rose enacts her values rather than declaring them, earning the endurance choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Situational lens holds: intruder breaches sanctuary; Elara’s stance shapes options; the blade’s sheathing marks the decisive change; the ending image reweights the world’s chaos against her cultivated order. Orientation is clean from the first paragraph. Cost is modest but legible—the risk of refusing violence and committing to pacifist continuity under threat. The cadence tightens once (crack → confrontation → surrender) and lands in a charged stasis.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The dome, climate hum, irrigated mist, and desert roses are vivid, selective, and POV‑filtered; details serve tension and theme rather than catalog. The enclosure’s engineered tranquility directly constrains behavior, pressing the soldier toward sheathing. Recurring objects (bone slivers, roses) charge the final image without over-symbolizing. World rules stay consistent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve a nonviolent sanctuary—clarifies early and tightens with the airlock breach and armed entry. The key turn is the enforced sheathing, which forecloses immediate violence and affirms Elara’s ethic. Prices are mostly conceptual/emotional; we don’t see a hard loss, but the risk and renunciation are clear. Tension sustains through to the gift of the rose, though escalation remains single‑step.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme—continuity through pacifism and the courage to begin again—emerges through concrete acts (engraving “quiet,” disarming by atmosphere, offering the rose) rather than abstract sermon. A few lines edge toward direct statement (“This one understands courage”), but the images carry most of the weight. The final harvest metaphor and charged bloom reframe courage as stillness. Subtext in the father/daughter counterline enriches without overt moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>A consistent close third through Elara yields a controlled, lyrical register that tightens under pressure. Dialogue is sparse, functional, and subtextual (“There is no place for it here” does multiple jobs). Diction fits the character’s sensibility and world; no head‑hopping or stance drift. Rhythm modulates effectively between hush and urgency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is clean, with varied syntax and purposeful imagery; metaphorical choices (“tranquil blaze,” “missing tooth”) are apt and not over-stacked. Momentum never stalls; reflection is brief and anchored in present action. Minor lushness (“senselessly perceptive”) skirts purple but remains coherent. No loops or scaffolding artifacts dull the closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The fusion of carved bone virtues, a glass‑domed desert rose farm, and a pacifist disarming a soldier via cultivated atmosphere feels fresh and integrated. The “inculcating plants with values” conceit is distinctive and functionally used. The turn—courage as stillness rather than combat—lands as a non‑obvious revaluation. Risk is aesthetic and thematic rather than structural, but it pays off.</comment>
