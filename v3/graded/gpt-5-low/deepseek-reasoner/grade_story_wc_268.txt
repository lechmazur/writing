<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, and her scholar-warrior temperament reads specific and coherent. Micro‑choices (selecting the folio, activating the pellet, focusing on “the idea of the pretender”) align with her values. However, internal conflict is minimal; she proceeds with near-total composure and competence, limiting felt risk. The endurance cost is gestured at (spent rune, ongoing quest) but not psychologically pressed in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: clue → activation → rune → targeted unraveling → spent ink, with a clean two‑shard delivery (library to court). Closure is decisive—the lie collapses on the page—and the cost registers in the rune’s expenditure and the still‑empty throne. Orientation is crisp from the opening line, and set‑ups pay off without teleports. Pressure could tighten further pre‑act, but the structure remains elegant and legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The temple library is sensorially vivid (“dust‑choked,” “ozone and slow decay,” “leviathan hide”) and functions as a resource and constraint. The object-as-setting (pellet, folio, shelves) tangibly channels action and charges the final image (dried pool, returned book). World rules emerge through use rather than exposition. The atmosphere of dignified ruin coheres with the act and aftermath.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—unmasking the pretender—is signaled early and resolved by Elara’s chosen tactic. Escalation arrives as a single precise intensification when she applies the rune, but resistance is minimal and no option is foreclosed beyond the spent rune. The cost is present yet modest; there’s little in-scene jeopardy or reversal. The quiet dismantling is conceptually satisfying but low-pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: truth’s patient, subtle force versus spectacle; knowledge as weapon; authority unmasked without violence. The “graceful collapse” image reweights prior material and lingers without moralizing. The still‑empty throne adds ethical ambiguity and consequence. Greater friction between method and desire could deepen the thematic charge.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The voice is controlled, elevated, and consistent with a mythic, scholarly POV; diction choices (“regally unpretentious,” “graceful collapse”) suit the world. Focalization stays tight to Elara while allowing one cutaway to the court that reads as deliberate and legible. Rhythm modulates well at the climax, favoring clarity over ornament. No head‑hopping or stance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is lush yet largely precise; images often carry dual loads (tone and function). Occasional density risks purple, but clarity persists, and repetition (“pause of shifting constellations”) functions as motif rather than filler. Momentum is maintained through purposeful sentences with minimal scaffold. The final cadence lands cleanly on a recharged image (spent rune, returned folio).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis—a diminutive titan using saliva to awaken iron‑gall ink and a rune that unweaves deception at a distance—is fresh and specific. The off‑stage collapse rendered as quiet unmaking rather than spectacle feels non‑obvious and earned. Risks in tone and texture pay off without obscuring clarity. Minor conventional beats (ancient library quest) are transformed by tactility and restraint.</comment>
