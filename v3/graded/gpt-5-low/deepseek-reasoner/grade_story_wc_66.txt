<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s motives are precise and character‑specific: a copyist who risks herself nightly to revive outlawed stories through dust. Interiority is embodied through concrete actions (cloaking the window, tuning the radio, listening to the radiator’s hum). The arc from “teach” to “translate” is credible and earned. Internal contradiction is minimal, so pressure reads more devotional than conflicted.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of nightly secrecy → sign‑off clue → recalibrated listening → breakthrough. Orientation is clean from the outset; the closure is a Conceptual Repricing where the job shifts from instruction to translation with the cost of ongoing clandestinity. The pirate’s line functions as a decisive hinge. Stakes are quiet but coherent and paid in endurance and risk.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The ember alcove, mist, and luminous dial integrate with action and tone, constraining tactics (cloaking, secrecy) and charging the final image. Sensory selection is purposeful (radiator hum, pen scratch, floorboard sigh). The environment mirrors the thematic silence vs. song without forcing symbol. Strong object‑as‑setting reprise in the ending cadence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—smuggling narrative back into the world—tightens via the pirate’s cryptic method that shifts tactics from telling to listening. Escalation is mostly internal and procedural; the felt danger of the regime remains atmospheric rather than tested in scene. The hinge moment reweights options effectively. Cost is implied endurance and risk, not an acute on‑page hit.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of listening as resistance and memory as ambient resource emerges organically from particulars (silences between notes, the dust’s “faint, melodic hum”). The final image reweights the world’s silence with a steady, defiant practice—no moralizing. Subtext of art versus censorship accrues through ritual and tool, not thesis. The “conduit, not teacher” turn lands with quiet authority.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Controlled, lyrical third closely tethered to Elara’s perception; rhythm modulates with discovery. Diction is consistent, with memorable phrasings (“thistled calm,” “secretly luminous”) that suit the world. No head‑hopping or register drift. Elision is purposeful and paid off by the sign‑off pivot.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished: images carry double duty (atmosphere and function), syntax varies, and there’s no scaffolding or synonym loops. Figurative language is vivid yet coherent and does not swamp clarity. Cadence accelerates at the hinge and softens at closure. Final sentence efficiently recharges the motif network.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>“Teaching dust to tell stories” via pirate‑taught listening is a fresh, specific synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. The radio’s clandestine sun and the method of hearing silences elevate beyond trope. Risks a quiet, concept‑driven closure and earns it. The piece commits fully to its premise without hedging.</comment>
