<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation—protecting vulnerable voices—remains clear and consistent, and her curiosity catalyzes the decision to move from easing a passing to exposing a crime. Interiority is specific enough (“a chill and a pull behind the ribs,” filtering out the world) though true contradiction is mild. The micro‑choice to promise justice under time pressure reads earned. The visible cost is more conceptual (accepting duty) than embodied, but it lands.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Clean causal chain under a Causal drive: dead call → photograph anchor → hearing aid whisper → tile → box → release. Orientation is firm within the first movements, and no props teleport. Closure is on‑page: the spirit’s release and Elara’s vow to speak, with a felt conceptual cost. Slightly low resistance prevents a higher score, but the decisive change is unmistakable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The derelict botanical atrium is vividly realized, with mist, shattered panes, and mossed tile integrated into action. Objects (photograph, hearing aid, loose tile, rusted box) function as micro‑setting constraints that guide tactics and charge the ending. Sensory texture is balanced and filtered through Elara’s professional bias. The environment subtly mirrors the release—“reeling hush” to “peaceful quiet”—without overstatement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (release the spirit by uncovering buried proof) is signaled early and tightened by the fading signal and fragmented whisper. Escalation proceeds through a meaningful deepening: from static to plea to discovery, narrowing options as the voice dissolves. The cost is a commitment rather than loss, but it reweights the final image. Lack of a counterforce beyond entropy keeps pressure from peaking higher.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Themes of witness, memory’s burden, and duty emerge from particulars (the photograph reweighted to “just a photograph”). Subtext operates in the “incidental heroism” shift and the mist’s tonal transition. A touch of overt statement in the coda (“It was who she was”) risks telling, but the preceding image work earns it. The ending offers a resonant, non‑literal answer: listening transforms into speaking.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>A coherent, lyrical third‑person close voice with a distinct perceptual signature (“reeling hush,” “sob of pure energy”). Dialogue is minimal and purposeful, with indirection through the device. The register stays stable and apt for the piece’s gothic‑noir mood. Rhythmic control is strong without head‑hopping or stance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is tight and vivid; sentences carry multiple jobs without scaffolding. Figurative language is frequent but controlled, rarely slipping into purple, and rhythm modulates with pressure. Small phrases (“sob of pure energy”) flirt with abstraction yet remain legible in context. No loops or template cadences stall momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The “contact tracer for hearts” and the brass/Bakelite hearing aid as divining tool in a ruined glasshouse feel fresh. The cover‑up angle is familiar, but the method and tonal treatment make it distinctive. The final repricing—listening turned to testimony—feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk is measured and coherent, not gimmicky.</comment>
