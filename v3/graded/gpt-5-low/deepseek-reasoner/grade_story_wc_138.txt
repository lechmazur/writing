<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Eliana’s core want—to learn what comes after goodbye—is clear and drives her choice to step into the vortex. Interiority is specific (boredom shading into “intrigue”) but shows limited contradiction or struggle at the moment of commitment. The cost is felt conceptually more than emotionally, with little embodied hesitation. Still, actions align cleanly with motive, and the final shift in stance reads earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: solar storm → amulet resonance via magnetic fields → spatial mutiny → her choice → experiential revelation → reentry with changed understanding. The single transition is legible, and closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with an implied cost (surrender of mystery, reorientation of self). Orientation is strong from the outset. The hybrid lens (causal frame, accumulative payoff) holds through the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The prismatic escondite, the storm, and the vortex are vividly rendered and integrated with action rather than postcarded. Environment and object shape events (geometry rebelling; storm seepage; fragment as catalyst) and charge the final image (silent relic on the shelf). Sensory selection is purposeful and filtered through Eliana’s long-worn indifference breaking into notice. World rules feel consistent within the fabulist register.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is focused and escalates once: the storm’s intrusion forces a decision that narrows options and risks obliteration. The internal and external pressures cohere, and the commitment moment is clear. The price is more conceptual than visceral, which slightly mutes tension. Nonetheless, agency drives the turn and reweights her options at the end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Themes of return, translation of energy, and witnesshood emerge organically through images (solar wind, background radiation, inert relic). However, the final paragraph states the thesis explicitly (“After goodbye was not an end, but a transformation”), damping subtext. The resonance remains, but the spelled-out moral narrows ambiguity. The best moments let the images carry meaning without explanation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>A controlled, elevated lyric voice suits an ancient perspective and stays consistent in stance and distance. Diction and rhythm modulate with pressure (from languor to charged description to quiet). No head-hopping, and inference remains within the POV’s plausible grasp given her stated awareness. A few ornate stretches flirt with purple but do not break clarity or tone.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and largely efficient, with strong verbs and concrete images; information density stays high. Some stacked modifiers and intensifiers (“a thousand forgotten suns,” “a cacophony of realities”) push toward overwriting, and a few phrases repeat function without adding pressure. Rhythm varies well across beats and lands a clean final image. Copy is clean and sequencing is clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>“Bored immortal” is familiar, yet the prismatic escondite, magnetic-field catalyst, and “spatial mutiny” inflect it with freshness. The after-goodbye reframing is graceful if not revelatory. Integration of science-tinged mechanics with mythic tone reads cohesive, not gimmicky. The piece takes a measured risk in marrying lyric density to a tight causal arc and mostly succeeds.</comment>
