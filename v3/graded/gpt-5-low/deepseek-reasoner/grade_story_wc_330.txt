<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—interpreting silence as possibility and completing lost work—is clear and consistent, and her micro-choices (stopping, entering, touching, singing, then taking up tools) align. However, internal contradiction is minimal; she rarely resists or doubts, so pressure doesn’t expose layered impulses. The compulsion to sing is effective but reads more fated than contested. The final choice to begin carving is earned but carries a soft, largely conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece coheres: discovery → chime → fragment → song → vision → charged decision. Orientation is strong from the first paragraph, and the closure lands as a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: she commits to finish the horse. The cost (time, purpose-binding, inheritance of another’s dream) is present but understated. The causal throughline is clean even while leaning into lyric escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The abandoned circus train, wind bells, mist, and tools are vividly rendered and filtered through a craftsperson’s eye. The environment directly charges the final image (bench, chisel, mallet; wind bells cue the time pocket; fragment light). Sensory balance across sight, touch, sound, and even humidity is precise without cataloguing. A minor risk of lushness never impedes clarity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes center on whether Elara remains a scavenger or becomes the finisher of a haunted work; escalation is a density increase (bells → glowing fragment → vision) that culminates in her choice to carve. The singing reweights the situation and narrows options toward acceptance of responsibility. The price remains mostly implied, not directly felt on page. Still, the tightening is credible and motivated.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Resonance grows from restoration, inheritance of abandoned dreams, and silence as latent possibility. The return image (tools’ tap-tap-tap) answers the opening hush with making, not moralizing, though lines like “not an end, but a beginning” skim close to thesis. The halo fragment’s light reconfigures meaning without heavy explanation. Overall, the piece invites reflection without flattening complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The close third-person voice is steady, textured, and appropriately lyrical for the subject; diction feels consistent with a quiet, tactile craftsperson. Rhythm varies well, and the lyric intensity is controlled through the pivotal beats. No POV slippage or over-explaining. A few heightened phrases edge toward purple but remain voice-justified.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The prose is polished with strong imagery (“slain beasts,” “misting hush,” “whispering gleam”) and purposeful sentence rhythm. A touch of adjective stacking and a couple of near-redundancies (hush/quiet repeats) slightly inflate density but don’t stall momentum. Information density is high; each paragraph advances mood and action. Mechanics are clean and the final line lands musically.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The blend of a carousel carpenter, an abandoned circus train, and a numinous halo fragment activated by song feels fresh and specific. The “wrong turn to fate” trope is re-energized by the craft focus and the accumulative hush-as-agency. The visionary beat with the prior carpenter deepens originality without becoming tropey flashback. Risks are purposeful and cohere.</comment>
