<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara’s altruism motivates every beat, culminating in a credible, costly sacrifice. Interiority is lyrical but light on contradictory impulses; we seldom see her doubt or selfish reflex complicate tactics. The “brambled” hope image gives texture to feeling without therapy‑speak. Kael functions more as an externalized competency than a pressured character, which limits relational crucible depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Causal chain is clear: chalk guidance → reexamination → repair → chime → insufficient water → Elara’s sacrifice → nebular remedy. Closure lands with on‑page cost (Elara’s dissolution) and decisive world change. The late cosmological rule (spirit particles + ring minerals = healing nebula) edges toward convenience but is thematically and diegetically seeded enough not to break causality. Orientation is clean from the outset.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The orchard planet, rose‑quartz arches, and ancient irrigation bell are vivid, selective, and used tactically. The environment constrains and enables choices (subterranean network, vibration‑responsive design), and the ring/mineral ecology charges the final image. Details feel filtered through the ghost’s sensibility, sustaining tone. No white‑room slippage or static postcard description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (save the trees/community) is signaled early and escalates coherently: discovery and repair give way to “too little, too late,” forcing a costly final act. The reversal from triumph to insufficiency is effective and narrows options to sacrifice. Slight softening comes from the quasi‑deus‑ex nebula, though it is earned by Elara’s agency. The price—her dissolution—reads on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Themes of communal interdependence, unseen guidance, and becoming “the garden” emerge through bell, chalk, and sacrifice motifs. However, the last paragraph explains the thesis directly (“They finally understood… They were strangers no longer”), edging into moralizing and reducing lingering ambiguity. The subtext otherwise rides the recurring objects well. Emotional aftereffect is present but slightly managed by the explicit takeaway.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and confident; the lyric diction fits a ghostly consciousness and modulates under pressure. The narrative resists head‑hopping and maintains plausible knowledge boundaries. Rhythm varies and carries scene pressure cleanly. A few elevated phrases brush purple, but control holds.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is polished, with strong images (“hope a brambled thing,” “twin suns painted the floating arches”). Sentences do more than one job and propel action with minimal scaffolding or loops. Figurative language is frequent but coherent, avoiding mixed metaphors or clog. No copy or cadence artifacts dull the closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—an altruistic ghost orchestrating a community via chalk to resurrect an ancient irrigation bell, then transmuting into a healing nebula—is fresh and specific. The bell’s vibration logic and ring‑mineral payoff feel idiosyncratic rather than generic SF garnish. The risk of a late magical save is mitigated by character‑rooted cost. Memorable details and an earned final image elevate beyond template.</comment>
