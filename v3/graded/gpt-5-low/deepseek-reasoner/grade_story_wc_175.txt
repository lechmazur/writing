<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s motives are clear and character‑specific (esoteric realist honoring overlooked histories), and her micro‑choices under pressure (anchoring silk, levering the thorn) reveal values and calm against dread. The embodied contradiction—performing steadiness while fearing a wing tear—reads true. The only limitation is a light cost profile; her competence mostly carries the day without a deeper personal price.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: altar → sighting → crack interrupts → entanglement → silk‑knot tactic → release → resonant marker left behind. Closure lands on the page with a Decisive Change (the butterfly freed) and a resonant reconfiguration (the knot as unrecorded history). Cost is felt but modest, leaning conceptual over concrete.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The grotto’s thorn, web filament, cliff, and mist shape tactics and peril; the environment constrains her options and dictates the delicate solution. Recurring objects (cairn, moth wing, knot) charge the final image. Vivid sensory work consistently filtered through her priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible early (witness/honor the last monarch) and escalates with the crack and entanglement. The tightening forces a precise, high‑risk tactic (knot/lever) rather than brute intervention. The price paid is primarily risk and interrupted reverie rather than a lasting loss.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Monarch vs. moth wing, signal vs. silence, and transient roots accrue into a quiet ethic of care without sermonizing. The ending reweights the motif—an unrecorded knot as history—offering a resonant, non‑literal answer to the stated aim. Subtext of equivalently vital nocturnal histories is deft.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a distinct lyrical texture—measured, image‑driven, and controlled under stress. Rhythm tightens appropriately during the rescue, then breathes at the end. No head‑hopping or stance drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished, with strong verbs and purposeful imagery (“a different kind of knot, not for binding, but for building a bridge”). Occasional lushness (“blushing stillness”) repeats but does not blur action or causality. Momentum holds through the rescue without scaffold or loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The rescue via a silk‑anchored “bridge” and the altar‑as‑signal produce a fresh synthesis of lyric and practical ingenuity. The esoteric realist lens feels singular rather than templated. Quiet risk‑taking in tone and structure heightens resonance without obscuring clarity.</comment>
