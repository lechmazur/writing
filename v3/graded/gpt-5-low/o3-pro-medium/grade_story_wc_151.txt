<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Mirielle’s motive—seeking meaning in margins—drives concrete micro-choices (copying the glyph motions, refusing to witness the delivery). Her interiority is particular and embodied through sensory-tuned noticing rather than labels. The archivist’s aphoristic presence applies pressure that widens her vocation without feeling contrived. Stakes remain quiet, but the renunciation and vocational pivot read earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: details and motifs accrue toward a conceptual repricing when Mirielle realizes the emoticons are keys and reframes her vocation. Orientation is crisp early; one continuous scene with a clear cadence shift around “This will be my last letter.” The cost is a modest but legible renunciation and the weight of the promise (“Your margins will finish my work”). Causality is soft but coherent under the chosen lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The golden arcade and dawn light are not ornamental: UV glyphs can be seen only in that light, and the mail slot environment produces the charged pause. Texture is rich yet purposeful (ozone, bakery steam, drones vs. surface mail). Recurring objects (clipboard, chalk, slot) are integrated into action and the final image. Setting shapes tactics and tone at key beats.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Pressure rises through the archivist’s “last letter,” the impossible address, and the ritualized pause before mailing, culminating in Mirielle’s refusal and reframing. The dominant stake—will she glean a code to widen her margins-vocation—tightens via the chalk/UV method. Costs remain conceptual and quiet rather than acute, limiting peak intensity. Still, escalation is coherent and sufficient for the form.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme—margins eclipsing text, anonymity as shelter, preservation versus speed—emerges through objects and ritual rather than thesis. The final shift to “drafting sentiments” reweights prior motifs and avoids tidy moralizing. One line (“Because margins have grown louder than texts”) veers toward explicit statement but is supported by scene. Subtext in the chalk/emoticon keys lands with resonant aftereffect.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The lyric third-person close is controlled and distinctive, with sensory and conceptual precision aligned to Mirielle’s gaze. Dialogue is elevated but motivated by character and setting; the archivist’s idiom contrasts credibly with Mirielle’s. Psychic distance remains stable; no head-hopping or helpful-narrator intrusions. Rhythm modulates cleanly around the hush and the mailing beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is lush yet disciplined; most images carry double duty (e.g., “futuristic nostalgia,” molten gold into typeface). Minimal scaffolding; momentum holds across long sentences with varied cadence. A few metaphor stacks approach density but stay coherent and on-voice. The final line crystallizes image and intention without purple drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Concepts—pseudonym seller, obsolete emoticon chalk as cipher keys, UV dawn legibility, surface mail as slow poetry—feel singular and integrated. The archivist’s “Palimpsest” angle is apt without feeling clever for its own sake. The closing reconfiguration is surprising yet inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking heightens coherence and tone rather than obscuring it.</comment>
