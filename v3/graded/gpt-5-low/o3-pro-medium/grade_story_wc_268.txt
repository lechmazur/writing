<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivations are clean and consistent (Lysar’s vow; Selestine’s devotion to ordered truth), and actions track. However, interior contradiction and embodied emotional texture are minimal; it reads more mythic-summarized than in-scene felt. The alliance forms credibly, and Lysar’s renunciatory fade has cost, but we don’t see complex internal struggle under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal chain is strong: cryptic warnings → Selestine’s discovery → proclamation tilt → Hall of Mirrors sunder. The closure lands decisively with a reconfigured political reality and visible social cost (kneeling vertigo, shattered mirrors, empty throne). Minor convenience in Selestine “stumbling upon” the rune is acceptable within the taught logic and doesn’t undercut the because/therefore flow.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The library, scriptorium, and Hall of Mirrors are vivid, specific, and functionally used—mirrors amplify the climactic sunder, and the library’s temporal oddity shapes Lysar’s tactics. Details like iron gall pellets, verdigris chains, and “glassy Hall of Mirrors” ground atmosphere and action. The environment clearly charges the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unmask the pretender) is clear and escalates from sub-rosa marginalia to public destabilization to on‑stage rupture. Agency drives the turns (Lysar’s speech; Selestine’s pellet) and forecloses a path (the pretender’s legitimacy). The cost is social and symbolic rather than personal-wounding, but it’s legible and sufficient at this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The theme—truth as gravitational lens vs. lie-induced distortion—emerges through mirrors, ink, and the “crown as lens” metaphor. Lysar’s speech flirts with didacticism yet serves the moment by operationalizing the thematic logic that powers the sunder. The final empty throne and summoned shepherd reweight earlier images without a neat moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical omniscient voice maintains consistency and cadence, with deft image economy (“crown fashioned of river stones,” “rune of drift”). Distance and stance are stable; elision is purposeful and paid off. No dialogue demands, and rhythm adapts at the climax without losing clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Line-level craft is polished with high information density and purposeful figurative language; the mirrors/ink/rune metaphors are coherent. There’s slight luxuriance that risks purple in places, but momentum holds and there are no paraphrase loops or muddled vehicles. The closing cadence is clean and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis feels fresh: a diminutive titan leveraging marginalia and a “rune of drift” to reframe reality via mirrors. The world-logic is particular (iron gall as seed, extinct winds glossaries) and the final reconfiguration feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in conceit and texture heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
