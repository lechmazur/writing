<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Amber’s motives and values are embodied through concrete micro‑choices (closing vents, sheathing the knife, offering virtues), and the father–daughter dynamic reframes her pacifism under pressure. The scars on her palms and Cullin’s tool‑swap to a watering can reveal character without speechifying. Internal conflict is present but tidy; her nonviolence never meaningfully wavers after the sheathing beat. The reconciliation lands, though the ease of the council’s softening reduces visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Orientation is swift and clean (dome, desert rose rows, Pushkar Frontier), and cause-and-effect holds: debris → message → warning → convoy → nonviolent demonstration → negotiation. Closure is on‑page with a felt reconfiguration (glass unbroken; he stays), under a Situational lens. The cost is implied rather than paid (risk of requisition/draft), and the leader’s turn is a touch convenient but not implausible. One continuous arc with a clear tightening through the convoy arrival.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The glass dome’s fragility and the roses’ presence shape tactics and outcome; vents, scars in the glass, and concentric pots are practical, charged details. World rules are learned through action, and the desert atmosphere permeates sensory choices without tourist cataloging. Recurring objects (canvas, labeled cuttings) evolve meaning and charge the ending. Strong integration without bloating exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve dome/continuity) is early and coherent, with escalation at the convoy’s arrival and a strategic pivot to demonstration. The sheathing beat credibly forecloses violent options and narrows tactics to the rose‑based plan. The outcome is earned by Amber’s stance rather than coincidence. Still, the resolution asks for only modest sacrifice in-scene, tempering peak pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Themes of continuity versus fear and nonviolence as active craft arise from particulars (engraved quiet, labeled virtues, Cullin’s reorientation). Subtext works through gesture and objects rather than moralizing; “remind us why towers mattered” teeters near thesis but is grounded by the canvas metaphor. The final image—planting beyond the dome and Cullin choosing to learn—reweights prior material. Resonance is earned and lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The voice is lyrical yet controlled, with a distinct sensory palette matching Amber’s attention and craft. Dialogue is lean, goal‑driven, and subtextual (forgiveness cutting, watering can), with clean mechanics. POV remains steady without leakage, and rhythm modulates well across pressure. High craft without showy intrusions.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is vivid and economical; images like “hemorrhaging ballast” and “tranquil blaze” are potent without stacking into muddle. Sentences carry multiple jobs, and there’s little scaffold or looped phrasing. A few lush metaphors push toward purple but remain legible and scene‑serving. The final cadence resolves via image rather than explanation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>“Engraved quiet” and virtue‑tagged roses as social technology feel fresh, integrating world, plot, and theme. The bounty hunter/pacifist daughter dynamic is revitalized by nonviolent tactics that reshape the father’s arc. Closure images synthesize objects and stakes in a non‑obvious, memorable way. Slight neatness at the negotiation’s turn keeps it just shy of the rarest band.</comment>
