<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mara’s drive to understand disappearing paths is clear and embodied through tactile, profession‑colored choices (tapping, aligning maps, hydrophone testing). Contradictory impulses—vertigo vs. resolve, ritual patience vs. risky descent—surface credibly. The note she leaves (“If I do not return...”) makes the cost legible and earns the final choice. A touch more on how the coral‑bleaching past complicates her present risk would push this even higher.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, beats cohere and tighten: anomalies → secret cache → map/labyrinth alignment → cavity confirmation → door signal → descent and tap. Closure lands as a Charged Poise: she taps the door’s rhythm, with a real price already staked by the note and the literal descent. Orientation is clean from the opening; no causality breaks. The cost is on the page and the pattern holds to the last line.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The station, tide sensors, hydrophone, rope, and observation deck are not décor; they constrain tactics and generate discovery. Echoes through metal/water and negative elevation create a living environment that dictates method. The final image is charged by tool and place (the hydrophone‑taught rhythm opening a “door assembled from absence”). Professional texture remains plausible without bogging down.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are coherent and escalate from eerie anomalies to a life‑risking descent. The decisive tightening arrives when the cavity is confirmed and the door signals back, leaving Mara to choose whether to answer. Agency drives each turn; the on‑page cost is implicit in the descent and explicit in the note. A sharper on‑page hazard in the final approach could intensify the price even further.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Absence, endurance, and the re‑mapping of certainty accrue through images (atlas/labyrinth, cairn, negative elevation) rather than thesis. “A door assembled from absence” epitomizes the conceptual repricing of knowledge and path. The ending reframes maps and tides as vows with cost, avoiding moralizing. One or two metaphoric lines risk prettiness, but they mostly stay earned and functional.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The voice is lyrical yet grounded in a singular perceptual bias (sound as mapping; oceanic arithmetic), with steady focalization and no head‑hopping. Rhythm modulates well—measured at first, tightening toward descent. Purposeful elision (“delayed revelation”) is taught and paid off in the closure image. Diction remains consistent with Mara’s expertise and temperament.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sentences carry high information density without drag; motifs do multiple jobs (map/tide/tapping). Figurative language is frequent but coherent to the water/echo logic; few, if any, mixed metaphors. No evident loops or scaffold; momentum builds cleanly to the final tap. A couple of stacked adjectives could be pared for even crisper pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis—post‑ban ocean science, sonic cartography, negative elevations, and a door of timed silence—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risks (lyric density, concept‑driven closure) heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. The tapping method as language to absence is a memorable, specific invention. The piece commits to its premise through tactic and image rather than cleverness alone.</comment>
