<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Mila’s drive—to resurrect stories—grounds every choice, and her occupational specificity (copyist habits, “rosin-scented fingers”) gives her credible agency. Interiority is present through action rather than abstract labels, and micro-choices (following the lyric’s directions, humming A, deciding to cloak) reveal her values. However, internal contradiction is minimal; she rarely wavers, so cost reads more conceptual than felt. The exhaustion beat and risk from “hounds of silence” hint at price but don’t fully bite emotionally.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, beats tighten cleanly: find glow → decode lyric → locate antenna → organize static → signal threatened → cloak in city noise. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: decentralizing the broadcast into “every cough, footstep,” with a clear before/after. Cost is legible (risk of regime, loss of a single locus of transmission, personal depletion), though not dramatized as harm. Orientation is crisp by line 2–3; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The world is vivid and purpose-driven: ember alcove, “birdcages” from instrument cases, salt-crystal “notes” on the antenna. Environment and objects constrain tactics (hidden dial, skyless sea seep, antenna alignment with vellum), and the final image is charged by setting (“ember twin,” dust spelling a line). Sensory selection tracks POV bias (musical lexicon). World rules (fear of light; dust from burned books) stay consistent and inform choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (smuggling story back into life under surveillance) is clear early and deepens as the signal falters. The key tightening comes when “the regime’s hounds of silence” force Mila to choose a new tactic, foreclosing the romantic central transmitter in favor of distributed life-noise. Prices include dispersion (loss of singularity) and exposure risk; escalation is coherent without manufactured reversals. A touch more tactile danger in the cloak moment could heighten pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme—art as resistance and the decentralization of narrative—emerges organically from particulars (copying rumors as staves; dust rehearsing syntax). The ending’s CR is strong: life itself becomes the transmitter, reweighting earlier images of light/noise and the famine. No sermonizing; “The regime would search...” edges declarative but still serves subtext. The final “thistled calm” reframes survival as fertile, not merely quiet.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The lyric third-person closely tracks Mila with a distinct musical-radio idiom; rhythm and diction are controlled and consistent. The brief pirate voice line is textured and functional without disrupting stance. Compression and figurative density are taught early and stay legible at closure. No head-hopping or register slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Line-by-line craft is tight: images carry multiple jobs (dust as ash, page, and transmitter), and syntax varies with momentum. Figurative language is rich yet coherent to motif; no mixed metaphors or opacity in peak beats. Minimal scaffolding; each sentence advances action, atmosphere, or theme. Opening and final images symphonize without redundancy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Copyist-as-revolutionary teaching dust to speak via pirate radio is an original synthesis executed with integrity. Turns feel earned (elusive lyric → physical scavenger-hunt → overture of city noise → decentralizing cloak). Risks in diction and concept heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. The world’s “fear of excess light” and “thistled calm” feel memorably singular.</comment>
