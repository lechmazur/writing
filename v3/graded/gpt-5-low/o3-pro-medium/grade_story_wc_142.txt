<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mira’s motives and contradictions are clear and embodied: duty to family vs. protecting the carnival drives a theft executed via her orderly intuition. Micro-choices (UV arrows, loosening boards, rumor-mapping, forming committees) align with her stated traits. Emotional texture is mostly shown through action, though her competence smooths risk a bit. The “dual lungs” realization feels earned and reshapes her stance without tidy absolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: encoded-parade distraction → heist → rumor leverage → delayed vote → organizing/legal push → public trust. The drive lens reads mainly causal with an accumulative flourish; orientation is immediate and stable. The theft sequence resolves a bit easily, reducing felt on-page cost at the peak. Closure lands decisively with the dais-setting, but the price is more conceptual than dramatized.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The raft carnival is vividly specific and functionally constraining (noise masking sensors; footbridge as percussion; floating-city politics shaping privatization). Recurring objects (Ferris wheels, the chip) charge the final image. Sensory details are purposeful and filtered through Mira’s tradecraft. Occasional lyric density verges on ornamental but largely serves pressure and tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes are singular and clear (public vs. corporate ownership) with a meaningful tightening at Carnival Eve and another at the procedural delay that forces grassroots structuring. Agency drives turns; coincidence doesn’t rescue them. The cost reads as risk and stamina over weeks rather than a sharp loss, tempering peak pressure. Still, external and internal conflicts braid effectively.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Themes of communal ownership, art-as-infrastructure, and immigration/gentrification ethics arise from events, not lecture. The “paint, then law” refrain reframes power and charges the ending. A few aphoristic lines (“corporations do not yield to poetry”) edge toward telling but they’re anchored by concrete tactics. The final image reweights earlier motifs without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct, confident first-person with a precise perceptual signature (“read chaos like sheet music,” “tuning forks for revolution”). Rhythm and diction modulate with action; patterned lyricism is taught early and maintained. No head-hopping; stance remains plausible to Mira’s knowledge. A couple slogan-like phrases skim close to thesis-speak but don’t break the spell.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density with propulsive syntax and varied sentence music; images often do double duty. Figurative language is abundant but coherent to the world’s logic; few, if any, mixed metaphors. Minimal scaffold or loops; transitions are crisp. Slight purple pressure at peaks is contained and doesn’t blur causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis feels fresh: a floating-carnival polis, graffiti as civic choreography, a talismanic foundation chip leveraged into law. Turns grow from prior particulars (encoded parade, rumor-mapping) rather than late rule drops. Stakes and tactics are reimagined through world logic, not novelty for its own sake. Bold without gimmickry.</comment>
