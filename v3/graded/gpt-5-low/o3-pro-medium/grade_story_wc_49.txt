<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Orin’s desire to revive the Arbor Heart is clear and consistent, and his agency drives the ritual from setup to payoff. The small tension between mechanic (gears, phonograph) and lore (songs, stories) gives him dimension. However, interior contradiction under pressure is minimal; he rarely doubts or falters. The piece favors external lyricization over embodied, conflicted interiority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Orientation is crisp from the outset, and the accumulative/textural lens holds: description → ritual → song → revival. Closure lands on the page with a decisive change (wilted tendril revives; bells of sap chime) and a resonant after‑image (“new leaves rustling yes”). Cost is present but soft—more investment and vigilance than loss—yet sufficient for this length and mode.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The arbor, phonograph, tin constellations, and vine lattice are vivid and functionally integrated; the environment channels sound/story into soil. Setting details are selective and purposeful, culminating in the charged final image (green sap bells chiming). Sensory range is strong without feeling touristic or static.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes—reviving the Arbor Heart—are singular and legible, with escalation via density and cadence: speech to song to communal resonance. The main tightening arrives at the shift to song and the grove’s hum. Pressure is coherent but gentle, with little overt resistance or cost beyond risk of failure and long neglect acknowledged.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Themes of memory as technology, ritual continuity, and community interdependence emerge organically through objects and acts. The elder’s line edges toward explicit thesis‑speaking, slightly dulling subtext in the final movement. The ending still reweights prior images (story as conduit; living wood carrying tales) with earned poetic resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third‑person with consistent distance and a distinct perceptual signature. Rhythm modulates well into the climax and tender silence after. Dialogue is minimal but apt; no head‑hopping or stance drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High information density with strong image economy; most lines do more than one job. Lushness skirts purple but stays coherent; metaphor vehicles (light, breath, sap, sound) are consistent. Minimal scaffolding or loops; cadence supports momentum and hush.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of tinkered machinery with oral tradition as literal conduit feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The sap‑bell chime as remedy marker is a striking turn. Emotional truth is grounded in community ritual rather than spectacle, avoiding template beats.</comment>
