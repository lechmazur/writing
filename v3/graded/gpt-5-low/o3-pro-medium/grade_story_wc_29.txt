<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mina’s motives are specific and consistent—prevent the tricksters’ feast by fostering unity—and her micro‑choices (rerouting transmitters, stalling Calvin) reveal priority and values under pressure. The relationship with Calvin adds a credible crucible with status dynamics. The visible cost is subtle but present (she forecloses institutional glory and risks alienating her mentor). Interiority is textured and embodied, though one or two moments verge on thematic summary.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Clear Causal lens: signals → decoding → campus pressure → Calvin’s intrusion → inversion broadcast → auroral resolution. Orientation is crisp from the opening booth image, and the escalation culminates in an on‑page decisive act with a before/after. Closure lands: the tricksters retreat and Mina chooses unity over opportunism; cost is implied through the severed power‑play path. Only minor softness in pricing the personal cost keeps it from a higher band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The station’s physical tools (mixing board, auxiliary antenna) and the amphitheater subwoofers directly constrain tactics and enable the counter‑signal. Sensory specificity (static, LEDs, vibrating plaques) is purposeful and filtered through Mina’s expertise. The environment shapes the final image by making the auroral “victory chord” feel earned. Strong economy with lived‑in credibility.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—thwart the tricksters by preventing division—is signaled early and tightened when Calvin threatens to amplify panic, foreclosing a path. Mina’s reroute and inversion create a meaningful narrowing and reveal trade‑offs (public acclaim/funding vs. communal protection). Pressure remains coherent and grows to a clean peak. A slightly clearer on‑page price for defying Calvin could heighten the squeeze.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Unity versus exploitative power plays emerges organically via action (hearts synchronizing, cocoa shared, Calvin’s hunger). The auroras reweight the premise toward care over conquest. However, the line “sometimes interference is protection” states the thesis directly, blunting subtext in the final beat. Strong imagery carries theme; trimming explicit moral would elevate.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A distinct, lyrical yet controlled POV steers perception (“static snow,” “silk over steel”) with consistent diction tied to Mina’s competence. Dialogue is sparse but character‑specific; Calvin’s register reads plausibly. Rhythm modulates with pressure, and focalization remains steady. Voice serves tension without overexplaining.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lines are vivid and efficient with multi‑tasking images (dust on plaques spelling rhythm). One paraphrase loop around “community divides” momentarily repeats content, and a few metaphors crowd in the middle. Otherwise, syntax varies and propulsion stays intact through the climax. Copy is clean and the final cadence is precise.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: campus radio as a celestial counter‑intelligence hub, unity engineered via subsonic frequencies, and tricksters feeding on sociopolitical fracture. The mentor’s opportunism refracts the “power plays” concept around human choices. The inversion broadcast is a smart, character‑driven twist that feels inevitable in hindsight. High originality without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
