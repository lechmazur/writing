<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Calix’s motive—“to collect the textures of different times”—is clear and consistently enacted through patient, risky choices (naming the avalanche year, continuing to map despite pain). Interiority is embodied via sensory specificity and restraint rather than labels. The earned endurance (archival over avoidance) forecloses comfort at a visible cost (absorbing future sorrow). A sharper contradiction beyond restraint vs. duty could have deepened complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: silence → hum → prism → birth-date test → avalanche deepening → concealment. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/CR: history as loom, town’s inhalation versus Calix’s cost, the notebook hidden. Cost is on-page (bodily grief, bonsai rupture, the hum’s cessation as window closes). Structure is clean, single scene with a decisive intensification tied to the method.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The mountaintop bonsai labyrinth, fluorescent lamp, and copper antennae are specific, tactile, and motive-shaped; the silence pact and electrical “veins” constrain when action can occur. Environmental change (bonsai thickening, splitting) mirrors and enacts the temporal experiment’s stakes. Setting charges the final image (the town’s return, secrets kept) rather than serving as postcard backdrop. Sensory economy is strong across sight, sound, and smell.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—capturing time’s texture at personal and communal cost—is signaled early and tightened when Calix invokes the avalanche year. The choice to endure and continue mapping under intensified pain reads as a meaningful narrowing with price. Pressure remains coherent and grows; the resolution is earned through his stance. Stakes stay intimate yet consequential, though a second micro-cost could have further sharpened the peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Themes of archival ethics, the cost of knowledge, and time as loom emerge through action and image, not lecture. The town’s pact and Calix’s endurance refract into a charged, morally complex ending: preservation over intervention, grace purchased in secret. The final rephrasing (“history as a loom”) reweights prior material without feeling like a platitude. Subtext hums through concealment and ritual rather than explicit moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third-person close aligns with Calix’s studious temperament; diction and rhythm are consistent and confident. The voice modulates under pressure without breaking register, and patterning (hum, prism, silence) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or stance slips; inference remains plausible to POV. Minor flourish density skirts purple but stays purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High-information lines do multiple jobs; cadence varies with scene needs. Metaphors are vivid and mostly coherent (“thunder butterflies” is a risk that still lands in voice). No scaffold/loop artifacts or clarity losses; punctuation and sequence are clean. Slight density spikes flirt with excess but do not obscure action or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis: time-smithing via fluorescent hum within a bonsai mountaintop ritual feels singular and necessary. The avalanche mapping as ethical endurance reframes “time travel” tropes into archival responsibility. Risks (lyric-science blend, ritualized civic pact) heighten stakes without gimmickry. Turns feel inevitable given the setup and voice.</comment>
