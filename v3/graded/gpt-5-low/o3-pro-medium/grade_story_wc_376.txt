<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Cressida’s motive—seeking honesty and the fate of lost letters—is consistent and propulsive, with embodied sensitivity (“wilted near dishonesty”) that informs choices. Her candor under pressure with Fen humanizes her and shapes tactics. Internal contradiction is mild (fear of poison vs. stronger aversion to lies), keeping complexity short of the highest tier. The final act—risking exposure to plant truths—reads earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clear causal chain: plate + map → tunnel journey → Archive access → seed retrieval → public planting → atmospheric shift. Orientation is firm early; the lens stays Causal through closure with a visible reconfiguration. Slight ease in city-scale remediation (mythic convenience) tempers the score but doesn’t break coherence. The closure lands on page with conceptual and social cost (public truth-telling).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The greenhouse city and toxic bruise sky are vivid and functional; maintenance tunnels and filtration constraints shape tactics. Recurring objects (zinc plate, seeds, planter) charge the final image. Sensory specificity is sustained and POV-filtered through Cressida’s craft. The environment directly participates in closure via air-clearing at the planter.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reviving the city’s viability by restoring honest speech) is clear and tightens once: discovery → access → seeding. Escalation is protagonist-driven and coherent under the causal lens, but losses are relatively light; danger remains mostly atmospheric and social rather than sharply priced. The public planting forces a stance crystallization citywide. Pressure is steady, not wrenching.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—small candors as restorative ecology—emerges through concrete images (seeds of unuttered truths germinating) rather than meta commentary. The final image reweights prior motifs without needing exposition. A slight whiff of moral statement in the penultimate lines keeps it shy of the very top band. Subtext in the Archive conceit enriches without blunt allegory.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Controlled, lyrical third-person close with a distinct perceptual signature (craft and botany-informed noticing). Dialogue is minimal but purpose-led and subtextually aligned with relief through honesty. Rhythm modulates from hush to lift as truth accumulates. No head-hopping or stance leakage; pattern-teaching is clean.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High information density with fresh metaphors (“neon warnings,” “shelves of translucent seeds”) and minimal scaffolding. Occasional lushness skirts purple without muddling sense; sentences vary in length and job. No paraphrase loops or cadence templates dull momentum. The closure image is crisp and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The Archive of Unuttered Things as seed-pollen of truth is a striking synthesis; the zinc plate and gilded calligraphy integrate form and function. The honesty-as-ecology mechanic is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Risks (myth-tech fusion, lyrical register) heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. The reconfiguration of “conversation as rainfall” feels singular.</comment>
