<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Felicity’s motives and choices are coherent and embodied—she refuses speech, “interjects” with chalk, opens the iris, then erases the visions, accepting a non‑mythic answer. Interiority is implied through tactile attention and social acuity rather than told feelings. Secondary figures press subtly but productively, revealing her leadership under hush. The change (trading prophecy for practical reordering) reads earned, though internal contradiction could be sharpened.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Clean single‑scene accumulative structure: arrival, gathering pressure, ritual action, reveal, repricing, dispersal. The closure is a clear Conceptual Repricing—mundane table over prophecy—with on‑page cost (relinquishing the mystique; the tile dissolves). Orientation is crisp early (grotto, mist, festival), and the pattern method is taught and paid off. Escalation is steady and coherent under the textural lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and functional: mist, broken columns, mineral breath, and hush direct tactics (no speech, chalk on sand). Environmental rules remain consistent, and the grotto’s hush and sand literally enable/shape the mandala and its erasure. The grotto’s final “sigh,” charged by the kitchen image, deepens the last beat. Sensory detail is economical and POV‑filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding meaning—tightens as observers gather and silence inhibits easy questions. Felicity’s agency drives the key turns (chalk ring, violet swirl), culminating in the anti‑prophecy table that forecloses the grand‑riddle path. The emotional price is subtle but legible: participants accept ordinary labor over oracular drama. Tension scales via accumulative density rather than reversals and stays taut.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The central theme—meaning as reorganized dailiness rather than grand riddles—emerges through particulars (mandala → kitchen table → dispersed plans). Strong subtextual resonance in the tile melting and the emptier nets. However, the explicit line “Meaning… is not hidden in grand riddles” tips into moralizing, slightly blunting the ache of discovery. The ending still lingers as an image‑driven repricing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice with consistent close third‑person filtering through Felicity’s sensibility. No dialogue needed; rhythms modulate from hushed to humming without head‑hopping. Diction remains coherent and precise, with metaphors tailored to the grotto and craft. The voice sustains under pressure at the iris reveal and final collapse.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Line work is tight, image‑dense, and largely avoids redundancy; sentences perform multiple tasks (world, mood, action). Figurative language is frequent but purposeful and legible; no mixed metaphors muddy key beats. Momentum holds through the reveal and erasure. A hair’s breadth from purple in places, but controlled and clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—festival of unlearning, whispering grotto, chalk mandala as inquiry, and a mundane table as revelation—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risks (ritualized non‑dialogue, conceptual climax) pay off cleanly. Recurring objects reweight meaning without gimmickry (tile → sand). The piece commits to its premise without retreat.</comment>
