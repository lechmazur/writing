<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and embodied—she seeks “the weight of a swallowed truth”—and her micro‑choices (charcoal gaps, smudging, opening the window) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. Interiority stays concrete (quinine ghosts, sweat‑soaked cots) with contradictory impulses (to measure vs. to confess). The renunciation at the end (release vs. plant) carries felt cost without neat moralization. Minor hedge: the illness’ moral stakes remain mostly conceptual rather than relationally tested.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Clean single‑scene causal chain: evidence → demand for a scale → hybridizing log and illustration → quantification → decisive release. Orientation is solid by the first lines (who/where/when), and the drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural with a decisive act at closure. Cost is on the page—she forecloses carrying the secret—and the oracle’s constraint shapes tactics. No teleports or soft resets; closure lands.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The station, instruments, vellum, candles, and high window all matter tactically and charge the final image (opening the window to release the seed; barometers ticking into alignment). Sensory specificity is vivid and POV‑filtered (auroral sorrow, optic sensors among pipes). World rules feel consistent; environment and objects evolve with action. The setting’s tools constrain options and cadence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible early; pressure tightens as the oracle requires a “scale” and she must alter method (occupy margins, smudge) to earn measurement. The 13‑gram valuation escalates internal conflict into a choice—release or plant—resolved by her agency. Cost is present but quiet; escalation is more deepening than reversal, fitting the lens. A slightly sharper external pressure could heighten the felt price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme coheres around truth’s measurability, fault tolerance, and living with “swaying certainties.” Motifs (margins, lilies, barometers) evolve in meaning and culminate in a resonant non‑literal answer: release/plant, motion changes mass. Subtext in the oracle’s clinical mercy and Mara’s crafted uncertainty ratio avoids didacticism. The final image reweights all prior particulars without stating a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice with precise diction and rhythm; compression is taught early and sustained. Dialogue is sparse yet functional and subtextual (“Load your evidence, and occupy my margins”). POV distance remains stable, with no head‑hopping or register drift. The prose modulates under pressure without losing clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High information density with varied syntax and purposeful metaphor; lines often do double duty (art→data→grief). A few lush constructions flirt with purple, but images cohere and propulsion holds. No scaffold loops or template cadences; punctuation and sequencing are clean. Peak beat clarity (release) remains crisp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—an oracle quantifying grief via a smudged botanical illustration in a weather station—feels singular and inevitable in hindsight. Risks (fault‑tolerant epistemology, margins as method) heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. The conceptual turn (“motion changes mass”) is fresh and earned by particulars. Emotional truth matches the strangeness.</comment>
