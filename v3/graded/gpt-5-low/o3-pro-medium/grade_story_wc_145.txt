<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Motives are clear (to find where rivers begin), and Morrow’s skepticism transitions into a spoken‑atlas acceptance with credible, felt trade‑off. Yara applies immediate, intelligent pressure (polyglot ritual, decisive action on the ice) and has a distinct idiom. Interiority is economical yet embodied (gloved finger tracing, ridicule/resolute mix), though contradictory impulses could intensify further under peak stress. The relationship dynamic is balanced and mutually sharpening without hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Hybrid lens (causal spine with accumulative lyric): condensation → buoy shifts → crack → grate → descent → memory‑only atlas, lands with on‑page closure. The cost is legible: paper forbids, forcing a renunciation that reconfigures the atlas and stakes. Setups pay off cleanly (falcon herald, dog‑eared phrasebook, singular convergence). Single continuous scene with crisp anchors and no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The rusted outpost, frozen lake, groaning ice, buoy‑grate apparatus, and warm mist are specific and tactically consequential. Environment constrains choices (ice risk, hinge mechanism, humidity forbidding ink) and charges the final image (outpost shedding corrosion). Sensory detail is vivid across senses (smell of loam and thyme, warmth on glass). World rules are learned through action, not exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early and tightens through a decisive ritual → physical risk → epistemic cost. Agency drives turns (choosing polyphony, crossing the ice, descending without artifacts), and the “paper forbids” beat forecloses a path. The price is more conceptual than peril‑driven; danger on the ice registers but never bites. Still, escalation remains coherent and satisfying under the hybrid lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme coheres around memory vs inscription, map vs margin, and convergence as both hydrology and polyphony. “Water remembers” transforms from phrase to enacted rule; the final choice to speak the atlas reweights all prior images without moralizing. Recurrences (falcon, condensation pattern, bright thread → crack) accrue meaning and culminate in a resonant, non‑literal answer. Ambiguity is purposeful, not vague.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Controlled lyric voice with clean focalization through Morrow; diction and rhythm modulate gracefully under pressure. Dialogue is crisp, wry, and functional, advancing plot and subtext (“Maps can lie… margins gossip”). No unjustified omniscience; inference reads as inference. A few elevated cadences push toward lushness but remain consistent with the established texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density with purposeful imagery; lines do multiple jobs without scaffold or loops. Figurative language is fresh and consistent (“ice groaned like a distant cello,” “radiant as lightning paused midflash”) and supports clarity. Syntax varies; momentum never bogs. No notable mixed metaphors or register slips at peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis is striking: condensation cartography, polyglot ritual, a subterranean font that forbids inscription, and an atlas that must be spoken. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight because each object/pattern returns with escalated function. Risks (mythic logic, lyric accumulation) heighten meaning while retaining legibility. The falcon herald avoids cliché by subdued framing and a charged final perch.</comment>
