<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Marlin’s perceptual quirk (identifying walks) and “calculated spontaneity” guide concrete choices under pressure, and his rapport with Liora carries subtext. Motivation is clear—prove whispers outpace shouts and secure evidence for rewiring—and decisions align (key use, vent‑murmur misdirection). Interiority is specific and embodied (“electricity prickle his beard”) without therapy‑speak. The cost is lighter than maximal—risk of being recorded is noted but not dramatically biting on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Clean Causal lens: maps reveal corridor; key opens chamber; discovery triggers ladder; patrol pressure forces the vent‑whisper ploy; coin becomes evidence. Closure lands as Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing: the world’s “loudest hush” becomes actionable proof with institutional stakes. Orientation is sharp from the outset (Pier Seven, night shift, storm), and the single scene holds. Cost is present but modest (surveillance risk and unresolved institutional fight), keeping this just shy of 9.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The port labyrinth, cranes, aurora, vents, and rooftop spans are vivid and strongly POV‑filtered. Environment constrains tactics (vent network for whisper throw, patrol sightlines, compass interference) and charges the final image. Details are purposeful and integrated into action rather than touristic. Consistency of world rules under storm pressure heightens plausibility.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear and escalates: secret corridor discovery → illicit “Whisper Network” → patrol pressure → tactic shift leveraging ducts. The tightening is driven by protagonist agency, with a credible reversal when patrols appear and options narrow. The price paid is mainly risk and deferred institutional confrontation, not an on‑page wound or loss. Stakes feel tense but could sharpen with a more concrete cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Thematic throughline—silence as transmission/power—emerges organically through objects and action (mute radios, vents, key, aurora) rather than moralizing. The final image reweights earlier motifs (“silence…loudest song”) without flattening into platitude. The relationship’s whisper‑challenge gives the theme human stakes beyond concept. Slight neatness in the closing aphorism trims the edge.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A distinct, lyrical yet controlled voice with consistent focalization; diction and imagery match Marlin’s sensibility and line of work. Dialogue is sparse, natural, and subtextual, advancing goals quietly. Rhythm modulates well between hush and urgency, with no head‑hopping. Purposeful elisions (e.g., map logic) are taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High information density with generally clean, propulsive lines; images like “cranes…metal herons” and “key chimed…like a question” are apt. A few metaphors cluster (aurora, music notation), but they cohere and don’t muddy action. Minimal redundancy and clear sequencing through the patrol/misdirection beat. Slight lushness in a few stacked descriptors keeps it shy of the very top.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—geomagnetic storm, whisper‑network contraband, a key without a keyhole, and gait‑reading—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Turns arise from prior particulars, not late rule changes, and the final reconfiguration honors the premise. Bold but unshowy risk‑taking in concept and language heightens coherence. Emotional truth is grounded in their quiet partnership rather than gimmickry.</comment>
