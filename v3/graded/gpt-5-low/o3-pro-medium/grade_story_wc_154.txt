<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied, with the translator’s contradictory impulses (cynicism vs. tender risk) dramatized through micro-choices: decrypting the cast, composing a sentence, returning the coral. Motivation is consistent (“graft new meaning onto old wounds”) and escalates under shellfire. The Earned Stasis/stance crystallization at the end feels earned and forecloses neutrality without promising facile outcomes. Slight safety in the tidy epiphany cadence keeps this shy of the very top.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: pressure accrues via notes decoded → acrostic → sentence found, with the shellfire cadence shift tightening the beat. Closure is a Charged Poise/RR: the line is spoken, the coral returned, and a cost remains (guns continue, promises fragile). Orientation is clear from the outset (field hospital, archipelago, translator). Minor softness in causal stakes (no external test of the new sentence) prevents a 9+.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting and object details are vivid and purposeful: salt wind, cracked skylight, mist-clad atrium, humidifiers, vines. The atrium and coral charge the final image (condensation constellations; grooves fitting his skin) and subtly constrain choice by providing the only quiet window and a ritual space. Sensory selection tracks the POV’s priorities. A touch more environmental constraint in the mid-beat would push this into 9+.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (can language re-knit frightened hearts in a war-night) is signaled early and tightened by the acrostic discovery and the shellfire interruption. The protagonist’s agency produces the culminating sentence and the choice to return the coral in a charged moment. The cost is mostly conceptual/emotional; external pressure doesn’t force a hard trade-off beyond time constraints and fear. Tension is steady if subtle rather than sharply escalatory.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through coral/cast motifs and the translator’s reframed duty; the ending reweights prior images without sermonizing. “Let what was broken remember its pattern...” functions as a resonant answer rather than a moral, grounded by concrete acts (placing and returning the coral). The “shared anxieties” thread integrates with the mission and closure. Occasional aphoristic lines (“Words sometimes suture...”) flirt with statement but remain earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct, coherent lyric voice with controlled rhythm and imagery; POV distance stays steady and plausible to the character’s sensibility. The diction (“lotus-hearted ache”) is elevated yet consistent with this narrator’s perceptual signature. Compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping or stance leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong: varied sentence rhythm, high information density, and images that multitask (mist as mood, condensation as cosmology). A few lush metaphors risk purple if overused, but they remain coherent and purposeful. Minimal redundancy; cadence supports pressure. Clean mechanics throughout.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The translator-in-war frame fused with coral/cast acrostic is fresh and specific; the accumulative structure lands a non-obvious, inevitable-feeling close. Risks (lyric density, object-charged ritual) enhance stakes without obscuring clarity. Emotional truth feels particular rather than templated. Not groundbreaking at the premise level, but rendered with distinctive ingenuity.</comment>
