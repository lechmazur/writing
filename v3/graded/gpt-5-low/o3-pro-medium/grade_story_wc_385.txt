<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Silva’s motive—retain agency while understanding why people “echo”—is clear and intensifies, culminating in a negotiated pact with visible cost. Interiority is specific (fear of becoming a “communal well”), and actions align with that fear. Contradictory impulses (curiosity vs. dread) operate in scene, especially at the descent and in the chamber. Minor note: the merchant is a light pressure source, vanishing quickly, leaving Silva largely self-propelled.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: shell → countdown → fissure → descent → negotiation → pact → reweighted surface performance. Closure lands as a Decisive Change with explicit cost (“every performance would now end with memories that were none of her own”). Orientation is early and stable; the hybrid lyric-causal pattern is taught and kept. No unkept setups; the final “grateful silence” pays off the premise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and operative: acoustics and the canyon’s “intelligence” constrain options, and the countdown-linked fissure fundamentally shapes the choice architecture. The chamber’s “loom” charges the final image and reframes the world’s rules through action, not exposition. The shell functions as a micro-setting tool across beats. Sensory selection (harmonics, vibration) tracks Silva’s bias and craft.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (agency vs. involuntary resonance) is signaled early and tightens as the countdown forces a decision window. Escalation is driven by Silva’s agency: leaving safety, descending, then negotiating instead of submitting. The pact forecloses a path and imposes a clear price that charges the ending. Pressure remains coherent without needing an external antagonist.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Themes of consent, stewardship of memory, and the ethics of voice emerge organically from the pact and the reinterpreted echoes. The final “grateful silence” offers a resonant, non-literal answer: chosen mediation over hijack. The loom imagery and countdown repricing avoid moralizing, inviting reflection on collective vs. individual voice. Ambiguity remains purposeful (the depths’ “intelligence” speaks in ache, not rules).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Consistent, confident lyric third-person with a distinct perceptual signature (acoustic bias, tactile sonics). Rhythm modulates with pressure; diction stays within the story’s poetic register without drift. No dialogue is needed; the voice carries subtext through images and controlled elision. Compression is purposeful and legible through closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High information density with clean propulsion; figurative language is vivid yet coherent (“loom of moonlit cobweb”) and task-bearing. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; syntax varies with scene tempo. Key beats are dramatized rather than summarized, and the final line crisply recharges earlier motifs. Copy is clean with no rhythm artifacts dulling the climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Echoes as stored consciousness with negotiated release is an original, well-integrated angle on memory and agency. The countdown shell, the acoustically carved stair, and the silent gratitude fuse fresh objects and stakes into a memorable synthesis. The risk of a quiet, pact-based climax pays off with clarity and cost. Feels singular rather than template-driven.</comment>
