<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Jarom’s drive is clear from the first line and intensifies under pressure, culminating in the explicit trade of his chromatic hearing for the betrayal tone. His interiority is concrete and embodied (clutching the coil; nearly tearing his aids away). The legacy-versus-wonder conflict is active, not summarized, and his choice forecloses a path with visible cost. Minor note: the acceptance is swift, but the groundwork makes it credible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: pursuit → orchard exploration → forge method → collection of absences → imprinting silence → price exacted → application in workshop. Orientation is strong within 120 words; the hybrid causal/lyric design holds. Closure lands with cost on the page (loss of color-hearing) and shapes the final image and options. The decisive ascent with the coil and later embedding in the device completes the arc without handwaving.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The sunken orchard/shipwreck milieu isn’t decorative; it supplies constraints (diving bell, wreck-scavenging) and resources (the forge beneath a keel). The aurora and pears under cracked panes inflect tone and tactics, later reweighted when colors dull. The final gray world is charged by this environment’s prior vibrancy. Details are selective, vivid, and POV-driven without tourist cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is declared early and tightens meaningfully when the forge exacts a price, forcing a trade-off. Agency drives the turns: choosing the forge’s method, selecting absences, accepting the loss, and embedding the tone. The cost is unmistakable and persists into the final beats. Tension escalates coherently without need for a second antagonist.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: absences as generative forces, memory’s residue shaping harm and warning. The final conceptual pivot (“absences, too, could bloom into warning”) reweights all prior images without sermonizing. Recurring objects (coil, aids, forge) accrue subtext and pay off. The emotional aftereffect is precise, neither tidy nor bleak.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The close third is consistent and confident, with a distinct perceptual signature (synesthesia filtered through a designer’s mind). Lyric compression is taught early and sustained; no head-hopping or stance wobble. Rhythm modulates with pressure, especially around the forge and ascent. Diction remains coherent with the character’s sensibility.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sentences carry multiple jobs with few redundancies; imagery is fresh and controlled. Occasional lushness skirts purple but stays purposeful, especially in the forge and aurora passages. No template cadence or filter stacks; momentum holds through the transition to the workshop. The final line is clean and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis—synesthetic engineer, drowned orchard, silence-imprinting forge, absences as fuel—is striking and feels inevitable in hindsight. Risks in worldbuilding and metaphor pay off and remain character-driven. The cost-consequence matrix is fresh, not a gimmick. Memorable images support unique thematic insight.</comment>
