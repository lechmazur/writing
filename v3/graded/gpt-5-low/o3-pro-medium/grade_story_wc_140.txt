<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct interiority with credible contradictions: the desire to witness vs. the survival mandate to stay erased. Micro-choices under pressure (ducking, following the turquoise, planting the label, retreating) align with motive. Embodied memory of poison and sensory bias make reactions feel specific. The cost—choosing nameless endurance over confrontation—is legible and earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: density and patterning build to the charged act of sliding the label under the door and recommitting to ghosthood. Closure lands as Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: a chosen namelessness that carries risk and cost. Persistent constraints (tide, labyrinth, bureaucratic death) shape options. Orientation is clear early and coheres through the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The port’s labyrinth, tides, refrigerated container, and industrial textures are not just vivid—they constrain tactics and time. The environment enables stealth, provides a breadcrumb trail, and offers the humming container as a pivotal locus. Sensory detail across sound/light/texture is purpose-driven and filtered through the narrator’s perceptual bias. The final image is charged by the setting’s ongoing erasure machine.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes are coherent: gather and protect erased histories without being “corrected.” Escalation tightens via the discovery of the poison label, the men searching, and the taped confessions; the decision to leave a calling card and withdraw narrows options. The cost is the renewed acceptance of ghosthood and deferred identity. Pressure grows consistently under the accumulative lens without false spikes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Themes of erasure, bureaucracy, memory texture, and identity are dramatized through concrete acts (notebook embossing, taped confessions, tides). The poison label reweights the personal with the archival. Occasional aphoristic lines are earned by scene work and do not lapse into moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal stance rather than a thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A singular lyric voice with precise sensory hierarchy (“Sounds arrive first, images later, names not at all”). Rhythm and diction modulate with pressure without losing clarity. Elision is taught early and remains legible; no head-hopping or register drift. The perceptual signature is consistent and character-specific.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High information density with minimal scaffold; images often perform multiple functions. Figurative language is controlled and coherent, avoiding mixed metaphors even at peak beats. Sentence rhythm varies with scene needs; no paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. Opening and closing lines are strong and mutually charging.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: a bureaucratically dead witness harvesting erased histories in a living port-labyrinth. The taped confessions and the poison label create a memorable, non-obvious interplay of personal and civic memory. Risks in structure and tone pay off without obscuring clarity. The piece feels singular rather than templated.</comment>
