<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Clear motive (to “discover the texture of time”) tightens into a costly, character‑specific choice to become the axis. Interiority is particular (designer’s mind mapping hyperbolic turns) and embodied (ivy on ankles, clock pulse). The internal contradiction—ambition vs. self‑erasure—crystallizes only at the end but lands credibly. Minor note: earlier beats favor competence over visible doubt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: arrival → maze pressure (wrong turns inflate space) → informed tactic via hyperbolic insight → shard completes clock → price revelation → acceptance. Closure is on‑page Earned Stasis/Decisive Change with a felt cost: he remains to prevent disintegration. Orientation is strong from the opening; single scene holds. The lens (causal with lyric texture) is taught and kept through the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The living bridge garden is vivid and rule‑driven; vines, arches, and mist constrain movement and tactics. Environment directly shapes choices (hyperbolic corridors, recursive hedges) and charges the ending (ivy binding, curator role). Object‑as‑setting (halo + clock) integrates spatial rules with temporal stakes. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible and escalates: mastery of maze vs. loss of self. The tightening turn—recognizing and exploiting non‑Euclidean arcs—earns access to the nexus and a sharper price. Final trade‑off forecloses departure with world‑scale consequence. Pressure remains coherent without coincidence bailouts.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Themes of memory, craft, and obligation emerge through action (designer solving a maze of regret) instead of thesis. The “fading photographs” recur and are reweighted when images stabilize—then demand sacrifice. Ambiguity lingers (salvation vs. entrapment) without confusion. No moralizing; resonance rides the final curator image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A confident, lyrical close third matches Quillon’s mind and vocation; diction (“hyperbolic tilings,” “origami rain”) feels earned. Rhythm modulates—rush during navigation, hush at the nexus—without losing clarity. No head‑hopping or register drift. Compression and metaphor are consistent with the taught pattern.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is dense yet controlled; metaphors cohere to time/geometry/photography. Momentum rarely stalls, and sentences do double duty. A few lush stacks flirt with excess, but they don’t blur causality or the closure image. Syntax and paragraphing provide propulsion into the price beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: living bridge + hyperbolic mazecraft + relic‑tech clock + retrocognition. The decisive lateral step “off the page of normal geometry” surprises yet reads inevitable. The closing curator conceit reimagines guardianship as temporal texture‑keeping. Risky lyric worldbuilding supports, not eclipses, character stakes.</comment>
