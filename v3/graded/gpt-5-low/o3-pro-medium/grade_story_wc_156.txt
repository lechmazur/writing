<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Ada’s motivation—trading certainty for curiosity—drives every tactic, and her occupational specificity (solvents, frequencies) reads lived-in. Interiority is particular (the hobo nickel as talisman; “Certainty…was a cage”), and her micro-choices (whispering, pinging, waiting without breath) reveal values. The cost she embraces is social and conceptual rather than personal peril, so internal contradiction is modest. A sharper on-page friction (any doubt or risk to her standing) would deepen the crucible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Orientation is clean from the first line (Ada, mural, Sound Wave Garden; solstice deadline), and the accumulative/textural lens holds as sound-rituals scale to nested awakenings. Because/therefore coherence is strong: question → echo-answer → negotiated price → ritual sequence → citywide effect. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: the city’s certainty is loosened, with Ada’s final “listening for the following question” a charged poise. The cost is felt but primarily conceptual; a brief on‑page counterpressure (someone objecting, or a visible risk) would sharpen it further.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The Sound Wave Garden feels tactile and rule-bound: alcoves shaped like throats, hedges sculpting reflection, benches responding to subterranean harmonics. Sensory selection is apt to Ada’s craft (frequency glazes, echoes “colored with antique brass”). The environment constrains tactics—she uses the alcove and architecture to “bewitch through reflected sound”—and the hobo nickel charges the final image. Vividness is high without tourist cataloging, though one grounded physical constraint at the climax could push this to the top tier.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear early (revive acoustics; exchange certainty for curiosity) and tightens with the garden’s demand to “loose the city’s certainty.” Escalation proceeds via ritual deepening (paint → stone → silence) and culminates in a citywide transformation. The price is embraced rather than contested, so pressure reads more like a chosen risk than a squeezed alternative. One concrete loss or resistance in the moment would intensify the turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme coheres: curiosity as living force versus the cage of certainty, enacted by questions, pauses, and echoes that answer with “Deep in your waiting.” Subtext blooms in the intervals—waiting without breath, citizens “tasting the interval”—and the final charged poise reweights the premise. A few direct statements (“Certainty…was a cage”) edge toward telling but are mostly earned by scene. The resonance lingers without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The voice is distinctive, lyrical, and filtered through Ada’s perceptual biases (chemistry of glazes, harmonic language), with steady POV and controlled distance. Rhythmic modulation supports key beats (the held-breath pause, the ricocheting chord). Dialogue-as-action is minimal but effective (“Where do echoes sleep?”), carrying subtext. No head‑hopping or stance drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Line work is vivid and mostly lean, with metaphors that align to sound and craft (“editorial laughter,” “invisible stitches”). Information density is high; sentences do multiple jobs and avoid scaffold. A few figurative reaches verge on ornate but remain coherent; no loops or cadence templates dull momentum. Final image is clean and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis—acoustic restoration as ritual bewitchment, nested awakenings, a hobo nickel as folk-tech talisman—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risks (accumulative structure, conceptual closure) pay off cleanly. The civic reconfiguration via curiosity is a non‑obvious angle on an art‑restoration premise. Only the relatively low on‑page resistance keeps it from an even higher band.</comment>
