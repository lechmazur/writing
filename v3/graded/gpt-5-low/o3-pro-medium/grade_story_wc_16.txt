<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Ada’s motive and trait blend (“carefully reckless”) drive concrete choices—humming the glyphs, reassuring the archive, engineering the ribbon lattice. Interiority is embodied (“voice trembling like a plucked string”) and consistent, though contradiction under pressure is modest; she rarely falters once the system responds. The maternal heirloom adds specificity without lapsing into stock sentiment. The final endurance—trusting the music more than herself—reads earned but low-cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clear causal chain: translation → archive responds → tactic (interconnected promises) → twilight oath‑singing → treaties inked and reweighted silence. Closure lands on the page with a conceptual price (risk of the archive, spent ink/lantern dimming, heirloom absorbing promises), though cost is gentle. Orientation is crisp from line one; single POV window holds. The neat success of the delegates undercuts maximal pressure at the peak.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The archive is tactile and rule‑bound, actively shaping tactics (must appease it, conduct shelves, tie ribbons to columns). Recurring objects—the heirloom ink well and lantern—charge the final image as silence converts from threat to rest. Sensory detail is selective and aligned with Ada’s professional lens. A hair more constraint at the end (e.g., spatial or acoustic limits) would push it higher.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is explicit early and escalates via the archive’s sentience and the twilight deadline. The key tightening is devising the ribbon lattice, which makes betrayal audible and sets the terms of the climax. However, resistance from the delegates or the archive barely tests the method, so the price paid feels light. The outcome, while elegant, arrives with limited strain after the tactic is introduced.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme coheres: truth as music, promises as binding—and silence reinterpreted as rest rather than rupture. Motifs (ink well, ribbons, humming) return charged at the end without didactic summary. The line “restore trust after silence” risks on‑the‑nose but is dramatized by the archive’s response and the final cadence. The piece invites reflection on consent and enforced honesty without collapsing into a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third‑person close is steady and textured; diction aligns with a ritual‑minded linguist without academic drift. Rhythms flex with pressure—lush when discovering, tauter at twilight. Minimal dialogue is purposeful (one declaration, one directive stanza) and functions as action. No head‑hopping or stance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lines carry multiple jobs with clean propulsion; images like “ink shimmering like quiet thunder” feel earned. Occasional lushness skirts purple but keeps clarity; no significant loops or template cadences. Syntax varies, and metaphors stay within the world’s physical logic. Final image lands crisply without over‑explaining.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh fusion of ritual linguistics and choral architecture—an archive that literally harmonizes oaths—feels singular. The ribbon lattice as audible‑betrayal system is a smart, specific turn. Risk is aesthetic rather than structural; resolution’s smoothness slightly tempers the afterburn. Still, the conceptual synthesis reads confident and inventive.</comment>
