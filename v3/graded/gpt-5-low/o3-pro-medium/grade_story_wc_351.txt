<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rhea’s motive—custodianship of abandoned dreams—drives concrete choices (modifying the mirror, following the light corridor, vowing not to plunder). Her fear/curiosity tension is embodied (“fear brushed… curiosity pushed harder”), and her chaotically precise mind shows in the fiber alignment. The renunciation at the end feels earned by the earlier vow and discoveries. Cost is conceptual (risk of redrawing her past; giving up possession) but present.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: image density builds from activation to corridor to amphitheater to the final custodianship stance. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing (“accepting custodianship, not possession”) with cost implied by self-alteration and relinquishment. Orientation is clean early; no causality breaks. Pressure is gentle rather than incisive, keeping this just below the top band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The moonlit canyon and the periscope mirror are vivid and functionally integrated: the canyon “listens,” projects a corridor, and shapes the final image; the mirror’s cracks become stitched constellations. Sensory selection is purposeful and filtered through Rhea’s engineer‑poetics. The environment charges choices rather than serving as postcard description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (use and ethical handling of entangled memories) tightens when the device begins to rewrite her past options, forcing the vow and later acceptance of custodianship. Escalation is more deepening than narrowing, consistent with the lens, but lacks a sharp on‑page price beyond conceptual cost. The amphitheater projection reframes stakes effectively without a concrete antagonist.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Themes of memory ethics, stewardship vs. possession, and collective rewriting emerge through images and the final acceptance scene. The closing reprise (birds singing “algorithms”) resonates. One near‑explicit thematic articulation (“meant accepting custodianship, not possession”) slightly reduces the felt subtext. Still, the images carry honest, durable resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A singular, controlled lyric voice with a crisp perceptual signature (“helix‑minded… double‑stranded prayers”). Psychic distance and stance are stable; elision patterns are taught and legible. No dialogue pressure needed; the vow line functions as action. Diction remains coherent with Rhea’s mind under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is lush yet largely precise; many lines do double duty (world and psyche). Minor density/overwrought moments and abstract stacking (“journal of extinct moods”) create slight drag. Rhythm and variation keep momentum, and final images are clear and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: a grown neural‑fiber periscope in a listening canyon capturing communal dreams with ethical stakes. The mirror’s wartime past repurposed to memory stewardship is non‑obvious and coherent. Risk‑taking remains legible; only the soft pressure ceiling limits further lift.</comment>
