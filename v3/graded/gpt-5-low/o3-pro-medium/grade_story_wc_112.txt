<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clear, incandescent motivation (“prove that time moves sideways”) drives concrete choices, and the ethical counter‑impulse (protecting the sleeping leviathans) forces a costly reversal. Embodied details (calloused, “mechanically warm” hands; signing in disappearing ink) individualize her. The mid‑scene apology and end promise show credible internal contradiction under pressure. Depth is strong for the length, though the flaw calculus remains gentle rather than scarring.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: anomaly → plan using the nexus → lever pull → temporal slip harms creatures → reversal to restore stasis while salvaging proof. Closure lands on the page as an Earned Stasis/Resonant Reconfiguration: she forecloses a path (continued experiment) to protect the biome, bearing an ethical cost marked by the “fingerprints” image. Orientation is crisp and the lens holds. The cost is felt but measured rather than devastating, keeping it just shy of the very top band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and constraining: dorsal fins, azimuth gyroscope, avian enclosures, and protocol all shape tactics and the final image. Sensory texture (“violet sheets,” “crystal breaths”) supports tone and choice without static cataloguing. The lever and fins function as environment‑bound tools that charge the climax and resolution. World rules are learned through action, not dump.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (proof vs. biosphere safety) is signaled early and tightens when the leviathans’ “subdued awakenings” become overlapping distress, forcing a reversal. Agency drives turns: the lever pull and its inversion both narrow options with a visible tradeoff (abort further testing to prevent harm). Ethical calculus is legible at the peak. Escalation is precise rather than harrowing, but wholly coherent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Themes of scientific ambition versus consent emerge organically from the experiment and its rollback, with the “icy warmth” motif binding care and machinery. The sideways‑time “deck of cards” reframes reality while the end promise reweights the pursuit with ethical cost. No sermonizing; resonance lingers in the twin suns/data plume image. Slight neatness keeps it from higher ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third‑person closely held to Maren’s perceptual biases (“poets navigate silence”) sustains a distinct texture. Diction is elevated but consistent with the speculative lyric mode; no head‑hopping or stance slips. Rhythm modulates well under pressure as timestamps cascade and then merge. A few lush phrasings skirt register stretch but remain coherent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High information density with purposeful figurative language; lines often do double duty (world, tone, and action). Minimal redundancy; syntax varies; beats move cleanly. A rich metaphor palette risks excess but avoids muddle and preserves clarity at the climax. No mechanical errors or cadence loops that dull momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: a sky mechanic leveraging a migratory magnetic nexus to tilt time sideways amid sleeping leviathans, then prioritizing consent. The lever as archaic fulcrum against futuristic systems feels both surprising and inevitable. Conceptual and ethical turns arise from seeded particulars, not late tricks. Bold without gimmickry.</comment>
