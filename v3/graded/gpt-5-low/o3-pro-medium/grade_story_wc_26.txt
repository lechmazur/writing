<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motives are clear and particular—Eira’s need to preserve hope for her vanished grandmother and the narrator’s allied drive. Trust is earned through concrete behavior (“anyone who honors unseen editors will honor secrets”). The narrator’s micro‑choice to stay while offering the password‑coat and Eira’s costly descent register as credible under pressure. Slight gap: internal contradiction is present but mild; the piece could sharpen the felt risk to Eira’s identity/role when breaking the charter.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Hybrid drive with a causal spine: comparing reels → spotting the shadow → decision to descend → returning with the stone → on‑page manifestation. Closure lands (the grandmother congeals; book absorbed with conditions), but the cost proof is softened by the charter’s consequence remaining abstract despite Eira’s return. Orientation is clean and pattern is taught early. A brief elision of the descent removes the scene’s hardest pressure from the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is exquisitely specific and functional: the cloud library’s charter tangibly constrains choice, the veranda/telescopes enable tactic, and the projector/ink/pollen charge the ending. Environmental logic is consistent and used through action, not dumps. The final hush of petals collapsing archive and sky reweights the space meaningfully. A hairline dock only because the charter’s penalty isn’t cashed on the page.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible early (“preserve the shape of hope”), and pressure tightens at the charter line; the narrator’s renunciation and Eira’s leap serve as the major turn. The resolution arises from their agency, not coincidence. However, escalation softens because the descent’s risks and obstacles are skipped, and consequences of breaking the rule aren’t dramatized. Tension otherwise hums at sentence level via the shadow and motes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Memory, forgetting, and hope are integrated through recurrent images (reels, dusk, stones) that shift meaning at the end without moralizing. The final image—gratitude traced in pollen and a charged book lent only to those guided by “luminous regret”—reprices the world’s rules in a resonant, non‑literal way. The theme emerges from choices rather than commentary. Minor sentiment risk is avoided by concrete, idiosyncratic detail.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A confident, singular lyric voice with a consistent perceptual signature (“proofreading gravity,” “glass roots drinking sky light”). Psychic distance is stable; any elision is purposeful and pattern‑taught. Dialogue is sparse but charged, carrying implication and restraint. Diction remains coherent and character‑bound despite high lyricity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High‑density prose largely sustains clarity and momentum; images are fresh and multi‑tasking. Minimal scaffolding or loops; syntax varies with pressure, and closures land cleanly. A few lush metaphors cluster, but they cohere to the vision and do not muddy causality. The cutline “because preserving hope sometimes means allowing unanswered frames to unfold in silence” earns its place via scene‑borne weight.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: cloud‑borne library, film reels as memory organisms, “shadow unbound,” and bureaucratic charter constraints interlock. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight (stone linked from first reel to final projection). Risk‑taking is purposeful, not gimmickry, and the imagery feels singular. Slightly reduced for the off‑page retrieval beat that mutes a chance for an even bolder escalation.</comment>
