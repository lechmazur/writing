<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Eren’s motive—restless drive toward freedom in a world where violence is impossible—is clear, embodied, and sharpened by the scrimshaw and whale call. Contradictory impulses (duty vs. surrender) operate simultaneously, especially when he sets the oars across the gunwales. His final renunciation of the “assigned” life carries visible cost. A slight hedge is that his unlocking feels partly facilitated by external forces (whale/scrimshaw) rather than hard-fought internal resistance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, pressure coheres from harbor calm to whale-call revelation to surrender and island solidification. Closure lands cleanly as a resonant reconfiguration: he forecloses the land life and commits to a vanishing harbor. Cost is legible in the leaving and the irrevocability of the island’s conditional presence. Causality holds with lyric ellipsis; no plot amnesia or soft reset.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and operative: sublittoral kelp, black-sand shoals, and a slim channel actively shape tactics and mood. The scrimshaw and whale function as micro-setting/tools that charge and constrain choices, culminating in the final descent beneath the ocean’s “bright skin.” World rules (post-violence) are consistent and refract through environment (guards can’t pursue). Sensory selection remains purposeful and biased to Eren’s lived knowledge.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—freedom via surrender—tightens when the island flickers and requires him to stop rowing, a concrete narrowing of options. His choice forecloses return and is tested by the island’s conditional disappearance. Price is conceptual/emotional rather than bodily, but it reads on the page (policies shouted, piracy turned theater, land life abandoned). Escalation is coherent and protagonist-driven.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Themes of surrender-as-agency and “combative tenderness” emerge through particulars (piracy becoming theater; breakers refusing to wound). The scrimshaw’s heart-unlocking runs through to the final reconfiguration of self. The ending image reweights the premise without moralizing, and the Quietening reframes conflict ethically rather than didactically. Resonance lingers as a non-literal answer to freedom’s cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable, lyric but controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature (“water shaped to a man”). Rhythmic modulation supports intensification at the whale breach and softens into surrender without head-hopping. Elevated diction fits the fable-like register of the piece. Purposeful elision is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong: images do double duty and momentum rarely stalls. A dense figurative weave risks purple in places but remains coherent and purposeful. No noticeable loops or scaffold; syntax varies to match pressure. Final images are clean and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The Quietening, disappearing island contingent on surrender, and scrimshaw that unlocks guarded hearts synthesize into a fresh, inevitable-feeling myth. Whale-song as method and “combative tenderness” as ethic feel distinctive rather than ornamental. Risks in lyric density and conceptual world-building pay off. The final submergence is memorable and specific to this vision.</comment>
