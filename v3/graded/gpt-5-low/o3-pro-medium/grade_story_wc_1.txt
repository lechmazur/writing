<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Yara’s motives are clear and consistent—survive, decode, expose—and her glassmaker’s mindset shapes choices (waiting for frost; “patience of cooling glass”). Embodied emotion lands via craft‑rooted metaphors (“anneal rather than shatter”). The anger/resolve contradiction is credible, and micro‑choices under pressure (route planning, using shadows, slipping into an arroyo) reveal values. A few thematic articulations edge toward told insights (“Purpose now had contour”), but they’re largely earned by action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hybrid drive (lyric accumulation with causal turns) holds: heat erased → therefore use cold; decode → therefore commit to council; dawn and hoofbeats → therefore evasive route. Orientation is immediate, and closure lands as Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: pendant sealed, path chosen, escape at a cost (arrows, forgoing the urge to look back). The causal chain is clean with no teleports or soft resets. Cost is legible on the page in the escape beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The canyon materially shapes tactics: its cold enables the frost‑reading, acoustics distort pursuit, the arroyo and sunrise enable escape. Details are purpose‑driven and POV‑filtered (kiln, anneal, boric flame), charging the final image (pendant as “silent beacon of truth”). Weather and terrain alter options; object‑as‑setting (pendant) functions in the ending. Vividness never feels postcard‑decorative because it constrains action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (survive with evidence to reach the council) is clear early and escalates with dawn and approaching hunters. The meaningful tightening arrives with hoofbeats and rising light, forcing a trade‑off between continued decoding or immediate movement; she pays with risk and irrevocable commitment. Agency drives outcome (frost method, route choice, arroyo slip) rather than luck. The costs are scaled to length and felt (arrows, exposure, no looking back).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme coheres around creation/survival sharing a rhythm; the pause as purpose is dramatized by the overnight vigil and measured escape. Recurring images (heat vs. cold, glass vs. blade, resonance) deepen meaning without sermonizing; the final line reframes identity as chosen shape. One or two lines verge on thesis‑statement, but the closing cadence reweights prior material rather than telling us what to think. The irony of her sculptures recast into weapons adds moral texture.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The lyrical, glass‑inflected voice is consistent and character‑specific, with controlled rhythm and selective image choice. Psychic distance modulates smoothly; no head‑hopping or unjustified certainty. Elision is purposeful (we don’t need the entire chase; we get the charged moments). The diction remains plausible for an artist attuned to craft.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is strong, with high information density and purposeful metaphor; cadence varies to match pressure. Minor redundancy (“Stars shimmered… under stars”) and occasional intensifier stacking are the only notable slips. Figurative language stays coherent to the glass/furnace/frost palette, avoiding muddle. Momentum holds without scaffold or loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The frost‑as‑negative to recover scorched ink is a fresh, elegant tactic grounded in character and setting. The glass/forge economy and pendant concealment feel specific rather than templated. The ending’s conceptual reframing (“glass… never doubts the shape it has chosen”) is memorable and earned. Risks in lyric density pay off without obscuring clarity.</comment>
