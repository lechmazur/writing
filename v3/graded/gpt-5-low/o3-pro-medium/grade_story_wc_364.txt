<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Ellan’s motivation and temperament (meek, quietly determined) cleanly drive choices: repairing the hoist, bartering his father’s laugh, then leading communal rebuilding. Interiority is succinct but felt—his end‑beat ache and vow ground the cost. Contradictory impulses (timidity vs. leadership) are present though lightly rendered. The emotional throughline stays legible and earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal chain is tight: quake → need → descent → barter → silk → stitching → communal sacrifice → stabilized arches and vow. Closure lands with visible cost (lost memories) and a reconfigured status quo (the humming, tethered arches). The lens holds under a causal design with lyric texture and the price persists into the final image. Orientation is crisp from the outset with no teleports or unkept setups.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and functionally constraining: floating arches cause the crisis and dictate the fix; shafts house silk and later serve as anchors. Tools, environment, and material properties directly shape tactics and the final image. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through Ellan’s craft‑biased noticing. World rules stay consistent and are learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (stabilize Valagh/rebuild) escalates through concrete costs: Ellan’s memory trade precedes a communal widening of the price. The meaningful tightening arrives when villagers begin sacrificing memories—stakes deepen from personal to collective. Resolution stems from Ellan’s agency rather than luck. The cost is clear and ongoing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Resilience via remembered/forgotten cost, communal artistry, and “meekness as muscle” emerges organically from acts, not sermon. “Azure defiance” coheres as tonal‑thematic glue and charges the ending. One line edges toward thesis (“his meekness had been muscle all along”) but is earned and not reductive. The final vow reframes responsibility and loss without tidy moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third‑person stays close to Ellan while allowing brief, motivated communal apertures. Diction is consistent, image‑driven, and confident without head‑hopping. Rhythm modulates with pressure (measured labor vs. chime‑brightening crescendos). No withholding or register drift undermines credibility.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is lush yet mostly efficient; images carry multiple jobs (tone, world, pressure). A high metaphor density risks purple in spots, but the pattern is taught and clarity holds. Minimal scaffolding or loops; syntax varies with momentum. The final cadence is clean and resonant.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Orchard planet with floating arches, memory‑for‑silk barter, and communal stitching of sky to soil feel singular and inevitable in hindsight. Risks (lyric compression, bold tonal motif) heighten stakes and coherence without obscuring clarity. The barter‑cost reimagines heroism and community with specificity. The closing “lute” arches and vow synthesize concept and feeling freshly.</comment>
