<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mora’s contradictory impulses—caution learned from “inkless letters” versus hunger to shape dawn—are dramatized through tactile choices (inviting the herald, inserting and rotating the wick). The embodied cost (“relieved and condemned”) lands and reconfigures her stance. The herald functions as pressure rather than foil, but their brief partnership reveals motive and value hierarchy. Emotional texture leans lyric over visceral at times, but it remains character‑specific and consistent.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, beats tighten from invitation → insertion → rotation → broadcast, culminating in a Charged Poise: Mora assumes stewardship with cost (“until another keeper takes your place”) as yesterday is consumed to mint tomorrow. Orientation is crisp from the first line; world rules are taught through action. The causal chain remains legible even in lyric mode. Closure is on‑page with a persistent constraint shaping the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The emerald lighthouse and central prism are not backdrop—they are the tool and constraint that make the method possible (total internal reflection, emerald slag vein). Weather and sea actively modulate outcomes (rain seeding “tiny lighthouses”), charging the ending. Sensory detail is precise and POV‑filtered, with maritime instincts (“three degrees east”) grounding the lyric. The setting decisively charges the final image and tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to steer futures and accept the price—is clear and escalates through mechanical engagement (inserting wick, rotation, palms to prism) to world‑level consequence. Pressure coheres via the cost revelation and Mora’s acceptance, foreclosing a more passive witness path. The conflict leans internal and metaphysical over adversarial, but it tightens once meaningfully. Stakes avoid inflation by rooting effect in a constrained method.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: story outlives print; warning braided with creation; stewardship as the true form of prophecy. The final image—guidance emitted as shaped darkness, rain multiplying it—reprices narrative as navigation with a visible cost. No moralizing; the auroral headlines and “yesterday to mint tomorrow” embed the argument in action. Ambiguity is purposeful and resonant without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice sustains metaphor without losing scene logic; POV remains single and stable. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful, with subtext (“finish what the newspapers began”) and tonal differentiation (herald’s octave‑skipping laughter). Rhythm modulates with pressure, especially around the wick’s rotation and the tower’s pivot. A hair’s breadth from over‑lush in places, yet consistently earned by voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density with minimal scaffolding; sentences often do dual duty (world rule + emotion). Figurative language is vivid and largely coherent to the nautical/optical motif (“total internal reflection,” “emerald slag”). No visible looped phrasing or cadence templates; momentum carries through beats. A few dense metaphors brush purple but do not blur causality or the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis feels singular: a lighthouse that inhales starlight to map unborn mornings, guided by laughter that’s “accidentally prophetic.” Optical physics married to myth and media afterlife is fresh and coherent. The risks—lyric density, conceptual stakes—pay off in a specific, inevitable final image. Turns arise from established elements rather than late rule changes.</comment>
