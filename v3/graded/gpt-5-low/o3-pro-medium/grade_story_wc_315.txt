<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Mara’s motive—preserving trust by redirecting violent pressure—drives concrete micro‑choices (breath cadence, leaf‑mapping, revised vectors). Embodiment is specific (buckle, bark biting gloves, muscle memory). A slight competence bias softens contradiction; doubt appears in Command’s hesitation more than in Mara’s interior conflict. Still, her restraint under pressure reads earned and particular.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Clear causal chain: vigil → convoy identified → Command doubts → she reframes via the buckle memory → proposes revised course → acknowledgment → charged final image. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: trust preserved for now; she remains on duty with visible cost (exhaustion, refusal to sleep). Orientation is strong from the first lines; the hybrid causal/lyric lens holds. The cost is on‑page and tied to her endurance and role.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The nocturnal arbor above clouds is vivid and functional: it grants vantage, a leaf as map, and even a felt tilt aligning with her plan. Sensory texture is elegantly selective (moonlight as “silver filigree,” radio static “like glass sanded smooth”). The environment shapes tactics subtly rather than forcing a hard constraint, keeping this just below the highest band. The recurring buckle acts as a micro‑setting object that charges the ending.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear early (prevent mutiny from breaking the ceasefire), with one meaningful tightening: Command’s doubt forces a reframed, risk‑bearing proposal. The reversal is internal/strategic rather than combative, fitting the lens. The felt price is endurance and responsibility, not a dramatic wound, but it charges the final image. Tension sustains at line and beat levels without gimmickry.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme coheres: trust vs. force, pattern and patience as moral stance, memory as tool. The buckle and “soundless echo” motifs reweight the final image without moralizing. The diplomats’ hour gained contextualizes an ethic of nonviolent redirection. Ambiguity remains (perhaps her data, perhaps morning light), enriching the meditation on trust.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyric third‑person closely held to Mara is steady and precise; diction matches a disciplined watcher’s perceptual bias. Dialogue is minimal yet carries subtext (authority’s fatigue; her feather‑light delivery). Rhythm modulates well—lush when scanning, clipped when acting. No head‑hopping or stance wobble.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High information density with controlled imagery; metaphors remain coherent and situation‑true. A few lush turns risk purple but stay motivated by voice and scene (“lock occupies its hinge,” “glass sanded smooth”). Minimal scaffold or loops; syntax varies and propels. Copy is clean, with strong verbs and purposeful compression.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The “arbor watcher above the clouds” frame feels fresh, with muscle‑memory cartography and trust‑preserving tactics as distinctive inflections. The buckle motif as operational memory is a smart, non‑obvious device. Quiet risk‑taking in concept and voice pays off without obscuring clarity. Not revolutionary, but striking and memorable.</comment>
