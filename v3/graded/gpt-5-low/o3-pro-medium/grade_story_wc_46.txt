<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and particular—she seeks “light without fire”—and her micro‑choices (selecting the crescent, escalating the polish, deciding to offer rather than keep) align. Interiority is embodied through tactile action and sense detail. The internal conflict (attachment vs. offering) is present but lightly contested rather than pressured. Still, the renunciation lands credibly for this length.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: sensory density and ritual action build to a resonant reconfiguration as the pearl forms and is released. Orientation is clean by ~120 words (who/where/when) and the scene remains continuous. Closure carries cost on the page—the choice to offer the pearl—reweighting the premise via the villagers’ torchless navigation. Setups (tools, pool, vow) pay off without stray threads.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The grotto, mist, granite table, and hidden pool shape tactics and the final image; environment is not postcard but instrumental. Objects-as-setting (sea glass, driftwood mallet, pearl dust) are used with purpose and bias through Liora’s gaze. The pool specifically constrains the offering method and charges the ending. Sensory choices are selective and coherent with the protagonist’s vocation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Pressure is quiet but coherent: inability to see stars forces reliance on memory; the polishing ritual intensifies until the tear catalyzes the pearl. The decisive tightening is the emergence of stillness and the subsequent renunciation, which forecloses keeping it. Stakes remain internal/ethical rather than perilous, but the cost is legible and tied to her vow. No coincidence resolves the arc; agency drives the turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of guidance without harm and the ethics of illumination arises from actions (snuffed lantern memory → pearl → villagers’ safe return). Recurring images (constellations/spirals/threads) reweight at the end without moralizing. The final image conceptually reprices “light” with restraint and communal consequence. Ambiguity is meaningful, not muddy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A distinct, lyrical perceptual signature—star‑watcher lexicon, tidal and reflective metaphors—stays consistent and controlled. Psychic distance modulates with pressure without head‑hopping. Purposeful elision is taught early and paid off (zephyr bloom). No dialogue needed; voice carries action and subtext.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is strong: varied syntax, multi‑function sentences, and high information density with momentum. Figurative language is plentiful yet coherent to the world; few, if any, paraphrase loops. Occasional lushness edges purple but remains legible and purposeful, especially in peak beats. The final cadence is clean and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis—sea‑glass ritual, “pearl of stillness,” zephyr bloom as tone—feels singular and inevitable in hindsight. Risks in lyric density and world texture heighten rather than obscure stakes. Familiar motifs (grotto, constellations) are transformed through specific, non‑obvious choices. The closure image is memorable and fresh.</comment>
