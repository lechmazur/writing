<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Oswald’s curiosity, reverence for the lighthouse, and patient eccentricity cohere into a specific, embodied interiority. His micro‑choices (pinning the Edelweiss, shutting his eyes to “listen to gaps,” prying the board carefully) reveal a value hierarchy. The contradiction—solitary devotion versus the intimacy he’s asked to guard—surfaces credibly at the ampoule. The final acceptance reads as an earned endurance with a felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural with clean causal steps: gesture → method of gaps → visions → discovery → stewardship. Orientation is immediate (keeper, dock, twilight), and the riddle escalates into a tangible find that reconfigures duty. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he assumes custodianship, reweighting his isolation. The cost—taking on another’s intimate memory during war—registers on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The maritime setting is vivid and POV-filtered (“sea whispered like torn silk,” “opal dock in mist”) and actively shapes action (gaps between waves/gull calls, prying between planks). The lighthouse lens and Deneb alignment charge the ending image and constrain choice. Environmental texture mirrors interior pressure without feeling symbolic on-the-nose. The recurring objects (dock, lens, ampoule) are integrated and functional.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around decoding the gesture; the key tightening is the decision to trust the “gaps” method, which yields visions and the ampoule. Stakes remain intimate but tangible: whether he can find and keep what was entrusted—and what that costs him. The decision to keep and place the ampoule (not chase the stranger) forecloses an alternative path. Tension is quiet but sustained, appropriate for the chosen lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Themes of witnessed isolation, custodianship of memory, and simultaneity (“fingers closed… palm opened”) surface organically through action and image. The Edelweiss/altitude vs. sea/war counterpoint earns the emotional repricing at the end. No sermonizing; the final beam’s promise reframes solitude as service. The war note adds gravity without commandeering the scene.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinct lyric voice with controlled rhythms and consistent psychic distance; the diction matches a contemplative keeper. Patterned elision (listening to gaps) is taught and paid off. Prose confidence stays within POV plausibility even in heightened metaphor. No head-hopping or stance drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line-craft is lush yet purposeful; images do double duty for mood and plot. Occasional high-color metaphors risk saturation, but coherence and momentum hold, and loops are avoided. Syntax varies to pace discovery and the closing cadence. The final image is clean and undulled by ornament.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The “observing gaps” method to borrow memories, the Edelweiss war-laden intimacy, and lighthouse-as-steward synthesis feel singular. Turns arise from established premises rather than late rule-changes. The risk—high-lyric mode married to a quiet, coded mystery—pays off with clarity. The closure image feels both fresh and inevitable.</comment>
