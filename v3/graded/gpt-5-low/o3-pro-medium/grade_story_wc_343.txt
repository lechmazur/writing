<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Aleksei’s drive to “chart the next great discovery” is clear and enacted through specific, tactile choices (kneeling, brushing grit, logging squares). Interiority is character‑particular (polyglot phrasebook as talisman; “sociable isolation” as credo). The relationship with Mirelle adds subtle pressure and trust stakes without crowding the POV. Internal conflict is light, but his solitude vs. need to be heard shades the final stance credibly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Hybrid with an accumulative drift: observation→pattern→test→course change→discovery. Closure lands on the page when they bank into the invisible corridor and reach the luminous island; the cost is modest but present (risk, lost sleep, captain’s trust). Orientation is clean from the first lines. The hopscotch grid and birds form a consistent logic that pays off causally at dawn.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The airship deck and hopscotch board are not backdrop; they function as an astrolabe, constraining and enabling the choice to steer. Sensory texture is vivid and selective (“stranded luminance,” “percolating chicory”) filtered through a map apprentice’s perception. World rules (lights correlating with birds) are learned through action, not exposition. Scale and spatial choreography are coherent throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—proving a discovery—tightens as observation becomes a navigational commitment when Mirelle asks, “Where… steer?” The decisive choice forecloses safer drift in favor of an uncharted corridor. Pressure is mostly epistemic; the price is risk and exhaustion rather than loss, which keeps the band below top tiers. Still, the escalation from noting to steering is clear and earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Themes of translation (speech/maps) and “sociable isolation” accrue through objects and acts and culminate in the final realization and image. The phrasebook marginalia and hopscotch grid reweight “language” as a way to read the sky. One line veers near didactic (“not a contradiction but a compass”), slightly flattening ambiguity. Nonetheless, the ending image resonates without overt moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>A consistent, lyrical third‑person close carries a distinct perceptual signature (cartographic and musical metaphors). Diction matches character and world; brief dialogue is crisp and status‑aware. Rhythm modulates well between awe and decision. No head‑hopping or stance leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is lush yet mostly efficient; images often do double duty (luminance as physics and metaphor). A few metaphoric stacks flirt with excess, but clarity and propulsion hold. Minimal redundancy and clean mechanics keep momentum. The final cadence lands cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: a dusty hopscotch board as navigational instrument, birds conducting “sky music,” and an apprentice reading it through a phrasebook’s margins. The discovery arises from prior particulars rather than a late rule. Risk‑taking is evident without gimmickry. Emotional truth is modest but specific and integrated.</comment>
