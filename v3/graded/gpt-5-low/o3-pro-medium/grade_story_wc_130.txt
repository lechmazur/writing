<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Eridian’s motive—to model grief without leakage—drives every choice, and “gently inventive” is dramatized through the glass eyes, lute, and irrigation redesign. His restraint versus yearning (not calling Lio back but reshaping time) creates credible internal tension. The final refusal to seek return, thanking silence instead, feels earned and costly. Interiority is concrete and character‑specific without therapy‑speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive holds: mosaic → refracted eyes → rhythmic translation → irrigation redesign. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing—loss becomes a continuing function—paid for by renouncing closure. Orientation is clean early (conjurer, karst orchard at night). Setups pay off (eyes reprise as sentinels; drips become Hope Fractions).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The cavern orchard and stalactite drips are vivid and functionally constrain tactics; drip intervals become both code and irrigation logic. Objects (mosaic, eyes, lute) are fully integrated and charge the final image. World rules are consistent and learned via action. Sensory texture supports the elegiac tone without drifting into tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Pressure deepens through density and pattern linkage rather than confrontation: the cipher coheres, the orchard answers, and the tactic shifts from solution to rhythm. The cost—the acceptance of ongoing absence—narrows options by foreclosing summoning or closure. Gentle escalation fits the lens, though overt reversal is minimal. The earned irrigation redesign serves as the concrete stake shift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly from particulars: grief converses with growth; equations become lullabies when solved by listening. The final thanks to silence resists moralizing and reweights all prior images. Subtext hums in the two hands sigil and “Hope Fractions,” avoiding tidy answers. The resonance is durable and non‑didactic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A single, controlled lyric POV with distinct perceptual signature and math‑mystic diction. Rhythm and syntax modulate with discovery and hush; no head‑hopping or register slips. Purposeful elision (years of loss) is paid off by on‑page micro‑choices. Confidence and modesty of knowledge remain plausible to the focalizer.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is dense yet clear; images (parabolas as smiles, integrals as sighs) are fresh and coherent. Minimal scaffold or loops; sentences carry multiple jobs. The lushness skirts, but does not cross, purple; cadence supports momentum into the closing image. Mechanics are clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High‑original synthesis: karst orchard physics braided with emotional mathematics; taxidermist eyes completing a mosaic cipher is striking and purposeful. The turn to rhythm over closure feels both inevitable and non‑obvious. Risks are cohesive and pay off in form and theme. Specificity makes the premise feel singular rather than trope‑bent.</comment>
