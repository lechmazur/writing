<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara’s motive (to recover a rhythm of belonging) is clear and embodied in specific choices: placing the feather, insisting “we listen harder,” and finally renouncing the relic. A credible internal tension surfaces at the airlock when she hesitates over whether the feather belongs with her or the city. Emotions register through tactile acts (trembling fingers, shared exhale, tears) rather than labels. Lio adds light pressure and mirroring without diluting her agency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hybrid drive with accumulative lyric deepening anchored by causal steps: arrival → calibration via breath → feather unlocks archives → cosmic reply → timed exit under alarms. Closure lands via Earned Stasis/Resonant Reconfiguration: she returns the feather, accepting loss to gain belonging. The surface sunrise clock and defense-grid inversion impose concrete constraints and cost. Orientation is clean from the outset and consistently maintained.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The underwater facility is vivid and functional: pressure doors, kelp smell, shattered glass, algal lanterns, and defense-grid timing all shape choices. Objects-as-setting (feather as keystone; projectors; mosaic aligned to Leo) constrain tactics and charge the ending image. The environment evolves with action (beam piercing seawater; shutters eclipsing starlight). Specificity serves both texture and plot without excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (harvest what the city will share before sunrise) tightens with the alarm and power inversion, forcing a trade-off. Agency drives the escalation: the ritual breath, alignment, and the decision to leave the feather. The felt cost is clear and the options narrow under time pressure. Stakes remain intimate yet credible, with no luck-driven resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Belonging emerges through image and act—breath-synced shrimp, star/avenue overlays, the keystone feather—and culminates in a resonant renunciation. The line “Belong, the city sang” edges toward on-the-nose but is offset by the final reframing (“belonging is rhythm… between notes”) and the sunrise ascent. Subtext operates in ritual and exchange, not moralizing. The final image reweights prior motifs with durable ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third-person close maintains a distinct perceptual signature: oceanic lexicon, instrumentality, and wonder. Dialogue is spare, natural, and purposeful, with subtle status harmony between Mara and Lio. Rhythm modulates under pressure without head-hopping or register slips. Patterned lyricism is taught early and paid off cleanly at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lines carry high information density with minimal scaffolding; images do double duty (e.g., “luminous avenues” both map and mood). Figurative language is coherent and purposeful; no mixed-metaphor clutter at peak beats. Variations in syntax and pacing support momentum through alarm to exit. Minor phrase recurrence (“softly ingenious”) is stylized rather than redundant.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: “landscape astrologer,” breath-calibrated bioluminescence as ritual interface, and a wildfire feather as underwater keystone. The piece risks a richly metaphorical system and follows its implications to a concrete cost. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight under the taught rules. The vision reads singular rather than stitched from tropes.</comment>
