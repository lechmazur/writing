<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Karima’s motive—to restore “missing hours” by assembling gaps—is clear and enacted through concrete choices (placing the valve, structuring recalls, promising a cadence). Interiority is particular and embodied through sensory bias and occupational lens. Internal contradiction is subtle (visionary ambition vs. humility/patience) but not strongly pressured on the page. The cost is implied (time, endurance), not directly dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from harbor atmosphere to council test to charged nightly practice, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration that reweights “absence” as host for memory. Orientation is clean from the first lines; stakes and objective are explicit via the chair’s ask. Closure lands with the city’s healing reframed as cadence rather than decree, with an earned cost in ongoing labor and time. The arc is quiet but cohesive, with no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The ivory harbor and weather infuse action and choice; the room above tide‑mark and wind through the valve charge the final image. Sensory selection is purposeful (smell of “pages too long closed,” bell intervals) and filtered by a memory‑minded archivist. The recurring object (valve) functions as micro‑setting and constraint. World rules are consistent and learned through observation rather than exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (returning meaning to a city) is pressured by the council’s demand and uncertainty. Escalation deepens through the silent demonstration that elicits communal fragments and the promise of “staggered intervals,” which narrows options to patience and process. Cost is present but soft (commitment to non‑calendar tides; ongoing work) rather than a sharp loss. Still, the vote hinge and method‑commitment produce a credible tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Themes of absence-as-architecture, communal memory, and rhythm as healing arise organically from particulars (valve as “room,” staggered intervals, lattice of scraps). The ending reweights the premise: exile ends not by decree but by quiet, shared cadence—a conceptual repricing without moralizing. Subtext accrues in silences, sensory motifs, and institutional unease. No sermonizing; resonance lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinctive, controlled first‑person voice with a clear perceptual signature (archival/music lexicon) remains stable. Diction and rhythm modulate with scene pressure—lush but legible, with purposeful elision. Dialogue is sparse, natural, and functional (“return their missing hours”). No head‑hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is rich and efficient; images often do double duty (salt bookmarking, benches as ribs). Figurative density is high but coherent within a sea/music system; momentum holds. Minimal redundancy; syntax varies and breathes with the piece. A hair from over‑lush in places, but clarity and propulsion remain intact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: an “ocean‑spray archivist” using a broken trumpet valve to curate communal silence and memory is striking and cohesive. Risks (lyric accumulation, conceptual method as action) pay off with a singular stance and charged ending. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight given the established pattern of absence as medium. Specificity and authenticity lift it above trope.</comment>
