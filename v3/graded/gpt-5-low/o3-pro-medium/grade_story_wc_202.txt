<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Irida’s motive—to honor overlooked histories—drives every choice, from barter to relinquishment, with embodied moments (“weight of future errands bent her knees”). Interiority is specific and sensorial, showing how she maps sound to shade rather than abstract labels. Internal contradiction is modest (devotion vs. the cost of surrender), with little messy friction beyond resolve. The relationship with Aven supports rather than pressures, limiting crucible dynamics.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the object is acquired, the vision deepens via painting, then necessity tightens to “return to water,” forcing the sky substitution. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing and Resonant Reconfiguration when the shard dissolves into “pure direction,” with the cost of surrender explicit. Orientation is clean early (alchemist’s market, rooftop bridges, lens), and beats link coherently. The pressure is lyric rather than causal, but turns are motivated and legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The elevated market and rope bridges are vivid and tactically consequential, forcing the choice to lift the shard to the “sky’s deeper water” when the river is unreachable. The lens functions as a charged micro‑setting and tool, shaping light and the final image. Sensory specificity is strong across sight, sound, and tactility (chains, humming cords, surf). World rules emerge through action without exposition bloat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—translate and deliver the sea’s dialect before dawn—tightens through the discovery that the work won’t finish until return to water. The climb and river‑is‑too‑far beat coherently narrows options, pushing the moon gambit and the surrender of the shard. Cost is visible (relinquishment, exhaustion, future burden). The escalation is primarily deepening and cadence‑shift, but it convincingly reweights options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme coheres: memory vs. translation into action, the lighthouse “changing address,” and art as vessel for overlooked histories. The final dissolution into “direction” reprices possession vs. service without moralizing. Recurring images (light dialects, anchors of intuition, rooftops/sea/sky) gain weight at closure. A single explicit line of statement (“promise…never failed”) is earned by the scene and does not flatten subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The voice is singular, lyrical, and confidently filtered through Irida’s perceptual bias (light as language), with consistent distance and no head‑hopping. Diction and rhythm modulate with pressure (market to surf to moon), and the scant dialogue carries subtext and function. Elevated register fits the world and character. No withholding or omniscience slips beyond the established lyric mode.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lines are dense yet purposeful; most sentences perform multiple jobs (world, action, theme). Occasional lushness skirts purple but stays controlled by image logic and momentum; redundancy is minimal. Syntax varies and the cadence accelerates at key turns without muddling clarity. No major artifacts or loops dull the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: translating light’s “dialects,” a painter as smuggler of meaning, and the moon as alternate “water” for a lighthouse shard. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight under established rules. The risk‑taking lyric frame heightens stakes and coherence without obscuring meaning. The specific object logic and thematic integration read singular rather than templated.</comment>
