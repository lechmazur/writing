<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Arlen’s motive (to catch the goddess’s echo) is clear, and his internal contradiction—hunter’s hunger versus ethical release—tightens credibly at the star‑warning beat. Embodied, character‑specific perception (“reading interference lines,” hush that “bruised the ribs”) grounds emotion without labels. The final renunciation feels earned by prior tactics and reveals cost (relinquishing the rarest catch). Minor note: he’s highly competent with limited visible error, but the hesitation suffices at this length.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure intensifies via density shifts (snarled melody → fracture arrival → constellations’ warning) toward an on‑page choice. Closure is a Decisive Change/Earned Stasis: pulling the spike forecloses the capture path with felt cost and reconfigures the world back to equilibrium. Orientation is clear early (who/where/when), and all set‑ups (net, spike, voice of silence) pay off. The persistent constraint of the window “when patterns break themselves” shapes tactics and timing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The sound wave garden is vivid, rule‑driven, and tactically active: hedges, basin, and “soil of echoes” directly condition how Arlen nets silence. Tools-as-setting (resonant wire, rail spike) constrain choice and charge the final image when removal reverses the capture. Sensory selection is purposeful across sight, sound, taste (“copper and lullabies”), with environmental response (“ultraviolet petals”) tracking consequences. The world’s logic stays consistent through action rather than exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capture vs harm to a living echo) escalates coherently: setup desire → capture → constellations’ sky‑warning → release. The tightening is unmistakable, and the visible price (letting go) charges the end. Internal and external pressures interweave—his gift amplifies both temptation and empathy. Slightly low on secondary costs (no lost tool or injury), but unnecessary at this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme arises organically: translation’s limits, the ethics of capture, and freedom over possession. Recurrent images (lullaby, silence, net/spike) reweight at the end—“some songs refuse translation” reframes the premise without moralizing. Subtext lands via gesture (gratitude hidden in ache) and the conceptual compass humming toward “unspoken shores.” The final image offers a resonant, non‑literal answer to the central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>A controlled, distinctive lyric voice filtered through Arlen’s perceptual signature (sound-as-physical terrain) remains stable. Rhythm modulates with pressure; diction is elevated yet consistent with the fable‑like frame. No dialogue needed; interior certainty matches what he can infer. Elision is purposeful and paid off (silence voiced, then released).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High information density with fresh metaphors that cohere to the sound/echo motif; lines carry multiple jobs without scaffold. Variation in syntax and paragraph rhythm sustains momentum; minimal redundancy. A luxuriant texture skirts purple but remains controlled and clear in peak beats. No loops or template cadences dull the closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis—fishing vibrations in a sound garden, a goddess who “voices silence,” sleepwalking constellations that issue a warning—feels singular and inevitable in hindsight. Turns arise from established rules and Arlen’s choices, not late contrivance. The ethical reweighting is earned and avoids safety hedging. Bold risk in concept and diction heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
