<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s motive (to test and possibly repair trust) is concrete and her micro-choices—climbing, writing in snow, revealing the gear—align with a cautious-but-bold temperament. Interiority is embodied in tactile actions (cold fingers, sutured tension) rather than labels. The relationship crucible with Elias tightens convincingly, with status parity and mutual scars. A minor softness: inner contradiction is present but mostly lyrical, not pressured into a near-failure before the repair.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Hybrid drive leaning causal: coded summons → confrontation → gear repair → decision “go west, together.” Closure lands on-page as a Resonant Reconfiguration anchored by the click and the snow-written directive, with cost (shared burns, risk, history) legible. Orientation is clean by ~120 words (who/where/when are crisp), and the scene stays within one continuous window. No teleports or logic gaps; the final image meaningfully reweights the opening setup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The bluff, mist, and accumulated snow are not decorative—they enable the cipher, enforce secrecy, and physically affect action (cold-stiff fingers). The pillbox functions as a charged micro-setting/tool that constrains the repair beat and charges the ending image against Mara’s pulse. Weather and thaw time (melting codes by noon) subtly shape tactics and tone. Specificity and POV-filtered detail are purposeful throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around whether trust can be repaired enough to move forward, escalating through the cipher test to the fine-motor risk of the repair. The hinge is the click—small but decisive—and the snow-line “go west, together” forecloses separation. Cost is primarily emotional and reputational; external resistance is gentle, so the escalation feels finely tuned rather than harrowing. Still, the tightening is clear and earned under the hybrid lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>“Fixing what’s broken” is dramatized through the gear/time wound and not just asserted; the click reweights the premise without sentimentality. Recurring images (snow codes, burns, thaw) accrue and then shift meaning in the final descent. One overt thematic line (“Fixing what's broken…”) skews slightly declarative, but the surrounding scene work earns it. The ending invites reflection beyond the plot without closing ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The lyric voice is controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature and clean, consistent focalization. Dialogue is sparse but precise, carrying subtext (“I remember,” “go west, together”). Rhythm modulates from hush to a brighter cadence at closure without head‑hopping or register drift. Patterned diction (“silver hush,” thaw/time) is taught early and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High information density with images doing multiple jobs (tone, theme, action). Figurative language is abundant but coherent and purposeful; metaphors are aligned (ice, thaw, time, machinery) with minimal purple leakage. No scaffold loops or template cadences; syntax varies. Minor lushness remains, but it doesn’t obscure causality or dull the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The spy-reunion premise is freshly inflected by the snow‑cipher and mechanical repair as embodiments of trust and time. The pillbox/gear as “tooth broken from time” is a memorable synthesis. Risks in heightened lyric tone pay off with coherence and a specific final image. The turns feel inevitable in hindsight given the established tools and setting.</comment>
