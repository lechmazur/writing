<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and particular—the oath’s pull versus the impulse to intervene is dramatized through concrete choices (entering the refuge, surrendering journals, choosing the boat). Contradictory impulses act in scene: neutrality as treason versus neutrality as vow. Emotional texture is embodied (“thought fled my skull like startled pigeons”) rather than labeled. The final endurance (witnessing over acting) forecloses a path with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds cleanly: patterned images (swan, silence, glass, flood) reweight the stake until a Charged Poise close. Closure lands with cost—journals sacrificed, city un-warned, the witness commits to watching from the river. Orientation is clear early (library/catacombs → refuge → river), with one purposeful transition. The regenerative silence and flood persist as constraints shaping the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is specific, tactile, and constraining: catacombs yield the swan; the obsidian refuge alters cognition and consumes the journals; the flood narrows options. Recurring objects charge the end (glass parting, refuge dimming to a shard). Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered, with consistent world rules learned through action. Environment directly guides choices at key turns.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—witness versus intervention—is signaled early and tightens notably when floodwaters rise and the refuge digests the journals. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: entering the wall, relinquishing records, choosing the boat. The price (not warning the city; accepting neutrality) is legible and carried into the final stance. Pressure remains coherent without contrived antagonists.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of memory, neutrality, and renewal emerges through specific events (regenerative silence, origins in catacombs, the boat of blanked paper) rather than thesis. The final image conceptually reprices neutrality—witnessing as costly endurance, not abdication. Minimal explicit statement avoids sermonizing; resonance lingers in the charged poise of “lanterns ahead” beneath a failing sky. Counter-readings (silence as complicity or balm) remain plausible.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A singular, controlled voice fuses perception and rhythm; diction is consistent with a lyric, self-aware chronicler. Psychic distance modulates purposefully at pressure peaks (thought loss in the glass, oath recollection). No head-hopping or register slips; patterned elision is taught and paid off. The perceptual signature (object-as-portal logic, ruminative metaphors) remains stable.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lines carry high information density with few redundancies; metaphors are largely coherent and advance sense. A lushness borders on saturation in places, but rhythm varies and momentum holds. Syntax is clean and purposeful; no significant loops or filter stacks dull the closure. The final third stays crisp and image-driven.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Striking synthesis—origami swan as map and boat, a womb-like refuge of regenerative silence, and a chronicler’s oath—feels fresh and inevitable by closure. Risks in structure and imagery heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. Turns arise from established logic rather than late rule changes. The vision reads singular and fully committed.</comment>
