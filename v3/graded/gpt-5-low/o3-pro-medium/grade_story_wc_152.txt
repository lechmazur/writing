<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Selis’s motive—preserving and decoding hidden knowledge—is clear and consistently enacted through concrete craft choices. The foolishness-as-cloak is dramatized (the dropped spool; the “winter curtain” lie) and plays against Voren’s status with credible subtext. Emotional texture is embodied via tactile work (thread, silk, flame) rather than labels. Internal contradiction is present but not deeply contested under peak pressure, keeping this just short of exceptional.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hybrid drive with a causal dominance holds: embroidery → revelation method → Voren’s intrusion/confiscation → candle-enabled reconstruction → decision window. Closure lands as a charged poise: she departs to act within a two-hour vulnerability, with the felt cost of exposure and the loss of her daybook. Orientation is crisp from the opening and the single-scene structure stays coherent. A hair more on-page consequence would push it past the band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The observatory, rotating roof, brass frame, and eternal candle are not decorative; they supply resources, constrain tactics, and charge the finale. The autumn fog and “echoed silence” infuse tone while the roof’s synchronization and shutters’ closing concretize the arc. Details are POV-filtered through an artisan’s sensibility. World rules (candle revealing inks/dyes) are learned via action and stay consistent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes (preserve knowledge/expose conspiracies before a coup) are present early and tighten decisively when Voren arrives and confiscates the daybook. The consequent adaptation (using ink traces and adjacent possibilities) earns the final actionable intel and dawn clock. Prices—lost tools, heightened scrutiny, compressed time—are legible. Slight abstraction of danger keeps the pressure a notch shy of visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Themes—truth versus misinformation, art as resistance, and wisdom masked as folly—arise through image and tactic, not thesis. The eternal candle and “adjacent possibilities” refract into a meditation on how knowledge survives authoritarian pressure. The final laugh-and-move beat reweights earlier “echoed silence” into charged resolve. Complexity remains without false balance or tidy moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice matches Selis’s perceptual signature (tactile, luminous, craft-focused) without drifting into abstraction. Dialogue is sparse, goal-driven, and status-aware; Voren’s bluntness contrasts Selis’s airy deflection. Psychic distance remains stable; elisions are purposeful and paid off. Rhythm varies to suit turns, maintaining clarity under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density with images doing double duty: tools, actions, and atmosphere carry plot and theme. Figurative language is rich but coherent; no paraphrase loops or template cadences dull momentum. Syntax and paragraphing modulate tension cleanly, especially across the Voren intrusion and the closing departure. Minor lushness never obscures cause/effect or the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The fusion of embroidery, astronomy, and intelligence work via an “eternal candle” and “adjacent possibilities” feels fresh and earned. The Marshal scene avoids cliché by leveraging misread status, not overt confrontation. The closing image (observatory shutters, foolishness as cloak) feels inevitable in hindsight. Boldness is integrated with clarity rather than gimmickry.</comment>
