<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira’s motive is clear and particular—retrieve “unused love” and return it—and her micro‑choices (gloving up, pressing a frame to her brow, choosing to project) align. Interiority is vivid and embodied (“hands trembling with tender responsibility”). Internal contradiction is minimal; she rarely wavers or pays a sharp emotional price beyond letting go. The change—she departs carrying no unused love—lands but with a gentle cost profile.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: the corridor of letters, projector, and emergent tune densify toward a cadence shift when the images and music free the paused love. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: unused love is not stored but circulated, and Mira releases her own. Orientation is clean from the first lines; causality is lyric but coherent (relic → reading → projection → release). The felt cost is subtle yet legible in her goodbye notes and relinquishment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The projection booth and its tools constrain and enable action: the motor hides the tune; the reel’s fragility dictates gloves and careful threading; the screen provides the ritual space for release. Sensory detail is purposeful, with thunder/hum integrating atmosphere and function. The setting charges the final image as the city hums the new melody. Specificity serves both tactic and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes are singular—freeing unused love—and escalate via the corridor discovery to the projection choice and the music reveal. Pressure stays coherent under the accumulative lens, but opposition is soft and success is relatively unresisted. The key tightening is the decision to project the never‑shown film, narrowing options with responsibility for fragile artifacts. Cost remains more conceptual than visceral, tempering peak tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme coheres: love paused between sender and receiver becomes circulation through enactment, not lecture, culminating in her gift of letters to future dreamers. Recurring images (letters, ink, hum/thunder, incubation) shift meaning at the end. A slight ding for an explicit thesis line (“Unused love had found storage unnecessary; it preferred circulation”) that states what the images already earn. Subtext otherwise runs through silence and tactile ritual.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The lyric third‑person close is consistent and confident, with a distinct perceptual signature (“corridor of light,” “ink glowed phosphorescent”). Rhythm modulates with pressure: the hush/hum/drone motif gathers and then loosens at closure. No head‑hopping or stance wobble; inference reads as inference. Compression teaches its pattern early and pays it off cleanly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lines carry high information density with minimal scaffold; images often do double duty (mechanical drone as hidden tune). Figurative texture is rich but largely controlled and legible; repetition of hush/thunder functions as pattern, not bloat. No notable loops or paraphrase redundancy. A few near‑abstract aphorisms brush sentimentality but don’t dull the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Combining psychometry with a vintage projector whose motor hides a melody is striking and earned. The goodbye‑letters-as-wallpaper, paused love as breath, and incubation motif synthesize into a fresh, inevitable turn. Risks in conceit and diction heighten resonance without obscuring clarity. The final city‑hum echo refreshes familiar “release” arcs with specific ingenuity.</comment>
