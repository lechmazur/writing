<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Silas’s motives (redeeming the father’s name by “threading a labyrinth with your own story”) are concrete and drive every micro‑choice. His contradictory impulses—chase hush to erase memory vs. face the patrol to share story—culminate in an earned renunciation. Embodied action (hovering steps, setting the lattice, then shaking corridors straight) reveals character under pressure. The cost of refusing escape reads on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Clean single‑scene causal build: hush → secret chamber → lattice‑labyrinth → approaching patrol → renunciation. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: he forecloses the escape into the labyrinth and reorients to communal truth at a cost. Orientation is crisp from the first lines; the warden’s arrival tightens options without coincidence solving anything. The final image reconfigures stakes without exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The lighthouse prison, copperlight protocol, narrow door, and brine‑dark undercells are vivid and pressure choices. Environment constrains access (ajar door, spiral stairs) and enables the impossibility engine (lantern, hush) that shapes tactics. The confessional lattice functions as micro‑setting, charging the ending when handed to the warden. Dawn’s shift from copper to gold reweights tone and meaning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—escape into self‑myth vs. stay to face consequence—tightens with the patrol’s approach. The decisive turn (collapsing the labyrinth into one straight passage) forecloses a live option and carries cost. Internal and external pressures interweave coherently; tension rises at sentence and beat levels. Slight abstraction at mid‑labyrinth lyricism softens immediacy briefly but not materially.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of story as communal bond versus escapist self‑erasure emerges through action (confessional lattice, hush’s lure, patrol’s pause). The ending’s repricing—“stories were meant to be shared”—is resonant though one line verges on explicit thesis. Inheritance and confession subtext thread cleanly; the copper→gold tonal shift seals the moral cost without tidy sentimentalism. Ambiguity remains around the prison’s secrets, which enriches without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyrical third‑person closely held to Silas, with a consistent perceptual signature (“hush breathing backwards,” “chains like broken harp strings”). The rhythm modulates under pressure without head‑hopping or register slips. Purposeful elision (world rules taught through image) stays legible through closure. Dialogue is minimal and used precisely to alter pressure (the warden’s pause).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High information density with minimal scaffold; images do multiple jobs (confessional lattice as key, compass, and petition). Lyric figures are fresh and coherent; no muddled metaphors in peak beats. Cadence varies to maintain propulsion; no paraphrase loops or filter stacks. A touch of saturation in mid‑section (“corridors within corridors”) skirts purple but remains clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>“Chasing hush” as a navigational ethic, a confessional lattice as engine, and the lighthouse‑prison blend yield a singular synthesis. The central renunciation reframes the fable of “cry wolf” with unexpected grace and consequence. Risks in diction and concept pay off in a precise, felt closure. The object and tone reprises feel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
