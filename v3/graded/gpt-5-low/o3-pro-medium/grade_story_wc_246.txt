<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Clear motive (atoning for prior harm) and credible internal conflict (urge to fix vs. choice to accompany) drive micro‑choices from pricking the finger to uncoupling the pen. Interiority is specific and character‑particular, not diagnostic. The renunciation forecloses a path with felt cost (retiring the tool and ambition). A hairline softness remains around how brittle “faith” concretely impedes tactics before the turn.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single‑scene accumulative structure tightens from attempt (rekindle and edit) to ethic debate to decisive renunciation. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: the pen’s final bead seals limited edits; the narrator commits to listening with a conceptual price. Orientation is firm by line one; no lens ambiguity. Because/therefore is less central than cadence/intensification, but the cost is undeniable on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The anomaly, basalt shard, and sideways gravity are vivid and functional—providing ink, anchoring movement, and charging the final comma image. The pen and environment operate as micro‑setting constraints shaping choices. Sensory detail (ruby filament, iris flare) is selective and purpose‑driven. World rules feel consistent within the lyric frame.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to keep editing reality—tightens coherently as the pulses escalate and the basalt “disapproves,” pressing an ethical decision. The turn (“do not laugh, listen”) narrows options and forces a trade‑off. The price (foregoing corrective power) is legible and reweights the ending. Slightly abstracted stakes keep it just shy of maximal bite.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Themes of control vs. accompaniment and commas as humane pauses integrate through recurring images and culminate in the closing comma/anomaly. The final choice offers a resonant, non‑literal answer without a tidy moral. One line edges toward thesis‑speak (“history disliked being corrected”), softening subtext a touch. Overall, resonance is earned by particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A distinct, coherent lyric voice with disciplined metaphoric palette (“spacetime vellum,” “aging diplomat”) sustains POV integrity. Modulation under pressure is controlled, with cadence shifts matching turns. No head‑hopping or register drift. Density never confuses scene logic.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentence‑level craft is strong: varied rhythm, high information density, and purposeful imagery. Minor risk of metaphor accumulation, but vehicles remain aligned and do multi‑work. No notable loops or scaffold; transitions carry momentum. Final image is clean and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The cosmic copyeditor conceit—editing commas of existence—feels fresh, specific, and thematically integral. Risks (lyric density, conceptual closure) pay off without obscuring clarity. Turns grow inevitably from seeded images (pen, pulses, commas) into a reweighted stance. Memorable synthesis elevates beyond trope inversion.</comment>
