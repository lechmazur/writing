<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Clear, consistent motivation (preserving ancient methods) drives Sera’s choices, and her patience is dramatized through waiting, decoding, and the final vow. Interiority is concrete and particular (“I believed patience could coax truth out of silence”). The lack of pronounced internal contradiction keeps it shy of the top band, but endurance-as-choice lands credibly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hybrid with an Accumulative/Textural dominance: rope → storm-struck dune → fulgurite → vow forms a coherent causal sequence inside a lyric frame. Closure arrives as Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: she assumes guardianship and defers sowing until the world is ready, with a felt cost. Orientation is clean from the opening and the set-ups pay off without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Harbor, fog, snow, rope, skiff, and fulgurite are vivid and POV-filtered; the rope and glass constrain options and charge the final image. Details evolve with action (lightning strike reshapes the dune; glowing fulgurite guides return). Strong sensory economy with purpose, with the “golden dock under snow” effectively bookending tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The pressure is quiet but coherent: the decoding choice narrows options and the lightning discovery deepens stakes into stewardship. The visible price is patience and deferred action, scaled to length. Escalation is more deepening than reversal, limiting peak intensity but remaining earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Themes of patience, relay, and reading the world’s knots accrue through concrete actions and close on a resonant vow. “Some wisdom grows only by relay...” elegantly crystallizes the piece, though the final aphoristic sentences edge toward explicitness. The reinterpretation of “weavers” as instructions reweights prior images.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A distinct, lyrical first-person voice with controlled cadence and precise diction; dialogue is sparse yet characterful (the fisherman’s rope line). POV certainty remains within what Sera can infer. Rhythm modulates well from harbor hush to storm strike to vow without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High information density with images doing multiple jobs (rope as language, lightning as loom); minimal scaffolding and no damaging loops. Lyric flourish is sustained but not purple to the point of blur; metaphors stay coherent to sea, rope, storm, seed domains. Closing lines are clean and rhythmically satisfying.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: decoding knot-grammar as wayfinding to fulgurite-sealed seed, and “weavers” as weather-instructions. Risks (mythic-lyric mode with quiet stakes) pay off with specificity and a charged final poise. A rare angle on maritime lore and botany that feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
