<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Clear, character‑particular interiority with a live contradiction—curiosity versus respect—drives the mid‑scene choice to read and the closing risk to quote. Embodied detail (goggles fogging, fingers on brass) grounds emotion. The status dynamic with Auden shifts credibly from servant/master to tentative peers. Stakes remain intimate but felt, with exile risk and ethical trespass acknowledged.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: the ascent frames a tightening window; the stall and discovery reweight options; the light‑triggered unlock is a clean because/therefore. Closure lands as a Charged Poise: quoting the diary line alters the relationship on the page with cost (possible exposure, moral breach). Orientation is crisp by 120 words and holds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The icebound spire, rattling elevator, frost, and scattered light are not postcard decor; they enable the unlock (light through mesh) and charge the final teapot/sunrise image. Sensory specificity is high across touch, sight, and sound (whale‑groan, purred cogs). Environment constrains time and choice through the ten‑floor ascent. World rules feel consistent and integrated.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—bridge or preserve distance—tightens via the found diary and the imminent arrival clock. The narrator’s agency escalates from restraint to ethically fraught action (reading) to the risky, subtextual quotation. The cost is quiet but legible; what’s missing is a sharper external pinch beyond the clock to push toward a more perilous inflection.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Themes of pain transmuted by attention, consent versus trespass, and finding joy “beneath anguish” emerge through concrete events (light unlocking tenderness; returned line easing Auden’s guard). The final shared sunrise functions as a non‑literal answer without overt moralizing. The quoted maxim risks slight neatness, but its diegetic origin keeps it earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A distinct, lyrical yet controlled first‑person voice filters every detail (“scattered light,” “whale turning in frozen sleep”). Dialogue is minimal but carries subtext and status play (“enjoyed the ride”). Diction stays within plausible lexicon and reliably maintains distance; no head‑hopping or unearned certainty.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density with varied rhythm; metaphors are mostly coherent and purposeful. A few lush lines flirt with excess, but pattern and payoff (light motif, mechanical lexicon) justify the texture. Minimal scaffold or repetition; syntax supports momentum through the ascent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Steampunk‑adjacent elements feel freshly synthesized through a humane, intimate arc. The light‑mediated unlocking and the ethical calculus around a private diary are non‑obvious and pay off cleanly. Risk‑taking in tone (affectionate detachment) and structure (quiet Charged Poise) heightens resonance without obscuring clarity.</comment>
