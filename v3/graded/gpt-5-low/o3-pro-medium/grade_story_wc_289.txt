<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mara’s interior is specific and credible: a ghostwriter who believes she “trafficked in hush” and worries about archiving before she relinquishes a letter. Her micro-choices (following rivulets, querying Arun, setting the boat on the coil) align with her conflict between secrecy and connection. The turn feels earned rather than declared. Slight neatness in the epiphany trims ambiguity but not depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive holds: each passage in the installation builds toward the coil and a conceptual repricing of “keeping secrets.” Orientation is clean from the first lines, and the closure lands on the page with the act of releasing the letter-boat. The cost—relinquishing proprietary secrecy for communal sound—is legible in her earlier worry about archiving and later relief. Quiet but decisive cadence shift at the platform satisfies scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The temple, pond, mirrored corridors, and coil are vivid and functionally integrated; the environment literally guides tactics via water rivulets and stepping stones as envelopes. The installation’s mechanics constrain choice and the final image is charged by the pond and reflected nest. Sensory range (moist air, hum, light) is purposeful. World rules stay consistent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes (find the thread; reconcile secrecy with sharing) tighten as Mara moves from observation to release, with a clear pressure point at the archiving question. The reversal is gentle but real: from guarding to redistributing secrets. Cost is present but soft; it’s ethical and identity-based rather than material. Escalation fits the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Recurring images (water, nest, coil) build a coherent meditation on secrecy, connection, and communal music. The final realization reframes “keeper of secrets” convincingly, charging prior details. A minor drawback: the line “to be a true keeper of secrets...” states the theme a touch explicitly. Despite that, resonance persists in the closing image of the world signing the letter.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct, lyrical POV with controlled rhythm and sensory bias; diction consistently suits a perceptive, crafted mind. Dialogue with Arun is brief but natural and subtextual (trust vs. memory). Psychic distance modulates smoothly without head-hopping. The voice sustains pressure without over-explaining.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sentences carry multiple jobs with clean momentum; images (envelopes as stones, tapes as filament) are precise rather than generic. Lyrical density approaches lushness but avoids muddle and repetition. No notable scaffold or cadence loops; final line snaps back to concrete image. Minor purple hints are kept coherent by motif control.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis—love-letter ghostwriter confronting a memoryless coil of lovers’ tapes in a lotus temple—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The installation’s rules and the sailor’s blurred letter interlock elegantly to produce the revaluation. Risk-taking is purposeful, not ornamental. Emotional specificity elevates the conceit beyond trope.</comment>
