<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lira’s motive (to archive without bruising) is specific and tested as she balances rigor against “preemptive nostalgia.” Her micro‑choices—measuring shadows, following the fainter thread, and excising her own yearning—reveal a live value hierarchy. The cost (“The omission stung”) lands on the page. Internal contradiction is credible and sustained without therapy‑speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, pressure builds via pattern: methodical dating → discovery of the sundial → vision → curatorial choice. Closure arrives as Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing when she omits her own longing, with cost felt and options reweighted. Anchors (who/where/what) are clear early; no causality breaks. The final image reconfigures the premise without over‑explaining.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The observatory, crystal forecourt, meteor‑glass obelisks, and broken sundial are tactile, character‑filtered, and functional. Setting constrains tactics (shadow measurements, moonlit ink) and charges the ending (the forecourt’s “final sigh”). Sensory specificity is high without tourist catalog drift. World rules are learned through use rather than exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—responsible curation of collective memory—is clear early and tightens when the sundial vision forces a consequential selection. The meaningful trade‑off is her own desire versus living memory; she pays by omitting herself. Escalation fits the lens: density deepens into a decisive curatorial act. No antagonist needed; agency drives resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Themes of preservation vs. petrification and humility in stewardship arise from concrete acts (what to keep, what to cut) rather than sermonizing. The mentor’s warning edges close to statement but is earned and immediately alters tactics. The final hush reweights earlier imagery into a promise rather than a tomb. Ambiguity remains purposeful, not vague.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A singular lyric voice with controlled focalization; no head‑hopping or register slips. Diction and rhythm suit Lira’s sensibility and modulate with pressure (from storm to cradle). Purposeful elision (collective faces, memory‑tapestry) is taught and paid off. No dialogue needed; interiority carries action.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is lush yet disciplined; images do multiple jobs and rarely feel redundant. Metaphors cohere to the sky/glass/sound palette, avoiding mixed vehicles. Momentum holds through description because each detail advances method or stakes. Minor density spikes never obscure sense or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The summer‑quill archivist, meteor‑glass shadows, and moonlit ink from a broken sundial synthesize into a fresh curatorial fable. The central reweighting—preservation as living promise—feels inevitable in hindsight. Risks in diction and concept heighten stakes without gimmickry. The piece reads as a singular vision rather than a template.</comment>
