<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Kael’s motivation (the “weight of a withheld truth”) is clear and intensifies into a credible, costly renunciation. Interiority is concrete and character‑particular through synesthetic perception, with a real conflict between obedience and curiosity crystallized at the end. The label “cyclically spontaneous” edges toward on‑the‑nose, but it’s dramatized via timing pressure and synchronized cycles. The final choice to conceal feels earned and reveals a hierarchy of values with visible costs.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong causal chain: shard → traversal → drone/hologram → revelation → decisive redirect. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Decisive Change: he forecloses discovery to protect, with the cost legible in the final stance (“map lacunae,” taming cycles). Orientation is clean from the first lines; the lyrical mode remains legible. Minor convenience (the drone’s timely revelation) is pre‑seeded by lullaby etchings, preserving causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Vivid, multi‑sensory specificity rooted in Kael’s synesthetic craft (“helix of perfume,” “flavor of gravity”). The shard and gate function as charged micro‑settings that constrain choices and charge the final image (pocketed shard; gates scrambled). The abandoned repair bay bookends the piece and grounds the return. World rules are taught through action rather than expository dumps.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake is focused early and tightens at the sister’s revelation, forcing a trade‑off between truth and protection. Escalation is driven by Kael’s agency—redirecting collapsing paths prefigures the decisive global redirect. The cost is felt: renouncing the quest’s trajectory and assuming guardianship under cyclical compulsion. Pressure is coherent with the causal lens; no extraneous reversals.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Themes of mapping as power/ethics and the ambivalence of discovery vs. protection emerge organically through action and image (maps that “protect or betray,” redirect as moral calculus). The final resolve to map lacunae reweights prior motifs without sermonizing, though one line edges toward thesis statement. Subtext around exploitation of gifted labor adds depth. Resonance lingers in the charged refusal rather than a tidy moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice aligned with Kael’s sensory cognition; diction and rhythm modulate under pressure without head‑hopping. Dialogue is spare and functional, carrying subtext (sister’s time‑bounded warning) while advancing stakes. Purposeful elision (mechanics of traversal) is taught by pattern and paid off. No register drift breaks plausibility for this speculative voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is agile and dense, with metaphors that mostly clarify character and world; rhythm varies and momentum holds. A few lush phrases flirt with purple (“helix of perfume,” “sea salt and wind chimes”) but remain voice‑justified. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; syntax stays clear at peak beats. The final image is clean and recharged without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The fusion of synesthetic cartography, cyclical spontaneity, and weaponized mapping feels fresh and internally coherent. “Redirect” as both tactic and ethic is an elegant, non‑obvious synthesis with strong payoff. The sibling hologram beat activates stakes without genre cliché dependence. Risks in voice and concept heighten meaning without obscuring clarity.</comment>
