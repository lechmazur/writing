<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Serah’s motives (unlocking the fort to free the confined) are crisp and consistent, and her calmly inventive nature drives the key tactical pivot. Interiority is selectively present—counting steps, the knuckle‑drumming, the angle “click”—but contradictory impulses are muted; risk and fear stay mostly implied. The Serah–Aldren dynamic adds texture without crowding the POV. The small on‑page cost (expending the sparks) lands, but deeper emotional friction is light.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Clear causal chain: blackout → initial plan → complication (locks asleep) → inventive reframe using sundial geometry → execution → locks open. Orientation is strong from the ramparts to the sundial chamber, with one scene sustained. Closure is a decisive change with conceptual cost (spent resource, treasonous act) and a reweighted world (doors unlatched, fort “lighter”). Cost is more implied than dramatized, preventing a higher tier.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The fort, stained glass, secret sundial, conduits, and turbines are vivid and functional—environment and objects directly constrain and enable tactics. The blackout and hidden hinge guide action, and the final image of luminous corridors and swinging doors is charged by the setting. Details are POV‑filtered (a sentinel’s noticing of latches, angles, steps). World rules feel consistent through observed action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible early (free everyone by opening locks) and pressure coheres under a causal lens. The key tightening arrives when the blackout renders the locks “asleep,” forcing Serah’s geometric solution. Agency drives the turn and outcome; the price (spent sparks, heightened exposure) is present but underplayed on the page. Tension remains steady rather than jagged, which fits the “silent revolution” brief but slightly softens peak pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Light vs. captivity, systems that “feed” control, and the ethic of silence braid through image and action. The “silent revolution” line edges toward thesis‑telling, yet the story mostly earns theme via particulars (doors “saluting,” the fort “lighter of heart”). The closing reprise (smile folded into hush) offers a resonant stance without moralizing. A touch more friction or ambivalence in Serah could deepen the thematic afterburn.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent with a sentinel’s perceptual signature; diction, rhythm, and image patterning are confident. Limited dialogue reads natural and coded, advancing subtext and plot. Psychic distance remains stable; no head‑hopping or unearned knowledge. Lyricality bends but doesn’t break clarity under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sentence music is strong; images like “winking hush” and “lattice lightning” are memorable and largely coherent. Information density is high with little scaffold, and the rhythm modulates from hush to surge at the climax. Minor purple edges (“polite giants,” “remembering sunlight”) are tasteful and do not obscure action. No detrimental loops or cadence templates.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The sundial‑coded lightning, bronze quill holder “cradle of sparks,” and the vow‑of‑silence jailbreak feel freshly synthesized. The plan’s complication and reframe arise from specific world logic rather than generic twists. Final images reweight the premise elegantly. The piece takes stylistic risks that heighten coherence and stakes without sacrificing legibility.</comment>
