<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Clear, compelling motive (save the girl by exposing assumptions) with embodied, profession-shaped tactics. The priest’s competence is textured by weariness and a janitorial self-concept, lending moral gravity. Internal contradiction is limited—he rarely falters—so the struggle reads more external than torn-from-within. Still, micro-choices (looping, offering the palette) reveal values under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive holds: chants/loops build architecture that culminates in the demon’s release (a decisive change) and a resonant cost (ongoing burden, beacon to “distant hungers”). Orientation is clean from the opening marble/anchor frame. The anchor’s constraint and looped rhetoric create a tight because/therefore sequence within the lyric mode. The closing reprices “truth via rhetoric” with a cost that charges the next pilgrimage.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and operative: the dimensional anchor physically constrains the demon’s escape and pulses to speech. Objects-as-setting (palette, loops) shape tactics and the final image (pigment flare, dawn). Sensory detail spans sound, touch, and pressure without tourist cataloging. World rules are learned through action (looped motion, architecture of hush) and stay consistent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear and escalates: rhetorical loops tighten, the demon’s sarcasm is neutralized, then it lunges and is arrested by the looped playback, forcing self-awareness. The mid-turn (failed mockery → slowed attack) narrows options toward surrender. Cost is conceptual rather than bodily—signal sent to other hungers, and the priest accepts ongoing duty. The pressure coheres under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme—assumptions as demonic footholds; silence as architectural tool; absolution as daring to mark emptiness—emerges through concrete acts, not thesis. The palette’s reweighting and the “cathedral of hush” convert rhetoric into moral action. The line about truth seldom surviving unaccompanied skirts telling but is earned by the scene and fuels the closing reconfiguration. The final image reframes ministry as maintenance of charged quiet.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A distinct, priestly lyric voice with controlled cadence and precise rhetorical naming (anaphora, polysyndeton) that doubles as tactic. Psychic distance is steady; elisions are pattern-taught and legible. Brief dialogue rings purposeful and subtextual. Elevated diction matches the ritual frame without register slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High-density prose with largely clean metaphorics (“cathedral of hush,” “architecture of chants”) and varied rhythm. Occasional lushness risks purple, but clarity of action and causality remains intact. Repetition is purposeful (loop motif) rather than scaffold; minimal redundancy. Final lines land crisply without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis—loop-pedal liturgy, dimensional anchor, rhetoric as exorcism, palette of one color—is striking and coherent. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight once the rules (looping as architecture, anchor as constraint) are taught. The piece risks a dense lyric register and makes it work under pressure. Emotional and conceptual freshness elevate beyond novelty.</comment>
