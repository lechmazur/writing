<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elias’s undertaker’s ethic and “inadvertently stubborn” streak motivate each turn, from not sealing the box to choosing to remain below. Interiority is embodied in tactile, profession‑colored noticing (fractures, burial records, ledgers). The tug between duty to the living and duty to the unburied becomes a credible renunciation. The final Earned Stasis reads as character‑true and costs him his life above.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Hybrid leaning Causal: package → lens → library → ritual → beacon → self‑sacrifice holds cleanly. Closure lands on page as Earned Stasis: he remains to balance the beacon’s rest, with the cost explicit. Orientation (who/where/when) is clear by the second sentence and maintained through one purposeful transition. Setups (clicking, chart names, lens) are paid off without convenience.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and functional: the collapsed lighthouse and underwater library constrain tactics (manual, plinth, light channels) and charge the final image. The lens functions as object‑as‑setting, shaping access and the ending’s beacon. Sensory choices feel profession‑filtered and purposeful (salt fire, foghorn echoes). World rules are taught through action and remain consistent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (transform ignored distress into rest) tightens from ominous clicking to ritual execution to the living‑as‑balance demand. The decisive cost—remaining below—forecloses ascent and reweights all prior actions. Escalation tracks Elias’s agency rather than coincidence. Tension modulates sentence‑level and scene‑level without dissipating.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme—duty to the unacknowledged dead and the transformation of warning into welcome—emerges through action, not moralizing. The final image (calm turned inward, “breath settling into bones”) reprices the premise with a felt cost. Recurring motifs (clicking → silence, lantern/gull cries → hush) accrue meaning. Ambiguity remains purposeful (balance required) rather than vague.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinct, patient lyric voice aligned with a meticulous undertaker’s sensibility; diction and rhythm modulate under pressure. No head‑hopping; psychic distance stays steady and tight. Patterned elision (ritual steps) is taught and paid off. Confidence of stance avoids over‑explanation while remaining legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet controlled; metaphors track to the maritime/mortuary lexicon (“singed wick,” “salt fire”). Minimal scaffold and no paraphrase loops; each line advances image or pressure. Figurative density approaches lush but stays coherent in peak beats. Final cadence is clean and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Underwater city library of ignored distress, octopus librarians, and a broken lens turned from warning to harbor is striking and organic. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight from seeded particulars (chart names, cracks as drowned constellations). Risk‑taking serves coherence, not gimmickry. Emotional truth (chosen custodianship with cost) grounds the novelty.</comment>
