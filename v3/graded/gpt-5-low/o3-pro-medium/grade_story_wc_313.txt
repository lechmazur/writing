<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mara’s motive to preserve resurfacing histories is vivid and particular, and her duty-versus-disobedience conflict culminates in the sluice choice. Interiority is embodied through tactile artifacts (photos, label) rather than labels. The cost is implied (professional risk/time theft) rather than dramatized, keeping it just shy of top tier. Still, her hierarchy of values is legible and earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Hybrid lens holds: accumulative trail → causal breach (opens gate) → charged communal dawn. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration; the decisive act narrows options by buying time at a risk. Orientation is clear early and through-line logic is clean. Cost is present but soft on the page (no immediate repercussion), tempering peak score.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is exquisitely integrated: drought, sluice, pump house, and exposed streets actively constrain choices and enable the central act. Recurring objects (photos, label, chime) charge the final image. Sensory selection is purposeful and POV-filtered without tourist cataloguing. The environment decisively shapes tactics and the ending.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving memory vs. institutional narrative) is signaled early and tightens when she raises the gate, a meaningful foreclosing choice. Pressure coheres as the lake recedes faster, enabling the curation sprint. The price is implied rather than enacted, but tension persists through dawn. Quiet, earned escalation suits the lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Memory versus engineered erasure emerges through concrete acts and images, not sermonizing, with the final chime ringing to remember. A single line (“She will expunge the engineer’s version…”) flirts with thesis-speak but is anchored by subsequent action. The water-as-archive motif deepens subtext without overstatement. Resonance lingers beyond plot.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third-person closely held to Mara sustains a distinct perceptual signature. Diction and rhythm remain consistent and modulate with pressure. No head-hopping or unearned omniscience; elision patterns are taught and paid off. Elevated language feels character-filtered via her vocation and sensibility.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lines carry high information density with varied rhythm; metaphors (mirror, coin, ribs) are coherent and thematically aligned. Minimal scaffold and no loops that sap momentum. A few lush patches flirt with purple but maintain clarity and propulsion. Final cadence lands cleanly without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The levee warden curating a resurfacing town by ethically fraught water manipulation is a fresh synthesis. The breadcrumb photographs and the labeled shard recontextualize progress narratives with specificity. Risk-taking (quiet transgression as preservation) heightens stakes without gimmickry. The final chime reframes warning into remembrance with inevitability.</comment>
