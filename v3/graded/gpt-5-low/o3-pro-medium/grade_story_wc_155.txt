<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Clear, credible motivation (to rekindle lost joy) drives specific micro‑choices—tapping the network, aligning the fresco, offering the light‑painted journal. Interiority is embodied (“pensive mirth pry open her chest”), though internal contradiction is gentle rather than sharply contested. The reciprocity insight (“the orchard demanded reciprocity”) lands as character‑specific logic. The final unlock is earned by her gift, not a free epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Hybrid leaning Causal: each step (“therefore” chaining from film → fragment → network nodes → offering) tightens toward the revelation and revival. Orientation is clean by ~120 words (who/where/why). Closure lands on the page with a Decisive Change and Resonant Reconfiguration (memory reclaimed; orchard revived). The emotional cost is present but light—she relinquishes her journal and self‑exposes to memory, not a heavy loss.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and functional: fog becomes a projection surface, the fountain and orchard architecture provide constraints and sites for the ritual. Tools and environment integrate (lantern, film, fresco against limestone) and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV‑tuned. World rules are learned through action, not dumped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recovering joy) tightens through accumulative deepening: pale projections fail, the fresco match unlocks partial success, then a demanded offering triggers the true turn. The “gift before surrender” adds pressure and a concrete hurdle. The final touch (pear blossom) serves as the climactic beat. Costs are modest but legible in the required offering and vulnerability.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of memory as communal, reparable infrastructure emerges through acts (coaxing echoes into song, reciprocity with place) rather than moralizing. The blend of art and network reframes joy as a shared system, not just nostalgia. The last image reweights the premise—restored joy sustains a public space. Subtext about technology as caretaker, not thief, is gracefully implied.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a distinctive lyric texture; diction matches an artist’s perceptual bias. Rhythm modulates with escalation (from gauzy observation to brighter, shorter cadences at revival). No head‑hopping or stance slips; elision is purposeful and paid off. Occasional lushness stays coherent with POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High line‑level control: images are precise and multifunctional (light carrying melody; leaves waltzing). Figurative density is elevated but rarely muddled; repetition (“pensive mirth”) functions as motif, not loop. Minimal scaffold or synonym churn; sentences propel action. A touch of purple (“daylight the color of ripe pears”) is apt to the piece’s aims.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—knowledge network + archival scents + light‑painting + fog‑screens—feels fresh and necessary to this exact story. Turns grow from established tools rather than late rule changes. The reciprocity requirement reframes the tech/memory conceit in a non‑obvious way. Risks in tonal blend and world logic pay off without obscuring clarity.</comment>
