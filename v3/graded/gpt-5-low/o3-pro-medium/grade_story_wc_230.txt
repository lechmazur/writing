<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Ilya’s motives (to buffer honesty into kindness) are clear and consistent, and his flaw (overriding rationalism under a truth‑compulsion) drives choice. The confession about abandoning his sister lands as a real cost and reorients his values. Embodied detail (probe in mud, copper taste, hiss of panic) prevents therapy‑speak. The late exchange with Mara adds a social vector that pressures him into community over solitude.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: catalog → search → find relic → pay price (confession) → effect → new plan under social threat. Closure arrives as a resonant reconfiguration: filter despair so care can pass, shifting from relic-dependence to communal dissemination. The council threat and Mara’s plea reinforce cost and choice at the end. Orientation is crisp from the first lines (rain, ravine orchard, forager).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The ravine orchard is tactile and operative: rain, cables, trellises, mud, and storm pressure shape action and exit (cables as handrails, slick path). The burial logic (“where storms could not swallow scent”) ties the relic to place. Sensory range is rich without excess, and the final chord image charges the ending. World rules feel consistent and learned via action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding a humane buffer against compulsive truth—tightens through the price demanded by the eye and the council risk. The decisive deepening is the forced confession that exacts emotional cost and changes tactics (from solitary fix to communal recipe). The Mara beat adds credible external pressure without resolving by coincidence. Stakes are intimate but decisive at this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Themes of honesty vs. kindness and community as psychological safety emerge from concrete acts (the under‑tongue eye, confession, smuggling knowledge). A few direct statements (“Psychological safety…”) edge toward thesis, but the final image (“grace fused with the fracture”) resonates without moralizing. The eye’s function reweights empathy from burden to scaffold. The sister thread anchors ethical cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A distinct lyrical-perceptual signature (“doves wrapped in cloth,” “polite shards”) stays within a plausible, character‑bound lexicon. Dialogue is minimal but purposeful and subtextual (Mara’s plea under truth-compulsion). POV remains stable and disciplined; no head‑hopping or unwarranted certainties. Rhythm modulates with pressure cleanly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is controlled, with vivid but coherent figurative language and strong verbs; minimal scaffolding. Density supports momentum—each line advances world, character, or stakes. Occasional abstract terms are grounded by sensory counterpoints (copper, cider scent, wet parchment). No loops or muddled metaphors blunt the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The empathy‑virus premise, truffle forager, and an under‑tongue glass eye that filters despair create a memorable synthesis. The pivot from relic to recipe via spores is a fresh, consequential turn. Risks (lyric diction, conceptual frame) pay off without obscuring clarity. It feels singular, not templated.</comment>
