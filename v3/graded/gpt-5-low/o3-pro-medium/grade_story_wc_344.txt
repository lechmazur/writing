<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Selene’s drive “to learn the rhythm of repair” is clear and embodied in concrete choices: climbing, seeking prophecy, confessing to the mirror, assembling the clock. The apology at the mirror carries felt cost and reveals a flaw (rushed locks, mistakes) that she must face. Interiority is specific and sensory rather than abstract. A touch more contradiction in-the-moment (hesitation vs compulsion) could deepen pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hybrid with an accumulative/textural dominant: ascent → discovery → prophecy assembly → heart retrieval via confession → assembly → remembered rhythm. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: she re-prices repair and leaves with a living clock; cost is the admission of failure and the tear-pendulum. Orientation is clean early; no causality breaks. The chain remains focused with one meaningful tightening when the “heart” is required.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The frozen library, mirrored halls, quartz lanterns, and frostbitten volumes aren’t decorative—they supply resources and constraints (mirrors as energy source and confessional gateway; scraps as method). Environmental details are vivid, selective, and POV-filtered, culminating in mirrors circling to power the mechanism. The setting explicitly charges the final image and tactic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (learn the rhythm) tightens at “they wanted assembling, but first they required a heart,” forcing her to confront failure to obtain it. Agency drives escalation: she seeks scraps, apologizes, extracts the pendulum, and assembles the clock; the mirrors’ refracted light powers the heart. The emotional price is legible, and options narrow meaningfully. Tension is quiet but coherent and cumulative.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of repair as invitation vs obstacle is earned through mirrors, scraps, and the tear-heart; subtext hums in images (icicles as punctuation, bottled flames as imprisoned heartbeat). The line “repair was less about fixing…” leans toward explicit thesis, slightly reducing subtlety, though it’s grounded in action and arrives after struggle. The final descent reframes the world with a charged cadence rather than a moral. Resonance lingers without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyrical, controlled, and consistently focalized through Selene; the prose’s diction matches the fable-like, artisan sensibility. Patterned imagery (mirrors, frost, driftwood) is taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping or stance wobble; psychic distance modulates with pressure. The voice remains singular and confident without over-explaining.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High-density lines do multiple jobs; rhythm varies and drives momentum. The figurative texture is lush but largely coherent and legible; minimal scaffold or repetition. A few stacked metaphors approach saturation, but they remain internally consistent and rarely blur action. The final beats are clear and uncluttered.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: a lunar-eclipse locksmith, frozen cloud library, confessional mirrors yielding a heart, and a mechanism powered by reflections. The inventive turns feel inevitable in hindsight and integrated with character motive. Risk-taking in concept and image heightens stakes without sacrificing clarity. Only slight conventionality in the explicit thematic line keeps it from a higher band.</comment>
