<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Corin’s motive—grief sharpened into inquiry—is vivid and consistent, and it drives concrete micro‑choices (leaving the sextant, approaching unarmed, answering in pattern). Contradictory impulses (mourning vs. caution; longing vs. risk) are embodied without therapy‑speak. The acceptance of cost at the end (“even if every hinge… crack open”) reads earned. Minor note: the internal struggle remains mostly poised rather than ruptured, keeping it just shy of exceptional.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hybrid lens with causal dominance: balcony → descent → watchers → mirror dialogue → whistle‑note → coordinates → chosen descent. Closure lands as Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: a decisive commitment with cost. Orientation is clean from the opening; set‑ups (pattern language, whistle, sextant, watchers) pay off. No causality breaks or soft resets.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The turtle‑city, scutes, pattern inlays, seamoth, and mirrors are not postcard detail; they constrain tactics and charge the final image. The environment teaches its rules through use, and the final guidance spiral literalizes “doors in light.” Sensory specificity is rich yet purposeful across sight, sound, heat, and scent. Spatial logic is coherent throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (to reach/understand the watchers and the lost) tightens via the note’s activation and the “neither alive nor dead” reframing. The relinquishing of the sextant and the unarmed approach are credible trade‑offs under pressure. The decisive beam‑triggered revelation escalates with a price implied for the chosen path. Tension remains lyrical rather than harried, but the deepening is clear.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Questions vs. gates, language as passage, and grief repurposed into inquiry cohere without sermonizing. The final contrast—“gates are only doors in metal; questions are doors in light”—reweights all prior images and costs. Motifs (spirals, cracking, mirrors) shift meaning at the end. Resonance lingers with conceptual and emotional charge.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinct, confident lyric voice with a cartographer’s perceptual signature governs selection and rhythm. POV distance is stable; elisions are purposeful and paid off (e.g., pattern languages). Diction remains character‑plausible and modulates under pressure without wobble. No head‑hopping or register leaks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density and image precision; lines often pull double duty (world + emotion). The figurative load is lush but controlled; no mixed metaphors or loops dull the closure. Rhythm breathes and tightens at key beats (mirror beam, forbidden note, final vow). A shade ornate in places, but clarity and momentum hold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Gargantuan turtle‑city + pattern‑language cartography + mirror‑speaking watchers synthesize into a singular vision. Turns arise from established logic (note → cracking → coordinates) rather than late rule drops. The risk of a quiet, conceptual climax pays off with specificity and cost. Memorable images feel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
