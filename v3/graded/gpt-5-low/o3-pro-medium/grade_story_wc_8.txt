<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mira’s drive (“rescue truth from a pit of lies”) coheres with her methodical, analogy‑driven tactics and micro‑choices (the hinge search; the bargaining parable). The caretaker’s grief‑logic turn is credible and adds relational pressure. Interiority is selective and embodied through objects and scents rather than labels. Slight limitation: Mira’s contradictions are muted; her risk tolerance reads clean rather than contested.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Clear causal chain: petal signal → access → mural/letter parallel → hidden chest → ledger → caretaker standoff → parable persuasion → leak. Closure lands on‑page via the decision to expose and the images sent, with risk marked by illegality and sirens. The lens reads Hybrid (Causal/Situational) and holds through the end. Cost is present but mostly conceptual/forward‑leaning rather than immediately punishing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The station’s ivy, mural, crawlspace, and ministry crest shape tactics and discovery (hinges behind the handshake) and charge the final dawn/ivy image. Sensory specificity is purposeful (damp stone, sweetness of preserved ink) and filtered through a historian’s eye. The environment constrains options and enables the find. Spatial and tool choreography remain clear.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible early and tightens meaningfully with the caretaker’s arrival. The persuasive pivot (wolf/sheep parable) is a credible turn that narrows options and forces an ethical trade‑off. Consequences (sirens, illegality, betrayal of a promise) are felt. Slightly neat resolution, but agency drives the outcome.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme—truth versus “noble lies,” handshake as polite strangulation—emerges through actions, objects, and reprises. Strong subtextual play in the mural/saint‑demon parallel and the final “reopened airways” image. A few lines verge on thesis (“beauty divorced from honesty was only gilded rot”; “best histories are written…”) softening subtlety. Overall resonance remains high without collapsing into sermon.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The lyric‑precise third‑person closely tracks Mira’s perceptual bias; diction and rhythm feel controlled and character‑apt. Dialogue is spare, purposeful, with subtext embedded in stance and pressure. No head‑hopping or stance drift; psychic distance modulates effectively. Occasional aphoristic flare briefly risks authorial sheen but doesn’t break voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentence‑level craft is polished: varied rhythms, high information density, and images that carry multiple loads. Figurative language is frequent but coherent and scene‑tuned (e.g., “flashlight slicing through dust like a censor’s pen”). Minimal redundancy; momentum holds. A touch of purple in thematic lines prevents an even higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The illuminated letter’s allegorical marginalia guiding a physical search and an ethical negotiation is a fresh synthesis. The mural handshake hinge is an inventive, earned device; the “noble lie” recalibration via lived grief reads specific, not generic. Risks in tone and imagery pay off with coherence. Not radical, but distinctly memorable.</comment>
