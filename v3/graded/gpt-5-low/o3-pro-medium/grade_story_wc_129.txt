<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear, compelling motive (“graft herself onto community”) drives concrete action (weaving reeds, pressing the knot). Interiority is vivid and embodied through the ache metaphor, but genuine internal conflict is minimal and pressure modest. The relationship with Lio adds tenderness but seldom tests values under strain. Change reads earned though low-cost: from peripheral to “threaded.”</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the approach → weaving → inscription → touch → arbor’s response culminates in a resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands on the page with a concrete image (obsidian shoots shaped like reeds and pencils) and a conceptual cost (choosing to tend, surrendering solitude). Orientation is crisp from the opening. The beat logic is clean, though the pressure line is soft.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The crystalline orchard and crater are sensorially rich and integrated into action; the obsidian arbor functions as environment/object that charges the final image. Details are filtered through Alyss’s craft eye, keeping specificity purposeful. The space shapes behavior (searching, weaving, pressing the knot) rather than serving as postcard backdrop. Vivid without excess sprawl.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding belonging—tightens as rumor → discovery → ritualized joining; the arbor’s hum and apparitions escalate texture and consequence. The decisive act (pressing palms; offerings recorded) reads as commitment, but opposing force is gentle and cost largely conceptual. One meaningful deepening occurs; a harder trade-off would raise stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of kinship-as-fabric emerges organically through craft actions and charged objects; the final resolve to tend the place reweights prior images. The inscription “Offer your thread...” edges toward didactic, but the mineral recording of their offerings restores resonance. Subtext in weaving/grafting imagery is consistent and fertile.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The lyric third-person voice is steady, image-driven, and plausibly filtered through Alyss’s sensibility; Lio’s presence never muddies focalization. Diction and rhythm modulate with discovery and climax without head-hopping. Occasional high shimmer risks purple but remains controlled and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is luminous with fresh images (“ringing like teaspoons against porcelain crystal”) and good syntactic variety. Minor density swell in stacked metaphors skirts overwriting but does not blur sense or momentum. Information density is high, and lines often do double duty (world + emotion).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Obsidian arbor as communal conduit, Vire’s tag reimagined as a living system, and the craft-based joining feel fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The synthesis of art, memory, and kinship transcends template fable. Risk is aesthetic rather than structural; stronger friction would push it higher.</comment>
