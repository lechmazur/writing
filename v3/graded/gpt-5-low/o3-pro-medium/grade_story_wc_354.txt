<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Tomas’s motives (to redeem exile by discovering “beauty in the difficult”) drive concrete micro‑choices at the board, especially resisting greed when the stakes tug. Contradictory impulses—ambition vs. grace, fear vs. poise—are active in scene and culminate in the queen sacrifice. Interiority is specific (worry stone, “translating silence”) and embodied. The cost is felt and character‑particular without safety hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, pattern density builds to a closure where moral intention affects physical equilibrium and Tomas pays by renouncing ambition (queen sacrifice). The eclipse, magnetic stakes, and opponent tied to his banishment cohere causally within the story’s rules. The final reconfiguration (“Your covenant is no longer eclipsed,” smoothed stone) lands with conceptual and emotional cost. Orientation is clean early; scope is tight and single‑scene.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The valley’s iron‑staked circle, eclipse, and magnetism are vivid and rule‑consistent, and they constrain choice by rewarding grace and resisting greed. The environment charges the final image (stakes ringing, stone warming) and is inseparable from the thematic turn. Detail selection is purposeful and filtered through Tomas’s chess‑tuned perception. World logic is taught through action, not exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>One dominant stake—redemptive poise vs. old ambition—tightens when the apparition repeats the line that caused his banishment and the stakes react to intention. The meaningful turn is the queen sacrifice, a visible price that forecloses an old path. Pressure remains coherent and grows with the eclipse deepening and the nexus reading intention. Resolution arises from Tomas’s agency rather than coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: grace over ambition, a covenant un‑eclipsed, beauty discovered through difficulty and listening. The worry stone’s transformation and the quiet mate reweight prior material without sermonizing. The single explicit line “Beauty, he decided…” edges close to stating the moral but is earned by the scene. Subtext hums in magnets “whispering” and the stakes easing with grace.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A distinct, lyrical third‑person close stays stable and congruent with Tomas’s sensibility (“translating silence,” chess lexicon). Rhythm modulates with pressure; images are controlled and legible. Minimal dialogue is purposeful and charged (“Your covenant is no longer eclipsed”). No head‑hopping or stance drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is precise, image‑dense, and mostly restraint‑controlled; metaphors align with the story’s physics and motifs (magnets, eclipse, chess). Information density is high without redundancy or scaffolding bloat. A few elevated turns flirt with purple but serve the lyric mode and never obscure causality. The final cadence is clean and weighted.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Chess tactics braided with a magnetized eclipse valley and a morality‑sensitive environment is a fresh synthesis. “Translating silence” as praxis feels singular, not templated, and pays off in tactic and theme. The apparition echoing his banishment line is both uncanny and character‑bound. Risks in concept and diction heighten stakes without losing clarity.</comment>
