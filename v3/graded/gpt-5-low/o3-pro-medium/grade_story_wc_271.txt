<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Anisa’s motives are precise and embodied—she wants “optimism anchored in realism,” and her freeze/lead tension plays in scene when thunder hits. The relationship with Malik provides a credible scaffold and pressure relief without dissolving her agency. Small, concrete micro‑choices (seed ritual, palm to glass, continuing the tour post‑trigger) reveal hierarchy of values. The only softness is slight thematic label‑speak around “neuroscience” that edges toward explained rather than purely dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the tour’s designed somatic sequence builds to the thunder trigger and the pearl‑through‑ruins reconfiguration at the end. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she nearly freezes, regains cadence via Malik’s pulse, and reframes the pearl to refract light through the cracked lens—cost and endurance are legible. Orientation is clean early, and all beats serve the central stake. No causal gaps or outliney “and‑then” sequencing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The arboretum and cliffside environment tangibly shape tactics: wind‑trembling glass, salt air, dimmed skylights, thunder, gulls, and the ruined lighthouse lens all cue the somatic method. Setting details are precise, POV‑filtered, and charged; the glass‑palm exercise and final lighthouse/pearl image fuse place and theme. World rules remain consistent without expository drag. The environment constrains and enables choices, not just decorates.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (hold steady under trauma while leading others) tightens at the thunder beat, forcing a test of her stance; the risk of freezing and losing the group’s regulation is a real price. The recovery via touch is a credible adaptation, and she chooses to lead onward, foreclosing retreat. Pressure is coherent and grows through the accumulative design rather than reversals. A slight cushion remains because external risk is low, but the internal cost reads.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: light refracting through ruins rather than denying them, the pearl of stillness as portable practice, and bodies mapping calm before minds consent. The final image conceptually reprices earlier material without moralizing. A few explicit lines (“anchor optimism in realism,” “drawn from neuroscience”) skim the edge of thesis but are earned by scene work. Subtext in gesture (palm to glass, dirt‑smudged pulse) carries the meaning.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The lyric third‑limited voice is controlled and distinctive, with tactile diction suited to a horticultural lens. Dialogue is minimal but effective; Malik’s silence and brief touches carry subtext. Psychic distance stays stable, with no head‑hopping. Occasional elevated jargon appears but remains justified by context and doesn’t break the voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lines are vivid, compressed, and purposeful; images do double duty (gulls as “loose gears,” glass trembling under palms). Figurative density is high but coherent, with no mixed metaphors dulling clarity. Rhythm modulates well across pressure points, and there’s no paraphrase looping. Minor abstraction in a couple of lines doesn’t slow momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis—drone‑strike survivor leading a somatic, sensory tour in a cliffside arboretum with a shattered lighthouse lens as closing anchor—is fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The pearl motif is used inventively, not decoratively; neuroscience via tactile ritual feels grounded. Risks in lyric density and conceptual closure pay off without obscuring clarity. The piece avoids template trauma arcs and finds a singular stance.</comment>
