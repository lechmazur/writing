<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Amira’s motives and grief are concrete, embodied, and consistent, with tactile micro‑choices (gloves, filing, listening) revealing value hierarchy under pressure. The internal contradiction—quiet grief versus a practiced, humanizing poise—registers without therapy‑speak. Competence slightly outpaces struggle (the repair proceeds smoothly), trimming the sense of risk. Still, the sacrifice of the water clock part and the final journal map earn the modest reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hybrid drive leaning Accumulative/Textural: causal beats (Laleh arrives → donor part chosen → repair → test) accrue to a resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands with cost: cannibalizing the fishermen’s clock, accepting permanent anosmia while “smelling with her ears.” Orientation is clean from the first lines, and all set‑ups (fog, clock, oil) pay off. The external urgency (“birth tonight,” rising river) stays mostly atmospheric, but the on‑page decisive acts and final cadence shift hold.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The shop and water clock are specific, lived‑in, and tool‑true; the donor mechanism constrains tactics and charges the ending. Weather and fog shape perception and tone, not just backdrop. The testing basin and quarter‑hour chime materially and thematically reweight the final image. Micro‑setting integrates with character bias (an ex‑aromatherapist translating senses) to excellent effect.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore the clamp before the imminent birth—is clear and tightens when Amira chooses to sacrifice the water clock. The visible price (losing/maiming the clock’s integrity) is legible and ties to identity. Escalation is gentle; the repair path lacks a setback or reversal, relying on cadence rather than obstacle. Still, agency drives the turn and the test beat functions as a meaningful deepening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: loss as rerouting of perception, “reading between lines,” and ordinary miracles. Images reconfigure at the end (droplets as footsteps; “smelling with her ears”), avoiding moralizing. A few lines edge toward statement (“absence could funnel perception”), but they’re earned by scene pressure. Resonance lingers in the charged poise of the final hush.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The lyric third‑person closely tracks Amira’s perceptual signature—texture over scent, sound as surrogate—with steady psychic distance. Dialogue is sparse and natural, carrying subtext and pressure without exposition. Rhythm modulates to match action (sparks, click, droplets) without head‑hopping. Elevated diction is voice‑motivated and consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lines are musical and information‑dense, with strong verbs and purposeful images; recurring motifs (fog, water, maps) are controlled. There is mild lushness and repetition (“reading between lines,” “trembling calm”), but clarity and propulsion hold. No scaffold loops or filter stacks dull the closure. The final paragraph lands cleanly with an image rather than an explanation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis—an anosmic aromatherapist repurposing a water clock to save a generational birthing tool—feels singular and inevitable in hindsight. Tactile ingenuity (listening as smelling, oil judged by bead) refreshes familiar loss‑and‑adaptation terrain. The risk (quiet, textural resolution) pays off without gimmickry. Key turns arise from established specifics rather than late rule changes.</comment>
