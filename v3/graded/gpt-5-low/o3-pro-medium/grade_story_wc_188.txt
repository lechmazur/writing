<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Motivation and interiority are vivid and specific—“defiance was his tinder, playfulness his fuse”—and micro‑choices (reading the mosaic as code; opting for a silent ignition) reveal character under pressure. Contradictory impulses (seriousness/play) operate on the page. The chief limitation is low visible personal risk or cost to Cyril; his competence faces little friction before success.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Hybrid drive with an accumulative/textural dominant: chant, mosaic, roses, and fireworks accrue into a decisive public reconfiguration. Closure lands on‑page as the fortress mood flips and the drawbridges lower, culminating in the charged act of perforating the star charts. Cost is legible in that sacrificial damage and implied risk, and all beats link coherently from setup to payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The fortress, roses, battlements, lanterns, and mosaics are sensorially sharp and used tactically (hidden note, guard placement, lighting constraints). Environment charges the final image—rose “snow,” opened drawbridges, and fireworks replacing a starless sky. Details are filtered through Cyril’s craft‑biased perception, avoiding tourist cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (ignite rebellion/defy despair) is clear, and pressure tightens via the guard’s attention and the silent flare that catalyzes a public turn. Escalation is protagonist‑driven, but the path to victory feels relatively unopposed and fast, with limited on‑page cost. Still, the one decisive intensification (message broadcast → collective rise) lands cleanly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme coheres: serious playfulness as insurgent method; “gravity” as opinion; absence made visible (starless night → perforated charts). Recurring images develop and reweight at the end without moralizing, and the final act offers a resonant, non‑literal answer about transforming despair into communal festival. Subtext hums in the protocol‑prisoned princess and silent mosaics “wanting” to be read.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and tightly focalized through Cyril’s sensibility; diction and rhythm are controlled and character‑specific. Occasional dialogue is spare and purposeful. Lyrical cadences modulate with action (chant accelerating to throw, then widening on the balcony) without head‑hopping or register slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is lush yet purposeful, with high information density and minimal redundancy; images do multiple jobs (roses as audience, then trigger). A few lines flirt with purple, but clarity and propulsion hold, especially around the ignition and balcony beats. No notable loops or mechanical artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: a fireworks artisan weaponizing play and poetry to invert a garrison’s mood; mosaics as clandestine signal; star charts perforated into future constellations. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight given the setup, and risk‑taking in tone and imagery heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
