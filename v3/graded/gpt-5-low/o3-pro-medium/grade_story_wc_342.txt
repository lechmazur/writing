<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear, particular motivation (to craft sky beyond likeness) drives decisive choices: accepting the warden’s offer quickly, blindfolding to paint by nonvisual senses, persisting under the demolition clock. Interiority is embodied and character‑specific (textures of sound/temperature as cognition), though internal contradiction under pressure is modest. Competence sometimes smooths struggle, but the commitment to non‑sight in a high‑risk window shows credible cost. The final endurance/stance is earned by prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Hybrid with an accumulative/textural dominant lens: coin → instruction → blindfold craft → crews arrive → consecrated hush. Closure lands on the page as a resonant reconfiguration: the mural changes the observatory’s fate; the city rescinds demolition. Cost is present (time pressure, working blind, risking failure under a live clock), though it’s felt more conceptually than viscerally. Orientation is crisp early; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is richly specific and POV‑filtered: the tree trunk library’s cambium shelves, lantern fungi, and the scaffolded dome as a “tired moon.” Environment constrains tactics (blindfolded navigation via sound bounce; demolition clock) and charges the final image (observatory transfigured into responsive sky; safe releasing “high altitude”). World rules remain consistent, and sensory selection aligns with Liora’s nonvisual priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (complete the mural before demolition) is signaled and tightens when the crew arrives, shifting from meditative craft to charged poise. Agency drives the turn—her blindfolded method culminates in an immersive sky that stays the wreckers’ hand. The price is mainly risk and surrender of sight/time; escalation is coherent but gentle, with limited reversal beyond the crew’s hush. Still, one meaningful tightening lands.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of discovering limits by crafting beyond sight integrates through the coin’s instruction and Liora’s sensory reorientation; the end reweights “recognition” from faces to interior weather. Subtext accrues in images (coin’s “collapsed constellations,” plaster as “unmapped stars,” safe’s “high altitude”) rather than thesis. No moralizing; the final image offers a resonant non‑literal answer about art remaking space and perception. Complexity remains without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is distinctive, lyric, and consistent with Liora’s perceptual signature (texture of sound, temperature, and pressure). Diction and rhythm are controlled; elision is purposeful and pattern‑taught from the outset. No head‑hopping; psychic distance modulates subtly with pressure. A few lush runs flirt with excess but remain legible and purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is strong: high information density, precise verbs, and layered images that carry plot and theme. The prose is lush but controlled; metaphors cohere (weather/sky/cambium/constellations) and avoid muddle. Minimal scaffold or loops; momentum holds through the demolition approach. A touch of purple in places is offset by clarity and propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original synthesis: a face‑blind portraitist decoding a coin by touch to craft a responsive interior sky that averts demolition. Risks (lyric density, accumulative design) pay off with a specific, inevitable‑feeling closure. The “blueprint coin” and “weather‑obedient craft” feel fresh and character‑driven rather than gimmicky. The turn reads earned in hindsight through seeded particulars.</comment>
