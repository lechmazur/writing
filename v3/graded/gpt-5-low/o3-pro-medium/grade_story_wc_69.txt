<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mara’s motive is clear and consistent—restore harmony before the arts vanish—and her actions align (gather exiles, teach silence, face the council, then leave). Interiority is spare and more fable‑like than psychological; contradictory impulses are muted, which keeps her a touch emblematic. Still, micro‑choices (whisper instead of speech, rests before notes, refusal to argue with the council) reveal values under pressure. The renunciatory ending (walking away) carries a modest but felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural, with pressure building through patterned silence and communal practice; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration when the chord clarifies grief and reweights power. Orientation is clean from the first line; the rosette and alcove train the pattern early. Cost is present (spent grant, reputational risk, confronting authority, then leaving what she catalyzed), if gently rendered. The final image reconfigures the city/library’s function without a mechanical tie‑off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and operative: the velvet library, drapes, hearth, and especially the map alcove’s “queer acoustics” constrain tactics (teaching silence, long rests) and charge the climax. The rosette functions as micro‑setting/object guiding behavior and the final cadence. Sensory economy remains purposeful and filtered through the piece’s tonal bias. The environment feels inseparable from the method and outcome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes are focused—can song rehumanize a divided city—and escalation is clear: assemble exiles, teach via subtraction, sustain night practices, then face the council. The key tightening is the council’s arrival and the risk of suppression, met by a non‑argument chord. Resolution leans toward the lyrical and frictionless, slightly softening the felt price. Still, the method itself is a tested stance under pressure, not a deus ex machina.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: harmony through restraint, “unlearning hatred,” and art as civic repair. Recurring images (rests, rosette, hush) accrue meaning and invert debate into listening. A few explicit lines (“to braid diverse voices… before the vanishing arts are forgotten”) edge close to statement but are earned by scene work. The ending’s conceptual repricing lingers without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, controlled, and lyrically sure, with a gentle omniscient tilt that suits the fable‑like register. Diction choices (“expectantly resigned,” “denote”) remain coherent within the piece’s idiom. Dialogue is sparse and purposeful; silence and gesture carry subtext. Rhythm modulates well between hush and swell without head‑hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished: sentences carry multiple jobs, and imagery is fresh yet legible (rests as welcome, dust motes like lanterns). Lushness occasionally skirts purple, but repetition is purposeful (rests, silence) rather than scaffolding. No visible loops or cadence templates sap momentum. The final lines land cleanly on a charged image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A reconciliatory choir story is renewed through the specific method “by subtracting noise,” the rosette as focal object, and the charged library space. The council confrontation via a clarifying chord feels non‑obvious yet inevitable from the taught pattern. Risks (lyric fable tone, minimal interiority) pay off with coherence. The synthesis reads singular rather than templated.</comment>
