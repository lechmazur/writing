<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mira’s motive (protecting vulnerable voices) is clear and consistently enacted, with small but credible friction between fear and curiosity (“lungs tight” vs. descent). Micro‑choices—unhooking the chain, descending, bleeding her lantern power—align with a persistent‑listener trait. Interiority is concrete and filtered through sensory attention rather than labels. The internal conflict is modest in complexity, keeping this shy of the top band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Hybrid drive (causal steps with an accumulative sonic crescendo) holds: pulses → door → stair → coordinates → vault → power‑up. Closure lands on the page via a resonant reconfiguration: the hush transforms and the city is briefly reweighted by released voices. Cost is legible (sacrificed lantern power; risk in the vault) and tied to the choice. A touch of world‑magic (water mapping coordinates) fits the established rules without breaking causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The conservatory’s mist, cracked glass, fountain hatch, and mossed ladders are tactile and govern tactics (access via flagstone/hatch; moisture, darkness, and power constraints). The hearing aid as micro‑setting/tool charges discovery and the final soundscape. Sensory detail is selective and POV‑driven, with the environment mirrored in vascular/plant imagery that supports theme. The setting directly shapes the decisive actions and final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Pressure escalates coherently under the chosen lens: faint ticks intensify to giggle/co‑ordinates to vault activation. The trade‑off of power and safety sharpens the final choice, even if the price remains modest. No antagonist is needed; the external puzzle entwines with Mira’s internal duty. Stakes remain intimate yet clear and tighten once in the vault.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Themes of remembrance over rescue and stewardship of vulnerable voices emerge through concrete acts (archiving the photo, reviving speakers). The final reconfiguration of “hush” resonates. A single overt thesis line (“Incidental heroism…”) states what the images already imply, slightly flattening subtext. Overall, meaning accrues from particulars more than pronouncement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The close third‑person voice is consistent, textured, and sensorially biased toward sound; diction and rhythm modulate with pressure. Elision is purposeful and legible, with no head‑hopping. Minimal dialogue fits the piece; spoken lines function as action rather than exposition. Minor redundancies don’t materially disturb the control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Line craft is vivid and efficient, with strong image economy and momentum. One clunky redundancy (“by tracking faint pulses in a decades‑old hearing aid” after already naming it) and a small explanatory block about the caretaker slightly blunt the edge. Otherwise, syntax and cadence vary well and keep propulsion. No figurative muddle at the climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The premise—“contact tracer for hearts” uncovering a seed vault of archived children’s pulses—is striking and coherently realized. The hearing aid’s sonic trail and the botanical setting synthesize into a fresh, inevitable final image. Risks (lyric science, bioacoustics conceit) pay off without gimmickry. Emotional truth (remembrance as protection) lands without cliché.</comment>
