<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Motivation is lucid and pressurized (conquer the self-labyrinth), and micro-choices (picking Silence, speaking denials aloud, selecting/wiping droplets) reveal values under stress. The guilt at erasing other Iras introduces credible contradiction against her clarity. Embodiment surfaces via sensory anchors (ozone, petrichor) though some conceptual diction (“procedural generation,” “seed data”) slightly abstracts emotion. The closing renunciation of savior‑worship path reads earned and costly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Orientation is immediate (viaduct after rain; Ira with tablet), and the piece sustains a coherent progression into the suspended rain “editor’s room.” Closure lands on the page: she composes a life pattern, baptizes timelines, and returns with the world reconfigured; cost is explicit (mass extinction guilt, foreclosed tyrant paths). The hybrid drive (causal choices within an accumulative lyric frame) holds consistently. Setups (arches as algorithms; respawning choices) pay off without rule drift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The viaduct/rainlake environment actively shapes tactics (menus at arches; descent helix; surface that arrests time) and charges the final image (arches breathing, tablet gone blank). Sensory specificity is vivid and POV-filtered (ozone, prismatic shadows, suspended droplets as planets). World rules are taught through action and remain stable. The setting is inseparable from the decision architecture.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear early and tightens when she enters Silence and later steps “between the drop and the ripple” with “no exit,” narrowing options. Agency drives escalation—speaking denials, selecting approving/vetoed droplets, refusing worship—and each choice carries visible or conceptual price. The editors’ room sequence is a decisive deepening that reweights all prior pressure. Stakes remain coherent and resolve through her renunciation rather than convenience.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Themes of identity-as-choice, ethical constraint on power, and the harm of untempered brightness are dramatized through concrete acts (wiping tyrant-Iras; diffusing power). The “darkening brightness” motif evolves from atmosphere to ethical principle at the end. No sermonizing; resonance arises from images and costs. The final cadence offers a non-literal answer: carry light that doesn’t burn, with remembered guilt as ballast.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A controlled, distinctive lyric voice sustains through pressure, with precise syntax and purposeful rhythm. Occasional register spikes (“procedural generation”) slightly jar against the otherwise mythic diction but are thematically motivated. POV distance remains stable; no head-hopping. Compression is taught early and paid off cleanly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density with images doing multiple jobs; rhythm varies and momentum never stalls. Figurative language is abundant but coherent and legible; key metaphors (editors’ room, droplets as sketches) don’t conflict. Minimal scaffold or loops; lines move intention forward. Minor abstraction patches don’t dull the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: gravity rebellion meets procedural identity editing within a rain-frozen liminal room, executed with ethical stakes. Turns feel inevitable from seeded logic (respawning menus → curated droplets → foreclosed tyrant branches). Risk-taking enhances clarity rather than obscuring it. The final reweighting is both novel and emotionally credible.</comment>
