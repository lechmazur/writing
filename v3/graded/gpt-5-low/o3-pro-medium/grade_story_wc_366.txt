<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Ellis’s reticence is dramatized through tactile, telling choices—climbing despite dread, decoding “protect,” arranging a reply cairn, and naming the glass “Anchor.” His contradictory impulses (urge to speak vs. savoring hush) surface credibly at the end. Interiority is embodied (matches, breathlike darkness, the ache in his ribs) and distinct. Secondary pressure from Marla/Joel is light but functional, keeping focus on Ellis’s agency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with tight causal through-lines (cairn→sea-glass→ritual placement→rekindled lamp) and a Resonant Reconfiguration closure. Orientation is swift and clean; the haunted dark coheres as a pressure that the sea-glass ritual answers. The final cadence (Ellis accepting his role in a quiet network, leaving a cairn for the next) lands with conceptual cost and a felt earned stasis. The magic logic stays consistent and is learned through action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The lighthouse, ladder, lantern room, and Fresnel pedestal constrain choice and tactics (climbing in dark, placing the shard on brass) and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and precise (paraffin, salt, lavender, verdant patterns), filtered through Ellis’s working gaze. Weather and darkness actively press the scene. The resurrected beacon’s “greenened promise” reweights the setting at closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—keeping darkness from “slipping into heads” and restoring the light—tightens through the lamp’s failure, the cairn’s “protect,” and the oppressive unlit presence. Escalation is a meaningful deepening: Ellis chooses a ritual reply that risks belief and identity. Cost is quiet but legible (endurance in the haunted dark, surrendering his own hush to serve the chain, staying through dawn). Pressure coheres without over-reliance on coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Guardianship, communal secrecy, and “bottled safety” arise organically from sea glass, cairns, and Ellis’s routes. The chain reframes superstition into a network, a conceptual repricing that dignifies reticence as service. The naming of “Anchor” and the final hush-braiding beacon carry earned resonance without moralizing. Ambiguity remains meaningful, not vague.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The close third’s lyrical precision holds steady, with diction and rhythm aligned to Ellis’s temperament. Dialogue is spare, natural, and subtextual (Marla’s “It is asking for a name”; Ellis’s “Anchor”). The perceptual signature—mechanics, weather, light, and hush—feels singular. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sentences carry high information density with varied rhythm; images do multiple jobs (e.g., “flame buttered the walls” locates and tones). Figurative texture is rich but controlled; metaphors stay coherent to sea and light. Minimal scaffolding or loops; momentum is steady through the lyric mode. Minor lushness never muddies causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—cairn syntax plus a sea-glass chain letter powering a haunted lens—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The understated reframe from superstition to guardianship is non-obvious and satisfying. Risks (quiet magic, lyric accumulation) heighten meaning without obscuring clarity. Specifics (stone heights forming tense; “greenened promise”) mark a distinctive vision.</comment>
