<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Clear, character‑specific motive (archivist resisting myth in favor of proximate causes) collides with a miraculous artifact, producing credible internal contradiction. The decisive choice—sliding the inked note over the photo—emerges from established traits and carries ethical cost (crossing from observer to agent). Embodied emotion and sensory bias are strong (“salt met perfume,” “haunted euphoria”). The endurance/renunciation of neutrality is earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal chain is tight: meeting → locket’s rule revealed → pocket’s secret → intervention → photo’s change → mantle accepted. Closure lands as a decisive change with conceptual cost; the archivist’s role reconfigures, and the artifact’s rule set is repriced. Orientation is crisp in the first lines, and the single‑scene structure holds. The price is legible on the page (“Carry it only when context changes… meant always”).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful; the jetty, petals, and violet water shape tone and enact the “covenant” idea. The locket functions as micro‑setting/tool charging the final image and constraining action (must watch until it settles; intervention is tactile). Sensory detail is selective and POV‑filtered (walnut ink, soot as reversed rain). World rules (photo healing with confessions) are learned through action, not exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (observer vs custodian) is established early and tightens when the pocket’s unsent letter appears, forcing a non‑neutral act. Escalation is coherent under a causal lens, culminating in a deliberate crossing of a line. The cost is subtle but present—accepting perpetual vigilance and responsibility. Tension operates at beat and image levels without contrivance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme—community accountability over mythic absolution—emerges through particulars (sea as courier, locket healing with confession) rather than sermonizing. One explicit line (“not mythic mercy from waves, but a contract among neighbors”) toes the edge of telling but is earned by the scene. The final image reprices small moments as consequential, sustaining resonance. Subtext in the widow’s “haunted euphoria” enriches moral complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct, controlled lyric voice with consistent first‑person distance and precise diction (“walnut‑ink archivist,” “ghost orchards”). Sparse dialogue is apt, subtextual, and advances action. Rhythm modulates well from observational calm to charged decision. No head‑hopping or stance leakage; purposeful elision is kept in check by concrete beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High information density with vivid, coherent metaphors; lines do multiple jobs without looped scaffold. Rhythm varies and supports momentum; no template cadences or filter‑verb stacks. A lush register risks excess, but vehicles stay aligned with the story’s logic and do not blur causality. Final images land cleanly without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis feels fresh: a civic covenant embodied in a mutable photograph, witnessed by a rational archivist who must intervene with ink. Turns are grounded in prior particulars (proximate‑causal method vs living magic). The risk—to literalize communal ethics via an artifact—pays off with specificity and cost. Closure reads inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
