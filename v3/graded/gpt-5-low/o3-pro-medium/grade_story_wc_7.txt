<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Moira’s motive (communal beauty over solitary power) is concrete and governs every choice, especially refusing to eat the fruit herself. Interiority is sensorially particular to her palate/skill, and actions (tuning fork, pruning “betrayal”) reveal values under pressure. The internal contradiction—temptation of omniscience versus sharing—exists but remains mostly implied rather than dramatized in a sharper on‑page struggle. Still, the final renunciation and departure register as earned with a felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: ritual actions build toward the comet’s zenith where the seed opens, then the communal serving reconfigures meaning. Closure lands with cost (she forgoes private omniscience, leaves the tool behind) and a clear before/after in the village’s stance. Orientation is crisp from the outset (who/where/when) and every step pays forward to the ending image. The live clock (alignment) cleanly tightens the window.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The rusted greenhouse, triple moons, and comet are not decorative; they constrain tactics (iron, war‑dust as micronutrients, alignment as trigger) and charge the final image (ladle on the nail). Sensory detail is vivid and filtered through Moira’s gustatory perspective. World rules stay consistent and learned through action. The setting’s corrosion-to-cultivation arc mirrors the thematic reweighting without being overdetermined.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—salvaging communal hope via a banquet—is clear and coheres under the ticking alignment. Escalation arrives through intensified pruning choices and the timed germination; the key tightening is her choice to share the fruit and “prune pain” for communal resilience. The price is primarily conceptual/emotional; a single beat of in‑scene temptation might have sharpened cost further. Nonetheless, agency drives the outcome rather than coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Themes of collective nourishment versus solitary omniscience, repurposed sorrow, and gentleness as rebellion emerge from concrete acts (guiding roots into war‑dust, leaving the ladle). The final image offers a resonant answer: change delivered softly can rewire a community without decree. No moral is stated; the imagery carries the argument. Ambiguity remains (future stewardship by others), enriching aftereffect.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A distinctive, sensorial voice blends lyricism with precise, character‑plausible science (neurogastronomy, synaptic plasticity) without register drift. POV is stable, close, and confident; patterning of images is taught early and maintained. Rhythm modulates cleanly from ritual concentration to communal release. Absence of dialogue is an intentional choice that suits the liturgical tone of the scene.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lines are economical yet lush, with images doing double duty (e.g., “juice like starlight,” “war‑dust as micronutrients”). No paraphrase loops or scaffold drag; momentum carries through beats. A few high‑density figurative runs flirt with purple but remain coherent and purposeful. Syntax varies to support cadence shifts at the zenith and the quiet departure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis is fresh: a chef who edits a seed’s “memory palette” via taste and sound to feed a village’s mind feels singular and inevitable in hindsight. The greenhouse/war‑dust/iron flavor chain and the communal neurogastronomy are inventive without gimmickry. Risks (science‑lyric hybrid, quiet revolution) heighten stakes and land cleanly. The closing gesture of leaving the ladle invites future stories while sealing this one.</comment>
