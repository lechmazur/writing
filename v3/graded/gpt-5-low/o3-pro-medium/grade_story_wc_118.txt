<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Ursa’s motive—salvaging what walls remember—is specific and drives concrete micro‑choices (the careful light‑fiber lift, the ear to metal). Curiosity vs. fear is embodied (“almost afraid the fragile ash would…scatter”). The internal shift from collector to stitcher is credible, though the felt cost remains subtle rather than sharply dramatized. No relationship crucible on‑page limits complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: discovery → charged phrase → tapestry omen → wall’s answer → conceptual repricing of her task. Orientation is crisp from the opening; the throughline never scrambles. Closure lands as a conceptual reweighting with a faint material echo (the wind’s tilt), though the cost is more implied duty than on‑page loss. The pattern teaches and pays off without causal gaps.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The reclaimed silo library is vividly tactile and filtered through Ursa’s sensibility (bronze quiet, corrugation vibrations, dust spiraling like script). Environment participates in the turn—the wall’s pulse and the library’s rustles articulate the “answer.” Details are selective and purposeful (fireplace, spiral ladders), charging the final image. Constraint is more tonal than physical, keeping this just shy of the highest band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes are conceptual (can listening realign a world’s axis?), signaled early and tightened by the wall’s response. Ursa’s agency escalates via attention tactics: delicate extraction, interpretive leaps, and the direct appeal to the silo. The decisive deepening is her realization that collecting must become stitching; price is responsibility, not a dramatic loss. Tension is steady, not jagged, fitting the chosen lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme coheres: memory as moral axis, listening as lever, archives as living cogs. The dragon‑rod embroidery and “displaced axis” phrase accrue meaning and reweight the final wind‑tilt without sermonizing. The piece invites reflection on ethics of preservation and repair through image rather than thesis. Ambiguity around “lever” remains purposeful and resonant.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A distinct, lyrical perceptual signature runs throughout (“bronze quiet,” “dust spiraled like script”), modulating cleanly at the wall‑answer beat. POV is stable and knowledge stays character‑bound; no head‑hopping or helpful‑narrator intrusions. Compression and diction are controlled; no dialogue needed. The cadence intensifies without slipping into haze.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished: strong verbs, precise sensory motifs, and sentences doing multiple jobs. Figurative density is high but coherent; images recur with purpose rather than churn. Minimal scaffolding and no paraphrase loops; rhythm varies to match pressure. A hair more plainness at one or two peaks could sharpen cost.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—post‑dream world, an odd historian reading walls, a tapestry fragment coding a cosmological‑moral axis—is fresh and organic. The lever/cog conceit feels inevitable in hindsight once the silo “answers.” Risks in lyric ambition and concept scale pay off without obscuring meaning. Emotional truth is grounded in tactile caretaking rather than abstract discourse.</comment>
