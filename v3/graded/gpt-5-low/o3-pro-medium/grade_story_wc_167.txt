<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Mira’s motive (finish her mother’s work; mend town by mending glass) is clear and embodied in concrete choices (go to the pond; reweave panes rather than replace). Interiority is specific to a glazier’s perception, but internal contradiction is light—competence faces little friction beyond time. The “glass never lies” credo usefully frames her method and restraint. The final acceptance of visible fractures as song reads as a credible, earned shift rather than a neat epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the pond’s rings set a time pressure and blueprint; the work sequence densifies to the “final pane” cadence shift. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—beauty refracts through fractures; the town’s perception tilts—with a soft but present cost (deadline, keeping wounds visible). Orientation is crisp from the opening. Slight softness: stakes never truly threaten to fail on the page, tempering the cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and integral: harbor, pond, and prism atrium constrain choices (consult ritual; work by daylight; finish before night). Tools and materials (lead came, soldering wand, bottle shards) are tactile and filter through her craft bias. The environment explicitly charges the final image (light through repaired fractures; noctilucent sky echoing pond logic). Sensory specificity stays purposeful rather than touristic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (complete the reweaving before alignments tilt) is signaled by the third ring and tightens tactics. Escalation is mainly density and deadline rather than antagonism; the “final pane snaps” is a clear peak beat. Cost is more conceptual (choosing to reveal wounds) than painful, and the deadline never bites hard. Still, the pressure coheres and deepens the outcome.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Themes of repair-through-fracture and mundanity transfigured arise organically from action (reweaving scraps; deckhands’ sudden pause). Subtext is carried by images (light bending toward crates, nets) and the pond’s reprise. A near-thesis line (“beauty adjusts the axis of perception”) states what the images already prove, slightly flattening resonance. Overall, the ending reweights earlier motifs effectively despite that explicitness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is assured, lyrical, and consistent with a reflective craftsperson’s gaze; diction and rhythms control pace without head‑hopping. Patterned elision is taught early and held. No dialogue, but the prose carries subtext and pressure through image. Occasional abstractions don’t compromise the strong perceptual signature.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished: varied syntax, high information density, and purposeful imagery that mostly avoids muddle. Repetition is functional, not looped; metaphors stay coherent with the glass/light lexicon. A few elevated formulations and one thematic overt statement verge on purple but don’t obscure clarity. Cadence at the climax (“final pane snapped…”) is clean and propulsive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The glazier‑oracle hybrid and pond‑ring divination are fresh, and the prism atrium as communal recalibrator feels original. The fracture-as-aperture turn is both thematically inevitable and newly phrased. Risks in lyric density and world logic cohere without gimmick. The final noctilucent echo synthesizes concept and setting memorably.</comment>
