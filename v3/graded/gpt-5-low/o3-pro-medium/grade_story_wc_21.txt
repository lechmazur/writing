<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara’s motive—defying remote archiving to seek firsthand testimony—is clear and consistently expressed through tactile choices (the kite, the debris‑code, the final question). Interiority is embodied via seizures and sensory bleed (“kerosene,” “boots”) rather than label‑speak. The inner contradiction (duty vs. dangerous truth‑seeking) is present but could tighten earlier on the zeppelin to deepen cost. Still, the closing endurance—choosing the ledger as revolt—feels earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hybrid drive: causal steps (diary → coordinates → lagoon → code → parley → routes) carried by an accumulative lyric density. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the lagoon shifts from starless to “storied,” and her seizures convert into anchored memory with recorded testimony, a visible cost having been paid. Orientation is clean from the opening and the two‑shard structure (zeppelin to shore) is seamless. The temporal bridge’s instability adds a concrete time pressure that tightens the endgame.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and operative: zeppelin library enables the descent, the lagoon’s properties shape access to testimony, and moonset illumination constrains when routes are legible. Specific sensory work (“black as cut glass,” sand like static) is filtered through an archivist’s gaze. The final image—lagoon reflecting dawn—recharges the world as newly recorded. Environment consistently dictates tactics (debris alphabet; reliance on moonlight).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (securing suppressed truth) escalates from seizures to field descent to a time‑limited parley as the lagoon trembles. Her agency drives turns: ignoring command, building the message, offering the cipher, posing the final question. The price—physical risk, breach of protocol, emotional toll—reads on the page, and knowledge gained (routes) reweights the world. One more on‑page obstruction en route to the lagoon might have further tightened pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Themes of testimony, erasure, and archival labor as revolt emerge organically through action and image (“Speak, I record”; “Because stories travel…”). The final moral sentence (“documenting the truth was another form of revolt”) edges toward explicitness, slightly dulling the otherwise resonant reconfiguration. Subtext thrives in the negotiated silences and cost of secrecy protecting villages. The closing image reframes the lagoon and archive without didactic over‑explanation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The lyric voice is assured and consistent, with rhythmic control and image selection tuned to stress. POV remains tight to Mara; dialogue is spare, goal‑driven, and carries subtext. The ripple‑voice of the figure contrasts subtly without breaking register. Elision patterns (reverie bleed) are taught early and remain legible through closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sentence‑level craft is crisp and propulsive; images do double duty without muddle. Figurative density is high but coherent and purpose‑driven, avoiding mixed metaphors. No paraphrase loops or scaffolded restatements slow momentum. The closing cadence lands cleanly with a charged, unfussy image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A floating library, retrocognitive seizures, and an obsidian lagoon as memory‑well feel freshly synthesized and necessary to the arc. The debris‑code and Freedom Cartographers add specificity beyond trope. The parley with time itself, catalyzed by an archivist’s cipher, is a non‑obvious yet inevitable turn given the groundwork. Risk‑taking enhances clarity rather than obscuring it.</comment>
