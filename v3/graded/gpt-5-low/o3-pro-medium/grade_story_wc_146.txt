<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lira’s motive (rebuild vs her habit of mapping escape) and Marek’s cryptic vocation create a clear, character-driven axis. The final choice—Lira stays and takes the fork—earns its cost by foreclosing her wanderer identity. Interiority is concise yet specific (heat in the stones; tears charting routes), though a touch more friction under pressure could deepen it. Marek remains enigmatic but active, not a mere oracle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: walking cadence builds pressure until the fork hums and time folds, culminating in a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis closure when Lira accepts stewardship. Orientation is crisp from the opening plaza/archway anchor. The cost is implied but legible (renunciation of flight; duty assumed). The sequence of loops around town functions as a purposeful pattern rather than “and-then” plotting.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and functional: the archway as threshold, the plaza and market as choreography, and the tuning fork as micro-setting/tool charging the final image. Sensory choices feel lived-in (dust lifting like waking birds; mortar “sweating”). World rules (sound as balance) stay consistent and are learned through action. Environment constrains tactics—revival is only possible via place-bound cadence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes are coherent (revive Varin vs. continue wandering), and escalation arrives through density: from silent fork to town-wide resonance to the transfer of the tool. The key tightening is Marek’s question, forcing Lira’s stance crystallization. Cost is present but gentle; resistance is largely atmospheric rather than oppositional. Still, the agency-driven turn lands.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of “shared balance” over speech is embodied in walking, not told, and reprises in the fork’s transfer. The concept of time folding reframes loss and restoration without moralizing, inviting reflection on community memory. Final lines reweight the hush from emptiness to promise. The resonance feels earned and specific.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The lyric third-person voice is steady, with crisp, purposeful dialogue (“Balance wants music, not words”) that carries subtext. Diction and rhythm modulate with pressure (from hush to chiming). No head-hopping; focalization remains close to Lira while allowing Marek’s opacity. Elision is taught and paid off through patterned cadence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is polished and musical with high information density. Minor repetition (“rhythm of footsteps on cobblestones” echoed in adjacent lines) nudges toward a small loop but largely serves pattern. Figurative language stays coherent and supports momentum. Sentence variety and cuts are clean; no clarity slips at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The bell-tuner/cadence method for reviving a ghost town feels fresh, with the tuning fork and archway reimagined beyond trope. The mapmaker who “walks maps into existence” is a distinctive, integrated twist. The temporal reconfiguration arises from established pattern rather than a late rule change. Bold yet legible.</comment>
