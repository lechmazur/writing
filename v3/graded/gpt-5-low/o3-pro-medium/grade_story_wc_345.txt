<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clear, evolving motivation (protect the arches/community) drives concrete choices: hesitation before ringing, then a gentler second ring reframed as promise. Interiority is specific (sap/ozone hush; chalk humming inside), with a credible fear that pricks “thorns” into optimism. The relationship with Serafin meaningfully pressures action without dialogue, revealing values under strain. Slight safety: the protagonist rarely risks a personal loss beyond social credibility and exhaustion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: arches crack → call via bell/messages → mass repair → new knowledge (arches as conduits) → reframed act (promise‑ring) → nebula’s mist sealing. Closure lands on the page as Decisive Change with Earned Stasis overtones: repaired arches, ghost on watch, chalk gone. Cost is felt in collective vulnerability, urgency, and the risk of mis‑sealing pain outward. Orientation and scope are crisp for the length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The orchard planet and drifting arches are vividly particular and directly constrain tactics (vines as sutures, magnetite skiffs, highest arch scene). The bell as tool and the nebula as environmental system both charge the ending image. Sensory economy is strong, balancing visual with tactile/aural (“butterfly wings” chime, chalk vibrations). World rules are taught through action rather than info‑dumps.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is coherent and escalates with the fracture spread and the revelation that arches are conduits, raising ethical/causal stakes. The shift from command to promise narrows options and requires a different, riskier intent. Prices are primarily emotional and communal (time, stamina, credibility) rather than a tangible loss, but they register. The protagonist’s agency drives both turns (both bell strikes).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Themes of communal interdependence, trust in the intangible, and transforming fear into harvest arise organically from action. Recurring images (bell, chalk, arches, nebula) reweight at the end without moralizing. One explicit line (“The motivation was simple and enormous…”) spells what the scene already shows, slightly flattening resonance. The final “bruised yet blooming” cadence lands as earned hope with cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A distinct, lyrical first‑person voice with consistent diction and selective noticing; modulation under pressure is controlled (swift during crisis; tender at closure). No head‑hopping; certainty stays within plausible knowing. Patterned elision (mythic framing, compressed time) is taught early and pays off cleanly. A few heightened phrases verge on purple but remain in character.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lines carry multiple jobs with strong rhythm; images are fresh and coherent (“latticed shadows,” “sigils of brambled hope”). Minimal scaffold/loops and precise verbing maintain propulsion. The density of figuratives is high but disciplined; clarity at peak beats is not obscured. Minor tell lines appear but do not sap momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: agrarian labor meets cosmic architecture, ghostly altruism, and a communal bell that changes intent to change outcome. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight given the seeded symbolism and world rules. Risks (lyric mythmaking, non‑tech repair logic) heighten stakes without losing clarity. The closure image is memorable and specific to this premise.</comment>
