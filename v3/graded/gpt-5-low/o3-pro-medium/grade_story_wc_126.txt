<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Selene’s goal and method are clear and character-specific, with micro-choices under pressure (using the bowl, whispering to map space, sacrificing strings to saw the net). Embodied perception anchors her interiority; her laughter on recovering sound lands as earned. The one gap is minimal on-page contradiction—she reads steady-true rather than torn—though the choice to unstring the violin carries a real trade-off. The final renunciation (leaving the bowl) feels motivated and costs something tangible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Hybrid with an Accumulative/Textural dominant: sound patterns and echo-mapping build to a charged reconfiguration where silence is “unbound.” Causality holds cleanly (bowl harmonic → echo mapping → story tremolos → sapling located → strings sacrificed → whistle → music). Closure lands on the page with cost (lost strings, bowl left) and a charged final image (sapling’s answering note). Orientation is crisp early and sustained through one continuous scene.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The sunken orchard ringed by shipwrecks constrains action (waist-deep water, barnacled walls shaping echoes, nets and glass dictating tactics). Objects-as-setting (bowl, crate, strings) integrate with space and reappear charged in the end. Sensory specificity across sound, touch, and light serves voice and choice. The final dusk/sinking image reweights the place without postcard excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reviving/locating hidden music within the hush—is signaled early and tightened via the discovery and unbinding of the sapling. The pivotal costed act (removing and repurposing strings) narrows options and earns the outcome. Pressure is quiet but coherent; reversal arrives when the freed tree whistles and the greenhouse becomes instrument. Slight softness in overt external jeopardy keeps it just below the top band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Themes of finding beauty in incompletion and listening as making are enacted, not declared, through the bonfire tradition, echo-reading, and the refusal to polish. The ending’s “promised more” note offers a resonant, non-literal answer consistent with the premise. Subtext in the chronic hush and shipwreck counterpoint avoids sermonizing. The orchard’s partial sinking reframes endurance and beginnings with quiet gravity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third-person close with a distinct acoustic bias sustains throughout. Rhythm and syntax modulate with pressure (from hush to laughing release) without head-hopping. Vocabulary stays within the story’s idiom; elisions are purposeful and paid off. No dialogue is needed; the whispered story functions as action more than exposition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Line-level craft is tight: images are fresh (bubble chord, hulls like broken harps) and do more than one job. No scaffold loops or filter stacks; momentum flows through tactile verbs and precise nouns. Figurative density is high but coherent and disciplined, especially in peak beats. Opening and final images echo cleanly without redundancy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original syntheses abound: catching a chord in a bowl, using violin strings as a saw, shipwrecks as resonant partners, a greenhouse-orchard instrument. Risks feel organic to character and premise, not ornamental. Turns arise from prior particulars and acoustic logic. The final note-as-promise is both fresh and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
