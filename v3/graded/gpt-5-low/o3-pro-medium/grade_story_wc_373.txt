<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Clara’s goal and values are clear and consistent, and her embodied unease (“watch fob…tapping her sternum”) grounds motivation. Contradictory impulses—stealth vs. the need to break the hush with “Truce”—surface under pressure. Her status play with Cinder via the fob reveals lived hierarchy and history. The endurance at the end (vow) feels earned, with a quiet cost in forgoing certain paths (violence, bravado).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Orientation is crisp from the jetty to the trapdoor market; the sunrise deadline and hush rule provide a coherent pressure system. The decisive turn occurs when the hush is broken and Clara restores it, reconfiguring options. Closure lands with Charged Poise: she exits with the cylinder and a self‑held recording, and the vow seals cost and stance. Coincidence (Cinder’s entrance) complicates rather than resolves, fitting a Situational lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The market’s rules and physicality (pilings groaning, barnacles raining, brackish steam) actively constrain tactics and escalate risk. The setting is not decorative; it enforces hush and nearly punishes the breach. The watch fob functions as a micro‑setting tool, charging the final image under dawn. Sensory selection is character‑filtered and purposeful across the piece.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—securing the “sound of trust breaking” before sunrise without triggering violence—tightens when Cinder shatters the hush. Clara’s agency (invoking “Truce,” revealing the insignia) redirects the conflict and forces a trade: social credit for safety. The cost is subtle but present: she curbs confrontation and spends inherited capital. A single meaningful tightening suffices at this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Trust, silence, and barter entwine through action rather than thesis, culminating in her internal “recording” and the fob’s closing click. The ending’s vow reweights earlier motifs (hush, inheritance, moral debts) without moralizing. Subtext in Cinder’s grudging loyalty and the market’s quasi‑sentience deepens complexity. The final image lingers with thoughtful ambiguity about what trust costs to hold.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The lyric voice is controlled and character‑specific, with consistent diction and clean focalization. Dialogue is sparse, pressure‑driven, and subtextual (“Truce”). Rhythm modulates with stakes, and the patterned images (shell phonograph, lantern halos) feel earned. No head‑hopping or register slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sentences carry multiple jobs (world, pressure, character) with minimal scaffold and strong propulsion. Figurative density is high but coherent; images track physical logic and avoid muddle. No loops or template cadences dull momentum, and the final lines are taut. Minor lushness never obscures causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The conceit of trading in the sound of trust breaking, a hush‑enforced market, and a shell phonograph is striking and integrated. Turns arise from character choice, not gimmickry, and the reweighting at dawn feels inevitable. Risks in tone and worldbuilding pay off without confusion. The piece synthesizes crime, myth, and lyric fable into a singular vision.</comment>
