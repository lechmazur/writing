<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Aveline’s fear and prudence are dramatized through concrete choices (reciting primes, negotiating with space, using the compass) rather than labels. Her internal contradiction—panic vs. duty—acts in-scene and drives tactics. The final refusal to cast the key away reads as Earned Stasis with felt cost. A minor on-the-nose abstraction (“Order…mutiny could be reasoned with”) blunts otherwise embodied interiority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hybrid causal/accumulative drive holds: music causes spatial shifts; the compass and negotiation produce access; the choice to keep the key reconfigures stakes. Closure lands on the page with conceptual cost as she pockets the key and promises restraint. Orientation is crisp within ~120 words and all set-ups (organ, compass, narrowing) pay off. A single convenience—space answering a promise—works because it’s taught early and consistently.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is tactile and consequential: narrowing passages, bellows, pipe reverberation, rails and gears, and the star-open dome constrain choices and shape tactics. The drafting compass functions as micro-setting, literally altering space to fit her body. World rules (architecture obeys sound/geometry) remain consistent and are learned through action. Atmosphere (“dust like ash,” “organ’s sigh”) deepens tone without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear (retrieve key vs. moral cost of war), and pressure tightens through the moving cage and constricting tunnels. A meaningful deepening occurs when she must negotiate space rather than force it, narrowing tactic options. The final moral calculus (starve vs. arm) crystallizes with a felt conceptual price. Stakes could read even sharper with one more concrete risk to her body on the retrieval beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Themes of negotiation over conquest and the ambivalent nature of opening (“doors invite war as easily as relief”) arise from action, not sermon. The ending reweights the premise into a charged, wistful pledge, avoiding tidy moral closure. Recurring images (organ, compass, dilation) accrue meaning toward that stance. A few abstract lines flirt with overt statement but do not dominate.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The close third voice is controlled and lyrically distinctive, with consistent diction calibrated to Aveline’s mind and training. Perceptual signature (“its needle remembered angles”) feels character-specific rather than generic high style. Rhythm modulates with pressure, and POV stays tight with no leaks. A slight tilt toward elevated abstraction in two lines is the only minor drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentences carry high information density and do multiple jobs (world, mood, action) with minimal scaffolding. Figurative language is frequent but largely clean and purposeful; cadence varies effectively. Minor redundancy and an occasional stacked metaphor appear but do not blur causality or the closing image. Mechanics and sequencing are precise, maintaining momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The organ-driven spatial mutiny and the diplomatic geometry are fresh and coherently exploited. The compass as inherited “steel blueprint” adds specificity and human texture to the weird. The ending’s reconfiguration—rebellion rerouted into stewardship—feels non-obvious yet inevitable. Risks in concept and tone pay off without obscuring clarity.</comment>
