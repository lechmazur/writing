<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear, distinctive motives drive both narrator and mapper; the narrator’s impatience meets the mapper’s discipline in concrete actions (tuning fork detours, rod placement). Interiority is specific and embodied (“shivered…like a tent of silence”), and the vow at the end credibly forecloses a prior path. The main limitation is low friction: the narrator consents quickly and faces little pushback beyond temperament. Still, the earned internal turn from urgency to “promises” lands.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: the journey, measurements, and humming viaduct culminate in a resonant reconfiguration/CR where urgency is reweighted. Orientation is clean from the opening, and beats proceed causally (mapping → detours → alignments → ignition). Cost is conceptual but legible: the narrator relinquishes a defining impatience and commits to recharting with visible renunciation. The closure image (“promises stretch; borders stop”) redefines prior material without contradiction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and functional: ice thickness, stress lines, basalt piers, rods, and stormwater constraints directly shape tactics and pace. The lake’s frozen state and the viaduct’s magnetism charge the final image and control movement. Sensory selection is purposeful and biased to craft and weather. World rules feel consistent through action rather than exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (kindling a “patient revolution”) tightens through the traversal choices and precise alignment, culminating in the controlled blaze. The felt price is internal—abandoning the drumbeat of haste—more than physical risk, keeping pressure quiet but cohesive. The meaningful turn is the hum modulating into a cadence that alters social options. A touch more material jeopardy or a sacrificed option on the page could heighten cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Themes of patience versus haste, borders versus promises, and time as political technology emerge from craft acts and images, not just claims. Some explicit thesis lines (“A patient revolution…”) flirt with sermonizing but are mostly embodied by process and cadence. The final reweighting (“promises stretch; borders stop”) resonates and reframes the map motif. Subtext in wolves pausing and sapphire light adds quiet gravitas.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A specific, lyrical first-person with controlled rhythm and precise technical lexicon (tuning fork, azimuths) remains consistent. Dialogue is minimal but purposeful and subtextual (“a patient revolution” as pressure). Modulation aligns with pressure spikes (hum → blaze) without head‑hopping or stance drift. The diction serves character and world rather than generic lyricism.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Line-level craft is tight: images carry multiple jobs, syntax varies, and momentum rarely stalls. Lyric density is high but coherent; recurring phrases (“softly purposeful”) work as motif rather than redundancy. No notable loops or mixed metaphors; technical details sharpen rather than blur. Minor risk of overrichness is managed by clear sequencing and action verbs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—lunar cartography plus a magnetized viaduct to engineer a “patient revolution”—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Tactics grow from this odd, persuasive physics; the final cadence literalizes a social idea without didacticism. Wolves, copper rods, and vellum moons create memorable specificity rather than ornament. Bold, controlled risk-taking elevates rather than obscures.</comment>
