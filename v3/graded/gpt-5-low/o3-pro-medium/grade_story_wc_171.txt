<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Petra’s interiority is precise and embodied—the ebony clipboard consoling and condemning her crystallizes her contradiction. Her choices under pressure (invoking the ritual; forcing the orphan-province clause) reveal values with cost. Secondary figures apply credible pressure while remaining distinct (brass‑armed Rourke vs. ascetic Laure). The endurance at the end reads earned: belief tempered by the knowledge of tomorrow’s cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single continuous scene, clean orientation, and a coherent Situational/Hybrid drive: ritual law + dawn deadline compress choices. Closure lands on the page: the leaders sign after the glacier renunciation and the joint stewardship demand; the cost is felt in their balks and Petra’s charged acceptance of ongoing upkeep. Because/therefore logic is intact (ritual → glacier concession → leverage for children). The final image reconfigures meaning without soft reset.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The terrace, helms, river water, and moons create a tactile, specific world filtered through Petra’s priorities. The terrace-as-witness and scarred plinth charge choices; the ritual can only happen here, giving the environment functional weight. Sensory balance is strong (smell of cedar/smoke; metallic clicks; torchlight). Tone and world rules stay consistent and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear and present: avert dawn annihilation by extracting enforceable commitments. Escalation tightens via the ritual drink (glacier loss), then the concrete terms, culminating in the contested stewardship clause that forces a tradeoff. Prices are visible in body (Rourke’s scars, balking signatures) and polity (resource control ceded). Tension operates at beat and sentence scales without coincidence saves.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>“Price of redemption” accrues through particulars (mentor’s death, ritual costs, grain over gold; children as noncombatant claimants). Subtext runs in objects and gestures (spit vs. benediction) rather than sermon. The line “redemption always demands interest” edges toward explicit thematics but is grounded by action. The final belief is a resonant repricing, not a tidy moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person closely held to Petra with a distinct perceptual signature; metaphors map to her vocation and history. Dialogue is brief, functional, and status-aware; narration neither over-explains nor withholds. Rhythm modulates well between ceremonious cadence and crisp turns. No head-hopping or stance drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Line-level craft is polished, with high information density and vivid, controlled images. A heavy metaphor load approaches saturation in places (“tired constellations,” “misplayed hymn,” “silver remorse”), but cohesion keeps it just shy of purple. No loops or scaffolding bog momentum; syntax varies with pressure. Final lines land cleanly without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The ritualized, quasi-mythic peace parley feels fresh through charged specifics (spent-shell torches; Paradox Falls code). The glacier-for-helmet drink is a striking, non-obvious device that grounds stakes. While the forever-war frame is familiar, the execution synthesizes setting, object, and ethic with conviction. Risks are aesthetic, not gimmicky, and they pay off.</comment>
