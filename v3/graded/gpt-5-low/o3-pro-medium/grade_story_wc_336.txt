<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orien’s motive—to preserve wonder—is clear and drives tangible choices (reciting fruit names, guiding the ribbon, grafting). Interiority stays lyrical rather than conflicted; there’s little friction or contradictory impulse on the page. The partnership with Liora is harmonious, offering minimal relational pressure. The vow at the end suggests cost, but struggle is largely inferred rather than dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens fits: ritual actions (weaving, grafting, rooting) intensify until a charged poise lands with a lifelong duty. Closure is on-page: the sapling sings, villagers are reweighted, and the guardians vow seasonal upkeep—a visible ongoing price. Orientation is immediate and clean; causality is coherent within the lyric logic. The lack of overt opposition is offset by the pattern’s tightening (“wonder is motion, not monument”).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The waterfall parapet isn’t decorative; mist, roar, pool, and a cliff‑clinging sapling supply materials and constraints that shape tactics. Setting details are vivid and purpose‑driven (mist as warp, roar as shuttle, willow/silk frame). The environment charges the final image (radiant hush under thunder). Specificity is filtered through the characters’ crafts, avoiding tourist cataloguing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes are singular: rekindling communal wonder. Escalation deepens via the realization that “wonder is motion,” forcing a second weave through roots—an adaptive tightening. Cost surfaces as exhaustion and the lifelong commitment to prune fear. Pressure remains gentle; no real chance of failure intrudes, keeping the band below the highest tier.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme arises through action (weaving/grafting as tending wonder) and the reweighting that follows (villagers subtly transformed). The “prune away fear” line edges toward thesis-stating, but prior particulars earn it. The final vow and luminous path offer a resonant, non‑literal answer about stewardship over spectacle. Ambiguity lingers in the ongoing cost rather than a moral wrap‑up.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent, with clean shifts into brief, purposeful dialogue. Diction and rhythm suit the mythic register without head‑hopping. Perceptual signature feels craft‑inflected (pruner/weaver) rather than generic. The prose modulates well at the peak without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Figurative density is high but patterned and mostly lucid; images tend to do multiple jobs (action, world‑rule, tone). Minimal scaffold or loops, and syntax varies to keep momentum. A few lush turns flirt with purple, but they don’t blur causality or the closure image. Line‑level control supports the accumulative cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The craft‑fusion of orchard pruning and waterfall weaving to plant “the color of wonder” is striking and memorable. Method and imagery feel inevitable in hindsight once the rules are taught (mist as warp, roar as shuttle). The anonymity of the artisans and the lifelong tending reframe the magic with grounded cost. Risk‑taking in concept and diction lands without obscuring clarity.</comment>
