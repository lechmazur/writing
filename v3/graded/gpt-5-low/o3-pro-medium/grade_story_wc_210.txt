<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas’s motives are coherent and intensify: guilt → purpose → sacrificial joining. Embodied perception (“calloused fingers,” “salt-slick pier”) grounds interiority. Contradictory impulses—fear of illusion vs. refusal of false comfort—surface at the pier and before the final step. The final renunciation (entering the bottle) feels earned and costly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Clear causal chain: mapping via working memory → recognizing the bottle’s mirroring rule → feeding it town fragments → solving the trap with sparks → self‑sacrifice. Orientation is solid from the first lines (who/where/when). Closure lands decisively with on‑page cost as he enters the vessel, reconfiguring the town’s life with his own. Constraints (bottle only accepts town objects) persist and shape tactics across beats.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The cove, torn lanterns, and pier are vivid and functional; the bluff and basalt supply the spark solution. The amber bottle operates as object‑as‑setting, constraining action and charging the final image. Sensory selection is purposeful and filtered through an alchemist’s lexicon. World rules emerge cleanly through observation and use.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reviving the town—tightens through discovery, partial success, the “ghost” risk, and a hard solution that costs selfhood. The micro‑reversal (illusion vs. real revival) forces a new tactic (sparks) and culminates in a true sacrifice. Pressure coheres and grows without an external antagonist. The cost is unmistakable at the end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Responsibility, memory as metabolism, and joining one’s creation are embodied through recurring images rather than moralizing. The final act reframes civilization‑making as literal incorporation, a resonant non‑literal answer to the premise. A few aphoristic lines tip toward stated thesis, but the imagery carries the weight. Ambiguity (salvation vs. self‑erasure) lingers productively.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A consistent, lyrical close third with a distinct alchemical/mental lexicon. Rhythm modulates well from hush to surge at the bottle’s splitting. Minimal dialogue is charged and precise. No head‑hopping or stance drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High information density with clean propulsion; images do double duty (alchemy/neurology/civic memory). Figurative language is cohesive, not muddled, and avoids loops. Syntax and paragraphing vary to suit pressure. No mechanical or copy slips evident.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: town as brain, bottle as organelle, alchemy as working memory, culminating in architect‑joins‑architecture. Turns feel earned by established rules. Risks (lyric density, conceptual frame) heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. The revival conceit feels singular rather than templated.</comment>
