<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clear desire (to find refuge/quiet) propels continuous micro‑choices from mapping to ritual, with a credible pivot when “bottling a gale” fails. Interiority is specific and embodied through tool‑use rather than label‑feelings. Internal tension (control vs. release; cartography vs. coaxing) is present, though the villagers’ pressure remains off‑stage and softens stakes slightly. The renunciation at the end (leaving the orb) reads earned with a modest, felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterning of sound, ice, and silence intensifies toward the ritual. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration—silence meeting silence—on the page, with a before/after clearly felt in the environment. Causality is clean: attempt → failure → reframe → omen → seam → hush; cost is the relinquishing of the tool and the acceptance of a new rule. Orientation is secure early; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The caves, echo stone, and ice shard function as lived setting and constraint, not décor—their rules channel tactics and shape the ending image. Sensory specificity is rich across sound, touch, and light, filtered by a cartographer’s priorities. World rules are learned via action (the orb’s hunger, ice‑omens) and charge the final altar image. Scale and spatial logic stay coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (securing hush) tightens via a meaningful turn when mapping proves insufficient and the narrator chooses a ritual of release. The spiral omen forces a directional choice and narrows options to the seam; the hush blooming is a concrete, earned result. The price is conceptual rather than severe—ceding control and surrendering the tool—but it’s legible and carries forward. Pressure remains coherent without false reversals.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of control vs. attunement (guiding the gale, “two silences pollinate”) accrues through particulars and resolves in a non‑didactic final image. Recurring objects reweight meaning: the echo stone shifts from extractor to communal mnemonic. The ending reframes calm as rhythm rather than place, an earned insight rooted in on‑page struggle. Ambiguity lingers productively without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Singular, confident first‑person voice with a precise perceptual signature (mapkeeper’s lexicon and noticing). Lyric diction is controlled and consistent; no head‑hopping or register slips. Rhythm modulates with pressure, and elision is purposeful. The voice carries image and action without explanatory crutches.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High information density with vivid yet legible metaphors; momentum rarely stalls. Minimal scaffold; repetition (e.g., “gently luminous”) serves motif more than padding. No mixed metaphors at peak beats; syntax varies and breathes with the scene. A slight luxuriance in description is present but doesn’t blur causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Conceptual blend (acoustic cartography, ice divination, “silences pollinating”) feels singular and inevitable in hindsight. Risks in language and worldbuilding heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. The hush’s on‑page mechanism is fresh and thematically integrated. The final altar gesture is both strange and satisfying.</comment>
