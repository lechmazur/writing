<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Lenra’s motive is precise and active, and her micro‑choices (button patterns, opening the doors, transcribing) reveal a steady, craftsmanlike will. Interiority is tangible through sensory focus rather than abstract labels. However, internal contradiction is mild; the cost of “sharing” reads more conceptual than personally fraught. The character endures pressure credibly but with limited ambivalence on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: tactile procedures compound until the chaos beat (sand in ribbons) forces a tactic shift. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing when she opens the doors and the prophecy insists “Share or disappear.” Orientation is clean from the outset, and the final image reweights the rule‑set with a legible price (relinquishing control/vulnerability). The throughline is tight and self-consistent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The amber warehouse, hourglass, buttons, and canyon echo are richly particular and function as constraint and tool. Opening the doors to moon and gulls materially alters the outcome—setting literally participates in resolution. World rules are learned through action without dumpy exposition. The final hum of the warehouse charges the closing image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: make the prophecy usable before dawn, tested when the sand’s chaos threatens failure. The decisive tightening is Lenra choosing “shared hearing,” which narrows options and resolves the tangle. Cost is present as exposure and surrender of solitary control, though it’s felt more as ethos than pain. Tension scales appropriately for the length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of communal meaning emerges organically from concrete acts (cataloging, opening doors, transcription). The imperative “Share or disappear” risks didacticism but works because it’s diegetic, not authorial scolding. The ending reconfigures prophecy from dictation to dialogue, offering a resonant answer to the premise. Ambiguity lingers productively without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent with Lenra’s tactile, mineral lexicon. Psychic distance remains steady; compression serves mood without obscuring action. No head‑hopping, and the rhythmic modulation sharpens pressure in the chaos beat. Diction remains character‑plausible for a mythic‑real frame.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is precise and image‑rich with strong verb choices and minimal scaffold. Figurative language is abundant but coherent and purposeful, avoiding mixed metaphors. Momentum rarely stalls; sentences carry multiple jobs (world, mood, action). Minor purple edges never blur causality or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—buttons as planets, a jarred echo, an hourglass prophecy—feels singular and inevitable in hindsight. The key turn (inviting the world in) refreshes the trope of solitary seerhood. Risks in diction and concept elevate rather than distract. The final reweighting is both novel and thematically sound.</comment>
