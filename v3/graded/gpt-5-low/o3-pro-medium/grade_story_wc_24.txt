<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Trond’s vocation, curiosity, and anxiety are clearly dramatized through tactile choices (opening the hatch, extracting the billet, using the key). Interiority is specific and embodied (“one slip could sever a thought”; feeling the wedge resisting his glove). The change—accepting stewardship as “keeping the dialogue whole”—is earned by discovery rather than declared. Slightly limited by minimal contradictory impulses under pressure; he moves steadily from question to revelation with little self‑conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: hesitation → investigation → crack/billet → key/unfolding → sand/mirror → conceptual repricing → repair. Closure lands on the page with both practical resolution (flow restored) and CR (time reframed as linkage) carrying a felt cost (gratitude and grief, renewed duty). Orientation is anchored early and stays tight to a single POV and place. The cost is more conceptual than perilous, but sufficient at this length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The fjord, station, pipes, sextant, and hatch are not decorative; they constrain and enable action at each beat. The object‑as‑setting (billet, key, conduit) charges the final image and tactics. Sensory specificity is vivid and POV‑filtered (“mist…parchment,” “broken crescents”). Consistency of world rules (hydraulic timeworks) is learned through use, not exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore function/understand time) is signaled early and tightens with the discovery of the crack and blade‑billet. Agency drives escalation—he chooses investigation, unlocking, and repair—while danger (razor edges, sabotage memory) shades the attempt. The decisive deepening is the mirror revelation that reweights the external task. Costs are more thematic than bodily; a touch more on‑page jeopardy would raise pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The mesh of hydraulics, memory, and communal time coheres into a resonant answer. The black sand mirror reweights the premise elegantly, and the final commitment reframes his role. However, the explicit articulation (“Time was not length but linkage”) edges toward thesis‑statement clarity. The piece still earns its insight through image and action, so the effect holds.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A distinct, confident lyric voice with controlled imagery and consistent focalization. Diction and rhythm suit a meticulous caretaker’s mind without slipping into academic register. Psychic distance modulates well from tactile maintenance to visionary revelation. No head‑hopping or unmotivated elision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line craft is tight, with high information density and purposeful metaphors that mostly advance sense. Varied syntax and strong verbs keep momentum; minimal scaffolding or repetition. A few high‑lyric turns flirt with purple but remain legible and voice‑justified. The final cadence is clean and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Hydraulic timekeeping, a sextant‑tuned reservoir, a razor‑edged tin billet with microglyphs, and syrup‑flowing black sand forge an original synthesis. The mirror’s conceptual turn feels both surprising and inevitable in hindsight. Risks in worldbuilding and lyric density pay off without muddling clarity. The premise is transformed by character‑driven specificity rather than ornament.</comment>
