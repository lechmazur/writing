<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mira’s motive (to build “safe zones for inquiry”) is clear, embodied, and intensifies through isolation and memory of ridicule. Interiority is specific—her theatrical self‑narration both steadies and exposes fragility. Contradictory impulses (gravity vs. laughter; retreat vs. persistence) coexist credibly. The change at the end—claiming the “safest zone” within—feels earned, if a touch tidy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural; images and acts accrue from setup to a resonant reconfiguration at the end. Orientation is crisp from the first lines; one scene with a soft hinge toward the geothermal plan. Closure lands via the finished dome and internal repricing, with cost carried in isolation and prior public dismissal. Stakes progress smoothly, though external resistance is minimal, keeping pressure softer than elite‑tier causal tightness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and functional: the abandoned control room, flickering monitors, and polar thaw shape tactics (cooling, temperature gradients, furnace placement). The dome and furnace operate as charged objects that constrain choice and power the final image. Sensory specificity (hissing rivulets, “campfires too shy to crackle”) is integrated, not touristic. Minor flourish leans lyrical but remains purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (complete a dome and reclaim inquiry from both weather and bureaucracy) is signaled early. We see one meaningful tightening: treacherous temperature gradients and measured cooling, culminating in the lift of the first dome and the choice to continue. Pressure stays coherent but gentle; no beat truly forecloses options beyond solitude’s ongoing cost. The coordinates offer deepening rather than a hard test.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme coheres—thaw as external climate and internal courage; transparency as safety; architecture that “feels.” Recurring images (thaw, breath, dome, bookmark) reweight meaning at the end. However, the line “realizing the safest zone for inquiry begins within” states the thesis too baldly, dulling subtext in the final paragraph. The resonance is real but slightly sermonized.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled voice—lyric yet wry—holds steady; the self‑addressed proclamations feel character‑true and move action. POV distance is consistent, with confident focalization and no leakage. Rhythm modulates well between image and action. Diction stays within the narrator’s plausible lexicon despite the elevated lyric texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Line craft is strong: images are fresh and mostly coherent (“metal like regret,” “campfires too shy to crackle”). Density is high without loops or scaffold, and syntax varies to maintain propulsion. Occasional metaphor stacking flirts with purple but doesn’t blur sense. The final cadence lands cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—a contemplative glassblower forging domes in a thawing polar ruin, theatrically narrating work—feels fresh and authentic. The bookmark‑coordinate turn adds intrigue without gimmick. Emotional truth (ridicule → chosen solitude → renewed purpose) is specific rather than templated. Risks in tone and premise pay off with coherence.</comment>
