<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The narrator’s motive (courier for a clandestine language resistance) is vivid and consistent, with credible costs (abandoning tenure, address, even pronouns). Interiority is specific and embodied through entomological perception and tactical micro‑choices (reversing airflow, guarding while Mira plants). Mira’s quicksilver pragmatism counterpoints the narrator and heightens pressure without flattening either. Only minor note: inner contradiction is hinted more than fully dramatized under peak stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: fog cover → betrayal → drones/auditor → vine question marks loop sensors → airflow reversal → escape and charged plan. Orientation is crisp from the first lines (who/where/when/why), and the single dominant stake (plant the message and escape) stays coherent. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/CR: seed planted, copy secured, options reconfigured toward “a sentence” tomorrow under ongoing cost. Cost is present (betrayal, live pursuit, taxed cognition) even if not bodily loss.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The greenhouse and community gardens are tactically integral: fog, vents, capillary pipes, UV patterns, ant trills, and the beetle‑mural panel all constrain and enable choices. Sensory detail is purposeful and POV‑filtered through an entomologist/linguist’s lens. Environment charges the final image (city lights, blimps) and repeatedly shapes tactics (Mira’s vine question marks; airflow manipulation). World rules feel consistent and learned via action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Pressure coheres and tightens with one strong turn (betrayal → auditor/drones) and an earned tactical response (vines scrambling sensors; airflow fogging optics). Stakes are legible and escalate; the option set narrows in a credible sprint to the panel/roof. The cost reads more as ongoing risk and forfeiture than immediate loss, slightly softening the punch. Still, agency drives the resolution rather than luck.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of language as resistance against monetized cognition emerges organically from action (living syntax, ant codes, “Not every silence has agreed”). Final image reweights prior material: “one word isn’t enough… tomorrow we plant a sentence” reframes defiance as cumulative text. The piece resists moralizing while making a pointed social argument through concrete particulars. Subtext in “curiosity accrues interest” and the auditor taxed by paradox deepens resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled first‑person voice with an ento‑linguistic perceptual signature; diction and metaphors fit the character. Dialogue is sparse but functional, goal‑driven, and subtextual (Mira’s concise prompts and tactics). Psychic distance shifts are intentional and steady under stress. No head‑hopping or unearned omniscience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lines carry high information density with vivid but disciplined imagery; rhythm varies to suit action. A few lush turns approach purple but remain coherent and voice‑true. No paraphrase loops or scaffold drags; syntax tracks action cleanly. Minor risk of metaphor saturation in mid‑beat, but the closure image stays sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: a secret language club using bio‑engineered vines and insect codes under a regime taxing thought feels original and inevitable in hindsight. Turns arise from established world logic (UV patterns as punctuation; airflow as a tool). The piece takes stylistic and conceptual risks without obscuring clarity. Specificity and human cost keep it from mere cleverness.</comment>
