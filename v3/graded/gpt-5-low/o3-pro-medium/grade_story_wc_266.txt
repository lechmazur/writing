<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lis’s motive is clean and embodied (fear thrumming, slipping on “petals of fog”), and her micro-choices (accepting the unlit lantern, following echoes, kneeling to wait) earn the shift. Internal contradiction (drive vs. fear) is present but mostly implied rather than dramatized in simultaneous push-pull. The guides apply gentle, apt pressure without stealing her agency. The change—waiting until the flame appears—reads earned with a quiet cost (enduring uncertainty).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: motifs and detours gather toward a cadence shift when the lantern lights and the path “no longer forked.” Closure is on-page as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing—courage is retrieved by vigil, not rescue—and the cost is the tense, time-bound waiting. Orientation is clear from the opening paragraph; no lens ambiguity. Setups (ticket punch, indirect routes, unlit lantern) pay off precisely at the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and functional: harbor, inlet, spit, and the veiled ridgeway constrain tactics (indirect routes, forking paths). The unlit lantern and the clearing of snapped leashes act as micro-settings that charge the choice and final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, with seawork and mist integrated through action. The environment reconfigures options (forking paths resolve after the inner turn), satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around the single stake (find unused courage) and tightens at the clearing where endurance is required without guarantees. The decisive tactic—stillness and waiting under uncertainty—forecloses retreat and pays a felt price. Escalation tracks under the accumulative lens: detours, forking paths, doctrine of obliqueness → vigil. Slight softness remains in external risk, but internal stakes carry.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Themes of oblique travel, relinquished leashes, and courage-as-waiting emerge organically through objects and action. The vigil reframes bravery as attention and listening; the final image (constellations in punched stars) reweights prior motifs. A near-explicit aphorism from Calla brushes moralizing, slightly reducing the afterglow. Overall resonance lingers without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A confident, lyrical third-person voice with consistent distance and perspective; maritime lexicon and cadences feel unified. Dialogue is sparse but carries subtext (fare paid by longing) and advances plot. Rhythm modulates—softer at harbor, taut at ascent—without breaking stance. No head-hopping or register slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Line work is polished: images are fresh (“petals of fog,” “drank the gloaming”), and sentences do more than one job. Figurative density is high but coherent; minimal redundancy and no evident scaffold loops. Momentum is maintained through purposeful compression and image-driven transitions. A few aphoristic lines approach purple but stay controlled.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The star-punch, indirect-route doctrine, and courage-as-vigil synthesize into a distinctive mythic-maritime fable. Risks (lyric mode, symbolic objects) pay off with concrete choices and closure. Familiar quest bones feel renewed by specific, idiosyncratic tools and tactics. The result is memorable and integrated rather than ornamental.</comment>
