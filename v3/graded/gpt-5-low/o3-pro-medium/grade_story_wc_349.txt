<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Kes’s motive—to locate the place where stories begin—drives each choice, with a credible tension between vendor/profiteer and seeker. Interiority is concrete through tool handling (stylus, bottled moonlight) and time pressure (parole). The final renunciation—choosing not to mark the slate—reads as an earned stance shift with conceptual cost. Slight distance remains: emotion is largely sublimated into imagery rather than embodied strain.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: patterning of coordinates → ascent → nucleus → non‑inscription culminates in a Conceptual Repricing. Cost is legible: spent moonlight, expiring parole, and the forgoing of inscription/commerce to guard emptiness. Orientation is clear early; set‑ups (apples, parole, slate) pay off cleanly. A hair more friction in the mid‑path would lift the tightening from strong to exceptional.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The glass orchard, ladders, sap‑glass apples, and cloud‑sea atmosphere are vivid and functionally constraining (restricted canopy, parole access, timed ascent). Objects charge the ending image (the untouched slate glowing with vacancy). World rules emerge through use, not exposition. Minor risk of decorative lushness is kept in check by tactic‑shaping details.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find origin) tightens under parole’s clock and the lure of making a mark. The central test—incise vs. abstain—forecloses a path and reweights value (subtraction over addition). Costs register without melodrama (spent inheritance, missed sales, acceptance of guardianship). Pressure is coherent if quiet; a single sharper loss mid‑ascent could further heighten stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of beginnings via absence materializes through repeated, functional acts (quantifying lack, bottled moonlight, the blank slate). The ending image answers the question non‑literally by enshrining emptiness as seed. A few explicit thematic statements (“universally adjacent,” “integrated fragmentation”) step on subtext. Still, resonance lingers through the vendor’s charged refusal.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third‑person closely held to Kes sustains a distinct perceptual signature (tools, measures, quantified lack). The voice modulates with ascent and time pressure without head‑hopping. Occasional abstract coinages risk register glare but remain consistent with the piece’s idiom. No dialogue; the silence is purposeful and on‑theme.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is musical, image‑dense, and largely precise; sentences carry multiple jobs. Minor overwriting and meta terms (“integrated fragmentation,” “Conceptual” inflections) create slight purple shimmer without obscuring action. Rhythm varies and transitions are clean; no scaffold loops. The peak beat’s clarity (choosing not to incise) remains crisp despite the lyric register.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—vendor of blank slates, bottled moonlight, parole‑timed ascent in a glass orchard—feels singular and inevitable in hindsight. The method of “quantifying absence” is a fresh engine that reconfigures the final choice. Risks (high‑lyric density, meta‑named tone) mostly pay off. Emotional specificity could deepen once or twice to push into rarer territory.</comment>
