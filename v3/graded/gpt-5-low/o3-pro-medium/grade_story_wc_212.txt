<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Alma’s motive (to “discover the texture of borrowed time”) is clear and drives every action, and the cost (visible aging) lands. “Furiously tranquil” reads embodied in her measured ritual under a blizzard’s pressure. Internal contradiction is present but light; she rarely falters or doubts. Micro-choices (placing the egg, descending, using the cap, continuing despite aging) align cleanly with motive.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Structure is tight: hatch → vortex → tunnel → mirrors → repair at cost → sowing → thaw, each because/therefore link escalating the ritual. Closure lands on the page with cost: she’s older and the world reconfigures toward thaw (Earned Stasis/Charged Poise). Orientation is solid from line one (who/where/when), and the lens (hybrid with accumulative cadence, causal spine) holds. No teleports or rule-breaking conveniences.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The icebound atrium, mirrors chamber, and storm are vivid and functionally constrain tactics: the hall focuses the ritual, the mirrors present the repair task, and the vortex interacts with ice, moonbeams, and relics. Objects-as-setting (acorn cap, mirrors) charge the final image as the ceiling heals and thaw approaches. Sensory detail is purposeful and POV-filtered. World rules stay consistent through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reclaim and replant time) is signaled early and tightened when the cracked mirrors demand repair at a price. Escalation is protagonist-driven: she chooses to channel the vortex, convert the cap, and persist as aging exacts interest. The cost is visible and accumulates, sharpening commitment. No antagonist needed; pressure coheres around the ritual’s risks.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Inheritance, stewardship, and entropy/time are interwoven through seeds, seasons, and lineage without moralizing. The final sowing and thaw reprice “borrowed time” from greed to care, resonating beyond plot. Recurring images (acorn cap, seasons, vortex) shift meaning at the end. The emotional aftereffect is earned and complex: victory with a felt personal toll.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The lyric third-person close is confident and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature (“seconds became malleable, waiting for her fingerprints”). Rhythm modulates with pressure—tightens during the mirror repairs, softens at closure. No head-hopping or stance wobble. Compression and patterned diction are taught early and remain legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is lush but purposeful; metaphors track the established physics (vortex, cooling seconds) without muddle. Minimal redundancy; lines generally carry multiple jobs (world, emotion, action). A high figurative density skirts purple but maintains clarity, especially in peak beats. Final image is clean and unencumbered.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dragon-hen plus “vortex inheritance” and entropy-farming is a fresh synthesis anchored in a seed-saver’s legacy. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight given the set objects and rules. The piece commits to its premise and follows implications to a concrete, costly closure. Risks in diction and concept deepen stakes rather than distract.</comment>
