<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Mara’s calmly intuitive vigilance and self-doubt create a credible engine for pursuit and choice; her decision to “finish the map together” crystallizes a stance shift. Embodied cues (boots skidding, iron rungs with rime) keep emotion physical. The relationship with Silas adds light pressure but is brief. Cost is more conceptual than personal, slightly softening impact.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clear causal chain: mirror glimpse → sprint to lantern room → map to tunnels → confrontation → shard union → broadcast. Orientation is strong from the first lines, and the two-shard structure (orchard to lighthouse) holds. Closure lands via a realized tactic and a conceptual reframing of “the anomaly.” The on-page cost is subdued, leaning more toward pledge and purpose than loss.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The lighthouse orchard, shifting ice, Fresnel lens, and tunnels are vividly specific and shape action (swaying tower, rime-slick rungs, hatch descent). The lens/tool charges the finale as they broadcast empathy, and weather responds in the closing image. Sensory economy is tight and POV-filtered. World rules feel consistent within the fable-lyric mode.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Pressure coheres and deepens (mystery figure, disappearance, unstable shed, hidden tunnels), culminating in the deliberate act of combining shards. Stakes (storm season, structural danger, isolated towns) are named and partly tested. The resolution is relatively easy—little is sacrificed beyond risk-taking—so the tightening lacks a hard trade-off. Still, agency drives the turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through objects and action: mirrors, shards, emotional cartography, and a lighthouse that broadcasts empathy. The final repricing—“the anomaly” as collective courage—reweights earlier signs. One explicit statement (“Mara realized…”) edges toward telling but aligns with the image-driven close. Resonance lingers without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice maintains close third without leakage; diction suits the world (“Fresnel lens,” “aureate windows”) and remains character-filtered. Dialogue is sparse but functional, carrying subtext and advancing stakes. Rhythm modulates well between sweep and urgency. No head-hopping; psychic distance is steady.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lines are vivid and efficient, with layered images doing multiple jobs; repetition is minimal and purposeful. A few lush metaphors brush the edge of purple but don’t blur clarity. Cadence varies to support momentum and breath. Final image is clean and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lighthouse orchard + emotional cartography + mirror portals + shard-compass is an original synthesis that feels inevitable by the end. Risk-taking in concept and imagery pays off without gimmickry. The reframing of anomaly as bond is fresh and earned. Specifics resist template swapping.</comment>
