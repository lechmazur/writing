<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Maris’s motive—to verify provenance against forged histories—is clear and consistently drives her tactics. Her restraint before stamping (“She resisted stamping it at once; first she would verify its lineage”) shows value hierarchy under pressure. Interiority is rendered through tactile intelligence (counting ink depth by touch), not abstractions. Slightly limited contradiction; she stays steady rather than fracturing in crisis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal chain is tight: blackout → disorientation → readjusted spine reveals passage → codex test → flood triggered by pedestal removal → pressured verdict via stamp → escape with sealed loss. Orientation is crisp from the opening (who/where/when). Closure lands as a decisive act with cost: she cannot return, the passage is sealed, but the condemned codex survives to challenge the official record. The drive lens reads Causal and holds through the ending image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and functional: darkness, salt air, algae light, and floodwater shape what she can do and when. The pedestal’s trigger and disabled floodgates directly constrain choices. The ink stamp and codex operate as charged micro‑settings that govern action at the climax. Sensory detail is selective and character‑filtered, avoiding tourist cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth vs forgery under lethal conditions) escalates coherently, with one strong tightening: lifting the codex triggers the flood that forces her verdict. Agency defines the resolution; she stamps under duress rather than defer. The sealed passage and permanent loss of access register as price. Stakes stay focused; no extraneous reversals dilute the pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Resonance arises from “reclaimed stillness” enacted through method and the charged final image of dawn with the stamped codex. However, the closing thesis line (“the alternative hypothesis of courage, inked upon a broken world”) edges into overt moralization, blunting subtext. Most insights are earned via specific acts (tactile verification, refusal to rush). Ambiguity remains around the library’s losses, adding texture.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The third‑person close carries a distinct tactile‑analytic voice that tightens under stress without head‑hopping. Diction is consistent with a measured, observant mind; rhythm modulates well from hush to surge. Lyric touches (“moonlit surf,” “whispering of tides beyond calendars”) feel voice‑motivated. No withholding gimmicks; inference matches plausible knowledge.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is controlled, with high information density and purposeful imagery. Occasional purple tendencies and tag‑like abstractions (“reclaimed stillness,” “truth steadies the sea of voices”) skim the edge but do not obscure action. Syntax varies to maintain momentum through the flood sequence. No scaffold loops or cadence templates dull the climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The fusion of sunken‑city librarianship, tactile forensics, and an ink‑stamp verdict feels fresh and internally coherent. The “readjust” trigger and pedestal/flood mechanism are elegant, non‑obvious turns arising from prior particulars. Emotional stakes tie to method, not spectacle, avoiding genre cliché. Risks in lyric texture mostly pay off without confusion.</comment>
