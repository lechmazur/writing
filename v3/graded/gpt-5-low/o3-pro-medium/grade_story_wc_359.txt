<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Harmona’s motive—unfettering the hush to “certify wonder as essential”—is clear and consistent, and her micro‑choices (which bell when; when to advance; when to braid all three) align with that aim. Interiority is filtered through synesthetic perception, giving her a distinct inner texture. However, internal contradiction is minimal; she rarely doubts or pays an overt emotional cost beyond concentrated effort. The competence-forward arc reads strong but a touch frictionless.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the piece tightens through patterned acts (bells → corridor opens → heart chamber → braiding) to a charged final image. Closure lands on the page when the marble becomes an open door and the “sculpted hush” is reconfigured from prison to threshold (RR with conceptual cost). The sculptor’s poised blow functions as a live clock and is paid off in the bell-of-marble-and-dawn echo. Cost is mostly conceptual (if she fails, wonder thins), not visceral, but it’s legible at the peak.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The ice cavern and auroral ice are not mere backdrop; they refract tactics (waiting for an emerald ripple, threading the ceiling) and charge the ending image. Tools-as-setting (bells, amber sheet) are integrated with place: ice, light, and sound answer each other. Sensory specificity across taste, color, and temperature is authoritative and POV-filtered. Occasional luxuriance pushes indulgent, but function remains strong.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes are signaled early and escalate via density of the hush, the narrowing corridor, and the heart chamber’s “upcoming destiny.” The key tightening is the choice to risk braiding all bells atop the marble under the sculptor’s impending strike. Prices are implied (risk of fracturing memory; generational loss) rather than dramatized as a loss on the page, slightly softening pressure. Still, the cadence shift to the door-statue reads as an earned culmination.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Themes of wonder versus disbelief and silence as threshold rather than absence are embodied through action, not lecture. The final reweighting—hush housed in an “open door”—answers the premise with a resonant, nonliteral solution. Motifs (aurora, bells, marble) return charged, avoiding tidy moralizing despite one early line naming the aim. The ambiguity around cost (what wonder demands) lingers productively.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A confident, lyrical third-person tight POV with a distinct synesthetic signature sustains across turns. Rhythm modulates well—measured at entry, brightening toward the braid—without head‑hopping or stance drift. Elevated diction is voice-justified by vocation and world. A few lush clusters flirt with purple but remain controlled.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line-level craft is polished: strong verbs, varied syntax, and high information density. Figurative language is abundant yet mostly coherent to the sensory logic; images do double duty for world and theme. Minor over-saturation and occasional ornament (e.g., stacked color–taste metaphors) slightly slow momentum but do not obscure action or closure. No loops, scaffolding, or clarity breaks at the peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—prism bells, an amber score that “remembers,” a sculpted hush becoming a door at a chisel‑edge of time—feels fresh and internally inevitable. Risk-taking in texture and conceit heightens stakes without gimmickry. The emotional truth (careful tending of wonder under pressure) holds beneath the invention. Only the soft cost prevents a higher tier.</comment>
