<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Liora’s motive is vivid and particular, and her micro‑choices (following the hum, conserving battery, deciding to guard the corridors) align with her vocation. The temptation to sell her findings versus her vow at the end provides a credible internal fork with a felt cost. Interiority is sensory and character‑specific rather than generic. A deeper moment of frictive hesitation under peak pressure could have pushed complexity even higher.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: diaries → negative → Ori’s intent → hum → hatch → capsule → anthem → vow. Orientation is swift and stable; the single‑scene window honors scope. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Decisive choice with cost (forgoing comfort to become guardian). The causal lens holds throughout, though the external danger is relatively low‑friction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is richly embodied and constrains action: ivy cools and “pools” echoes, acoustic geometry guides search, the maintenance hatch and crawlspace enforce tactics. Tools (parabolic mic, lightbox, crystalline recorder) are integrated as environment‑shaping objects. The final image (“The walls are awake”) is charged by place. World rules are consistent and learned through action, not exposition dumps.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recovering and stewarding stored resonance—tightens through discoveries to the recorder’s choral release and the culminating vow. The key turn is Liora choosing guardianship over sale/escape, which forecloses a path. The pressure is coherent but remains gentle; fewer direct obstacles slightly soften escalation. Still, the anthem’s bloom and battery risk provide a concrete intensification.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>“Legacy’s burden” is dramatized via the children’s anthem and Ori’s acoustic vaulting, culminating in Liora’s renunciation. Recurring images (walls’ dreams, ivy, echoes) accrue meaning rather than being declared. One or two aphoristic lines flirt with telling (“Legacy’s burden pulsed…”), but the ending reweights the premise without a moral. The final commitment reframes listening as stewardship.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A distinct, lyrical perceptual signature sustains control—sound‑first noticing, resonant metaphors, and technical lexicon are consistent with an echo cartographer. Psychic distance and tense remain stable; no head‑hopping or unearned omniscience. Rhythm modulates well at the anthem’s bloom and at the vow. Minor flourishiness never obscures clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lines carry high information density with few redundancies; images often do double duty. Occasional purple turns (“pressed back like velvet,” “balancing its elbows on the future’s table”) verge on decorative, but don’t blur action. Syntax varies and momentum holds through discovery to vow. No scaffold loops or filter‑verb stacks sap immediacy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The corridor echo cartographer, stone‑stored dreams, and acoustics as archive feel fresh and coherent. The architect’s protest‑chant vaulting is an inventive bridge between world and theme. The vow’s reconfiguration is earned and non‑obvious, with climate aftershocks integrated rather than stapled on. Risk is bold without gimmickry.</comment>
