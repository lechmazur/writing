<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Amelia’s motive—curiosity versus inherited loyalty—drives every beat and culminates in a costly vow. Contradictory impulses are active on the page (fear of lawsuits/orbiting reputations vs. responsibility). The micro‑choice to scratch the orrery with the pen nib externalizes her internal turn. Her decision to finance reparations with the sale of her estate makes the cost concrete, not merely stated.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: call → meeting → evidence → ethical calculus → decisive vow. Closure is a Decisive Change with on‑page cost (front‑page printing and selling her estate). The inferred lens is Causal and holds without contradiction. Set‑ups (pen nib, orrery, headlines) pay off precisely at the turn.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The observatory, orrery, and storm are not postcard details; they charge and shape the climax, with echoes and star‑“dictation” reinforcing the press motif. The pen nib functions as micro‑setting/tool to effect change. Sensory detail is selective and POV‑filtered by a journalist’s heir. The final image returns to setting to seal resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around a single dominant stake—publish the buried truth at personal and institutional cost—and tightens when Felix presents carbon copies. The act of scratching the orrery and the explicit vow foreclose the path of silence. The cost is legible (lawsuits/shareholders/reputation, sale of estate). Escalation is measured but purposeful, fitting the length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Themes of legacy, accountability, and journalism’s ethics emerge through concrete images (orrery of headlines; “proof by contradiction” as persuasion). Final cadence reweights the universe from regret to responsibility without sermonizing. A couple of lines verge on declarative thesis, but subtext largely carries the weight. The storm/press/telescope braid deepens the moral pivot.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice with a reporter’s sensibility and astronomical idiom stays consistent. Dialogue is crisp, goal‑driven, and subtext‑rich (Felix’s “proof by contradiction” persuades rather than explains). Psychic distance remains stable within third‑person close to Amelia. Elevated diction fits persona and stakes without head‑hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and information‑dense, with images doing multiple jobs; rhythm modulates well into the vow. Occasional metaphor stacking risks purple but maintains coherence and clarity. No paraphrase loops or scaffold bloat; each line advances mood or action. Final images are sharp and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The orrery of headlines, dirigible ascent, and “stars taking dictation” synthesize journalism and cosmology in a fresh, inevitable way. The proof‑by‑contradiction device is an original persuasive lever that alters stakes. The tool‑as‑talisman pen nib turn is memorable and character‑bound. The piece commits fully to its conceit without retreat.</comment>
