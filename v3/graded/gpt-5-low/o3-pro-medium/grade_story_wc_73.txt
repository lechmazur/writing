<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Marlen’s motive—to undo regret via a loop—drives concrete choices (rolling, chalking, proving, and finally stopping), and the narrator’s counter‑motive (to retexture the loss rather than reverse it) shapes the decisive beat. Interiority is vivid and embodied (dice as “nervous beetles,” “tears were equations”) rather than labeled. The cost—relinquishing the chase for reversal—is legible on the page. Minor note: the narrator’s internal conflict surfaces briefly (“could not abandon him” vs fear of rupture) and could tighten once more before the pivot.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of rolls/proofs builds until the compromise question breaks the cadence. Closure arrives as Earned Stasis: they erase sums, place the dice, stop ascending; the staircase reconfigures into a landing. Cost is explicit—foreclosing the loop and living beside regret—and the final image reweights prior material. Orientation is clear from the outset (infinite staircase, two characters, one scene).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The infinite staircase is not backdrop; it pressures tactics (endless ascent, chalking each riser, gravity loosened) and charges the ending (terraces/landing manifest when the chase ends). Recurring objects (dice, chalk) function as micro‑setting tools that alter options. Sensory detail earns its keep (clouds “like discarded thoughts,” rain on bakery bricks). World rules stay consistent within the fable logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—looping back vs accepting stillness—is signaled early and tightens via the compromise roll that reveals texture instead of reversal. The zero/one result deepens pressure, converting abstraction into felt memory, which forces the renunciation. The price (abandoning the perpetual pursuit and erasing work) is shown. Escalation is quiet but coherent under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme integrates seamlessly: probability as memory, motion without travel, regret versus stillness. The final act (listening “for the silence between probabilities”) offers a resonant, non‑literal answer without moralizing. Recurring images reprice meaning at the end (the healed chip, the staircase finite when desire ceases). Ambiguity remains purposeful and earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The first‑person voice is lyrically controlled and consistent; metaphors align with the story’s logic. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful, carrying subtext (“broken clocks… noon passes twice”). No head‑hopping; stance and psychic distance modulate cleanly at pressure points. Elevated diction matches the established register.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is tight: high information density, purposeful imagery, and rhythmic variation. Figurative language is abundant but disciplined, seldom tipping into muddle; motifs (loop, wound/seam, dice) stay coherent. No notable scaffold or paraphrase loops. A couple of lush lines flirt with purple but don’t blunt clarity or momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: an infinite staircase measured by dice throws and proofs as a means to hack regret feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The compromise to seek texture over reversal is a non‑obvious, human turn. Risk‑taking in concept and diction heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The final reconfiguration avoids genre‑template comfort.</comment>
