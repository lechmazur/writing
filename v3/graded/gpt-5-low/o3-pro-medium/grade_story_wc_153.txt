<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Motivation is crystalline—she seeks “the moment before deciding”—and contradictory impulses (“Wait” vs. “Speak now”) act simultaneously in scene. Interiority is embodied and specific (pain at the sternum, “armor rusted into flakes”), not diagnostic. Her decisive vocalization through the shard and the commitment to send a final letter feel earned by prior pressure. Cost is on the page: she carries pain until moonrise and risks vulnerability to break paralysis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: pattern of spirits/shard/condensation builds to a cadence shift where the shard overflows and truth is spoken. Orientation is clear early (mangrove labyrinth, medium, unsent letters), and closure lands with cost as moonlight heals the opened wound. Setups (condensation, shard, late moon) pay off causally within the lyric frame. The final image reconfigures options (from drifting to deciding) without mechanical over-explanation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The mangroves, water, roots, and moonlight are not decorative—they constrain and guide action (late moon extends pain; roots “vault” to tilt water toward the shard). The shard functions as object-as-setting, charging the final image and enabling speech. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful across senses (wet glass song, brackish water, condensation as windows). World rules remain consistent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—speak or remain silent—tightens via the “Wait” message versus the spirits’ counterpoint, then deepens with the shard becoming a mouthpiece. Pain as price escalates until the overflow forces a choice, with a new knowledge turn when her lover’s unsent sentences appear. The resolution comes from her agency, not coincidence, and forecloses drifting. The cost and trade-off are legible and scaled to the length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Themes of communication, paralysis, and compassion emerge through image and act, not moralizing. The unsent/sent letters motif reweights at the end, transforming absence from abandonment to mirrored paralysis. The final charged poise—healed seam that proves truth spoken—offers a resonant non-literal answer. Ambiguity remains humane without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The voice is singular, controlled, and consistent in a close third with lyric density taught early. Rhythm modulates well at pressure (from hushed accumulation to the sharp overflow beat). No head-hopping or stance drift; uncertainty is purposeful and paid off. Diction fits the sensibility of a medium in a liminal ritual.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Figurative language is lush but largely coherent and multi-tasking; images (condensation windows, reddish snow armor) advance action and theme. Minimal scaffolding or loops; sentences propel rather than stall. A few high-register metaphors flirt with excess, but clarity and cadence hold, including at the climax. Proofreading and syntax are clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The gargoyle rainspout as mouthpiece for unsaid words and condensation windows as divination are strikingly original yet integrated. The accumulative turn—unsent letters materializing as liquid sentences—feels both fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risks in lyric density and world logic pay off without obscuring closure. The piece commits to its premise with integrity and specific invention.</comment>
