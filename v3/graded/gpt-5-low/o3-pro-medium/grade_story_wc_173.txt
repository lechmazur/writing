<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mirelle’s motive—to defy the court’s lullaby—drives clear, embodied actions (the shears, the true name, the final renunciation). Interiority is lyric but specific, with tactile micro‑choices under quiet pressure. Internal contradiction is present but soft; she encounters little resistance, so cost feels more conceptual than visceral. Laying down the shears credibly forecloses a path, but struggle remains gentle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Hybrid lens leaning Causal: rumor → descent → woven doors unlocked by untangling → sanctuary reconfigured → city transformed. Orientation is clean early; the sequence reads as motivated steps with a clear before/after. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost (exposing the sanctuary, reweaving civic order) on the page. The low opposition softens pressure but doesn’t break causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting and object ecology constrain choice: woven doors require thread‑work; prisms refract and return the echoes; the fountain and frozen lip charge the last image. Sensory detail is vivid and filtered through the protagonist’s priorities (looms like teeth, breath as vowels). World rules are learned through use rather than told. The environment materially shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (liberate listening vs imposed conformity) is signaled early and tightened by the doors puzzle and the true‑name risk. Escalation is a steady deepening rather than combative, culminating in the choice to unsecret the sanctuary. The visible price is gentler than the rhetoric suggests, yet renunciation (of secrecy and tools) lands. Tension operates through poised decisions rather than reversals.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of listening as defiance accrues through image and act, culminating in an invitation rather than command. A few lines tilt toward thesis (“proof that silence was never duty,” “Conformity’s lullaby faltered”), trimming subtlety. Still, the final image reweights prior motifs (echoes, threads, prisms) without moralizing. The piece invites reflection on power and gentleness with credible ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Consistent, confident lyric voice with a distinct perceptual signature (threads/echoes lexicon) and controlled cadence. Psychic distance stays steady; no head‑hopping or register drift. Purposeful elision works in accumulative mode and pays off at closure. Dialogue is minimal but purposeful (the invitation), aligning with voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High information density with images doing multiple jobs; rhythm modulates well between hush and release. Figurative language is rich yet coherent to the motif; few, if any, mixed metaphors. Minor lushness risks over‑saturation but clarity holds at critical beats. No scaffold loops or template cadences dampen momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The prism‑echo sanctum and woven‑door mechanics feel fresh and inevitable given the courtesan’s thread‑tuned skill. The transformation via listening rather than force is a non‑obvious, specific synthesis. Risks in diction and conceit cohere without gimmickry. The final reconfiguration reframes power and truth with distinctive imaginative authority.</comment>
