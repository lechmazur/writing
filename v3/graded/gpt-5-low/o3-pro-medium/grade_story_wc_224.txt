<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Motivation is crystalline (“to understand the shape of home”) and drives concrete choices under pressure. Interiority is embodied and particular—map as feather felt rather than seen; “heavier than regret.” The shift from fearing pain to seeding talents reads earned through on‑page trial. If anything, contradiction is subtle rather than dramatized as a sharp internal clash.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: seer’s warning → feather‑map guidance → discovery of stone → reorganization tremor → seeding journals → home‑word aligning corridors. Closure lands as a Decisive Change with Resonant Reconfiguration: home reframed as carried direction, mountain exhales, exit revealed. Cost is legible (risk of being sealed, the ongoing obligation to “keep planting verses”). No major orientation debt or lens wobble.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The mountain‑bookstore is tactile, rule‑bound, and constraining; the nightly reorganization and architecture directly shape tactics and outcome. Details are specific across senses (phosphorescent margins, volcanic glass, breathing biographies). Recurring objects (feather, stone, journals) function as setting-tools that charge the final image. World logic stays consistent and learned through action rather than exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear and pressured by the live clock of nightly reshuffle; the tremor converts “hidden thunder” into active threat. The protagonist’s seeding and final utterance are agentive turns that narrow options and resolve the risk. The price is primarily conceptual/emotional rather than materially taxing, which slightly softens the edge. Still, the escalation reads coherent and tightening under a causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme coheres: home as a carried direction, memory as pain transformed into seed, the heart/maze refigured. Recurrences (hidden thunder, feather, stone) evolve in meaning and culminate without moralizing. The final image reweights prior material with genuine resonance. Ambiguity remains purposeful and invites reflection without fuzziness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyric first‑person voice is controlled and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature (tasting directions in dust). Compression and image density are taught early and remain legible under stress. Brief dialogue is spare and purposeful, carrying subtext rather than exposition. No head‑hopping or stance drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density with varied rhythm; images usually pull double duty. A lush metaphor load risks saturation but remains coherent and propulsive, especially in the quake-and-seeding sequence. Minimal scaffold or loops; syntax adapts to pressure. A hair less figurative stacking in peak beats might sharpen the edge further.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: a mountain‑bookstore that reorganizes nightly, a feather‑map, and a lost language stone used to seed a living architecture toward a redefined “home.” Turns feel inevitable in hindsight and grounded in established rules. The risk-taking is elegant rather than flashy, with durable emotional truth. Nothing reads derivative or checkbox‑assembled.</comment>
