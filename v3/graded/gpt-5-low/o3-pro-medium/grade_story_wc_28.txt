<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Aarik’s motive (“cradle empathy in arms of steel”) is distinct and consistently enacted through tactile choices (barefoot on cracked stone, arranging tesserae, voicing the name). Interiority is embodied via grief-as-temper imagery rather than labels. The relationship with Rima supports rather than pressures him, so crucible dynamics stay gentle. The cost is mostly conceptual—relinquishing the retrocognitive trap—credible but soft.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Hybrid with an accumulative/textural dominant lens: the pattern of placement → wind tuning → voiced echo → renaming builds to a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is crisp early (who, where, when, and damage after the great fire). Closure lands on-page with the city’s renaming and sky’s “veins of silver,” and the cost is the acceptance of sorrow as temper. The causal seams are clean and the ending reweights all prior images.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The plaza is not postcard dressing—it is “the anvil,” the only place where their act can be tempered; wind and stone actively tune and respond. The recurring tessera and stepping stone function as charged micro-settings that constrain action and drive the ritual. Environmental detail is vivid and POV-filtered (ash like gray snow; silver-veined sky). The final image is inseparable from place.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Pressure escalates texturally: shard → arrangement → wind’s chord → spoken echo → blue sparks → renaming. The dominant stake (rename to reforge destiny) is clear and tightens once meaningfully at the naming. Opposition is internal/ambient rather than antagonistic, so cost is more spiritual than tactical but still legible. Agency drives the turn; coincidence does not resolve it.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Themes of mercy versus strength and names as destiny arise organically from action, not sermonizing. The hinge vs. wall line risks neatness, but the piece earns it through consistent paradox imagery (“warm coldness,” “sunrise on iron”). The final revaluation (Solaryn) offers an implicit thesis on healing scars without didacticism. The braiding of shards, promise, and renaming yields lingering resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The lyric third-person voice is stable, controlled, and distinctly filtered through Aarik’s sensibility; diction is consistent with the story’s elevated, ritualistic mode. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful and character-distinct (Rima’s paradoxical warmth). Psychic distance modulates smoothly at the naming without head-hopping. No unearned omniscience beyond the framed retrocognition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and carries momentum; images do double duty (forge/mercy, ash/history). Figurative density is high but coherent and pattern-taught, avoiding muddle at the climax. Minimal redundancy and clean mechanics. A slight purple tint in places doesn’t impede clarity or the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis—retrocognition used to rename a city via mosaic acoustics, forging “aberrant mercy” into civic destiny—feels fresh. The ritual and object-work are specific and reimagined, not templated. The closure turn is both surprising and inevitable in hindsight. Bold lyric risk pays off without obscuring stakes.</comment>
