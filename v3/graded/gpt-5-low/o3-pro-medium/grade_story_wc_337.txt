<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Neris’s motive (to calm/ground the spirit before the hush numbs everything) is clear and consistent, and her taboo choice to use the elders‑disliked method under pressure reads earned. Interiority is concrete and specific (tools, smells, the needle’s purpose) rather than label‑speak. A minor limitation: internal contradiction is hinted (taboo method, cost of recognition) but not deeply wrestled with on the page. The final renunciation—offering applause to the dead rather than the actor—lands as a credible, values‑driven choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: unraveling knots releases sea‑memories that fracture the hush until the reweighting at the end. A clean mid‑turn reframes the antagonist (not a fisherman but an actor siphoning honor), tightening tactics toward the naming/applause solution. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the spirit accepts recognition and settles into the mask; the hush remains but softened—felt cost is the narrator bowing and redirecting applause to the dead. Causality and on‑page payoff are coherent with no loose set‑ups.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary, starlight, net, and needle are vividly particular and consistently filtered through Neris’s craft and aims. Environment and objects constrain choices (forbidden net method, lighthouse‑iron needle) and charge the ending (mask hung in the eastern apse). Sensory selection is purposeful across modalities (metallic taste, salt/rain smell, hissing gulls). World rules are learned by action—no inert exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Pressure accrues through the growing hush, the spirit’s roaming disruptions, and the taboo method; unraveling knots escalates via released sea‑pockets that antagonize the spirit. The reveal about the actor reweights stakes and narrows options toward reassigning applause. Cost is present but subtle (ritual risk, taboo breach, surrendering applause), keeping the conflict lyrical rather than perilous. Still, the tightening is coherent and protagonist‑driven.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Themes of recognition, honor, and redistribution of applause emerge organically through naming and the net’s drowned‑sky memory. The “interlaced hush” transforms from threat to lullaby, reweighting silence as earned equilibrium. The final image (mask facing dawn; island‑sand silence) resonates without moralizing and reframes the opening unrest. No sermonizing; complexity persists in the gentled hush that remains.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single, confident first‑person lyric voice with a clear perceptual signature (craft‑inflected diction, tactile ritual focus) remains stable. Patterned elision is taught early and remains legible; inference stays within plausible knowledge. Rhythm modulates under pressure (from lush observation to ritual action) without head‑hopping. No dialogue needed; the voice carries subtext and purpose.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lines carry high information density with vivid images doing double duty (star‑bubbles that crack the hush). Lushness borders on surplus in places, but metaphors mostly cohere and don’t muddle action. Minimal scaffold or loops; syntax varies and supports momentum into the closure. The diction stays controlled, with only a slight risk of over‑ornamentation in mid‑beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mask restoration as psychopomp craft, a lighthouse‑iron needle piercing memory, and a hush that accumulates like frost/sand—these synthesize into a fresh, memorable system. The turn (actor stealing the dead’s honor) is non‑obvious yet feels inevitable in hindsight. Risks (forbidden method, accumulative lyric pattern) heighten stakes and coherence without obscuring clarity. The final reweighting is specific and distinctive.</comment>
