<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rowan’s focused, craftsmanlike POV and Mara’s serene decisiveness read as specific and credible under pressure. Motivation is clean—fix the drone before the ship departs—but internal contradiction is light, with little friction beyond awe and urgency. Small micro‑choices (basin shifts, counterweight adjustment, trusting Mara’s calls) reveal values without grandstanding. The late realization about “patterns beneath noise” lands, though it edges toward tidy clarity rather than conflict‑scarred insight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal chain is crisp: diagnose → patch → imbalance revealed → counterweight calibrated → launch and guidance delivered. Orientation is immediate (Grafton Station at dawn; shop, captain, harbor clock), and the ticking anchor elevates urgency. Closure arrives on‑page with the drone’s return and the synchronized whistles, a resonant earned stasis. The felt cost is modest (time risk and trust), but sufficient for this length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting work is vivid and purposeful: the basins, lattice light, and mist directly inform Mara’s diagnostic method and charge the final image. The depot/harbor interface constrains time and tactics rather than sitting as décor. Sensory detail is balanced (sound, touch, temperature, vibration), filtered through the shop’s craft ethos. A few lush lines press toward lyric excess, but clarity holds.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear early: restore telemetry in minutes or schedules “splinter.” Escalation tightens through failed first fix and a new constraint (gyro imbalance), with the anchor’s lift as a palpable clock. Agency drives turns—Mara’s calls and Rowan’s precise adjustments—and the risked release is a credible test of trust. Cost isn’t punishing, but the time squeeze and potential disruption keep pressure coherent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Motifs (ripples, light, feedback) accrue into a theme of faith in pattern recognition; the final synchronization image resonates. The line “Direction is only hidden until we decode the feedback we already carry” reads as a thesis statement and slightly over‑articulates what the images already earn. Subtext in Mara’s method and Rowan’s dawning respect largely carries the weight. Emotional aftereffect is contemplative and earned, if a touch didactic at the close.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The first‑person apprentice voice is steady, tactile, and plausibly technical without pedantry. Mara’s few lines feel distinct, quiet, authoritative. Rhythm modulates well between lyric atmosphere and procedural clarity. No head‑hopping or stance drift; inference stays within Rowan’s grasp.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lines are clean, varied, and mostly high‑density; figurative flourishes are frequent but generally apt (“tiny eclipses of warmth,” “braille beat”). Minor purple tendencies flirt with over‑ornamentation in places, yet sequence clarity and propulsion are preserved. Little scaffold or repetition; syntax varies to fit pressure. Copy is clean and precise at action beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The fusion of blind craft, water‑listening refraction, and rail‑harbor synchronization via a brass hummingbird feels fresh and internally coherent. The method’s specificity avoids steampunk wallpapering and meaningfully drives action. The ending reweights earlier images without a twist gimmick. Strong risk‑taking in concept and texture, executed with control.</comment>
