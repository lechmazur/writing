<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Milo’s motives are legible and escalate: from curiosity and duty to a charged compulsion to complete the tapestry and surface buried intentions. Interiority is concrete (the whistle snagging, the “beetle” heart), and the choice to heed whispers instead of resisting lands as character-specific. The resist/comply tension is present but lightly priced; the cost feels more conceptual than personal risk. Still, his decisions drive every turn and are consistent with the “gardener who never learned to fear.”</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the chain is coherent: find → align → decode → follow map → exhume → re-house regret. Closure arrives as a resonant reconfiguration when Milo returns the king and letter through the sovereign case, reweighting Rowan and the hush. The cost is modest (a night’s endurance and psychic strain) but on-page and thematically apt. Orientation is clean from the first lines; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful: the cemetery’s velvet hush, the cobalt silo’s spiral and textiles, the yew as waypoint. Objects-as-setting (tapestry, sovereign case, spade) constrain tactics and charge the ending. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (grainy scent, lunar milk), with consistent world rules. The environment shapes choices rather than posing as backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—answering the echoes by finishing the map—tightens once through the decode sequence and dawn’s approach. The meaningful turn is Milo choosing to work the tapestry and then to dig, which narrows options toward an ethical delivery of regret. Pressure remains coherent but gentle; consequences are felt more as relief than loss. Still, agency, escalation, and payoff align.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Memory, intention, and caretaking braid organically through images (spade, king, salt to clay). The final act reframes the whispers as a call toward communal repair rather than mere haunting. No moralizing; the resonance lingers in the lullaby-like hush and the reweighted whistle. Ambiguity around “voices” serves theme without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The lyric voice is controlled, consistent, and character-inflected; the diction fits Milo’s sensibility without stray registers. Patterned imagery (velvet/velveteen) is taught early and carried with intent. No head-hopping; focalization stays tight to Milo’s perceptions and inferences. Rhythm modulates well through discovery, work, and dawn descent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lines are dense yet purposeful, often doing double duty with image and action (“choir shaped of wind and calcium”). A few metaphoric repetitions (velvet/velveteen) verge on lush but remain coherent and motif-driven. No paraphrase loops or scaffolding drag; syntax varies and sequencing is clear. Minor overwriting risk prevents a higher mark, but clarity holds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—a gardener decoding a grief-map tapestry in a cobalt silo to midwife forgiveness—is fresh and specific. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight and stem from established rules (visions tied to colors, the spade manifesting). Risk-taking in tone and imagery elevates without obscuring clarity. The piece avoids template beats and owns its strange with integrity.</comment>
