<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mara’s obligation-versus-curiosity tension is embodied and active, culminating in a precise, trained risk through the lasers despite survival instincts. Her professional competence is balanced with credible strain (oxygen clock, the impossible perfume reaching her). The scholar’s motive is clear and particular, if more static. The ending registers a subtle reconfiguration—Mara accepts guardianship and carries a cost-laced fragment of sunset—earned by prior beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: distress pulse → temple → beacon → trapped scholar → micro-precision retrieval → ascent. Constraints (oxygen, hypoxia, tripwires, potential collapse) shape tactics, and the beacon sync pays off previously seeded protocol without feeling like a cheat. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: guardianship replaces trespass, with a priced reprieve. No orientation debt; single POV and scene hold steady.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The underwater temple and its devices (pressure, lasers, spores, mosaics) are vivid and purpose-driven, constraining action and instructing meaning. Multisensory details—especially the impossible perfume—sharpen urgency and theme. The environment directly shapes the retrieval choice and the ascent’s caution. The final image is charged by place and object: sunset-in-a-vial borne from the temple’s rules.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear early (save the scholar and secure the artifact without triggering collapse). Escalation tightens at the laser lattice, forcing a values trade-off that risks both lives. The beacon sync softens the edge slightly after the precise maneuver, but the price—time, risk, restraint in ascent—remains legible. Resolution follows Mara’s agency and renunciation of safety-first procedure in favor of guardianship.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Ephemerality, memory, and stewardship accrue through concrete actions (the vial’s “last sunset” used to buy minutes, then withheld). The “lonesome splendor” tone deepens rather than lectures; even the scholar’s thesis statements are grounded in mosaic scenes. The last lines reweight the journey without moralizing, turning survival into a charged custodianship. Ambiguity lingers productively around what it means to carry a stolen sunset within.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyrical yet controlled voice with a distinct perceptual signature (procedural precision against numinous sensation). POV remains tight; dialogue is minimal but functional and character-bearing. Diction and rhythm modulate under pressure without head-hopping. Elevated language fits the world and Mara’s training meets wonder without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sentences carry multiple jobs—world, mood, and action—without losing clarity. Figurative texture is rich but coherent; motifs reprise rather than churn. Minimal scaffold or loops; pacing stays taut around the micro-surgery sequence. A few heightened flourishes flirt with density but never blur causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The perfume-vial-of-sunset amid a drowned temple of currents and constellations is fresh and integrated. The tactical laser-dance married to sensory and mnemonic stakes feels non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. The final conceptual turn—trespass to guardianship with a fragment of sunset housed inside—lands as both image and idea. Bold without gimmickry.</comment>
