<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and particular, with a credible push-pull between duty (distilling chaos) and feral jealousy of past selves. Micro-choices under pressure—stepping into the wind, sending the breath‑plane, choosing charcoal to finish—align with motives and reveal values. The cost registers when the rookie foregoes the ascent, foreclosing an ego-affirming path. Emotions stay embodied (metallic bees, ranger‑issue wool) without therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hybrid lens with causal turns inside a lyric frame: the breath‑plane warning triggers the rookie’s descent, which in turn smears the grave’s date, reweighting options. Closure lands as a charged poise/CR when the narrator authors a revised outcome and signs “To Be Determined.” Orientation is early and clean (cabin, assignment, grave) and the pattern is taught and kept. The cost is legible on the page at the turn and colors the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The cabin and its tools constrain tactics: stove for heat and later charcoal as the only instrument, the platform plus wind enabling the flight, the storm negotiating with the draft. Details are selective and POV‑true (kerosene, old coffee, knots mapping peaks). Environmental elements recur to charge the final image (lightning silhouette, embers as punctuation). World rules are consistent within the surreal logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—wresting narrative control/time to prevent the foretold death—tightens through flight and the intervention with the younger self. The decisive choice forecloses a path (the rookie’s conquest) and alters the gravestone’s certainty. Pressure coheres from cabin -> platform -> sky -> desk, each narrowing options. The price is emotionally legible and threads directly into the ending’s revised authorship.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of authorship versus chronology, with jealousy recast as solvent, arises from actions rather than pronouncements. Recurring objects (scroll, stove, platform, storm) reprice meaning at the end where revision outweighs prophecy. The final self-definition as “adequately footnoted” offers resonant, unsentimental acceptance. Purposeful ambiguity invites reflection without muddle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The voice is distinct—wry, precise, and metaphoric—with consistent focalization and plausible lexicon for this narrator. Rhythmic control holds through pressure spikes (flight, intervention, writing) without head‑hopping. Purposeful elision (rule of the sky/time) is taught and paid off. No dialogue needed; internal cadence carries subtext and momentum.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High-density imagery mostly pulls its weight, advancing scene and theme (“disbelief offers no calories,” “generator powered by paradox”). A few stacked metaphors risk purple but do not blur causality or closure. Syntax varies well; no loops or scaffold drag. Final images are clean and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of ranger procedural, dream‑logic meteorology, and time jealousy feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The breath‑plane intervention and charcoal‑authored revision are bold, specific turns. Risks heighten meaning without obscuring clarity. The piece commits to its premise through charged particulars rather than concept alone.</comment>
