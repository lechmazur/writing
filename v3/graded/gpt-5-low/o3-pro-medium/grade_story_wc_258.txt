<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear, specific motives (Jonas seeks a lens; Mirelle tests and guides) with embodied choices (placing zero at his heart; her final counsel). Jonas’s doubt versus curiosity yields a credible shift. Interiority leans toward Mirelle’s perceptual filter but still renders Jonas’s fragility and craft‑tethered mind. Cost is subtle (ceding solitary control), yet legible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single, coherent scene with early anchors; the accumulative/textural lens is taught through the spiral layout and held to closure. Closure arrives as a resonant reconfiguration: rain becomes threads to weave, and the choice to share the “tape” forecloses pure solitude. The price is conceptual/social (surrendering ownership) and on‑page. No causality breaks or unkept setups.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory detail rooted in POV: rain, wet plaster, onyx ink, oak table. The measuring tape functions as micro‑setting/tool that constrains tactics (“Place the tape where origin seems immovable”) and charges the close. Weather and loft recur to reweight the final image. World rules are learned through action (numbers ink themselves) without dumps.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible: how to navigate/regrow culture from failed ledgers. Pressure deepens via the reading’s emergent pattern and tightens at the counsel: “follow the line alone, or let others mark their inches.” Cost centers on relinquishing solitary authorship; escalation is quiet but clear under the accumulative lens. No adversary needed; agency drives the turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Themes of belonging over profit, culture as drawn not stored, and communal trust emerge through concrete beats (unlocked doors, communal ovens) and the charged final choice. Subtext flows in image and action more than assertion. Slight on‑the‑nose lines in the final cadence (“not for profit but for belonging”) temper the subtlety. Nonetheless, resonance lingers without simplism.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Controlled, lyrical third‑person with a distinct perceptual signature (craft diction, tactile noticing). Dialogue is spare, purposeful, and carries subtext (“my algorithms break where intuition begins”). No head‑hopping; distance modulates cleanly. Rhythm supports pressure without drift into purple excess.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High information density with images doing multiple jobs; varied syntax and clean momentum. Figurative language is rich but coherent (rain as threads/needles; thunder stitching). Minimal redundancy; no scaffold loops dulling the close. Copy is clean and precise.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: onyx‑ink tarot meets data archaeology and a rune‑marked measuring tape to reverse‑engineer culture. The method (“multiplying paths”) integrates form and theme; the final reweighting feels inevitable. Risks in tone and concept pay off without obscuring clarity. Memorable particulars avoid template solutions.</comment>
