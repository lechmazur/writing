<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Clear, particular motive (“navigate without moving”) and embodied attention build a credible practitioner. The main tension—wielding power versus honoring balance—emerges late but lands in the renunciation to share rather than rule. Internal contradiction is present but mild; competence outpaces struggle, softening felt cost. Micro‑choices (tasting flint, planting the arrowhead) reveal values under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: listening → echo/bird mapping → alignment → pact/renunciation. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost: he grounds power, foreclosing domination, and binds himself to stewardship (“or the canyon would collapse”). Decisive acts (planting the arrowhead; etching the teaching) make a before/after legible. Orientation and world rules are taught early and pay off cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The canyon of bone and echoes is not backdrop; it governs method (echolocation via birds), risk (collapse), and the pact image. The arrowhead functions as a micro‑setting tool that charges the final image and constrains choice. Sensory detail is selective and POV‑true, with wind, dust, and resonance integrated into action. Environmental logic stays consistent and shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Pressure escalates via density: listening becomes a test, then a dangerous empowerment that requires balance. The meaningful tightening is the recognition that unbalanced use could “collapse” the canyon, leading to the grounding act. Stakes remain conceptually scaled rather than visceral, but they’re coherent and paid off. Agency drives the turns; coincidence never resolves them.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme arises from particulars: reverence versus mastery, listening to history, and the ethics of power. The final vow and teaching object reweight the premise without moralizing, answering the question of how to move the world without moving oneself. Recurring images (birds, pulse, dust) accrue meaning and modulate by the end. The emotional aftereffect is one of charged stewardship.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A distinct lyric voice with consistent third‑person close focalization; perception is filtered through Ithar’s craft and reverence. Rhythm varies and tightens appropriately at key beats (alignment, planting, pact). No dialogue, but the narrative stance remains controlled without over‑explaining. Diction is elevated yet coherent for this mythic register.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High information density with purposeful figurative language; images multitask and rarely overflower. Minimal redundancy; the prose carries momentum while sustaining atmosphere. A few intensifiers edge toward lushness, but clarity holds, including at closure. Final lines cleanly reprise motifs without scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: acoustic cartography via birds, a “wandering pulse,” and an ethic of immobile navigation. Turns feel inevitable from seeded logic (echoes, bone towers, flint as conduit). The teaching‑relic coda extends stakes across time without slackening focus. Bold yet coherent risk‑taking elevates the piece.</comment>
