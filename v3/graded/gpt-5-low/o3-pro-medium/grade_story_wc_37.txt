<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motives are clear (rekindle the realm, find the pane) and tested when the lattice reflects her failures. The internal conflict between control and communal tangle culminates in the costly choice to tear the logbook and sing. Embodied emotion (“warm braid around my ribs”) grounds the lyricism. The renunciation of archivist rigidity for collective song reads earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: songs, memories, and objects layer toward a reweighting that cracks the pane. Closure lands on the page with cost (destroying the logbook, stepping through), shifting options from greenhouse stasis to open dawn. Orientation is taught early (who/where/what) and pays off when the “mirror world” reveal reframes space without breaking coherence. The final image is a CR/RR hybrid that makes a clear before/after.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The orchard/greenhouse is tactile and constraining (mica window, glass roof, vines), and environmental states evolve under pressure (vines loosen, roof pops). Specific objects (lantern, harp-cocoon, mica) are handled and alter choices. World rules (memories as fruit, songs as force) remain consistent through action. The setting decisively charges the ending image of stepping beyond the pane.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is established early (rekindle the realm) and tightens when the pane confronts her with stratified failures. The pivotal reversal stems from agency: she sacrifices order (logbook) and adds her voice, enabling the window to crack. The price is legible—abandoning her defining method and exiting the known greenhouse. Tension coheres without contrived antagonism.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: memory as communal weave versus isolating archive; dawns must be sung together. The line “The window would never open while memories remained separated” reweights the premise without moralizing. Final understanding (“swaddle them until they could fly”) reframes care as temporary holding, not imprisonment. Resonance lingers with complexity, not tidy moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinct lyric first-person voice with consistent perceptual signature carries the piece. Diction and imagery are controlled and modulate with pressure (from hush to orchestral). Elision is taught (metaphor-forward logic) and paid off at closure without head-hopping. Confidence never exceeds what the POV could infer in the moment.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High-density prose stays clear and purposeful; images rarely tangle or contradict. Rhythm varies and accelerates toward the pane-shattering and chorus beats. Minor risk of saturation is balanced by pattern discipline and momentum; no loops or scaffolding drag. Final lines land with precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Alchemical orchard, mica window, and “woven dawns” synthesize into a fresh, inevitable turn. The mirror-world reveal reinterprets—not replaces—prior logic. Risky lyric methodology heightens stakes and coherence without gimmickry. Emotional truth (relinquishing control for community) anchors the novelty.</comment>
