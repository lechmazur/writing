<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Clear motive (hush the prophecy) drives concrete choices, and his competence reads earned through ritual precision. Interiority is conveyed via tactile acts (smoothing hush, fingertip tracing ripples) more than thought, which keeps it specific but limits contradictory impulse on the page. The nearest tension—cosmic temptation to speak—registers in the sky more than inside him, softening felt struggle. The final endurance/renunciation feels credible and costs him the dangerous power he extracts.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: hush → ink dissolution → locating the last vowel → refolding and release. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: he forecloses the prophecy’s utterance and redefines power as silence carried by water, with the cost embedded in relinquishment. Orientation is clean from the outset; no lens ambiguity. Each beat coheres into the final image of the brook “fulfilled” like a library, a paid price and a reweighted world.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The brook is not backdrop; it functions as mechanism and vault, constraining tactics (dissolve ink, carry wings, bury vowel under the footpath’s stone). Sensory specificity stays textured (ink ripples mapping memories) and remains POV-filtered. The environment charges the ending—the water’s capacity to forget is the seal. World rules (silence as readable coordinate) are learned via action rather than exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible early and tightens with the discovery of the “last shard” under the stone, a clear deepening. The pulse of the sky’s temptation introduces a credible brush with failure before his renunciation. While escalation is quiet, the narrowing to one potent vowel creates genuine pressure and cost. Resolution is earned by his agency in extraction and release.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Silence refigured as craft and cartography yields a resonant answer: peace as deliberate structure, not absence. Recurring images (wings, water, maps) reweight at the end, avoiding didactic moralizing. A single explanatory line (“He was driven to hush a prophecy…”) edges toward tell, but the piece largely trusts image. The final inward turning of prophecy offers conceptual repricing with lingering implications.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Consistent, assured lyric voice with controlled metaphoric system (“mapping silence,” “library lent its most dangerous book”). Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping or register slips. Rhythmic modulation supports pressure points (the sky’s pulse) without clutter. The occasional elevated diction fits the ritualized POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lines carry multiple jobs—image, action, theme—without padding; momentum rarely stalls. Figurative density is high but coherent, with few mixed vehicles. Minor lushness risks purple but never muddies causality or the closure image. Sentence and paragraph rhythms vary to good effect.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Origami wings as silence‑carriers, “mapping” hush, and a vowel extracted from absence feels fresh and inevitable by the end. Genre elements (summoning, prophecy) are transformed into a unique ritual ecology of water and quiet. The risk—lyric compression in place of overt conflict—pays off with a precise, charged closure. Distinctive vision with conceptual integrity.</comment>
