<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and consistent—an archivist‑skeptic compelled to test and name magic—and the conflict between archiving and carrying drives micro‑choices (placing the shell; accepting the memory). Interiority is vivid and character‑particular, with embodied pulls (“ribbon of unexamined yearning”) against discipline. The final renunciation (not shelving the memory) forecloses a path with felt cost. A few lines edge toward tidy self‑explanation, but they don’t undercut the earned turn.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Causal: patterned resonance builds pressure and then causally reveals the brother’s sacrifice, culminating in Mara’s decisive acceptance. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost—she trades quarantine for the burden of carrying grief—made legible in the promise aloud and the garden’s path opening. Orientation is clean early; cause/effect holds without teleports. The ending image meaningfully reweights prior beats.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Environment and objects do more than decorate: hedges seal/open to constrain access, the marble pedestal acts as a conduit, and the shell’s state changes with honesty, all charging the final image. Sensory specificity is lush yet purposeful, filtered through Mara’s archivist skepticism. World rules learn through action (resonance, quarantine) and remain consistent. The garden directly shapes choice and exit, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear early (isolation vs independence) and tightens when the hedges seal and the brother’s choice reframes cost. The key deepening—the revelation that he quarantined despair to spare her—forces a trade: archive and abandon or carry and pay. Consequence is felt; the resolution arises from Mara’s agency, not convenience. Pressure is coherent and escalates without requiring an antagonist.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Themes of memory stewardship and redefining independence are earned through particulars (archivist ethos tested by the brother’s sacrifice). Subtext surfaces in images (filaments knitting; fountains falling silent) and the shift from coaxing to conversation. However, explicit thesis lines (“Independence…was not the absence of voices…”) verge on final‑paragraph moralizing, slightly blunting the resonance. The underlying revaluation still lands.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric third‑person maintains consistent psychic distance and a clear perceptual signature. Diction and rhythm flex with pressure (from velvet observation to tremor‑charged immediacy) without head‑hopping. Brief dialogue (oath, shell) functions as action rather than exposition. The voice remains believable for this mythic register.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is lush yet largely precise; images do multiple jobs (world‑building and theme) with minimal redundancy. Rhythm varies and the line carries momentum through sentence‑scale turns. Density occasionally nears purple but coherence and clarity persist, especially at the closure beat. No noticeable loops or scaffolding dull the final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The archive‑garden of quarantined memory, the resonance method, and the archivist’s ethos create a fresh synthesis; the brother’s quietly self‑sacrificial logic reframes the premise elegantly. The seashell’s evolution from lure to conduit to companion feels inevitable in hindsight. Risks in diction and design pay off without obscuring clarity. A few familiar lyricisms appear, but the core vision reads singular.</comment>
