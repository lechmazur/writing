<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Kilor’s motive and method are concrete and character‑particular, and his decision to offer himself reads as an earned renunciation after discovering remorse can only be redistributed. Sel’s guilt and fear of water provide a credible counter‑pressure and status dynamic. Interiority is conveyed through sensory idiom (flavor as emotion), avoiding generic labels. The only minor soft spot is the speed of Kilor’s pivot to sacrifice, though it aligns with his ethos.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Clear causal chain: touch → contagion → ricochet → pavilion cracks → demand → sacrifice. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise with on‑page cost (Kilor enters the coral; Sel’s guarded breath after). Orientation is crisp from the opening and the drive lens stays coherent. Slight ambiguity about the pavilion’s “demand” is supported by physical signs (cracking, vapor), keeping cause credible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The fortress after rain and the thawing coral pavilion are vivid, multi‑sensory, and constantly in play, constraining choices and charging the final image. The environment (water, ice, wind) materially shapes fear and stakes, especially Sel’s balking at water and the drowning threat. Details are selective and POV‑filtered through taste and texture. The final mirrors of rainwater reweight the opening image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake is clear and tightens: smoothing Sel’s remorse without catastrophic spread, then containing the pavilion’s threat. The contagion and ricochet function as earned reversals, forcing a costly trade‑off. Kilor’s sacrifice resolves the external and internal pressures credibly. Stakes remain visceral rather than abstract through concrete sensory beats.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: remorse cannot be erased, only redirected, and responsibility requires bearing cost. The final uncertainty—whether the vigil praises or judges—preserves moral complexity while landing a resonant answer. Recurring images (salt, water, coral) accrue meaning without being over‑explained. No moralizing; the insight is earned through action and consequence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The voice is distinctive, lyrical, and controlled, with a strong perceptual signature centered on taste and texture. POV remains steady with slight, purposeful slips to Sel’s perception that enrich subtext. Dialogue is minimal but purposeful and subtextual (“the pavilion demanded payment”). Rhythm modulates with pressure without losing clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High information density with vivid, precise figurative language that generally clarifies rather than obscures. No discernible loops or scaffold; sentences propel and vary. A few ornate phrases risk saturation, but coherence holds, including at the closing image. Mechanics and sequencing are clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The premise—chef tasting memories, coral pavilion storing remorse, contagion through touch—is striking and integrated. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight: the method used to offload guilt produces unintended spread, demanding a sacrifice. Imagery and world logic cohere without genre crutches. The risk‑taking in concept and diction heightens stakes and originality.</comment>
