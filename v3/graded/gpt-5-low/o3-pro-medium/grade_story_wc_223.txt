<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Ezra’s motive—“apprentice to memory”—drives every action, and his contradiction (opportunist/martyr) flickers in the offer of joint stewardship over control. Interiority is embodied (bishop scrape as syllables; palm to cold geometry) and decisions under pressure are legible. Calypso’s benevolent ruthlessness applies immediate relational pressure and shifts status on the floor-as-board. The final choice feels earned and exposes a cost: surrendering sole custody to preserve integrity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Situational lens holds: the interregnum and Calypso’s pressure force a stance crystallization about who will own the whispers. Closure lands on the page with their pact and the act of “unbinding” via microphones—an RR/CR that reweights ownership of memory. Costs are conceptual but clear: Ezra relinquishes monopoly and binds himself to a precarious ally; Calypso trades leverage for legitimacy. Orientation is clean from the opening image; causality is coherent through patterned actions (walking scripts → CHECKMATE).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The whispering gallery is not decor; its acoustics enable encoded exchanges and make echoes an active resource and constraint, culminating in joint stewardship to preserve those echoes. The pawnless chessboard functions as micro‑setting, charging tactics and metaphor. Atmosphere (“luminous absence,” “nomadic penumbra”) aligns with stakes and modulates toward the charged poise of the ending. Spatial choreography (tiles, colonnade, central tile) remains coherent and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—custody of truth during interregnum—tightens as Calypso demands UNBIND and arrays followers on alternating tiles. Ezra’s counter (bishop scrape, then CHECKMATE gait) credibly narrows options and forces a trade: share or risk seizure. The price is a principled compromise under threat; no soft reset follows. Escalation is quiet but unmistakable and rooted in agency rather than coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Themes of memory’s custodianship, power’s myth‑making, and the dignity of small gestures braid through object/action motifs (pawnless board; pauses as “luminous absences”). Subtext runs through hesitations and kinetic scripts rather than exposition. The final line risks thesis‑statement clarity (“History... the echo of someone choosing to notice”), slightly flattening the otherwise earned resonance. Still, the conceptual repricing of “pawns” into language and microphones is strong.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A distinctive, controlled lyric register suits Ezra’s perceptual signature and holds steady under pressure. Elision patterns (encoded walking, echo‑carried words) are taught early and pay off cleanly. Dialogue is sparse but functional, with subtextual aims (“Speak your smallest gesture”). No POV leakage; certainty stays within Ezra’s plausible knowledge.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High‑density lines do multiple jobs with minimal scaffold; images are fresh and largely coherent (“shadow with its own passport,” “benevolently ruthless eyes”). Figurative texture is rich but under control; cadence varies to maintain propulsion. Minor risk of over‑ornament is balanced by clarity in peak beats (CHECKMATE, the nod, the microphones). No noticeable loops or template cadences dulling momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—pawnless chess as ethics of memory, walking‑script communication, a whispering gallery that “remembers”—feels singular and inevitable in hindsight. Risk‑taking serves stakes rather than showy novelty. Turns grow from seeded patterns (UNBIND → CHECKMATE → microphones) without late rule changes. A hairline of aphoristic tilt at the end is the only restraint on an even higher score.</comment>
