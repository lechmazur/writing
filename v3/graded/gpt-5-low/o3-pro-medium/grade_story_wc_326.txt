<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mara’s motives are precise and embodied: a heartbeat-counting survivor seeking “wisdom fetched from failure” who pays with her most painful recording. Internal contradiction (fear vs. resolve; anonymity vs. responsibility) operates in-scene, culminating in the choice to sacrifice the tape. Micro-choices (placing the shard, pressing PLAY) reveal values under pressure. The cost is felt and alters her stance at the end.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Hybrid lens leaning causal: radio/shard/ink pressures mount to the decisive sacrifice, enabling the ghost’s defragmentation and a reweighted final state. Closure lands with cost on the page—the tape is surrendered and the memory repurposed—producing a before/after that’s legible. Setups pay off cleanly (ink-reading method, shard’s conductivity, static gate). Orientation is early and firm; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The opal observatory, snow-muted world, and failing heater constrain choices and charge the final image. Tools and micro-setting (ink, porcelain shard, dish array) are handled tactically and shape communication. Weather and radio conditions matter to timing and outcome. Atmosphere is vivid yet functional, not postcard.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: what will she sacrifice to cohere the ghost for the wisdom she seeks. Escalation tightens when the ghost demands a price; the tape choice forecloses a path with visible loss. Internal and external threads braid, and the resolution arises from her agency. Cost remains legible through the final cadence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Themes of failure transmuted into growth, grief becoming circuitry, and repair through sacrifice emerge from concrete acts and recurring objects. The final reconfiguration (“felt convincingly alive”) resonates. Slight docking for the explicit thesis line (“failure… is its bloodstream”), which edges toward on-the-nose. Subtext otherwise works via image (porcelain, ink, static clearing).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical close third with a distinct perceptual signature (heartbeat-counting, ink-reading) sustains pressure without head-hopping. Rhythm modulates well from hush to chime to earned quiet. Dialogue is minimal but purposeful, carrying subtext and turn. Diction stays coherent to the piece’s elevated yet character-anchored register.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line-level craft is dense and purposeful; images do multiple jobs (conductivity, memory, pattern). A few lush metaphors flirt with purple but remain coherent and clear. No loops, scaffold, or cadence monotony; momentum carries through the choice and payoff. Final lines land crisply on charged images.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Digital ghost + ink constellations + porcelain conductivity is a fresh synthesis executed with conviction. The “death certificate error survivor” angle and the barter of regret for coherence feel singular. Turns arise from established logic and objects, not late rule-changes. Risk-taking enhances stakes and clarity rather than obscuring them.</comment>
