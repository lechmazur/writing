<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Olivine’s motive—collecting the weights of burdens—is clear and particular, and her competence is balanced by the trap of her own unmeasured burden. The internal contradiction (she welcomes boundary blur until it traps her) feels earned and drives the pivotal turn. Embodied beats like “a yank behind her sternum” and fingers threatening to calcify ground emotion. The final choice to measure and braid her own burden forecloses avoidance with a credible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: repeated orienting of the lamp densifies pattern until the darker seam forces a reconfiguration. Closure lands on the page when she measures and braids her own burden, rebalancing the grotto; the cost is her admitted lack and the near-paralysis. The who/where/when is anchored early, and causality within the lyric logic is coherent (orientation → crystals → pit → self-weave → balance). The final hush “folded…like wings” registers a resonant before/after.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The bronze grotto and lamp function as live environment and tool, constraining tactics (rotation, inversion, mirrored ore) and charging the final tapestry image. Sensory specificity is rich yet purposeful (calcifying droplets, mirrored pit, starlight to pale gold). World rules are taught through action and remain consistent. The setting actively partners with theme and decision, not a postcard backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—collecting and balancing burdens without being subsumed—tightens when the “darker seam” reveals her unmeasured cost. The reversal (“turned the burner upside down”) and the subsequent self-aimed light narrow options and force a trade-off. Price is felt in the threat of paralysis and the admission of emptiness. Escalation is clean and protagonist-driven under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of reciprocity and burden-ethics emerges through concrete acts: she cannot credibly weave others without weaving herself. Recurring images (hush shingles → wings; calcified tears; weights in drams) reweight meaning at the end without didacticism. The final hope “roof the sky” resonates as conceptual repricing rather than a moral. Complexity survives the resolution: mission unfinished, but stance altered.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The third-person close maintains a distinct, lyrical perceptual signature that modulates with pressure (from opalescent description to clipped, task-focused directives). Patterned phrasing (“By orienting properly…”) is taught and paid off as method and rhythm. No head-hopping or register drift; certainty matches what she can sense. Voice deepens rather than explains.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line-level craft is elegant and efficient; most sentences carry dual duty (world + pressure/meaning). Figurative density is high but coherent within an established lexicon; metaphors don’t contradict physical logic. Minimal scaffolding and no noticeable loops; cadence varies to fit beats. A hairline risk of purple is kept in check by consistent action tethering.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis feels singular: a fractal weaver measuring burdens in drams within a bronze, calcifying grotto, using lamp orientation as epistemology. Turns grow from prior particulars (inversion, mirrored ore, shadow-aimed light) rather than late rule drops. Emotional truth—self-inclusion as ethical necessity—grounds the high concept. Risky lyric design heightens stakes and lands clarity.</comment>
