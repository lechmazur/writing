<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Marisol’s motive—to study plant behaviors—drives every micro‑choice, and the push‑pull between panic and surrender is embodied (bark filigree, buds on knuckles) rather than declared. Her decisions to press the leaf, to “reconstruct by releasing control,” and finally to choose the “understory” feel earned. The cost—foreclosing a purely human life—reads on the page. Minor safety: her competence makes outcomes smooth, but her reluctance and recalibration keep it human.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, beats accrue cleanly from discovery to embodied change to chosen stance. Closure lands as Charged Poise/Resonant Reconfiguration: the seed in her palm after she resolves to live in the understory, with the conceptual and bodily price legible. Orientation is crisp from the first lines (who/where/when). The brief mid‑story time expansion (weeks) is controlled and supports the final cadence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The nursery, storm season, and “mossy trellis after rain” are tactile and POV‑filtered (plastic pots drumming, metronome ponytail). Environment constrains and enables choice: the storm catalyzes the metamorphosis and the trellis becomes the site/tool of reconstruction. World rules emerge through action (woody fibers knitting) without expository dumping. The final image is charged by place and weather logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (identity via surrender vs control) is signaled early and tightened by the bodily costs. The decisive intensification is her choice to press the leaf and let growth “decide angles and strength,” which narrows options toward metamorphosis. Later public acts deepen stakes, culminating in the understory choice with visible price. Tension is internal but persistent, operating sentence to sentence through sensory escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme grows organically from particulars: reconstruction through surrender, belonging to a slow conversation, and the cost of crossing thresholds. The mantra reframes agency and returns to charge the ending without moralizing. One explicit line of realization (“She realized her lifelong motive…”) risks stating the theme, but the surrounding images earn it. The final seed reweights the premise with quiet authority.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The close third maintains a distinctive, botanist‑tinged lyric diction with consistent focalization. Rhythms modulate with pressure, avoiding head‑hopping or unearned certainty. There’s no dialogue to test, but the narrative voice carries action and subtext effectively. A few high‑flown metaphors skirt purple but remain voice‑true.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Line work is vivid and efficient; most sentences do multiple jobs (image, emotion, causality). Figurative density is high yet coherent and seldom loops; momentum rarely stalls. Minor lushness (“manta rays,” “encyclopedia”) edges toward excess, but clarity and propulsion are intact, especially at peak beats. The last image lands cleanly without scaffold or muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Plant‑human metamorphosis is familiar, but the synthesis—storm‑tuned reconstruction by surrender, nursery praxis, and the understory stance—feels fresh and inevitable. Recurring elements (leaf/trellis/mantra/storm) are transformed rather than repeated. The conceptual risk of choosing a braided identity reads as specific, not generic fantasy. It’s inventive without gimmickry.</comment>
