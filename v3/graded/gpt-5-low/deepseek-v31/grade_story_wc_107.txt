<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—to build “sanctuaries of glass” and shed collective guilt—is clear and enacted through concrete micro‑choices (handling the bookmark, firing the furnace, the final relinquishment). The internal contradiction (attachment to the past vs. the resolve to build anew) operates in scene. Emotions are embodied via tactile rituals and the soundscape of thaw. Slight over‑explaining of past arrogance softens the need for inference.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: the thaw’s soundscape and the ice‑sheet fall densify pressure toward renunciation. Orientation is crisp early (who/where/when), and closure lands on‑page with a visible cost as she leaves the bookmark. The final image reweights the control room and her craft without mechanical tying‑off. Minor exposition about the collective borders on summary but doesn’t undercut closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The abandoned control room and active melt shape timing and atmosphere, with the shattering ice acting as a catalytic beat. Tools and objects (furnace, pipe, spheres, bookmark) are handled in lived, tactile ways. The environment charges the final image—leaving the bookmark to the drip‑drip. Vivid sensory detail stays selective and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (renounce the past to create safe inquiry) tightens as the melt accelerates and the ice sheet falls, pushing a choice with cost. Escalation is internal but coherent and grows under the chosen lens; the final abandonment forecloses a path. External pressure is mild, so the turn depends on lyric deepening rather than direct opposition. Still, the price of leaving the token and place reads.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The thaw as inner/outer reconfiguration develops through specific actions and charged objects rather than pure assertion. The spheres-as-sanctuaries reframe inquiry with moral cost and responsibility. A line or two state theme overtly, but the closing walk‑away image earns resonance. Ambiguity lingers productively around guilt transformed into practice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a distinct lyric texture; the performative self‑narration suits her temperament and craft. Rhythm modulates effectively around the shattering ice and the final quiet refusal. A single code‑switch (“赋予”) slightly jars register but doesn’t break focalization. Dialogue is minimal and character‑true.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lines carry multiple jobs (image, theme, action) with few redundancies; cadence varies and supports momentum. Figurative language is mostly clean and cohesive to the melt/glass lexicon. Occasional tell phrases and one register blip keep it short of top‑tier polish. The final sentence lands with clarity and charge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A glassblower forging “safe zones for inquiry” in a thawing control room feels fresh, with the bookmark as a specific moral token. The ice‑as‑heart conceit is familiar but revitalized through concrete, procedural craft. The decisive renunciation grows organically from seeded particulars. Risks are aesthetic rather than structural and pay off.</comment>
