<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael’s vow and curse drive concrete, escalating micro‑choices—digging up the jar, laying sequences, deciding to hold his ground at the overload. Interiority is specific and embodied (“teeth ache,” “river of possible futures”), avoiding generic labels. The final renunciation—choosing understanding over survival—feels earned by earlier motives. Slightly idealized poise under peak stress is the only small slack.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Clear causal chain: promise → ritual preparation → star dust conduction → overload forecast → chosen refusal to evade → unraveling. Single scene holds a tight throughline with a decisive closure on the page and explicit cost. Orientation (who/where/when) lands early and remains stable. The conceptual repricing at the end coheres with the causal lens rather than replacing it.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The tidal bluff, aurora, frictionless sea, and painted stones are vivid and purposeful, threaded through action rather than catalogued. The aurora functions as both atmosphere and resource, charging and channeling the ritual; the frictionless world re‑weights the closing image (“wind that no longer had the friction to blow”). Spatial logic is steady. It stops just short of the 9‑band because the environment rarely constrains tactics beyond serving as a power source.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding at any cost) is signaled early and tightens toward a single consequential choice. The precognition creates a pointed tradeoff—step aside and live versus keep the promise and be unmade—making the cost legible. Pressure coheres and intensifies without side quests. The price paid (self‑unraveling) decisively forecloses future options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Themes of knowledge versus surrender, promise as covenant, and the cost of harnessing the cosmos emerge through particulars, not sermonizing. The final image reweights earlier motifs—the rocks, dust, aurora—into a quiet elegy that answers the central question in action. Subtext hums in the idea of energy as concept and unraveling as understanding. Resonance lingers without tidy moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third‑person close sustains a distinct perceptual texture consistent with Kael’s mind. Diction and rhythm modulate with pressure, tightening as the ritual peaks. No head‑hopping or stance leakage; elisions are purposeful and legible. Slight tendency toward elevated register is voice‑justified by the premise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sentences carry multiple jobs with few redundancies; images are fresh and disciplined (“energy hit him not as a force, but as a concept”). Momentum holds through description, and syntax varies to match pacing. A few lush turns flirt with purple but do not blur clarity or causality. Final lines land cleanly without scaffolding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Striking synthesis: eel herder under frictionless aurora, mathematical stones, and collapsed star dust feels singular rather than stitched. The central turn—choosing dissolution for comprehension—reads inevitable in hindsight. Risks in conceit and tone heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. The world’s alterations are followed through to a charged final image.</comment>
