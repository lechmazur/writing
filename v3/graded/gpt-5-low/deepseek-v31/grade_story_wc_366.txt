<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elias’s practical reticence undercuts and then catalyzes his protective impulse; the contradiction reads lived-in, not imposed. Embodied cues (sea glass in his palm, the jar clatter, the cold) root emotion. Micro‑choices are clear—pocketing the letters, refusing the presence, building the cairn. The internal turn from skepticism to charged defiance feels earned and specific.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Orientation is crisp from the opening—who, where, and the failing lamp as trigger. The situational lens holds: pressure mounts as the haunted hour deepens, the door slams, and he responds with a message‑cairn. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: “You don’t get this light,” the constructed barrier, and dawn’s arrival with a new resolve. Cost is quiet but legible: he risks himself to hold the letters’ light against an ancient grief.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The lantern room’s iron grating, gears, cold, and salt act as more than backdrop; they constrain choices and supply the jar and tools. The haunted architecture applies pressure and shapes tactic (a cairn made from on‑hand tools). Sensory selection remains disciplined and character‑filtered. The final image is charged by place and object.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes are simple and focused: keep the shared light (letters) from being extinguished. Escalation is coherent: lamp dies → presence intensifies → door blasts open → Elias asserts agency with a symbolic barricade. The price is an exposed vulnerability and a night of fear resisted, appropriately scaled for the length. The reversal hinges on his decision to translate Elara’s code into action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Connection as light versus grief as extinguishing force emerges through particulars—the stone code, the cairn, “bottled feeling of safety.” The ending reweights the premise without moralizing; dawn and the warmed sea glass suggest a costly, defended tenderness. Subtext works in silence and objects rather than declarations. The ghost reads as internalized communal grief rather than a cheap scare.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third‑person close remains steady, with diction that matches a taciturn, practical observer shaded by lyric torque. Rhythm tightens under stress and relaxes at the close. The lone line of dialogue lands with force and subtext. No head‑hopping or unearned certainty intrudes.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sentences carry multiple jobs—image, mood, and motion—without padding; metaphors are apt and not overstacked. Variations in syntax and paragraphing support momentum. No significant loops or scaffolding; line choices stay clean under pressure. A few elevated phrases (“luminescent ache”) remain integrated with voice.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Haunted lighthouse is familiar, but the anonymous letter exchange and tool‑cairn translation feel fresh and character‑driven. The sea glass as micro‑talisman and the refusal framed as message rather than exorcism reframe the trope. Turns arise organically from established particulars. It’s distinctive without showy gimmicks.</comment>
