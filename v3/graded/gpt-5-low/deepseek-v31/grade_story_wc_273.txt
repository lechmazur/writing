<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Silas’s motive (“to discover why time slows in crisis”) is clear and drives concrete choices (staying, experimenting with water). Interiority is specific (serene anger, albino sensitivity) and embodied through attention to wind‑carved stone and ink. The change from hunter’s anger to a calm participant in the pattern reads earned. Internal contradiction is present but light; most pressure is conceptual rather than psychologically contested.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: observation → experiment → consequence (drone unmade) → conceptual repricing. Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph, and each beat is causally legible (moonlight + water intensify patterns). Closure lands on the page with cost: the drone’s disappearance and Silas’s relinquishment of anger. Stakes tighten through the experiment and its fallout without breaking coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The wind‑carved encampment, moonlight, and porous sandstone integrate with action; the spilled ink and waterskin function as micro‑setting tools that drive choice. Sensory detail is vivid and selective, filtered through Silas’s tracker eye. World rules are learned via observation rather than exposition. While the landscape doesn’t physically corner him, the environment and light regime charge and constrain the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—grasping the time anomaly—tightens when Silas chooses to intervene (pouring water), escalating from seeing to catalyzing. The drone’s unmaking raises tangible risk and cost, reweighting his inquiry. Pressure is more conceptual than adversarial but coheres and deepens appropriately for length. A clear option is foreclosed: naïve observation gives way to charged participation with consequences.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The piece resonates around crisis as solvent and reality as layered “ink,” with the drone’s erasure as a strong non‑literal proof. However, the final paragraph states the thesis directly (“Time didn’t truly slow…”) rather than trusting image, which blunts subtext. Still, the ending reweights prior material meaningfully, shifting Silas’s identity. Thematic complexity is present but slightly over‑articulated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>A controlled third‑person voice with a distinct perceptual signature—patient, sensory, and precise—suits a tracker’s mind. Diction is elevated yet consistent with the piece’s lyric mode; no head‑hopping or stance slips. Rhythm modulates well through observation, experiment, and epiphany. Minor abstraction spikes don’t disrupt POV credibility.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lines carry imagery and action with good density; verbs are strong, and scaffolding is light. A few abstract formulations (“underlying machinery of the world”) trend purple but remain coherent. No notable loops or cadence templates; momentum is steady toward the closure image. The final image is clean and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: a sacred desert site, disappearing ink as cosmology, and a surveillance drone unmade by “truth.” Turns feel inevitable in hindsight (moonlight → water → eruption → erasure). The risk of blending lyric metaphysics with a technological object pays off. Minor conventional phrasing in the thesis sentences tempers peak originality.</comment>
