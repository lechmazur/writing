<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lyra’s motives are clear and evolve credibly from survival to revelation, with embodied beats like the arduous climb and the tactile study of frost. Interiority stays specific to an artist retooling perception, not generic trauma-speak. The final resolve risks safety and solitude, signaling a real change. Slight tidiness in the epiphany (“medium… justice itself”) trims a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: frost → ledger strip → frequency code → relay → unsent message → decision to broadcast. Closure lands as a decisive change in goal and tactic, with cost implied by renewed exposure and the physical toll already shown. Orientation is crisp early, and the single-POV thread holds. The ending stops at vow rather than execution, but the reweighted options are legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The canyon’s cold, stars, and frost aren’t décor; they enable discovery, constrain movement, and charge the final broadcast plan. The relay on the rim and the frost patterns integrate geography with plot. Sensory selection feels POV-driven (artist noticing pattern and surface). The environment meaningfully shapes choice at multiple beats.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Pressure coheres under a causal lens: discovery tightens into a climb and then a worldview shift when the message reframes stakes. The dominant stake—expose a planned ecological collapse—sharpens from personal survival to public action. Costs are present (risk of exposure, physical strain), though antagonistic force remains offstage. A single deepening turn (from ledger to relay revelation) carries most of the load effectively.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through image and action: from “pauses” and silence to a “clear note,” from glass/light to making poison visible. The scorched testament reweights guilt into duty, offering a resonant reconfiguration. However, the final lines edge toward thesis-statement clarity, slightly reducing subtextual power. The emotional afterimage still lingers as art repurposed into justice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a lyrical yet controlled register fitting a former light-sculptor turned survivalist. Diction and rhythm vary with pressure (brittle morning vs. arduous climb). No head-hopping or stance slips, and inference stays within plausible knowledge. Mild loftiness is voice-motivated and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lines are precise, with vivid, economical images (“fine, grey dust of charcoal,” “grammar of ascent”) doing multiple jobs. Momentum holds with minimal scaffolding; no major loops or muddled metaphors. A few abstractions (“steadily adaptive,” “purpose”) recur, but they’re anchored by concrete action. The final sentence leans rhetorical yet stays earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The synthesis—frost archaeology revealing a charred ledger, an artist leveraging glass/light knowledge to whistleblow—feels fresh and character-specific. The relay and canyon silence reimagined as tools elevate the premise beyond template survival or conspiracy beats. The twist to ecological stakes is grounded by the ledger’s provenance. Not radical, but confidently original.</comment>
