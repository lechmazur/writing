<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation (restore balance before collapse) is clear and consistent, and her patience informs her method. Interiority remains mostly cool and professional; we glimpse dread but not much contradictory impulse beyond persistence under a deadline. Micro‑choices (route, patterning, when to strike/listen) align with her craft. The ending earns a credible endurance but the felt cost on her person is muted.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Orientation is immediate (who/where/why) and the accumulative/textural drive is maintained through rhythmic work toward a cadence shift in the square. Closure lands on the page as a resonant reconfiguration: the town stabilizes as “a perfect, eternal memory,” and the archway firms. The cost is conceptual—revival as memory, not life—under a live clock of failing spells. No causality breaks or soft resets.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, selective details (wild hush, skeletal buildings, central square, archway) are filtered through a tuner’s acoustic bias, and the ebony fork functions as a micro‑setting/tool that constrains action. Environmental rules (resonance, support spells) stay consistent and charge the final image. The archway’s failure pressures the scene and its renewed glow anchors closure. Sensory economy and atmosphere are exemplary.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake (prevent unmaking) is signaled early and tightens at the central square where imbalance is profound. Escalation is accumulative: pattern density increases until echoes appear and the archway halts collapse. The price is primarily conceptual/temporal rather than a concrete sacrifice or reversal on the page. Still, agency drives the turn and the pressure coheres.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme coheres around balance, memory, and the ethics of restoration versus resurrection, delivered through image and method rather than moralizing. The final reweighting—“not as it was, but as it needed to be”—offers a resonant, non‑literal answer with a quiet cost. Recurring motifs (silence/hum, footsteps/rhythm) deepen subtext. It resists patness while remaining legible.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The third‑person limited lyric voice is controlled, with a distinct acoustic lexicon and rhythmic modulation that matches pressure. No dialogue to test, but focalization stays clean and consistent. Diction is elevated yet coherent with the protagonist’s craft. The prose maintains certainty within plausible knowledge.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lines are polished, rhythmic, and carry multiple jobs (world, mood, action) with minimal scaffolding. Figurative language is frequent but disciplined; repetition patterns (tap‑step, hum‑step) are purposeful. Minor density risk in stacked metaphors never clouds clarity or closure. Momentum holds through the lyric mode.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A bell tuner restoring a town through resonance and footsteps is a fresh synthesis, and the “eternal memory” outcome re‑angles the ghost‑town trope. Stakes and method feel organic to the premise, not gimmicked. Risk lies in the quiet, accumulative form and pays off. Only slight familiarity in haunted‑city imagery keeps it shy of the top band.</comment>
