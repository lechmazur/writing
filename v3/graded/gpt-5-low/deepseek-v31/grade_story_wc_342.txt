<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—mirroring the sky inside walls—is clear and drives each choice under time pressure. Interiority is particular (texture of carvings, scent of damp paper) and embodied. Internal contradiction is light; she reads more focused than torn, with minimal ambivalence beyond urgency. The final renunciation (no brush, use the hand) feels earned and character‑true.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong because/therefore chain: coin pattern → precise wax → true lock click → hidden pigment/instructions → hand‑pressed painting before demolition. Orientation is clean from the outset and the causal puzzle resolves without cheats. Closure lands as a charged poise: the wall becomes a sky‑window as demolition begins, with time as cost. No major logic gaps; the coin/lock echo is well seeded.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The observatory, hidden tree‑trunk library, and carved wall are vivid, tactile, and purpose‑driven. Setting objects constrain tactics (impression‑based lock; pigments accessible only via puzzle). Sensory economy is strong, with damp paper/roots and cold stone aligning with mood. The final image is literally environmental: the wall becomes the sky, charging place into closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Primary stake—preserving/echoing a vanishing space—tightens under the demolition clock. Escalation is coherent: discovery of the coin’s method, then the precise lock, then the last‑second crafting choice. The felt price is time and risk (abandoning brush; one shot), though the pain is more poised than punishing. No antagonist is needed; the clock suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of limits (time, perception, possibility) emerges through action, not sermonizing, and culminates in a saved echo instead of salvation. The coin/process reframes “portraiture” as reading the world’s faint indentations. The final window reweights the premise: preservation as transformation, not resistance. Complexity lingers without a tidy moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single, close third focalization is steady, with a distinct sensory lexicon (fractals, topography, damp paper). Rhythm modulates from hush to click to glow without head‑hopping or register slips. Lyrical diction remains anchored in her perceptual bias; no explanatory overreach. Elision is purposeful and paid off by tactile beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lines are lean yet lush, with imagery doing multiple jobs; minimal scaffolding or loops. Figurative language (fractal/topography) stays coherent to the motif and doesn’t muddle beats. Syntax varies and momentum holds into the closing image. No noticeable copy or logic stumbles.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis feels fresh: a face‑blind portraitist reading process from a coin to unlock a pigment that captures sky. The fractal/indentation method is imaginative and tightly integrated with stakes. The last beat converts wall to cosmos with earned inevitability. Risk‑taking is high without obscuring clarity.</comment>
