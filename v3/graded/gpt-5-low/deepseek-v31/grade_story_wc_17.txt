<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elara’s motive (to learn what walls dream) is clear and particular, and her sensory gift meaningfully shapes action and cost. Interiority is textured—“listener of stone,” the scream in the wall—though internal contradiction is modest. The decision to carry and share the burden reads earned. Slight safety: she faces little on‑page resistance beyond emotional weight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: discovery of diary/negative → wall‑scream → conceptual turn to testimony. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/CR when her cartography becomes public witness; the cost (emotional burden) is legible. Orientation is clean and the two‑shard transition (manor → community) is coherent. No causality breaks; escalation is soft but sufficient for this mode.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful: damp manor, ivy‑veiled passage, choked fireplace, and walls that “scream.” The environment shapes action (listening sites, discovery in the fireplace) and charges the final image via the negative and the house’s remembered anguish. Details are filtered through Elara’s perceptual bias. Strong integration without mere postcard description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to remain a quiet mapper or become a witness—tightens as the wall’s scream reframes her role. The discovery sequence escalates pressure credibly; choosing to share the negative publicly carries a felt cost. Opposition is largely internal, but coherent under the chosen lens. A single meaningful deepening lands.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Themes of legacy, complicity, and witnessing emerge from concrete images (negative frames, fireplace, wall‑scream). However, the conclusion leans toward explicit moralizing (“warning,” “guard against the same terrible dream”), reducing subtext. Still, the wall‑dream motif reweights meaning well. Resonance persists despite a slightly stated thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third‑person close is steady, lyrical without drift, and tuned to Elara’s sensory focus. Rhythm varies and supports mood shifts from hush to scream to public testimony. No head‑hopping or register clashes. The perceptual signature (“listener of stone”) feels distinct.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is clean, image‑dense, and purposeful; most lines do multiple jobs. Minor redundancy and a few declarative thematic lines slightly flatten the final cadence. Otherwise strong momentum, specific diction, and controlled figurative choices. No artifact patterns or clarity issues.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The “echo cartographer” listening to walls is fresh and organically tied to climate‑legacy material. The film negative and wall‑scream synthesis feels non‑obvious yet inevitable. Risk is measured and coherent, avoiding gimmickry. Only the slightly didactic close tempers peak ingenuity.</comment>
