<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear, specific motive (save Carver by interrogating the void) and a credible tactic shift (from attack to listening) under pressure. Interiority is mostly conceptual and disciplined; we feel the cold fog pressure and his composure, but contradictory impulses are faint. The cost of the choice registers in the spent pigment and fatigue implied by the crescendo. Relationship stakes with Carver land briefly but effectively at the end.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single-scene causal chain is tight: layered “why” leads to recoil, to syllogistic net, to revealed assumption, to the pigment’s decisive application. Orientation is clean from the opening; the ticking possession clock narrows options. Closure is an on-page Decisive Change with visible cost (pigment used; stability restored). A hair more resistance or setback before the final press might have deepened the price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The dimensional anchor’s muffled geometry and the loop pedal/palette act as charged micro-settings that constrain tactics. Soundlessness matters to the plan and the final image of “earned silence” reweights the space. World rules are taught through action without exposition. A touch more tactile spatial choreography inside the chamber could push it higher.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible early and escalates coherently: question → assertion → captured shriek → listening/diagnosis → punctuating act. The time pressure (possession nearly complete) and the one-shot pigment create a credible narrowing. Agency drives the turns; the logical net is a meaningful tightening. The conflict resolves a bit smoothly once the hidden premise is named, softening the sense of risk.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of inquiry versus oblivion emerges through tactic and image, not mere statement, and the ending reprices “silence” as earned understanding. Some lines verge on thesis (“Stillness is not oblivion”; “You fear the question”), but they function as weapons in-scene rather than moralizing. The final quiet carries resonance without didactic residue. Ambiguity remains around the void’s terror, enriching aftertaste.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>A distinct, liturgical-technical voice marries ritual and gear with confidence, and POV distance remains steady. Dialogue functions as action (loops as rhetoric) with clean mechanics. Minor diction slip (“You decorates with silence”) and occasional elevated phrasing slightly nick precision at peak beats. Rhythm modulates well through the crescendo.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lines are largely tight and multi-tasking; images are vivid and purposeful (“perfect geometry,” “susurrus of broken logic”). Momentum holds with few redundancies, and the final image lands cleanly. Small artifacts—one grammatical error and a couple of near-ornamental modifiers—slightly cloud the polish. Figurative density stays controlled under pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—priest as loop-artist deploying logic as exorcism with null-white pigment—is striking and feels inevitable in hindsight. Turns arise from the established method rather than late rule changes. Risk-taking in the method and tone heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Minor grammar and a relatively smooth victory prevent a higher band.</comment>
