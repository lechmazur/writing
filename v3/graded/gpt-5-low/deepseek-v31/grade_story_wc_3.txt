<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Aris’s grief‑driven need to decode “transition” is clear and consistent, and his kindly methodical nature shapes both his error (trying to force) and his remedy (a deliberate release). The internal contradiction—control vs acceptance—surfaces in the cuneiform insight and is resolved through a costly renunciation. Emotions are embodied through tactile anchors (warm seed, ironwood hum) rather than labels. A hair of telling at the epiphany (“required acceptance, not force”) keeps it just shy of exceptional.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Clean causal chain under a Causal lens: study → analogical revelation → relinquishment → carrier wave and sprout. Orientation is crisp from the outset (who/where/what), and the closure lands on‑page with cost (releasing the seed/control) and a tangible effect. The faint ping is a measured payoff that preserves price. Slight neatness in the seed’s immediate response is mitigated by the restrained, partial success.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The Magnetic Arbor is vivid and purposeful: altitude and ironwood’s resonance charge the final act and image, and the edge enables the crucial release. Details (ironwood lattice, above‑cloud quiet, clay tablets) filter through Aris’s priorities. World rules are learned through action rather than exposition dumps. The environment materially participates in closure via the hum and drop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake (reestablishing connection/understanding transition) is clear early, and pressure coheres as internal conflict tightens toward a renunciatory act. The decisive release forecloses a path (control/hoarding) with visible cost and alters options, earning the partial signal. Stakes remain largely interior, but they interlock with the external ping enough to feel consequential. One pronounced tightening suffices for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: crossing as a unified physics of faith; the seed’s release reframes death, travel, and knowledge as one transition. The final image (carrier wave + green shoot) offers a resonant, non‑literal answer without overexplaining Elara’s absence. A touch of thesis articulation (“it required acceptance, not force”) edges toward on‑the‑nose but is supported by action. The ache transmuted to “touching distance” lingers effectively.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a measured lyricism that suits a scholarly, grieving mind; diction and rhythm feel purposeful and character‑specific. No head‑hopping or stance drift; inference remains within what Aris can know. Modulation under pressure is controlled, tightening around the act of release. Absence of dialogue keeps focus on interior cadence without loss.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is clean, image‑rich, and largely free of loops or scaffolding; sentences do multiple jobs and maintain momentum. Figurative texture (rivers, ferryman, ironwood hum) is coherent and earned by motif. Minor tell phrases appear but do not blunt the closure image. Rhythm varies well across the reveal and release.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of philology, floating arboreal tech, and a knowledge seed reframes SF through mythic physics. The analogical leap grounded in cuneiform signs feels non‑obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Risks (quiet, internal climax; partial technical payoff) heighten meaning without obscuring clarity. The specific world and object choices resist swap‑outs, giving the piece distinctive identity.</comment>
