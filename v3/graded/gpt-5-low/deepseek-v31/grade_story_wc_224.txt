<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—finding the “shape of home”—is clear and drives concrete, tactile choices under pressure. Her contradictions (tormented by nightly truth yet persistent, tactile seeker) are embodied in the feather-guided navigation. The final endurance stance (truth persists; she reframes and bears it) is earned. A touch of stated realization (“Home was not a place of soft lies…”) edges toward explicitness, slightly smoothing complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the feather-method shifts her tactic and leads causally to the stone, which reconfigures the premise. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: the cost remains (nightly visions), but meaning and stance change on the page. Orientation is crisp, and the chain (Alistair’s caution → seeding via texture → tactile path → stone’s quieting) holds. The mystical mechanics are leaned on but remain coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The mountain-spanning bookstore is vivid and functional, constraining choice by making sight unreliable and touch decisive (banister grain, left vs. right). The object micro-settings (feather, stone) charge the final image and shape tactics. The cavern of book-stalagmites escalates scale and tone without postcard excess. World rules are consistent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around enduring pain versus risking deeper exposure to find translation; the feather tactic is a meaningful tightening that changes options. The price is explicit: the visions persist and must be borne with new grammar, not erased. While no external antagonist presses back, internal and environmental pressures escalate sufficiently at this length. The ending choice (ritualized feather-to-stone) crystallizes commitment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: translation over erasure, home as foundational truth rather than comforting lie, and the body as a reading instrument. The feather/stone return reweights earlier images and offers a resonant answer without plot summary. One line states theme outright (“Home was not a place of soft lies…”), trimming some ambiguity. Nonetheless, the final image carries earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The close third voice is consistent, lyrical without drift, and modulates with pressure (from dread to charged poise). Alistair’s brief dialogue is economical and scene-advancing. Diction stays within a coherent poetic register, with imagery tied to perception rather than authorial intrusion. No head-hopping or stance wobble.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sentences carry multiple jobs—world, mood, and action—without padding; rhythm breathes and tightens at turns. Figurative language is controlled and sensorially grounded (texture, grain, “book-stalagmites”), avoiding mixed metaphors. Recurrent phrasing (“hidden thunder”) is purposeful, not looped scaffolding. The final line lands cleanly with charged economy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis—mercury-glass perception, a mountain labyrinth bookstore, and a feather-texture method to “seed” location—feels distinctive and inevitable in hindsight. The lost language stone as translator of reality reframes clairvoyance tropes with fresh stakes. Risks (tactile cartography, conceptual closure) heighten coherence without obscuring clarity. Emotional truth is specific rather than templated.</comment>
