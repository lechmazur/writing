<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s motive (to collect burdens) is clear and drives each micro‑choice, with credible internal contradiction between empathy and panic. Embodied responses (cold jolt, trapped hands) ground her interiority. Her final renunciatory choice—acceptance over struggle—feels earned and costly. Minor abstraction in phrasing doesn’t blunt the character’s specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single scene, clean orientation, and a tight causal chain: orient → misalign → calcification → acceptance. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she accepts the sorrow and ends with mineral gloves—a palpable cost. The drive lens reads primarily causal with textural support, held through the final image. No extraneous beats or soft resets.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The bronze grotto and lamp are tactile and integrated; the environment constrains and charges choices (darkness, metallic walls, resonant patterns). Setting details evolve with action (calcification spreading on the walls, lamp flicker under stress). The final image is inseparable from place and tool. Sensory specificity is rich without losing focus.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (measure without being entombed) is clear and escalates when misalignment traps her. The tightening forecloses flight; endurance/acceptance is the only viable tactic under pressure. The cost is legible on the page. Tension operates at line and scene levels without redundancy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of bearing/transforming grief emerges through concrete actions and reweighted images (whalebone reverie becoming marble, then lace). No moralizing; the ending offers a resonant answer: to hold weight one must accept it fully. Subtext about art, empathy, and self‑risk is woven into the method and setting.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lyrical third‑person with controlled distance; diction and rhythm fit the character’s sensibility and the grotto’s hush. The voice modulates under stress (from reverie to clipped panic) without breaking stance. No head‑hopping or elision debt. Slightly ornate at times but consistent and purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lines are largely precise and propulsive, with strong image economy and few scaffolds. Occasional purple density and one jarring register slip (“冰冷的stone”) in a peak beat nick the polish. Rhythm otherwise varies well and maintains clarity through the climax. Figurative choices mostly cohere and serve action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The fractal‑weaving, burden‑measuring conceit in a bronze grotto is fresh and internally consistent. The calcification turn feels inevitable from the established method and world logic. Risks in language and concept heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. The synthesis is memorable and specific.</comment>
