<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is clear and character‑specific, and her ritual choices align with her values. The moment she halts breath/heart provides embodied cost. However, internal contradiction is minimal; she encounters little moral or emotional friction beyond the technical risk. The piece leans reverent competence over struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Structure is clean: setup of task, ritual, threshold, infusion, repose. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the tightening occurs at the “threshold of stillness,” paid by a bodily pause and risk. Closure lands with a charged final image (chip over heart under aurora). Orientation is crisp from the outset with no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The skyborne grotto and aurora are vivid and consistently filtered through Elara’s sensibility. The environment charges the ritual (light refracting in the emerald) and the ending image. While it doesn’t strictly constrain tactics, it meaningfully frames the geomancer’s wish and the final tableau. Sensory economy is strong and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve a last spark—tightens when she must cross a stillness that risks self‑erasure. The escalation is singular but effective, and agency drives the turn. The price is felt but brief; consequences are largely aesthetic rather than destabilizing. Still, tension coheres through the ritual’s demands.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of art as last grace against oblivion emerges organically through action and image. The “threshold of stillness” reframes death as charged poise rather than mere cessation. The final image reweights prior material without moralizing, inviting reflection on preservation and release. Resonance lingers via the chip’s warm, memorized light.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A controlled, elevated third‑limited voice fits the ritualistic mode and sticks to Elara’s perceptual bias. Diction and rhythm modulate well at the threshold and return. No head‑hopping or stance drift, and inference stays within plausible knowledge. Lyric certainty never overreaches into omniscience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is lucid and musical with high information density; images carry double duty (ritual mechanics and theme). Minor risk of lushness never tips into muddle, and there’s little to no scaffold or loop. Sentences vary and propel rather than stall. The closing cadence lands cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis—skyborne mortuary art, geomancy memory capture, stillness threshold—is fresh and coherent. The emerald as memory lattice is a striking, specific twist on familiar death‑rites. Risks in tone and concept pay off without obscuring clarity. The final reconfiguration feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
