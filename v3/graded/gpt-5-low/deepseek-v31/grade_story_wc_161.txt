<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s motives and contradictions are precise: a self-forged past versus a compulsion to preserve lost songs. Embodied ritual (meteorite balancing, dust‑reading) reveals character under pressure. The final choice to risk Argos is earned by her established fear of leaving a trail. Slight tidiness in her concluding resolve keeps it just short of revelatory complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Orientation and drive are clear early; the accumulative pattern (ritual → accident → discovery → release) coheres. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Decisive Change hybrid: she forecloses secrecy to send the song, paying with risk and the possible loss of her last bird. The meteorite’s tip is a mild coincidence but grows organically from her practice. Cost is legible in the send‑off and in the reweighted meteorite image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The attic’s skylight, drafts, and decaying paper are not mere backdrop—they dictate tactics and trigger discovery. Object‑as‑setting integration is strong (meteorite, brass eagle, folio), and the environment charges the final image. Sensory specificity is high and POV‑filtered. The setting’s constraints (drafts, height, hidden folio) shape action and meaning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes (safety vs. letting the song “fly”) tighten credibly when the folio reframes her mission. The decisive escalation is her choice to risk exposure and Argos; the cost is felt though quiet. Pressure is coherent with the accumulative lens, culminating in the release. A hair more friction or resistance in the final beat could heighten the squeeze.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Balance, echo, and flight entwine with identity and truth without over‑explaining. The ending reweights prior images (meteorite as anchor, not chain) and answers the thematic question through action. One line edges toward explicit moral (“ready to write a true history”), slightly flattening subtext. Overall, resonance is earned and lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical close third maintains consistent distance and diction. The prose modulates with pressure, and the single whispered line of dialogue carries subtext and purpose. Perceptual signatures (dust motes as vane, scent of old glue) feel character‑bound rather than generic. No head‑hopping or stance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentence‑level craft is clean, varied, and purposeful; images do double duty without clutter. A few heightened phrases flirt with purple, but clarity and propulsion hold. No scaffold loops or template cadences. The final image crisply reprises earlier motifs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis—courier pigeons, a Mars chip, dust‑mapping as ritual of trust—feels distinctive and inevitable in hindsight. The folio turn and the charged release avoid tropey sentiment. Risks (quiet plot, lyrical register) pay off without obscuring clarity. The conceptual weave of balance/echo/flight achieves memorable freshness.</comment>
