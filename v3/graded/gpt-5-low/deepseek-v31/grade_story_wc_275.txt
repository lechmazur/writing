<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s motives and contradictions are clear: she craves peace yet chooses to risk it to honor her father’s ethic. The embodied ritual with the sandbag scrap grounds her interiority in concrete action. The moment of temptation to destroy the chip versus carrying it shows simultaneous conflicting impulses. Slight safety in the moral frame—she reads more virtuous than flawed—but the choice still carries cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Orientation is swift and clean; the dome, the farm, the father’s past, and the found box link in a tight causal line. The closure is an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she refuses to destroy the chip and binds it to carry forward, with the cost of endangering her fragile peace. The causal beat “finds chip → recognizes stakes → chooses to carry” holds without contrivance. The buried box is a slight coincidence, but contained within her domain it doesn’t break logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The glass dome, hydroponics, and desert roses are vivid and POV‑filtered; the oasis sharply contrasts the wasteland outside. The environment charges the stakes: preserving the dome’s “engraved quiet” versus inviting chaos by keeping the chip. Recurring objects (sandbag scrap, box) function as micro‑settings that shape action. Sensory economy is strong and purposeful rather than touristic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible early—preserve sanctuary or confront truth—and pressure tightens with the discovery of the chip and photograph. The internal moral calculus escalates convincingly to a single, consequential choice. External pressure is light, but under a situational/causal hybrid design the internal stakes suffice. The cost is clear though largely projected rather than immediately enacted.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Symbols (sheathe, seed, sandbag, roses) are earned and reweighted at the end, answering the central question through image rather than a stated moral. “Weave continuity through chaos” risks repetition but is grounded by actions and objects. The final act—binding and carrying the box as a “seed”—reframes burden as generative peace. Resonance lingers without didactic wrap‑up.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The voice is lyrical yet controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature (“engraved quiet,” “tranquil blaze”) that holds under stress. POV is stable and credible; no head‑hopping or unearned omniscience. Elevated diction fits the character’s meditative mode and environment. No dialogue, but the narration carries subtext and pressure effectively.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished: varied rhythm, strong verbs, images doing multiple jobs. Minor repetition (“weave continuity through chaos”) skirts redundancy but remains purposeful. Metaphors are coherent and non‑muddled; no artifact loops or template cadences dull momentum. The final image is crisp and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The fusion of post‑collapse oasis, bounty‑hunter legacy, and a horticultural ritual feels fresh. The “engraved quiet” and sandbag benedictions give the premise specificity beyond trope. The buried data‑chip is familiar, but the “seed not burden” turn and sheathing motif reanimate it. It’s thoughtful rather than radically new, achieving distinctiveness through texture and choice.</comment>
