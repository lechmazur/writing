<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara’s drive—to salvage one untainted truth—feels specific and consistent, and her methodical selection of the “window” shows agency. Interiority is embodied through the cold, candlelit setting rather than abstract labels. However, contradictory impulses under pressure are muted; she doesn’t face a sharpened dilemma on the page beyond care versus haste. The final renunciatory cost is conceptual rather than emotionally strained in-scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the mosaic of dream‑fragments coheres into a single clarifying window and a closure beat that reweights collective memory. The final image—truth exposed to the universe, the purser’s lie silenced—lands as a Conceptual Repricing with a felt solemnity. Causal beats (cross‑referencing cameos → isolating the purser → reframing “accident” as fraud) are clean for this scope. The cost remains largely conceptual, limiting peak voltage.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The glacier shrine and candles create a lived, sensorial atmosphere that perfectly fits her vocation; the snow globe as object‑setting charges the last image. Detail selection (compressed light in ice; warped glass) is purposeful and POV‑filtered. The setting does not heavily constrain tactics, but it meaningfully frames and amplifies the ending’s reverence. World rules remain consistent and are learned through action rather than exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—expose a single devastating lie—is signaled early and tightens as she isolates the “window” and names the purser. Escalation reads as a density shift from chorus to singular clarity, appropriate for the chosen lens. The price is implied (ethical burden, the dead’s peace) rather than dramatized as a trade‑off that forecloses another path in-scene. Still, agency clearly drives the decisive deepening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Themes of truth, memory, guilt, and salvage emerge organically from concrete particulars (melted globe; illegal fuel; borrowed starlight). The final act reframes communal memory without moralizing, delivering resonance rather than thesis. Subtext (the cost of getting it wrong; the duty to the dead) is carried by image and method rather than statement. Slight neatness in the fraud reveal trims ambiguity but not meaning.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third‑person voice with a distinct perceptual signature sustains tone and focus without head‑hopping. Diction (“borrowed starlight,” “psychic shrapnel”) is consistent and character‑apt for a contemplative practitioner. The modulation from investigative poise to reverent stillness is clean. No dialogue, but the narrative rhythm works as action.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sentence‑level craft is polished, dense without purple excess, and the images earn their keep. No paraphrase loops or scaffolding clutter; clauses propel knowledge and mood together. Figurative language is coherent and spaced; metaphors (ice holding centuries of light) track logically. Minor high‑register choices fit the elevated mode and do not blur clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—wreck‑diver medium, glacier shrine, and dream‑cameo method—feels fresh and integrated. The snow globe’s reweighted meaning as guilt’s vessel is strong. The insurance‑fraud twist is familiar, but filtered through this apparatus it gains originality. Risk‑taking is purposeful and enhances coherence without obscuring clarity.</comment>
