<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation (to “contain” grief and harvest a lesson) is clear and embodied in specific, character‑particular choices (timeboxing with the kettle; refusing to carve a lion). The internal contradiction—pain versus “hauntingly practical” craft—plays out credibly in micro‑choices (tool selection, negative space, vessel not monument). The cost is legible: she foregoes literal memorial and stops when time is up, accepting “for now.” Interiority is precise and avoids therapy‑speak, letting tactile details reveal her.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single‑scene accumulative structure lands a resonant reconfiguration at the kettle’s click (Earned Stasis/Charged Poise). Orientation is clean early; the live clock and artistic process provide coherent pressure. Closure carries cost and an after/before: she reweights grief into a vessel and lays it down unfinished but decided. The causal thread is light by design yet consistent with the chosen lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The rain‑beaded skylight loft, tools, ash wood, and kettle are vivid and filtered through craft and grief. Micro‑setting elements constrain and charge choices: the kettle creates temporal constraint; the fogged skylight softens light during the decision. Details are sensorially balanced and purposeful. The final image returns to the skylight and droplets, recharging the environment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake is tight: shape grief within a limit. Escalation occurs as she rejects the obvious (lion) and discovers the cupped hand—an internal deepening that narrows options with a cost. The time constraint sharpens the choice; the click forecloses further work. Tension is quiet but real, fitting the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Themes of presence/absence and love as “quiet architecture” surface organically through action (negative space, vessel vs statue). The final decision reweights the premise from loss to contained assurance, avoiding moralizing. Recurring images (kettle, skylight, wood grain) accrue meaning and modulate at the end. A hair’s breadth from sentimentality once or twice, but held in check by craft specificity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third‑person closely held to Elara maintains stable distance and tactile noticing. Diction matches a craftsperson’s sensibility without register slips; rhythm modulates with pressure (the kettle). No dialogue needed; prose carries subtext. Voice remains distinct and coherent under emotion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sentences are clean, varied, and purposeful; figurative language is fresh and consistent (negative space, “weather” of absence) without overgrowth. Minimal repetition; high information density per line. The final cadence is earned and unencumbered by scaffolding. A few lush phrases push toward purple but stay legible and motivated.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The widow of a lion tamer carving a cupped hand as negative space is a specific, memorable turn on grief art. The live kettle clock and refusal to monumentalize add freshness and discipline. The final repricing (“contain love, not loss”) feels inevitable in hindsight. Not radical in form, but executed with singularity and restraint.</comment>
