<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elros’s motive is crystalline and embodied in specific acts (bird-call reading, speaking dead tongues, seed casting). Interiority is textured if largely unwavering; there’s little contradictory impulse beyond a quiet endurance. The earned stasis—choosing patience and ritual over tech—carries conceptual cost. Slight limit: the piece avoids sharper internal friction that might deepen climax pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterning of silence, bird reports, and dead-language litany culminates in the audible seed-split—an on‑page closure that reweights the ground. Cost is conceptual (bearing memory, refusing expedience), present in the final charged poise. Orientation is clear early, single scene respected. Minor reservation: escalation is subtle, not transformative in options, keeping it just under the 9-band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful: the blooming jetty, bioluminescent algae, skeletal reef, and salted flats filter through Elros’s priorities. The environment charges the final image and provides the frame that mirrors “narrow vastness.” Spatial logic and world rules stay consistent. Slight restraint: the jetty shapes vantage more than it constrains tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—coaxing life from a poisoned battlefield—is legible and tightens when the lark’s call triggers “It was time.” The ritual of speaking the land’s poison into air provides the key deepening; the seed’s click seals it. Price and narrowing are more tonal than tactical, but they’re felt. A stronger on-page cost (risk or sacrifice) could raise it.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Memory as fertilizer, language as release, and nature’s slow reclamation cohere without didacticism. Recurring images (seed pods, dead reef, birdsong) reweight by the end; the “private, vital mechanics” crystallize the piece’s moral calculus. Ambiguity is purposeful and resonant. Slight cap from the piece’s serenity blunting sharper counter‑currents.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>POV is steady, lyrical, and biased by Elros’s vocation—a distinct perceptual signature. Diction remains controlled and thematically tuned, with cadence modulation toward the closing hush. No head‑hopping or stance slips; elision is purposeful. High lyricism is sustained without over-explanatory intrusion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Line-level craft is polished: dense images do multi‑work, rhythm breathes, and the closing image lands clean. Minimal scaffolding, few redundancies, and metaphors hold coherence (memory as fertilizer, language as release). Slight risk of purple is managed by specificity and restraint in the final beats. Mechanics are clean and precise.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—gardener-exorcist using dead languages and birdsong to heal a militarized landscape—is striking and cohesive. Risks (ritualized litany, conceptual “fertilizer”) pay off in a fresh final image. The piece avoids template moves and feels singular. Only marginally held back by the gentleness of conflict dynamics.</comment>
