<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and specific—her tactile relationship with vines and the “always” shard reveals a grounded psyche rather than a generic mourner. Motivation (to rediscover and re‑center her “always”) is clear and actions align, culminating in the choice to crumble the letter. The shift feels earned via the parallel with the vines’ hardship‑sweetness, not a sudden epiphany. Slight limitation: her contradictory impulses are present but subdued, keeping tension quieter than it might be.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: observation → reweighting (“always”) → act (crumbling) forms a clean cadence shift with felt cost. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Earned Stasis: she forecloses the Leo path and integrates the past as “compost.” Orientation is strong from the opening bus image through the Pavilion and return to the vines. The causal stitching is lyric rather than beat‑driven, but the final act puts concrete cost on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The vineyard, autumn light, and Amber Pavilion are sensorially lived‑in and filtered through a working relationship to the land. Environment and object co‑charge the ending: moonlight, breeze, and the vineyard take the ash, literalizing integration and dispersal. Details are purposeful (gnarled trunks, translucent panels) and never feel touristic. The setting’s textures shape perception and the final image without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reclaiming the “always” for the land/self) is signaled early and tightens as the letter reframes from wound to resource. Escalation manifests as density and re‑valuation rather than confrontation, culminating in the irrevocable disposal of the shard. The cost is legible: relinquishing a relic and accepting a redefined promise. Pressure remains coherent, though it never peaks into acute conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Thematic strands (wildfire vs. cultivation; “always” reframed; composting the past) accrue organically through image rather than sermon. The final act offers a resonant answer to the central question: some love prepares the soil rather than pairs, and that preparation becomes present strength. A few lines edge toward statement (“Her motive was not to wallow...”), but the images carry the weight. The closing breeze‑borne ash lingers with conceptual clarity and emotional restraint.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The voice is controlled, consistent, and character‑bound; diction feels like a caretaker’s lyric precision rather than generic poeticizing. Psychic distance remains steady, and rhythm modulates well from observation to decisive gesture. No head‑hopping or stance leakage; inference stays plausible. Occasional elevated phrasing skirts abstraction but remains anchored by concrete images.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished: strong verbs, selective metaphors, and momentum maintained through reflection. The “always” motif reprises without redundancy, and sentences carry multiple jobs. A few lines flirt with purple (“intersubjective understanding,” “passionate subtlety”), but clarity and propulsion hold. The final line resolves by image rather than exposition.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>While love/land metaphors are familiar, the reframing of “always” via fire’s selective survival and the compost conceit feels fresh. The Amber Pavilion and sentinel frame give the piece a particular identity. Risk is in the quiet, lyric handling and pays off without obscurity. Originality is strong but not radical.</comment>
