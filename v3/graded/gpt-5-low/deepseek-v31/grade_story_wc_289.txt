<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s yearning to “find the thread that connects all things” is clear and drives her choices from discovery to creation to offering. Interiority is embodied through sensory attention and craft actions rather than labels. The internal conflict—feeling hollow and disconnected—resolves credibly via her installation, though the on‑page cost remains soft. A slightly tidier emotional arc limits the sense of contradiction under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the nest find → pulp work → installation → reception accrues meaning to land a resonant reconfiguration. Closure arrives when the public engagement reweights her role from private scribe to communal conduit, mending her separation. Orientation is crisp early; causality is clean with the storm enabling the discovery. The cost is conceptual rather than visceral, keeping it shy of the very top band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The lotus temple, lily pond, walkway, and storm‑tossed willow are vivid and purpose‑driven, filtered through Elara’s sensibility. Environment charges the closure: the sculpture on the longest walkway, birds circling, the temple “gazing back.” The nest’s origin in the storm ties weather to object and choice. A slight bias toward beauty over constraint prevents a full 9+.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake (reconnecting to purpose) tightens through a single decisive deepening: transforming private letters into public art. Pressure is coherent but gentle; there’s no sharp foreclosing loss beyond surrendering secrecy as material. Pilgrims’ reactions function as soft validation rather than a test with real risk. The escalation fits the accumulative design but remains low‑temperature.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Motifs (thread, spiral, nest, temple/lotus) cohere to explore private confession becoming communal meaning. The final image—spiral pointing to temple, temple gazing back—offers a resonant answer without overt moral. One explicit line (“All things were connected…”) nudges toward statement, slightly softening subtext. Overall, the thematic weave is elegant and earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The lyrical third‑person close maintains a distinct perceptual bias: craft, waterlight, and material detail. Rhythm and diction modulate with the making/installing beats and quiet reception of pilgrims. No head‑hopping; stance is confident without overexplaining. A stray register blip (“曝光”) momentarily jars, but doesn’t disrupt control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is lush with strong image economy and purposeful sensory choices. Occasional purple lean and a minor diction glitch (“曝光”) nick the polish. Some phrases restate theme (“thread that connects all things,” “inevitably whimsical”) rather than letting images do all the work. Momentum largely holds through making and placement.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis—an archivist/ghostwriter pulping unsent love letters into a communal spiral anchored by a thrush’s engineered twig—is fresh and specific. The storm‑gifted object catalyzing a public offering avoids gimmickry and feels inevitable in hindsight. While the private-to-public art arc is a known path, the details here feel singular. Risk is tasteful rather than radical, but the vision is coherent.</comment>
