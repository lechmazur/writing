<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Isla’s motives and contradictions are clear and embodied: duty to safety versus reverence for history, enacted through micro‑choices (not breaking the seal; working it open; redirecting focus to control veins). Her competence is credible and rooted in tactile craft. The relational pressure with Kael is subtle but effective. The primary softness is the near‑frictionless acceptance of her plan, which dampens the felt personal cost at the peak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Clean causal chain under a Situational→Causal hybrid lens: ultimatum → hidden signal → reinterpreted stakes → engineered third path → institutional acquiescence. Closure lands on the page with a Decisive Change (adoption of the bypass) and a charged final image (gears turning, tear). Cost is mostly emotional and reputational, not materially priced, which tempers impact. Orientation is crisp from the opening and maintained.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The breathing volcano and crumbling amphitheater are vivid and functionally constraining: breath‑cycles create a live clock; thermal vents become the resource that enables the solution. The surveyor’s chain as object‑within‑setting filters perception through profession. The atmosphere mirrors tension without feeling pasted on. World rules remain consistent and legible.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake is legible early (preserve history vs prevent catastrophe), and pressure tightens with the envelope’s hidden code and the mountain’s breath timer. Isla’s agency drives the deepening (reframing lower chambers as counterweight; designing the bypass). However, the Council’s swift acquiescence mutes the price and the sense of risk in the final turn, limiting escalation’s bite. Tension works beat to beat but resolves too cleanly for maximal force.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Meaning emerges through particulars: the chain (balance), the compass rose (encrypted compassion), and the mountain’s breath (harmonization) thread the theme of synthesis over binary sacrifice. The final image resonates without sermonizing. The neatness of the win reduces lingering moral complexity, but the piece still invites reflection on progress versus memory. Subtext in Kael’s coded aid deepens it.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyrical voice with technical texture suits the POV and setting. Dialogue is minimal but carries subtext (“No further delays”) and advances plot. Psychic distance is steady, and elisions feel purposeful rather than withholding. Rhythm modulates with pressure effectively.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sentences carry multiple jobs with strong verbs and concrete nouns; imagery is evocative yet mostly disciplined. Minor purple edges (“dappled resolve”) and a single register blip (the inserted character 分流) don’t impede clarity. No scaffolding loops or muddled metaphors in peak beats. The final lines are clean and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The fusion of geothermal “breath,” floodgate engineering, and a coded compass signal feels fresh and organically integrated. The third‑option solution grows from established particulars rather than a late rule change. The only limiter is the relatively tidy institutional acceptance, which keeps the risk profile modest. Still, the concept’s synthesis reads inventive and memorable.</comment>
