<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s grief, stubborn curiosity, and word‑healing gift are integrated into concrete choices: choosing a lucid dream, then rejecting the academic paper for a healing narrative. The internal contradiction—she can heal others but not herself—adds pressure without melodrama. Cost is present but understated (foregoing traditional scholarly credit and accepting the burden). Interiority is specific and tactile (“mantle of leaden stars”), avoiding therapy‑speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: mentor’s telegram → lucid dream method → verification at the telescope → choice to write to heal public panic. Closure lands as a decisive renunciation and a conceptual repricing of the temple’s message from apocalypse to collective vigil. Cost is legible in the refusal of academic publication and the acceptance of communal responsibility. Orientation is crisp from the outset, and the single transition (dream) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The observatory is vivid and functional—brass telescopes, ozone, old paper—and becomes a tool that enables the turning verification beat. Environmental texture mirrors inner state without blunt symbolism and evolves as night shifts to dawn. While not a cage, the setting constrains tactics (she uses the equatorial telescope and charts). Specificity is selective and character‑filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decoding the inscriptions) tightens through the dream’s methodological reveal and the dawn verification. The key deepening is the reframe from static map to living clock, which narrows options and compels a new mode of response. The visible price is modest but real: abandoning the safer academic route for a riskier public‑facing healing act. Tension is primarily conceptual and internal but coherent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme arises organically: knowledge as communal duty, translating dread into shared purpose, language as living system. The final choice embodies the theme without overt sermonizing, though one line (“a unifying human experience”) nudges toward explicitness. Recurring images (stars, instruments, telegram) accrue meaning and reweight at the end. The piece invites reflection on how science and story co‑author resilience.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a lucid, lyrical register that suits a dream‑science hybrid. Diction is elevated but character‑plausible and modulates from midnight hush to dawn clarity. Dialogue in the dream is spare and purposeful, carrying subtext and method. Rhythm is controlled with varied sentence lengths that track pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is polished and economical; most sentences carry dual duties of image and action. Occasional lush metaphors (“accusing fingers,” “mantle of leaden stars”) flirt with purple but remain coherent and purposeful. No paraphrase loops or scaffolding bog momentum, and the final cadence lands cleanly. Technical phrasing around stars is precise enough without pedantry.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—variable stars as syntax, temple as clock, a healer‑writer reframing cosmic dread—is striking and grounded. The lucid dream as method risks cliché but is transformed by the specific astronomical mechanic and the ethical pivot. Turns feel earned and inevitable in hindsight. It reads as a singular vision rather than a stitched prompt response.</comment>
