<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s drive to translate silence into music is specific, embodied (the film‑less camera; the pang when the yacht tears the water), and her pivot from mapping to conducting reads as a credible renunciation with cost. Interiority is textured and character‑particular, not generic. The old court‑advisor instinct resurfaces and motivates the central choice. Slightly limited by the absence of deeper flaw friction or a sharper internal contradiction at the peak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the yacht’s intrusion tightens pressure, prompting Elara’s counter‑gesture; the engine cutting creates an on‑page resonance shift and a felt price (she foregoes her solitary mapping to risk being seen). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the world listens, then forgets again, and she accepts that cost. Orientation is clean from the outset. Stakes and turns are legible without mechanical over‑explanation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The harbor’s silver stillness and the pier’s staging are vivid and functional, not postcard filler: the wake literally shatters her “composition,” and the end‑of‑pier vantage enables her answer to be seen. The vintage camera operates as micro‑setting/object charging the final image. Sensory selection (water shimmer, creak of wood, absent gulls) supports tone and choice. A touch more non‑visual texture under pressure could have pushed it higher.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around one dominant stake: preserving/translating the harbor’s quiet. Escalation is clean—a singular modern noise demands a stance—and her response narrows options (she cannot remain purely observer). The price is subtle but present: she suspends her private art to intervene and risks exposure. The conflict could feature a slightly sharper consequence for her if ignored, but within scope it lands.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Themes of presence versus absence, ephemeral beauty, and the value of being unheard are earned through image and action, not stated morals. The final cadence (“once again in the timeframe when no one remembers you” yet satisfied) reweights the premise without neat consolation. Sign language as music and the camera that maps silence cohere conceptually. No sermonizing; resonance lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The close third‑person lyric voice is controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature (seeing “the weight of a sleeping cat’s breath”). Rhythm modulates at turns, and diction remains coherent to Elara’s sensibility. Dialogue is minimal yet effective; no head‑hopping or stance wobble. A few repeated constructs skirt sentimentality but stay earned by the voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is elegant and economical; images often do multiple jobs (wake as acoustic and visual rupture). Figurative density remains clear; limited repetition (“joyful sorrow”) functions as motif rather than padding. No scaffold loops or cadence templates bog momentum. Minor risk of purple is managed by situational specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The fusion of a film‑less camera that maps silence and sign language as orchestration against a yacht’s noise feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The risk—answering intrusion with performed silence—pays off without gimmickry. Emotional truth emerges without safe hedging. The closing reprisal of the camera and forgottenness lands with distinct identity.</comment>
