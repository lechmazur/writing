<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Eliran’s interiority is specific—his meditative craft, the spectral prompting, and the tactile engagement with ribbons show a coherent, motivated mind. The motive evolves credibly from commission to a broader quest to understand “collective grief.” Internal contradiction is mild (serenity vs. disturbance by the inner voice) and could push harder under pressure. Still, his final choice to alter his carving practice is earned and revealing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the journey to the greenhouse and immersion in migration deepen the central stake and culminate in a conceptual repricing (grief as movement/path). Orientation is clear; single POV, tight scope, one transition. Closure lands through the reconfiguration of his role and method, with a conceptual cost (shifting from monument-maker to translator of motion), though the price is largely interior. Causal threads (voice → retrace → object → revelation → plan) cohere.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The greenhouse, butterflies, ribbons, and tools are vivid and sensorially grounded, filtered through a carver’s attention. The environment decisively charges the final image (migration as poem; rain carving tears; lichen as future text) and directs his tactic. Details feel lived-in and purposeful without cataloging. The dusk/migration atmosphere sustains tone and meaning throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake (reframing grief and his craft) is signaled and coherently intensified by the spectral directive and the migration’s presence. The meaningful tightening is the choice to “retrace” and the ensuing redefinition of his carving practice. Costs remain conceptual rather than dramatized losses, keeping pressure modest. Still, the internal/external threads align clearly through the final decision.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Themes of collective grief, memory, and translation arise organically from ribbons, poems, migration, and craft. Subtext is strong: the river of Monarchs reframes grief without needing a moral, and the plan for rain and lichen embeds time into the stone. A few direct statements (“Grief was not a monument, but a path”) verge on telling, but they’re supported by concrete images. The final image resonates and reweights the earlier particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, lyrical yet controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature (tool, stone, and environmental attention). Spectral quotations are spare and well-placed; no head-hopping or register drift. Rhythm modulates appropriately from stillness to a charged calm. Diction remains coherent to the sensibility of a meditative craftsman.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is polished and economical, with multi-tasking lines that carry image, tone, and theme. Occasional elevated turns risk purple but remain legible and purposeful. No scaffold loops or mechanical cadence; sentences vary and propel. The closing paragraphs achieve clarity while sustaining lyric density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis—gravestone craft as translation of collective grief via ribbons, family-poem ritual, and a living canopy of Monarchs—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Spectral mentorship is familiar but reframed as a chorus of traded poems, adding specificity. The decision to carve for flow, rain, and future lichen is an elegant, original tactic. Risk is quiet but confident, avoiding gimmickry.</comment>
