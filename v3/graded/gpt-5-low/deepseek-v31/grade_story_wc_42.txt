<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—“to harness the ephemeral”—is clear and consistently expressed through tactile choices under pressure (arming the mechanism instead of scrambling for safety). Her competence and tremor‑ridden restraint give her interiority specificity. The conflict between custodian duty and secret artistic drive surfaces credibly in the quake. A deeper contradiction (art vs. survival voiced or acted upon) could heighten the cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Hybrid drive with a causal spine (setup → quake → arming → leaf‑tap trigger) culminating in a charged poise closure as time freezes. Orientation is crisp from the outset (who/where/what). Closure lands on‑page with the stopped hand and frozen tremors; conceptual cost is legible though her ongoing fate is left artfully ambiguous. A hairline plausibility blur—Elara observing post‑freeze—keeps it shy of the top band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The lunar observatory and its machinery constrain tactics and charge the final image; quartzglass, mic calibration, and orbital decay are not wallpaper but live pressures. The micro‑setting (camera, spinning hand) functions as world‑rule and tool. Sensory choices (hum of machinery, red lights, tearing metal) are purposeful and filtered through a technician’s eye. The environment directly enables the decisive “leaf” tap.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: capture the uncatchable as the station fails. Escalation coheres (alarms → degradation → violent lurch), narrowing options to a single attempt; agency lies in prior preparation and present arming amid noise. The trigger is coincidental but pre‑taught and filtered by her design, not deus ex machina. The price—forsaking safety for the shot—reads, though on‑page consequences are mostly conceptual.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Themes of time, art, and preservation emerge through objects and acts (“escape velocity” reframed as temporal release; the stopped hand). The “luminous ache” evolves from longing into a held, charged quiet, a non‑literal answer that reweights prior material. No sermonizing; the closing image invites reflection. A slightly neater consolation than necessary trims lingering moral complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Controlled close third with a lyrical, technical lexicon that fits a custodian‑engineer. Rhythm tightens under stress without losing clarity; no head‑hopping or stance wobble. Patterned diction (“changelessly constant,” “luminous ache”) is consistent, not showy. Minor flourish density in peak beats stays legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lines carry multiple jobs (image, function, stakes) with clean syntax and varied cadence. Figurative choices are coherent and anchored in the world (the “leaf” simile operationalized via mic). Minimal scaffold and no visible loops; propulsion tracks with events. A few reiterated phrases tilt toward motif but don’t bog momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—chrono‑synch flaw harnessed via a “leaf” sound to reach temporal escape velocity in a lunar observatory—is fresh and thematically integrated. The final reweighting (quiet freeze) feels earned by prior specifics. Risks are aesthetic rather than gimmicky and pay off. Only a slight dependence on coincidence keeps it from a higher band.</comment>
