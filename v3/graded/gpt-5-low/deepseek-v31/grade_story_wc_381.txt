<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation is crystalline and constant: a solitary summoner intent on hushing a dangerous prophecy. Interiority is particular (using breath and the brook’s flow) but largely free of contradiction; she rarely wavers or reveals competing impulses. Micro‑choices (inviting patterns, mapping silence, targeting the core syllable) align with her ethos of gentleness over force. The cost is primarily exertion and focus rather than a conflicted sacrifice, keeping the arc strong but not piercing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Single scene, single POV, clear anchors; the accumulative/textural lens holds as cadence and density of quiet intensify. Closure lands on the page: the prophecy’s knot unravels and the environment settles, with a conceptual price paid in the “silent supernova” outpouring of her cultivated calm. The object reprise (wing glowing then settling) binds the final image. Cost is felt but modest; nevertheless, the earned hush reads as a resonant reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The brook, willow haven, and mossy bank are tactile and continually integrated, not postcarded; the brook’s flow constrains tactics as a metronome. The origami wing functions as micro‑setting/object, charging the final image. Sensory selection (hush, hum, glow) is purposeful and filtered through a practitioner’s priorities. World rules emerge through action (mapping silence) without exposition bloat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early and pressure coheres as she narrows from mapping general noise to the core syllable. The deepening is a clear tightening rather than a reversal; agency drives the outcome via nonviolent method. Cost registers as painstaking effort and complete expenditure of calm, but there’s little visible price beyond fatigue. The escalation is elegant and sufficient under the textural lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of gentle constraint over force accrues through recurring images (breath, brook, wing) and culminates in a hush rather than a blast. The final image reweights the premise—power as quiet mastery—without sermonizing. Subtext of potential versus purpose (single wing) enriches the ending. Complexity is present though the moral calculus remains relatively unconflicted.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The close third‑person voice is coherent and confident, with rhythmic control that supports a meditative pressure curve. Diction is lyrical but largely within the piece’s own taught register; metaphors stay thematically aligned (silence as dye, supernova of will). No head‑hopping or stance slips. A few lush turns edge toward purple but not enough to blur focus.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is polished, image‑dense, and generally efficient; most sentences do multiple jobs. Occasional stacked modifiers and intensifiers (“terrestrially cosmic,” “silent supernova”) flirt with overwriting but don’t derail clarity or momentum. Variation in syntax and paragraphing sustains flow. No significant loops or scaffolding artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>“Mapping silence” as a technique, anchored by a single origami wing and a brook metronome, feels fresh and harmonized with the thematic core. The cosmic‑scale stake handled through micro, nonviolent precision is a non‑obvious synthesis. Risks are controlled and pay off at closure. The lane is familiar (quiet mage versus prophecy) but distinctly inflected.</comment>
