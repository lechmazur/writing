<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—to prove listening heals—drives coherent choices from the grate to the hospital. Interiority is steady and embodied (the locket’s “weight,” her silent invitation), but contradictory impulses are minimal, so cost to her remains light. Leo’s on‑page presence creates a brief, potent relational crucible, yet Elara never faces a hard trade‑off. The change is a credible endurance/stance crystallization rather than a risky transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: locket → neighbors → accident/letter link → hospital confrontation → quiet resolution. The mailbox/letter/lock pattern pays off conceptually with the locket as “key,” and the closure lands via Elara’s chosen listening. The hit‑and‑run coincidence strains probability but complicates rather than resolves. Cost is legible in Leo’s confession and Elara’s acceptance of witness duty, though the price is more emotional than tactical.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Evocative atmosphere (“sandstorm calm,” tarnished locket, perpetually locked mailbox) feels lived‑in and filtered through Elara’s sensibility. The mailbox and locket operate as micro‑setting objects that charge the final image, though the environment rarely constrains physical choices. Hospital and courtyard shards are cleanly staged with sensory economy. Tone and place cohere without tourist catalog breadth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can listening mend a rupture—tightens when the locket connects to Leo and Elara chooses silence as action. Pressure escalates coherently toward the hospital scene, but Elara sacrifices little beyond time and emotional bandwidth. The decisive deepening is Leo’s confession, precipitated by her stance rather than a difficult trade. The ending’s earned calm reweights stakes, though the path remains relatively low‑friction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme coheres through particulars: locked/unstamped, keyless/ear as key, witness as balm. The final image resonates, but the closing sentence explicitly states the moral (“to truly hear is to heal”), dulling subtext. Earlier restraint—Elara placing the locket without speech—shows a stronger thematic method. Ambiguity around Anya’s fate adds humane complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Controlled third‑person close with a distinct, unhurried cadence that fits Elara’s curator’s gaze. Dialogue snippets carry texture and do not over‑explain; the pivotal hospital exchange leans on silence effectively. Psychic distance remains stable, with clean focalization and no leakage. Lyric touches modulate under pressure without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lines are clean and purposeful, with a few strong metaphors (“particulate silence,” “eye of a lifelong storm”) that mostly cohere. Minor risk of figurative echo (storm/sandstorm) but clarity holds and momentum is steady. No scaffold or synonym loops; sentences vary and carry multiple jobs. The final paragraph balances compression and image without bloat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The thrift‑curator/listening‑as‑key angle freshens a familiar lost‑love confession frame. The locked mailbox and unstamped letter give an elegant thematic mechanism rather than a twist gimmick. Emotional truth lands, if safely; the coincidence of the accident feels conventional. The quiet, witness‑centered resolution shows taste and restraint over spectacle.</comment>
