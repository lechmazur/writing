<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation and perceptual signature are vivid and consistent, and her micro‑choices (isolating the shadow, choosing to whisper rather than force) align with a character defined by empathic attention. Internal contradiction is mild—she rarely wavers under pressure—so the arc feels more assured than contested. Embodied emotion lands in tactile details (palms on cold stone, thrum of heartbeat), avoiding generic labels. The final refusal to immediately descend reads as a credible earned stasis, if with a subtle cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Clear causal chain: comparison of footage → discrepancy → keystone hypothesis → whisper → mechanism opens → inner chamber revealed. Closure lands on the page (a Decisive Change plus a charged pause), though the cost is more conceptual than felt. Orientation is clean and single‑scene scope holds; the drive lens reads Causal with a quiet, textural finish. The only soft spot is the relatively low consequences for opening an ancient mechanism.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The vault’s geometry, oculus light, crack-as-seam, and keystone materially constrain options and enable the discovery, and the environment charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV‑filtered; the space is both functional and atmospheric without museum‑tour excess. World rules stay consistent and are learned through action (shadow shift, retracting stone). Strong object‑as‑setting integration elevates the last beat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—unlocking/understanding the threshold—tightens once with the keystone realization and the decision to whisper rather than force. Escalation is controlled but low‑amplitude; danger is implied rather than dramatized. Agency drives the turn and the resolution feels earned. The cost register remains gentle, limiting peak tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Silence, attention, and the known/unknown converse through concrete actions, culminating in the charged threshold image. Thematically, empathy as method reweights power and access (the door opens to gratitude, not force). A few lines verge on direct statement (“The known and the unknown were not divided...”), slightly flattening subtext. Overall resonance lingers without tidy moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The voice is controlled, lyrical, and closely focalized to Elara’s perceptual bias; diction and rhythm support the contemplative pressure. No head‑hopping or stance slips, and patterned imagery is taught and kept legible. Compression and cadence modulate effectively at the turn. Occasional elevated phrasing skirts purple but remains coherent for the register.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Sentences carry multiple jobs—worldbuilding, mood, and causality—without scaffold or loops, and the prose keeps momentum through the discovery. Figurative language is judicious, with only minor density spikes that don’t blur sense. Syntax varies and the final image is clean. Minimal redundancies, no distracting artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis feels fresh: a “cartographer of silence,” forensic shadow comparison, gratitude as access mechanism, and the miniature henge recontextualizing the chapel. Turns grow organically from character and space rather than gimmick. The risk is quiet rather than flashy, but the conceptual angle is distinctive. A slightly higher stakes cost could have pushed it into exemplary territory.</comment>
