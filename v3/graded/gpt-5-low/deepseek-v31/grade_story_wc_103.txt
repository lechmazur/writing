<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is clear (find mother; “feel the grain of time”), and her choices—analysis via hyperbolic geometry, returning to the bridge, recalculating—track her values. Interiority is specific enough to feel embodied (scent of yew, the burn of the fragment), though contradictory impulses are muted and competence reads a touch convenient. The reunion forecloses her prior haunt (the loop), with an emotional cost implied by the photographs’ demise. Added ambiguity or visible hesitation under stress would deepen character texture.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: discovery of the halo fragment → retrocognitive vision → geometric reframing → recalculation at the fracture → mother returns. Orientation is solid early; the two‑shard structure (present/vision) is controlled. Closure lands on the page with cost (photos disintegrate; artifact relinquished). The only slight softness is the low resistance in the final execution beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The living bridge garden is vivid and functional—the apex, “heart,” and shimmering fracture direct action and focus. The halo fragment as a tool-object charges space and the final cadence; sensory details (scent of yew, trembling leaves) are pointed and filtered through Elara’s practitioner bias. Setting constrains the choice to act at the fracture and makes the ending image feel earned. A hair more spatial tension during the climax would heighten immediacy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (freeing her mother/releasing the loop) is signaled early and deepens with the artifact’s discovery and the geometric insight. Escalation is coherent under a causal lens, but the final recalculation meets little on‑page resistance, reading more as a clean solution than a test under pressure. The cost is present (losing the photographs; relinquishing the artifact), keeping it in the strong band. One visible hitch or trade‑off during the act would sharpen the squeeze.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Time as textured, foldable surface connects cleanly with maze design and the photographs’ fade, which reprice as “calibrations” before dissolving. The ending reweights prior images without a moral, though a few direct theme statements (“The maze was a temporal equation”) flirt with didactic clarity. The transformation of the loop from prison to stitch is a strong subtextual turn. Slightly less exposition would let the imagery carry more of the load.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, lyrical yet controlled, with a clear perceptual signature shaped by Elara’s craft. Brief dialogue (“It’s a key…”) is functional and charged. Diction occasionally edges into explanatory register but stays plausible for a designer steeped in geometry and structure. Rhythm modulates well into the climax without head‑hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is polished and efficient, with strong image economy (“swallow the afternoon sun,” “leaves trembling in a silent frequency”). Minimal scaffolding; momentum holds. A few abstract nouns (“temporal equation,” “hyperbolic pressures”) risk cooling the heat at peak beats but do not obscure clarity. Overall, high information density with clean cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Hedge‑maze restoration fused with hyperbolic geometry as a time‑map is a fresh synthesis, and the halo fragment’s role as focal lens feels distinctive. The photographs-as-calibrations and the loop-as-stitch reframing show ingenuity. Resolution is not novel in genre terms (artifact-enabled reunion), but the execution is elegant. A small push toward a less tidy, more costly solving would elevate distinctiveness further.</comment>
