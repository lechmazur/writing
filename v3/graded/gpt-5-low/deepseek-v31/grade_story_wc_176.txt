<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—to preserve the sound of forgotten names—anchors every action and reads particular to her craft and guilt. Interiority is concrete (minute pressures, precise heats) and the despair-to-ingenuity pivot feels earned. The contradictory impulses (forgiven self vs. creeping despair) surface plausibly in-scene. The cost is felt but modest; we glimpse strain more than a deep wound.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Clear causal chain: failed archive → fragile card/wax won’t hold → rope insight → aurora-focused solution → bronze closure. The rope’s function is foreshadowed as a “ceremonial” object and then reinterpreted, avoiding a pure deus ex. Closure lands on-page with a decisive material result and a reweighted internal state. The price is mostly risk and near-loss rather than a consequential trade-off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The icebound sanctum and aurora are not backdrop; they actively constrain and enable tactics (the rope, the light focusing memory). Objects-as-setting (rope, crucible, wax, card) are tactile and integrate with action. Sensory selections are POV-driven and economical. The final image is charged by place-specific phenomena.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early and pressure coheres: the card threatens to crumble, the wax won’t take impressions, despair rises. The meaningful tightening arrives with the rope reconfiguration, a knowledge-deepening that changes options. Agency drives the resolution. The felt price is there but light; few alternatives are foreclosed beyond the near-failure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Themes of memory as matter, transmutation of regret, and the ethics of preservation emerge through action rather than moralizing. The rope’s reclassification from ceremony to tool reframes memory and ritual. “Snowmelt ardor” in the final beat offers a resonant, non-literal answer to guilt and purpose. Ambiguity exists but remains gentle rather than knotted.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third-person close sustains a distinct perceptual signature aligned with craft and place. Diction and rhythm modulate with pressure without head-hopping or register slips. Purposeful compression fits the scene’s intensity. No dialogue, but the narrative voice carries subtext well.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lines carry multiple jobs (world, action, theme) with clean syntax and momentum. Figures are vivid yet disciplined; minimal scaffolding or paraphrase loops. The peak beats remain clear despite lyric density. A few elevated phrases brush purple, but they serve tone and do not obscure causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis—lost-wax casting as archival salvation, a rope lens channeling aurora to fossilize song—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The reweighted meaning of “ceremonial” is a smart, non-obvious turn grounded in prior detail. Emotional specificity (forgiveness turned into method) avoids tropey arc. Risks in world-rule invention heighten stakes without confusion.</comment>
