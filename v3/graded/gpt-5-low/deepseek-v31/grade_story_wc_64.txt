<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation—“to discover the shape of intentions”—is clear and governs each choice from walking to the silo to decoding the tapestry. Interiority is specific and embodied (the tactile decoding, the sovereign case warming) though internal contradiction is mild; pressure never forces a painful trade. Her final stance shift (“blithe no longer”) reads earned by the discoveries on the page. The character is distinct without lapsing into stock cues.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: image density and object reveals escalate toward a resonant reconfiguration. Causality holds cleanly—decode → echoes → mechanism click → locket/king—delivering conceptual cost via the gambit realization and Elara’s tempered poise. Orientation is crisp from the outset; the closure lands on-page with the return of the case to the chest. The cost is quiet but legible: she foregoes keeping the relic, accepting stewardship over possession.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The cobalt silo, starlight window, motes, velvet, tarnished silver—setting is vivid and integrated through action. The space and light meaningfully guide discovery (the beam on the chest; the celestial map mirroring the sky), charging the final image. Sensory range extends beyond visual (chilled air, metallic taste), aligned with mood. World rules are consistent and spare, without expository drag.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes are intimate: deciphering intention and honoring it. Escalation is a steady deepening rather than sharp reversal—the tapestry’s logic coheres, sensations rise, the mechanism springs; pressure is coherent but low-friction with no significant obstacle. Agency drives the turns, and the closing renunciation reads earned, though the felt price remains subtle. A single decisive tightening exists but never bites hard.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Chess/gardening/tapestry motifs converge into a clear metaphor of love as gambit and preservation as sacrifice. The final image reweights prior material without moralizing, transforming “blithe” into gravity. Subtext (stewardship over ownership; saving the king to save the game) is organic and avoids platitude. Quiet ambiguity lingers around the figures’ past and the costs they bore.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The voice is poised and consistent, with a tactile lyricism that matches the protagonist’s perceptual bias. Psychic distance remains steady; no head‑hopping or register slips. Patterned diction (“velveteen gloom,” “tenderly organized chaos”) is controlled and paid off by the closing cadence. Elisions are purposeful and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is clean, with efficient sentences that carry image and action together. A few lush phrases flirt with purple, but rhythm and clarity hold, and there’s minimal redundancy. Syntax varies and momentum is maintained through the decoding sequence. The final line lands without over‑explaining.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—a cemetery gardener decoding a tapestry to unlock a sovereign case that hides a chess king—feels fresh and coherent. Turns arise from the established pattern of attention rather than late rule changes. The gambit frame recontextualizes the discoveries in a satisfying, non‑obvious way. Risk is taken in the quiet, accumulative approach and pays off.</comment>
