<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s motives and methods are clear, embodied, and pressured: she calibrates, chooses to enter, recoils, then recommits with a redefined aim. The contradiction between craving mastery and risking madness surfaces convincingly in the “flood” and her shaken withdrawal. Her final stance—restorer not archaeologist—feels earned by what she endures. A slight label-y note (“helix-minded”) is decorative but doesn’t undercut credibility.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: preparation → immersion → revelation → reconfiguration. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost: she absorbs another’s ruin and repurposes fracture as method, altering her project’s aim. Orientation is crisp from the opening, and the cracked mirror persists as constraint shaping the end. The causal thread of device modification triggering the vision that reweights her approach is tight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The moonlit canyon and the broken mirror are sensorially vivid and functionally integral; the place literally houses the “haunting” and the mirror’s state dictates tactics. Multisensory touches (static through teeth, scent of bread) deepen atmosphere without bloat. The environment/tool charges the final image where she works “under the moon” to integrate fracture. Scale and specificity are proportionate and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes—mastery without psychic collapse; salvaging meaning from ruins—tighten via the painful influx and the seared predecessor’s failure. The key turn is her shaken withdrawal and resolve to integrate the wound, narrowing options away from “fixing” toward bearing fracture. Cost is felt (another man’s tears, quaking threat to sanity) and carried into the final decision. Pressure could be sharpened by one concrete risk to body or device, but current escalation reads cleanly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through image and action: failure-as-foundation, restoration via fracture, collective memory as haunting. The mirror’s crack reweights from defect to method, offering a resonant answer without sermonizing. One explicit line (“She was not just an archeologist… she was a restorer”) verges on statement but is earned by scene pressure. The final working image sustains ambiguity and afterglow.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The voice is lyrically controlled, sensory, and consistent with close-third access to Elara’s perceptions. Rhythm and diction modulate with pressure (from poised calibration to flood and steadied resolve). No head-hopping or register slips undermine authority. Figurative texture feels chosen rather than generic.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sentences carry multiple jobs with minimal scaffold; vivid images avoid redundancy. Metaphor density is high but coherent and legible, with no mixed vehicles in peak beats. Momentum sustains through the reflective segment because it tilts present stakes. Minor elevated diction fits the piece’s lyrical aims.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis—engineer as restorer of murdered dreams via a cracked periscope mirror in a haunted canyon—feels specific and inevitable in hindsight. The “entangled memories” device is fresh in its collective-discard frame, and the fracture-as-method turn is elegant. Risks in language and premise heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. The result reads singular rather than templated.</comment>
