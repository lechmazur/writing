<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation and flaw are clear: mastery vs. vulnerability, control vs. surrender. Her micro‑choices (lifting the lens, stepping into the chamber, choosing to “converse” with sounds) reveal a credible internal shift. Embodied detail—cool weight of glass, breathlessness at the end—grounds feeling. The change is earned, though the final articulation edges toward tidy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural, with pressure deepening through sonic layering to a resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands when she inserts herself as guide and the system answers with unprogrammed laughter, reweighting the rules of her project. The cost is the risk of relinquishing control and exposing her “prism‑song.” Orientation is clean; causal links are soft but coherent for the chosen lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The Laboratory of Lost Sounds and resonance chamber are vivid and functional, not postcard—tools shape tactics. The miner’s lamp lens works as a micro‑setting/object that frames choices and charges the final image (“seemed to capture the light”). Sensory selection fits a sound‑obsessed POV, widening to visual/light only when thematically apt. World rules feel consistent and efficient.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes are internal but clear: make the pilgrimage truly move a listener. Escalation arrives when she abandons conducting for responsive presence, narrowing options to risk and receive. The unexpected laughter is a meaningful tightening/turn consistent with the accumulative method. Cost is felt but subtle, more conceptual vulnerability than concrete loss.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme—connection resides in the resonant space between sounds and selves—emerges through action (call‑and‑response) and recurring images (lens, bell). The child’s laughter reweights earlier material without neat moralizing. A few lines verge on explicit thesis (“She had discovered the texture...”), modestly reducing subtlety. Still, the final image carries honest aftereffect.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The voice is controlled, textural, and coherent with Elara’s sensibility; diction and rhythm fit a reflective, technical artist. Free indirect distance is stable, with no head‑hopping. Lyricism flexes without obscuring clarity. Minimal dialogue is natural and purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is clean and purposeful, with strong image economy (gravel crunch, wind through pines, bell tone). Minor risk of over‑telling and elevated diction near the end (“Golden Shadows given voice,” restating the moral) slightly blunts the charge. No loops or cadence templates drag momentum. Rhythm supports the accumulative build.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The “prism‑song bell ringer” in a post‑collapse sound lab is an original synthesis executed with conviction. The decision to let the archive “answer” and the emergent laughter are fresh and thematically apt. Risks (lyric mode, gentle stakes) pay off without confusion. Specific objects and techniques keep the premise from feeling generic.</comment>
