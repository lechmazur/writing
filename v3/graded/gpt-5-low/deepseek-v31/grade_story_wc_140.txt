<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear, singular motivation (“to bear witness”) drives concrete choices: creeping the yard, prying the footlocker, confronting the clerk. Interiority is specific (seeing absences rather than presences) and embodied through occupational grit (tides, rust, gulls). A modest but credible internal tension peaks at the office visit and resolves into an earned renunciation. Slight softness remains around his fear and personal risk calculus, which stays mostly implied.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: fragments accrue to a pattern, culminating in the office warning and a reweighted return to the maze. Orientation is clean early (port yard, erased man, tides) and the label anchors the causal chain. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: he forecloses confrontation in favor of archivist duty, with a felt conceptual cost. The cost is more implied than dramatized physically, but the warning line and final image make it legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The container labyrinth and tides are not backdrop; they shape tactics and the cadence of movement and charge the final image (“tide was turning”). Detail selection is disciplined and filtered through his perception (rust canals, seals, gulls). The poison label functions as micro‑setting in hand, constraining choices in the office scene. Atmosphere sustains tone and meaning without touring.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Pressure coheres from curiosity to peril: discovery of the empty bunk and label → office confrontation → explicit warning. The dominant stake is his commitment to witness in the face of institutional threat, and it tightens once; he chooses endurance over exposure. The cost is quiet but present; we feel the foreclosed path of open pursuit. A second concrete pinch (e.g., immediate consequence) might have amplified stakes further.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Erased histories and the hidden costs of commerce surface through scene and image, not sermon. The poison label reweights the theme from loss to deliberate removal; the clerk’s line condenses institutional complicity without didacticism. The final cadence (“keeper of the silence”) answers the story’s question with charged resignation. Ambiguity is purposeful and lingers productively.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A supple, controlled lyric voice with a distinct perceptual signature (seeing hollows, mapping voids). Dialogue is sparse yet loaded, especially the clerk’s warning, which carries subtext and status. Psychic distance stays steady; no head‑hopping or register slips. Rhythm modulates well from ruminative to taut in the office beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density and clean syntax; images do multiple jobs (tides as clock, labyrinth as system). Figurative language is purposeful and not overstacked; minimal scaffold or repetition. The prose propels without clogging exposition. A few abstractions (“texture of memories”) lean elevated but remain grounded by tactile detail.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The erased‑man archivist in a tide‑ruled container maze is a fresh synthesis; the poison label as signature is a striking, memorable turn. The accumulative investigative method subverts thriller beats into a moral ledger. Risks (quiet, conceptual closure) pay off coherently. Only the danger vector remains somewhat safe, keeping it just shy of the rarest tier.</comment>
