<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kaelen’s motive is clear and particular—seeking “hush” by rethreading a legacy of lies—and his key choice (to speak truth through the lattice) reads earned. Interiority is concise but specific; the inherited “sin of silence” sets a credible contradiction resolved under pressure. Emotional embodiment leans symbolic more than visceral, so the cost sits more conceptual than bodily. Still, the on‑page renunciation of the family pattern carries weight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: he steals the lattice, the Warden manifests, he reinterprets the object as filter, speaks truths, and the threat resolves with a felt price. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—his stance changes and the environment’s pressure lifts. Orientation is strong and single‑scene focus is tight. The “before they find the bodies” clock is underused tactically but doesn’t harm closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid, economical setting—lighthouse prison, reef, deconsecrated chapel—grounds tone and action. The lattice functions as a charged micro‑setting/tool that constrains tactic (truth must be filtered), and the final image returns to sea and copperlight. Sensory balance (taste of dust, vibration in teeth) is purposeful. Minor: the broader island/prison stakes don’t materially squeeze choices beyond tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (achieve hush/escape spectral pressure) is legible early, and escalation tightens with the Warden’s hum and approach. The decisive turn—using the lattice as filter to voice hard truths—narrows options and exacts a price (breaking the family’s protective silence). The clock about bodies doesn’t escalate the scene’s beat, but internal/external pressures interlock well. Resolution arises from his agency, not coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of fear‑fed falsehoods and truth as clarifying, not blaring, emerges through action and the lattice’s function. The final hush reweights lineage and silence without sermonizing, though a couple lines (“He was not weaving a new tale…”) skirt explicitness. Recurring images (lattice, hush, copperlight) accrue meaning. Ambiguity about the bodies lingers productively.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Controlled, lyrical third‑person with a distinct texture; diction is elevated but coherent for the fable‑like register. Psychic distance remains steady, modulating aptly at the peak. No head‑hopping or unearned omniscience. The voice carries pressure without over‑explaining.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lines are clean, rhythmic, and information‑dense, with purposeful imagery (“pressure in his skull,” “vibration that made his teeth ache”). Occasional purple glints (“copperlight repose,” “coalescence of gloom and memory”) fit the chosen register and stay legible. Minimal scaffolding and no paraphrase loops. The prose accelerates into the choice and breathes at the end.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: heir of the Boy Who Cried Wolf, a confessional lattice as truth‑filter, and a Warden of Echoes is an elegant, non‑obvious combination. The key reweighting (truth must be filtered to be bearable) feels inevitable in hindsight. Risks in tone and concept pay off without obscuring clarity. Only the underused “bodies” clock tempers the sense of total integration.</comment>
