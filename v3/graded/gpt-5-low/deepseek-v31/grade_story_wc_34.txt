<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—giving voice to unspoken systems—drives concrete choices under pressure, and her embodied focus (hands on the cold bolt plate, timing the window) reads lived-in. The heirloom’s use reveals value hierarchy without exposition. Internal contradiction is mild (devotion vs. risk), so the portrait leans assured rather than torn. Still, the final acceptance—singing for an audience of one—lands as earned endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural held cleanly; pressure intensifies via storm cadence and pattern density culminating in the lightning/thunder window. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the ghost ceases as code and persists as song, with the graffiti fading and chime as cost/receipt. Orientation is immediate (who/where/when by the first paragraph). The bolt plate constraint and the atmospheric window provide the persistent pressures that shape tactics through the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The misted, charged courtyard and storm are not postcard detail—they constrain the only viable transmission window and regulate tactics. The bolt plate functions as micro-setting/object, physically aligning in the reader slot and returning in the final image. Sensory economy is strong (wet stone, glowing tags, charged air) and consistently filtered through Elara’s attention. World rules are taught through action, not exposition dumps.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (“free the ghost via a clean transmission”) is explicit and tightened by the between-lightning-and-thunder clock. A live constraint (incomplete matrix without the bolt plate) forces a trade-off, and the storm escalation narrows options credibly. The cost is felt (spending the heirloom’s aura and risking the singular window), though it remains more conceptual than material. Agency drives the climax: she inserts the plate and encodes through song despite the thunder’s arrival.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—articulating the unvoiced and the ethics of listening—emerges through actions, not thesis. The final image (“The ghost was no longer in the code; it was the song.”) reweights prior motifs without moralizing. The heirloom-as-key reframes preservation into release, adding a subtle price to connection. Slight neatness in gratitude/chime keeps complexity from deepening into ambiguity’s darker edge.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A distinct, lyrical POV with technical inflection (“translation matrix,” “carrier wave”) stays character-plausible and modulates under stress. Diction tightens during the peak, and the voice carries the accumulative design without head-hopping or stance slips. No dialogue needed; vocalization appears as action (her song) rather than quoted lines. Minor risk of lushness is contained by scene momentum.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is musical yet purposeful; sentences vary and carry multiple jobs (world, emotion, tactic). Imagery clusters (light, static, engraving) stay coherent; very few redundancies or scaffolds. A handful of elevated modifiers approach purple but do not obscure action or cost. The final cadence is crisp, with clean syntax supporting the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>“Ghost in code” meets graffiti-encoded light and a flower-press bolt plate as analog key—an inventive synthesis executed with conviction. The storm-window tactic and song-as-vessel avoid gimmickry by shaping decisions. While the cyber-lyric frame isn’t wholly unprecedented, the specific object ecology and transmission ritual feel fresh and memorable. Risk-taking in tone and method heightens stakes without confusing the read.</comment>
