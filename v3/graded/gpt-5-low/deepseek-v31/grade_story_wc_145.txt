<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s motive (to find the rivers’ source) is clear, character‑specific, and governs her choices from noticing the glass‑map to venturing onto the ice. Interiority is textured (atlas editor’s eye, polyglot’s phrasebook) and embodied in cold, breath, and efficient motions. The internal conflict is more steady endurance than contradiction, keeping the arc quiet but credible. The final renunciation—smoothing the dog‑ear, closing “source”—lands with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural with clean causal spine: condensation pattern → trek → discovery → conceptual repricing at the end. Orientation is immediate (outpost, frozen lake, falcon at a fixed hour), and the closure occurs on the page with cost—her quest ends as epitaph, not triumph. No teleports or soft resets; the returning images are kept and paid off. The price is legible in her choice to end the search and accept the world’s “postscript.”</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The environment constrains and charges every move: iron chill, black ice window, subterranean cavern with bioluminescent river. The outpost and lake shape tactics (half‑mile trek, kneeling to scrape ice) and heavily charge the final image of life below. Sensory detail is precise and POV‑filtered (cartographic noticing, “valley inverted”). World rules remain consistent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>One dominant stake (truth of the source) tightens when the condensation becomes a map and forces a choice to cross the ice. The meaningful deepening is the inverted valley and cavern reveal that reweights the journey into an epitaph. Cost is internal but explicit: she forecloses her life’s pursuit upon discovering it’s a memorial. The pressure is coherent and builds in a single, decisive intensification appropriate to the length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars—language loss, maps vs. reality, living world submerged—and culminates in the final repricing: source equals end. The phrasebook, falcon, and condensation recur with shifting meaning, avoiding moralizing. The last image (worrying tranquility “now complete”) offers a resonant answer without stating it. Subtext about knowledge’s limits and elegy for a planet feels earned and durable.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The voice is distinct—precise, sparely lyrical, professionally biased toward cartographic noticing—and stays consistent under pressure. Diction choices (“stoop,” “headspring,” “atlas editor’s eye”) feel plausibly within her lexicon. Psychic distance remains steady; no head‑hopping or gratuitous elision. Rhythm modulates well from watchfulness to charged stillness at the close.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lines are clean, purposeful, and carry multiple jobs (image, character, and theme) without paraphrase loops. Figurative density is high but coherent with the cold, cartographic idiom; no mixed metaphors or register slips. Momentum stays intact through transitions; sentences vary in length and cadence. The closing images are crisp and unblurred by purple flourish.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The condensation‑as‑map and inverted valley leading to a bioluminescent subterranean watershed feel fresh and integrated with the cartographer’s psyche. The falcon as daily herald and the phrasebook’s “source” reprise add specific texture beyond trope. While elegiac climate‑future frames are familiar, this synthesis lands with specificity and conceptual bite. Risk lies in the quiet, non‑heroic closure, executed with control.</comment>
