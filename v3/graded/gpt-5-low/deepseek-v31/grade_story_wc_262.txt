<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—to locate where unused love is stored—is clear and governs her choices (touching the film, entering the memory, deciding to project). Interiority is specific (psychometry filtered through tactile details), though internal contradiction is minimal, with little friction between caution and compulsion. The grief-suffused tenderness reads embodied rather than labeled. The closing act (projecting the film) feels earned by the prior discovery.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong single‑scene arc with a clean accumulative/textural lens: tactile investigation → visionary deepening → revaluation → ceremonial projection. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing/charged poise: love as archived energy released into the world, with the goodbye reweighted. Orientation is clear early, and the final image pays the set‑up without mechanical over‑explanation. The cost is primarily conceptual/emotional but legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The booth, projector, dust, and celluloid are vivid, selective, and POV‑filtered, with professional textures that feel lived‑in. The environment and tools constrain and enable the final act (only here can she project the film and “pump” the archived love). Sensory balance (smell of hot metal, dust in the light cone) supports tone and meaning. The setting meaningfully charges the closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Pressure coheres under an accumulative lens: density and resonance increase from tactile contact to immersive memory to action. Stakes remain intimate and conceptual, yet the decision to project functions as a tightening choice that transforms the stored love into a public goodbye. The lack of antagonistic force is offset by an effective cadence shift. The price is quiet but present: releasing what was held as an archive.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Themes of art as repository, love’s afterlife in objects, and the ethics of release emerge through concrete particulars (film handling, attic letters, the whirring projector). The ending reframes “unused love” as “archived,” avoiding platitudes, and the heart‑screen image works as a resonant answer. Subtext binds craft and devotion without sermonizing. Slight neatness is balanced by felt melancholy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a supple, controlled lyric register; perceptual signatures (tactile/technical) match Elara’s method. Rhythm modulates well from stillness to ceremonial urgency. No head‑hopping or register drift; brief dialogue is unobtrusive and functional. The voice stays confident without over‑explaining.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is clean and economical; images do multiple jobs (dust as atmosphere and projection medium). Figurative language is purposeful and largely unmixed (“hushed thunder,” “beating heart”) without purple sprawl. No visible loops or scaffold; sentences propel rather than stall. Minor lushness serves mood rather than obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Psychometry fused with cinema’s materiality yields a fresh angle on love, memory, and craft. The goodbye‑as‑archive reweighting feels inevitable in hindsight once the film’s tactile history is revealed. Risks are quiet but real, privileging conceptual closure over plot tricks. Specificity (old projectionist’s booth practices) keeps it from template sentiment.</comment>
