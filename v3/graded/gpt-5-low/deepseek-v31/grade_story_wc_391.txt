<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elara’s impatience vs. trained vigilance produces a credible internal contradiction, and her embodied beats (chart‑checking, standing her ground) align with motive. The arc from mapper to keeper is earned by the scene’s pressures. The cost—renouncing impatience—is felt but soft. A secondary stressor (beyond environment) could have deepened micro‑choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the convergence tightens pressure toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (awakening and role shift). Orientation is clear early and the ritual’s payoff occurs on the page. Closure cost is conceptual (renunciation/endurance) more than material but legible in the final stance. The causal chain leans on prophecy over choice, yet coherence and cadence make the turn satisfying.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is vividly particular (basalt sanctuary, magnetic viaduct, triple moons) and integrated into action as energy travels through ore and re‑lights scripts. The ice lens in the final image recharges the world’s rules and theme. Sensory detail is purposeful and POV‑filtered, especially the metallic hum felt “in her teeth.” Minor risk of over‑decoration is held in check by consistent function.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—witnessing the alignment to unyoke the sanctuary—tightens as the moons converge; escalation reads as cadence intensification rather than reversal. Agency is endurance/attention: she chooses to hold under pressure, foreclosing haste. Cost remains mostly interior and conceptual, which tempers heat but fits the lens. A single added obstacle could have clarified price at the peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Thematic throughline—“patient revolution”—is well braided with setting and final repricing (awakening deepens the ice into a truer lens). However, a few lines state the thesis outright (“The revolution was not an attack; it was an awakening”), slightly flattening subtext. The closing transformation of role and world carries resonance beyond the page. Nuance outweighs moralizing, but restraint could be tighter.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third‑person maintains stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature. Rhythm modulates with pressure (from stillness to groan/flare) without head‑hopping or stance slips. Diction fits the world and character’s vocation. Occasional abstraction creeps in, but the voice remains coherent and sure‑handed.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lines carry strong image density and clean syntax; most sentences do more than one job. A few phrases drift toward thematic proclamation and minor redundancy, but momentum holds. Figurative language largely matches established physics (magnetism, ore, aurora) and avoids muddle. Closing image lands crisply.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Magnetic viaducts, triple moons, and the ice‑as‑lens reprise feel fresh and cohesive, transforming familiar “chosen alignment” tropes. The patient‑revolution angle, realized through endurance rather than spectacle, offers a non‑obvious synthesis. Risk is measured but real, with world logic and vocation unified. Slight reliance on prophecy softens surprise but not ingenuity.</comment>
