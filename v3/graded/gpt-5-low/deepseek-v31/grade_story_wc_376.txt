<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation (to find where lost conversations go) is clear and coherently compels her descent. The embodied cost of dishonesty (wilting, leaden limbs) grounds interiority in specific, character‑particular terms. A credible shift occurs when she drinks from the spring and resolves to disseminate the truth. The inner contradiction (retreat from lies vs. compulsion to seek truth) is present but could tighten under the final decision for a sharper felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal. The sequence cleanly links discovery of the map → descent impeded by dishonesty → candor restores capacity → cavern revelation → decision to return with truth. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing (truth as water) with a charged poise in her vow. The cost at the end is more implied than enacted, slightly softening impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The greenhouse city, toxic sky, glass‑dome studio, and damp tunnels are vivid and functionally integrated. Environment constrains action (her wilting in dishonest atmospheres, the physical descent) and charges the final image (pure spring vs. parched city). Details are filtered through her calligrapher’s eye, keeping specificity purposeful. A minor lift remains possible if spatial choreography in the descent showed one more tactical constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes are coherent: locating the true source to save a city starving for truth. Escalation tightens via physical degradation under lies and a restorative jolt from the plumber’s candid admission, enabling the push to the cavern. The ending choice (share truth “no matter the personal cost”) resolves the pressure credibly. The price is forecast rather than felt on the page at the last beat, keeping it strong but not searing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Themes of candor, preservation of speech, and truth as lifeblood rise organically from action and image (the murmuring cavern). The plumber’s small truth meaningfully reweights the journey. One sentence—“Her city was starving not for water, but for truth.”—edges into explicit statement, slightly dulling subtext. The final growth image restores resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The third‑person close voice is steady, textured, and character‑specific without leakage. Lyric diction suits the world while staying legible; the lone dialogue moment is natural and pressure‑bearing. Rhythm modulates well between descriptive poise and forward motion. No head‑hopping or stance drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sentences carry multiple jobs (world, mood, motive) with minimal scaffold. Figurative language is controlled and thematically aligned; no muddled metaphors or loops. A few elevated declarations could be trimmed for even greater propulsion. Final line lands cleanly through image rather than exposition.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—calligraphy on living leaves, a subterranean archive of spoken truth, and an honesty‑sickness—feels fresh and purposeful. Turns arise from seeded particulars (map fragment, plumber’s candor) rather than contrivance. The repricing at the spring is non‑obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Boldness is evident without obscuring clarity.</comment>
