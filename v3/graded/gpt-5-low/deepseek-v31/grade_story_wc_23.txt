<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—preserving culture as a response to loss—is clear and consistently drives every micro‑choice from jury‑rigging comms to repurposing scraps. Embodied emotion (“boots echoing,” “heart hammering”) keeps her present and specific. Internal contradiction is modest but present (grief as fuel vs. peace at closure). The final renunciation—accepting the station as tomb—feels earned with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal chain is tight: hydraulic failure → midnight directive → build from scraps → beam sent → power death and earned stasis. Orientation (who/where/when) is clear within the first paragraphs and sustains coherence. Closure lands on the page with cost as the station goes dark and she remains alone but at peace. No false beats or unkept setups weaken the arc.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The environment is vivid and functional: a frozen array and dwindling power concretely force the decision to build a new broadcaster. The observation dome, Earthlight, and emergency blue consoles create a coherent, tactile atmosphere. The censer foot functions as micro‑setting that charges the final image. World rules feel consistent and learned through action rather than exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are singular and legible: send the archive or let it die with the station. Pressure tightens when the hydraulics and power limits foreclose standard options, forcing a costly improvisation. The accelerated schedule and total power drain make the price unmistakable. Resolution arises from her agency rather than luck.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme coheres around preservation vs. loss, with “reverse migration” reframing elegy as action. The censer’s reweighted meaning at the end turns memorabilia into conduit, not symbol-only. The final darkness delivers earned solace without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers productively about her fate while honoring the cost of the choice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The voice is controlled, lyrical, and character-specific, maintaining consistent focalization. Diction and rhythm modulate well under stress without purple drift. Dialogue is minimal but purposeful, carrying subtext and pressure in a few lines. No head‑hopping or stance slips under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sentences are clean, varied, and purposeful; images often do double duty (e.g., “hiss of stars”). Figurative language is measured and coherent, rarely crowding clarity. Momentum stays taut through build and release. Minimal scaffold or repetition appears, and the final line precisely recharges earlier motifs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis—an orbital archivist using a ritual relic as the anchor for a memory broadcast to the Oort Cloud—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The “reverse migration” angle reimagines exodus with conceptual rigor. Risks in tone and object integration pay off without gimmickry. Emotional truth grounds the speculative frame.</comment>
