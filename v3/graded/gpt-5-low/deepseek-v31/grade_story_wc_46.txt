<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—“to share light without using fire”—is clear, consistent, and actionably resolved by the end. Her tactile, craft-based interiority is specific and embodied (she “weighs its significance, not its mass,” then polishes by feel). Internal conflict is quiet (uncertainty about how to share) rather than oppositional, but it credibly tightens into a decision. The renunciation of torches for a slower, less-recognized offering lands as a modest but earned change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of mist, grotto, glass, and craft densifies to a realization that reweights the premise. Orientation is clean from the opening, and the beats connect causally (find glass → polish → glow → plan). Closure is a Conceptual Repricing/Charged Poise: she chooses a dissemination method that fits her ethic, with a quiet cost (eschewing spectacle for labor and anonymity). The change is on the page without mechanical over-explanation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The serpentine grotto and rolling mist are vivid and integrated; the environment shapes the solution (dimness enables “captured” ambient light and reflective walls amplify it). Sensory detail is economical yet lush across senses (damp stone, sweet night flowers, grey diffusion). The setting charges the final image of soft radiance breathing on rock. Object-as-setting (the sea glass) further anchors the atmosphere into outcome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes concentrate on discovering a non-fire way to share light; pressure is contemplative but coheres. The meaningful tightening is the shift from passive watching to active craft and distribution. Costs are subdued but legible: she rejects torches and embraces slow, unseen work. A stronger external counterforce could heighten tension, but within this mode the escalation reads.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme—light that “listens” versus fire that “shouts”—emerges through action (polishing) and image (held ambient glow), not mere declaration. The grandmother’s “pearl of stillness” reprises in the glass’s internal luminance and in Elara’s final plan. The ending’s quiet gift-economy answer resists moralizing while offering resonance. Sentiment is restrained and earned through particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The lyrical third-person close is steady, with a controlled, sensuous lexicon that fits Elara’s perceptual signature. Rhythm modulates with the meditative craft sequence and lifts at the glow’s reveal without head-hopping. Quoted ancestral wisdom integrates smoothly. No register slips or explanatory overreach dilute the voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is polished, with high information density and minimal scaffolding; images do multiple jobs (the glass as object, symbol, and light-source). Figurative language is consistent and clear; only rare phrases flirt with purple but do not blur sense. Syntax and paragraphing vary to maintain momentum in a quiet scene. The final line recharges prior motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sea-glass as a medium for “listening light” is a fresh inflection on illumination and gift-giving. The combination of coastal grotto craft, ambient capture, and ethical stance feels specific rather than templated. Risks are quiet but coherent, and the closure follows from the piece’s singular logic. Not radically genre-breaking, yet notably original in synthesis and image.</comment>
