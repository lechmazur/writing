<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Silas’s motive—finding the color of sound—drives every choice, culminating in the risky dives and the interpretive leap with the key. His guarded solitude vs. obsessive quest gives him a credible contradiction that tightens at the porthole and the desk. Emotions are embodied through tactile tasks (lighting, polishing, wading, coughing) rather than labels. The change at the end is earned, though the cost remains mostly internal and lightly physical.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Clear causal chain: glow → dive → key → drawer → tube → vows → realization. The closure is a conceptual repricing where “sound” becomes a color of kept promise, tied to concrete acts. Stakes escalate coherently through repeated dives and the sealed drawer; the cost is present (risk, breath, solitude) if understated. Single scene, single POV, no orientation debt; lens holds cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The pier, bioluminescent water, and the drowned library are vivid and functional, not postcarded. The environment constrains tactics (breath limits, forced‑ajar door, sealed drawer) and charges the final image with green‑gold algae. Details are selectively observed through his lamplighter sensibility (glass, wicks, glow). World rules feel consistent without exposition bloat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (his synesthetic quest) is signaled early and tightens via the glowing key’s interpretive turn. Each dive increases pressure and narrows options toward the drawer and tube; the lantern release raises external hush/urgency. The price is mild but legible—physical risk and a rupture of his protective monotony. The resolution flows from his agency rather than coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme coheres: promises as light, art as synesthesia, and the durability of kept vows. The final repricing—color of sound equals the algae’s green‑gold—reweights prior images (lamps, lanterns, glow) with emotional clarity. The inserted vow risks neatness but earns its resonance through the tube’s discovery and timing under the lanterns. No sermonizing; the image carries meaning.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third‑person with a distinct perceptual bias (glass, light, hush); distance stays steady. Diction suits the character and atmosphere without register slips. Rhythm modulates from tranquil to intent during the dives, then widens under the lanterns. No head‑hopping or gratuitous elision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sentences carry multiple jobs—image, action, mood—without padding; momentum is clean. Figurative language (“meteor hush,” “swaying suns”) is precise and not overstacked; no mixed metaphors dull the peak. Micro‑choreography remains purposeful; no looped scaffolding. The final line resolves with an exact image rather than abstraction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—lamplighter, drowned library, bioluminescent promise as the color of sound—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The key’s semiotic turn (“signifier”) is an elegant, non‑gimmicky risk that reframes action. Emotional truth is specific and avoids template romance beats. Slight familiarity in festival lantern imagery is outweighed by the sunken‑vows conceit.</comment>
