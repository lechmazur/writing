<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—visibility as presence rather than person—is specific and consistent, and her tactile competence grounds her. The internal tension between invisibility and the need to make truth visible registers, though it isn’t deeply contested on the page. Her micro‑choices (following the sense memory; deciding to place the box openly) align with motive. The cost of exposure feels hinted rather than dramatized, slightly softening impact.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: blackout → search → tape fragment with sense memory → hidden panel → box → decision to reveal before power returns. The drive lens reads Causal with a clear closing act (placing the cache on the desk) that reconfigures stakes. Closure lands as a resonant decision with conceptual cost. Orientation is crisp early; no lens drift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The shadowed library, crawl spaces, and dawn light aren’t mere décor—they enable stealth, restrict access, and press a time boundary. Sensory precision (iron, dust, lemon candy, tobacco) is filtered through Elara’s lived expertise. The setting charges the final image (box on the main desk, dawn/sparrow) with thematic weight. Environment reliably governs tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: reveal or conceal under a tightening clock as power returns. Escalation arrives via the fragment’s psychic pull and the lights’ flicker, forcing a timely choice. Price is present but subdued (risk to anonymity, exposing a founder’s failure). No antagonist is needed, though pressure could sharpen with a more tangible risk.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of visibility, stewardship, and forgiveness arises from concrete acts, not assertion. The tape’s ghostly memory reframes preservation as ethical revelation, culminating in a non‑literal answer: visibility through action. The founder’s failure and Elara’s penance braid without moralizing. The final sparrow and dawn subtly reprice the prior hush.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The voice is lucid, lyrical, and consistently filtered through Elara’s tactile sensibility; no head‑hopping. Diction fits the character’s patient, subterranean competence. Rhythm modulates with pressure (flicker of lights) without grandstanding. No dialogue needed; the narrative stance remains controlled.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sentences carry multiple jobs—atmosphere, action, motive—without visible scaffold. Occasional elevated phrases (“sapphire hush,” “kindly methodical patience”) read earned and not purple. No paraphrase loops or cadence templates sap momentum. The final line cleanly images the tonal shift without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Crawl‑space archivist + sense memory encoded on ferromagnetic tape is fresh and well‑synthesized. The hidden civic failure reframed as a path to forgiveness feels non‑obvious yet inevitable after discovery. Risk is aesthetic rather than structural and pays off in coherence. The piece avoids template twists and inhabits its premise fully.</comment>
