<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elara’s motive and worldview are vivid and consistent, embodied through tactile gardening tactics and the cracked marbles ritual. Her fear-pride mix under Cederic’s scrutiny surfaces in concrete choices (revealing the artifice, holding the marble up). Internal contradiction is quiet (truth vs necessary lie) but present rather than dramatized as a wrenching struggle. Status dynamics in the brief dialogue are legible and effective.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Single continuous scene with a clean situational lens: daily ritual → intrusion → stance crystallization. The closure is Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she keeps the garden and her ritual, but the cost—ongoing deception under hostile scrutiny—is felt. Orientation is immediate and causality coherent (meter reading prompts confrontation). The cost is understated yet visible in the ongoing maintenance and secrecy.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The maze, wires, dye injections, and mist are sensorially rich and filtered through a gardener’s priorities. The garden-as-stage constrains tactics (concealment, propping, ritual center at the plinth) and charges the final image. World rules (Luck-Meters) integrate smoothly with place. Strong object-as-setting work via the marbles and plinth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (the garden’s survival) is clear early; pressure coheres when Cederic arrives with data-backed austerity. Tightening occurs as she risks exposing the artifice as “proof,” wagering status and credibility. The price is subtle—a continued labor of deception under a numbers regime—but legible. One meaningful turn suffices for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Themes of repair-as-truth, memory vs measurement, and beauty-in-decline emerge through particulars (wires, dye, silvered cracks). A touch of on-the-nose thesis (“The meters measure luck, not knowledge”) slightly blunts subtext, but the final endurance image reweights the premise without moralizing. The cracked marbles reframe breakage as archive. Resonance lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Controlled, lyrical third-person close with a distinct perceptual signature anchored in horticultural tactility. Dialogue rhythms distinguish Cederic’s clipped data-speak from Elara’s leaf-rustle voice. Psychic distance remains stable; no leakage or over-explanations. Cadence modulates effectively at the intrusion and the quiet exit.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is precise and texturally dense without major muddle; images do double duty (marbles as memory and light-caster). Minor recurrence (“blooming withering,” “mended deception”) skirts redundancy but remains motif, not loop. Syntax varies and momentum holds. No significant figurative clashes or register drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Luck quantified as civic ritual meets an artful hospice-gardening ethic; the cracked-marble archive feels fresh. The “beautiful lie” handled as loyalty is a non-obvious synthesis. Quiet, confident risk-taking in a soft-climax structure pays off. A few familiar formulations keep it just shy of startlingly new.</comment>
