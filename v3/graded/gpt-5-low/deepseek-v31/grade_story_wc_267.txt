<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Leo’s motivation—testing the bargain of safety against the loss of voice—grounds every choice, from the seventh‑step ritual to the final refusal “He would not remain.” Interiority is embodied through tactile beats (the bolt’s weight, the handprint fit) and a credible internal contradiction (healing body vs. imprisoned spirit). The final act (silent chord) earns his renunciation. Minor on‑the‑nose phrasing skirts didacticism but doesn’t undercut character truth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single continuous scene with a tight accumulative design: bolt → handprint → realization → bench restoration → silent chord. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid: he refuses to remain and commits to speaking, with the cost of leaving “safety” legible. Orientation is clear early; causality coheres through object recalls. The final sentence reprises the staircase clue to seal conceptual repricing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The cobalt fortress, snow, silent policy, stair geometry, and piano are specific and tactile, filtered through Leo’s bias. The environment functions as constraint (enforced hush; empty, frozen space) and charges the final image (silent chord resonating only through wood and bone). The recurring bolt/rail detail acts as micro‑setting that shapes discovery and action. Rich without feeling touristic or static.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—safety vs. voice—tightens via the found handprint and the warming throat, culminating in “He would not remain.” The pressure escalates texturally: routine → anomaly (handprint) → reinterpreted past → charged action at the piano. Cost is felt (betraying the silent regimen, forfeiting sanctioned safety). No antagonist needed; agency drives the turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Resonance arises from particulars (bolt as “key,” child’s handprint, silent chord) that reweight the fortress’s hush from care to control. However, the thesis line “Safety purchased with suppression was no safety at all” states the moral a bit baldly in the final movement, blunting subtext. Still, the final charged pose (silent music that only he “hears”) carries lingering complexity. Earned insight mostly outpaces the brief didactic flare.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Close third with a distinct, restrained lyricism; diction and rhythm suit the character’s muted state. Perceptual signature is consistent (tactile attention to tools, surfaces, and pressure of silence). No POV leakage or unearned certainty; the voice modulates toward intensity at the climax without breaking register. Clean mechanics support the cadence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is precise, image‑dense, and purposeful; sentences carry multiple jobs with minimal scaffold. A few near‑proverbial lines edge toward abstraction, but most metaphors are grounded and consistent with the physical logic. Rhythm varies, and paragraphing breathes at key turns. No loops or muddle in the closing beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—mute bellhop in a snow‑shrouded fortress reclaiming meaning through a bolt and a ghost song—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Accumulative structure and object recurrence show craft without gimmickry. Risks (quiet stakes, lyric closure) pay off with clarity. Slight thematic over‑statement keeps it just shy of the top band.</comment>
