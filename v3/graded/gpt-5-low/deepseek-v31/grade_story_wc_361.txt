<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Silas’s jitteriness, loyalty to Kael, and buried hunger for wonder are concrete and drive his choices, especially when he decides to raise the pendant. The shift from fear to clarity is motivated by the pendant’s resonance but reads a touch convenient, compressing internal contradiction quickly. Embodied details (fluttering hands, ridgeway exposure) help. The final identity turn feels earned if slightly tidy, with limited visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: delivery → activation → rejection by hermit → Silas chooses to wield the pendant → world reconfigures → spectral convergence → settled aftermath. Closure lands on the page with a decisive change in role and world-state, and the drive lens is causal with a slight accumulative flourish. The cost is primarily conceptual (taking on custodianship; loss of former self), which is felt but not deeply tested. Orientation is crisp; scope fits the length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The aurora-lit ridgeway is vivid, spatially coherent, and purposefully integrated; “when the sky road bleeds colour” ties environment to ignition conditions. The pendant functions as a recurring, charged object that governs the final image and transformation of the setting into a crystal road. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful without turning into a catalog. Constraint is moderate (the ridge’s edge and auroral timing), keeping this just shy of the top band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Pressure tightens meaningfully when the hermit rejects the box and the pendant answers to lineage, forcing Silas to act rather than deliver. The escalation is coherent under the causal lens, and the beam‑through‑wings choice is protagonist‑driven. Cost is implied (responsibility; relinquishing his old identity) but not sharply dramatized, keeping the stakes more spiritual than contested. Still, the internal and external threads mesh at the peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Legacy, wonder wrested from routine, and the permeability between memory and myth emerge from concrete acts, not lecture. The reappearance of Kael as a time‑echo reframes mentorship from absence to inheritance. The last lines verge on declarative (“He was no longer just a courier…”) but the crystalline road image carries the weight. Resonance lingers through the charged transformation rather than moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third‑person limited is steady and confident, with lyric textures that track Silas’s perception under stress. Diction suits the mythic register without register breaks, and the narrative doesn’t claim knowledge beyond Silas’s experience. The brief dialogue is functional and natural. Rhythm and cadence support the set‑piece transformation without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lines carry high information density with fresh images (“hands… like trapped moths,” “violent and beautiful genesis”) and minimal redundancy. A few phrases flirt with purple but remain legible and scene‑serving. Syntax varies and momentum rarely stalls; no scaffold loops or filter‑verb stacks. The final image is cleanly rendered.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The blend of auroral geomancy, a dragonfly key, and a ridgeway turning into a sky road feels distinct and thoughtfully synthesized. Mentor‑legacy is a familiar trope but is re‑energized by the time‑echo encounter and creative world mechanics. Choices arise from established particulars, not late rules. The risk lies in big‑myth payoff within tight scope, largely executed with control.</comment>
