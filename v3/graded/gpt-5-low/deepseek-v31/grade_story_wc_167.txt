<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elian’s motive—restoring meaning to his craft—is clear and textured through his glazier’s sensibility. His frustration and pride create a credible internal contradiction that resolves into renewed commitment. The turn arises from his professional way of seeing, not abstract declaration. The cost is modest (accepting the labor with new stakes) but felt at this length.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Orientation lands cleanly within the first paragraph; the single‑scene arc is coherent. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the ripple observation deepens pressure and reweights the goal. Closure is on‑page: he reframes the task and completes the window as the sun breaks. Cost is conceptual more than punitive, but the before/after is legible and earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The bay, mist, and prism atrium are vivid and filtered through a glazier’s priorities. Setting actively charges the turn (still water enabling ripples) and the final image (sun through the prism atrium). Sensory choices are selective and purposeful, avoiding tourist catalog. Environment materially shapes what he can notice and decide.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recovering purpose) is signaled early and tightens via the ripple epiphany. The escalation is quiet but decisive, consistent with the accumulative lens. Agency drives resolution—he reinterprets method and finishes the work. The price is internal (accepting craft as resonance rather than illustration) and could feel sharper, but it lands.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme coheres: craft as generating ripples of meaning, value in the unseen joinery, perception transforming labor. The recurring images (glass, mist, rings, light) reweight at the end without sermonizing. One line edges toward explicit thesis (“throw a stone into the consciousness…”), slightly reducing subtlety. The final lens‑as‑ring cadence resonates.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The close third voice is controlled, lyrical, and profession‑inflected; diction and imagery suit a glazier’s mind. Rhythm modulates from languor to precise urgency at the end. No head‑hopping or stance wobble. Slight elevation is earned by the character’s perceptual signature.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sentences carry multiple jobs—image, character, and motion—with good rhythm and economy. A few abstract phrases risk purple but are balanced by concrete craft detail. No noticeable loops or scaffold; syntax varies. Final lines land cleanly without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The glazier’s lens on meaning, the prism atrium, and the ripple‑reading insight feel fresh and specific. The turn arises from character‑bound perception rather than a generic epiphany. Risks are controlled and coherent, if not radical. The synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
