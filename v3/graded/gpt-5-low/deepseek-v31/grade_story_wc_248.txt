<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clear, consistent motivation—honoring a dying mentor and protecting the “forgotten promise”—drives concrete choices. Interiority is character‑particular (“volcanic tenderness”) and embodied in tactile acts (making and erasing art). Internal conflict (reveal vs protect) tightens credibly at the door and resolves in an earned renunciation. A touch more friction or fallibility under pressure could deepen the cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: discovery of the vandalized self‑portrait → portrayal trail → door mechanism → choice to witness/erase. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she refuses possession, reseals, and erases the path with visible cost. The drive lens is held without contradiction, and the price is legible on the page. No dangling setups or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The archive is tactile and constraining: pigments, charcoal, etched stone, and the press‑plate wall decisively shape tactics. Details are selective and POV‑filtered, serving both tone and action. The crystal sphere and seed charge the final image and reweight earlier motifs. Clarity and spatial choreography are strong throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around a single dominant stake—protecting the promise—and tightens once at the hidden door. The reversal is internal yet concrete: witness over possession, followed by erasing her own work, which forecloses discovery. Stakes are felt but largely inward; limited external resistance keeps the ceiling just shy of top band. The cost is nonetheless unmistakable and earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: defacement as love, creation as guidance, preservation through erasure. The final acts (not taking the sphere, resealing, erasing) refract the “volcanic tenderness” idea without moralizing. The seed’s image conceptually reprices the whole journey. A hair more moral tangle (public good vs secrecy) on the page could elevate.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lyric yet controlled voice with a distinct perceptual signature; diction matches the character’s analytic‑intuitive bent. Rhythm modulates well from hush to charged poise. No head‑hopping or stance drift, and elision is minimal and purposeful. A slight tendency toward elevated phrasing in places is balanced by specificity and action.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High information density with purposeful images; lines often do double duty (world and theme). Figurative language is vivid but generally disciplined; minimal redundancy. Syntax varies and propels; no scaffold loops or muddled metaphors at the close. A few lush phrases flirt with purple but do not impede clarity or momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: a vandalized self‑portrait as protective cipher; a breadcrumb trail of art that must be erased to preserve the promise. The witness‑not‑possession turn feels inevitable in hindsight. Risks in tone and conceit pay off cleanly. Slight familiarity in the “ancient archive/seed of rebirth” premise is overcome by execution and specificity.</comment>
