<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Clear, urgent motivation and embodied practice (“listening with her fingertips”) feel particular, and her craft reads lived-in. However, internal contradiction is minimal; she is consistently competent and calm, with little ambivalence or mistake under pressure. The visible cost is mostly fatigue and a role shift, credible but light. Her renunciation—becoming “a keeper of this silence”—lands, but without a thorny trade-off on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure concentrates on teaching the stone to release silence, and the “bloom of hush” serves as on‑page RR. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when), and the causal throughline within the lyric mode is intact (ice‑crack method → persuasion of energy → diffusion → hush). Cost is present (exhaustion, altered vocation) though modest; closure is nonetheless legible and satisfying.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The harmonic caves and the echo stone are sensorially vivid and functionally integral; the environment and object constrain tactics and charge the final image (“a new permanent star in the underground firmament”). Detail is filtered through Kaelyn’s professional gaze (ripple-marks, striations, ice‑crack analogs). World rules are taught through action rather than exposition. The setting evolves with events—the hammered stillness softens as the hush blooms.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear (restore the caves’ peace), and tension tightens at the stone’s flare and during the guiding of energy along “paths of the ice-cracks.” Escalation is primarily density and cadence shift rather than overt reversals, appropriate to the chosen lens. The price (effort, responsibility) is felt but not punishing, keeping the pressure strong but gentle. Agency drives the turn; nothing resolves by coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The transformation of chaos into a palpable, nourishing silence emerges through concrete image (“flower opening in reverse time”), not sermon. The final repricing—silence as presence rather than absence—reweights prior material, though one sentence skirts explicit thesis. The recurring craft motif (ice‑cracks) integrates theme and method. Resonance lingers without collapsing into a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Singular, steady lyric voice with clean focalization and confident diction; rhythm modulates with pressure (from “screaming light” to “velvety and complete”). No head‑hopping or register drift; metaphoric field remains coherent (stone/ice/sound/light). Purposeful compression reads legible and earned. The prose’s certainty matches what Kaelyn can infer and feel.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished: image density is high yet mostly purposeful; sentences carry multiple jobs without scaffold. A few lush phrases verge on purple but maintain clarity and propulsion through the peak beat (“flared brightly… diffused”). Syntax varies and paragraphing supports momentum from tension to release. No loops or mixed metaphors dull the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: a mapkeeper translating ice fractals into acoustic stillness to alchemize alien residue feels striking and inevitable in hindsight. The “bloom of hush” and “hammered repose” reframe silence with freshness. Risk‑taking in concept and imagery heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The piece commits fully to its premise and pays it off in a specific, memorable way.</comment>
