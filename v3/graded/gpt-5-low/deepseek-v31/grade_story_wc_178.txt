<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s drive is clear and consistent, rooted in her frugality with observation and devotion to proof. Her mounting frustration and final surrender show credible contradictory impulses under pressure. The change—relinquishing quantification—is earned by the sequence of failures. A slight tidiness to the epiphany keeps it just short of top tier.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The piece follows a clean accumulative lens: repeated rational attempts escalate, then a pattern‑break renunciation reconfigures meaning. Closure lands on‑page with the magic square’s sustained light and the entity’s appearance, and the cost—abandoning her defining method—is legible. Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph. The causal chain is compact and coherent without contrivance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The reimagined ziggurat, plum sky, warm stone, and schematic chamber are vivid and POV‑filtered. The magic square and chamber function as charged environment rather than postcard decor, directly shaping attempts and the ending image. Sensory selection is purposeful and consistent with an astronomer’s gaze. World rules are stable and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around one stake: opening the covenant. The failures via different logical sequences tighten options until surrender becomes the only viable move. The price—renouncing the comfort of quantification—registers at the climax. It’s a quiet arc, but the cadence shift is decisive and earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the magic square’s reweighted meaning: devotion “encrypted” in logic must be translated into presence and silence. The final image offers a resonant answer without needing dialogue. A single explicit line (“some truths are felt, not solved”) nudges toward moralizing and slightly reduces subtext. Overall integration remains strong and sincere.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The third‑person close is steady, with a controlled, lyrical register that fits an empiricist in a ritual space. Diction modulates well from analytical to surrendered hush. No head‑hopping or stance slips, and elision is minimal and legible. Minor flourish never breaks plausibility for this voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is largely tight, musical, and image‑efficient, with strong verb choices and economical syntax. A tiny artifact (“标准”) and a few near‑purple turns momentarily distract. Momentum stays intact; sentences usually do double duty. The final image is clear and unblurred by figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The fusion of a Babylonian ziggurat, a magic square, and an empiricist’s surrender feels fresh and thoughtfully synthesized. The internal pivot from proof to presence is familiar but executed with specificity (sum to fifteen, planetary cycles, schematic walls). The entity’s silent covenant avoids cliché through restraint. Risks are measured and coherent rather than flashy.</comment>
