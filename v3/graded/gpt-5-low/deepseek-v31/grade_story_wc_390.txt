<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Clear motive (protect artifact/place) and a credible trait set (engineer who “feels” the lighthouse) drive on‑page choices. His panic → recalibration beat shows internal contradiction resolving into attentive listening. Interiority stays embodied (hand to stone, bone‑felt wrongness) rather than abstract. Slight neatness at the end—the win lands without a palpable lingering personal cost—keeps it below the top band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lens: Causal. Setup → wrong attempt → environmental backlash → attunement → resolution forms clean because/therefore linkage. Closure is an on‑page Decisive Change: the ice shifts from grinding to rest as the horn’s frequency aligns. Cost is implied risk/near‑failure more than paid-on-page loss, trimming the ceiling.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The drift‑ice marina and skeletal lighthouse are vivid and operationalized: weather, iron, horn, and pilings all pressure tactics. Tools (brass instruments, key, horn) are POV‑filtered and constrain choice. Environmental sound becomes the problem and the solution, charging the final image. Rich sensory range avoids museum‑tour listing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible early; pressure tightens when the “harsh” frequency provokes an external slam. The decisive adaptation comes from listening and fine adjustments, a meaningful deepening rather than brute force. The price is mainly risk and time pressure; no visible sacrifice slightly softens the punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Harmony over coercion emerges through action, not sermon: he must “sing a song the ice would willingly follow.” The final glow on calmed ice reweights prior images without a stated moral. “Sonic absolution” risks overt labeling but is earned by the concrete attunement sequence. Thematic complexity is solid though not daringly ambiguous.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Controlled limited third with a consistent, slightly lyrical register suited to a sensate engineer. Rhythm modulates well at stress peaks, and the perceptual signature (listening through metal and bone) stays distinct. A few elevated coinages brush purple without breaking plausibility. No head‑hopping or stance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong line craft with purposeful images and clean sequencing; sentences generally do multiple jobs. Minor overwriting/echoes (“golden sunset” repeated; “fleshly ethereal” is awkward) and a small typo (“gentlely”) nick polish. Figurative logic holds under pressure. Momentum remains steady with little scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lighthouse‑as‑instrument and “convincing ice to rest” via resonance feels fresh and specific. Engineering fused with mystic acoustics gives an organic twist to the stop‑the‑cataclysm trope. Turns arise from the premise rather than grafted gimmicks. Not radically risky, but confidently singular.</comment>
