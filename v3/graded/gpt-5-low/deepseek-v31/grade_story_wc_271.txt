<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is concrete and embodied—soil, glass, fern, breath—so her motives and coping method read lived-in rather than labeled. Contradictory impulses act in scene: the photo both drags her under and, later, is exhibited and weighted, signaling a costly endurance. Micro‑choices under pressure (unclenching fingers, choosing tactile anchors, turning to water) reveal hierarchy of values. The final Earned Stasis is credibly earned by prior causality and shows visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Situational lens holds: the storm pressure coheres, triggering the PTSD “freeze,” and the on‑page tactics (somatic anchors) produce a resonant, earned refusal. Orientation is clean from the opening (arboretum on a cliff, lighthouse context), and causality tracks through the spike to the measured thaw. Closure lands with cost: smoothing and weighting the photo, then watering as a deliberate cadence shift. No unkept setups or soft resets; options narrow then reconfigure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The arboretum, cliffside glass, and lighthouse beam are vividly integrated and filtered through Elara’s priorities; tactile environment actively shapes tactics (wall against forehead, shelf grain, fern unfurling). Weather pressure interacts with space to affect action and perception. The final image is charged by place (workbench, stone, plants) rather than postcard description. Minor note: the “pearl of stillness” metaphor is strong but not strictly constraining, keeping this just shy of the top band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will she drown in the triggered memory or maintain her hard‑won present—is signaled early and tightens when “thunder” keys the trauma. The decisive deepening occurs at the paralysis and her tactical pivot from the photo to tactile anchors, foreclosing the path of collapse. Costs are felt through bodily seizing and the deliberate, effortful movements toward now. Resolution is earned by endurance and renunciation, not luck.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme—hard optimism built over scars versus empty, mechanized warning—is dramatized by particulars (automated beam vs. tending plants; photo as exhibit). The ending offers a resonant, non‑literal answer: each drop of water as a choice reframes hope as disciplined practice, not sentiment. Subtext hums in the lighthouse image and the “exhibit” gesture without moralizing. Complexity persists: she will freeze again, but the stance is reweighted.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The close third voice is consistent, sensorial, and modulates under pressure with tightened syntax during the freeze and longer, calmer lines in the thaw. Diction fits Elara’s perceptual signature (botanical focus, tactile registers) without register drift. No head‑hopping or unearned omniscience; inference reads as inference. Lyric lift is controlled and purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is clean, rhythmic, and purposeful; sentences carry multiple jobs (setting, emotion, action) with minimal scaffolding. Figurative language (“pearl of stillness,” “stone pulling her down”) is apt and not over‑stacked in peak beats. No loops or synonym churn; progression remains propulsive. Minor density in the opener stays coherent and supports atmosphere.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—trauma management via somatic markers in a cliffside arboretum with an abandoned lighthouse—feels specific and memorable. The drone‑strike wedding memory risks the familiar, but it’s transformed by tactile tactics and the lighthouse’s “empty gesture” counterpoint. The final reconfiguration (exhibit the photo, water as choice) is non‑obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Boldness is quiet rather than flashy, but coherent and organic.</comment>
