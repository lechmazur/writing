<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s motives are precise and consistent: the translator who believes in fragile peace translates a child’s terror into a healing tactic. Key micro-choices—refusing to force Kaito to speak, pocketing the coral, directing surgeons to use its pattern—reveal a believable hierarchy of values. The final state (peace without amnesia) is earned by prior choices. Minor strain from clinical phrasing (“re‑pathway the neural lightning”) slightly cools embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Hybrid with an accumulative/textural dominance: the surgery frame accrues meaning through coral/maze echoes and pays off in a quiet on‑page transformation. Orientation is clean from the first line; the two‑shard structure (OR → memory → awakening) holds. Closure lands as Decisive Change with felt cost (experimental risk; wound remains). Causality is tidy: Kaito’s cast → coral pattern → surgical plan → altered outcome.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is tactile and selective: sterile theatre, bleach clinic, mist‑clad atrium. The environment (atrium display) supplies the crucial resource that alters tactics—the coral fragment—rather than acting as a postcard backdrop. Object‑as‑setting recurs and textures the final meaning, even if not named in the last sentence. Detail stays POV‑biased and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—relief from PTSD—tightens through the experimental procedure whose plan and risks are set by Elara’s earlier choices. Pressure escalates texturally rather than through reversals; the memory beats deepen the cost and need more than they narrow options. The ending’s price (old wound persists, reweighted) is clear, but the on‑page present‑tense pressure is gentle. Effective, not searing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The coral/maze motif reframes trauma as pattern that can be traversed: “every maze has a center. And a way out” earns resonance when the surgery delivers a quieter meaning rather than erasure. Subtext of translation—of language, fear, and neural pathways—integrates cleanly without sermonizing. Thematic complexity holds (hope as risk, not naivete). Slight directness in one whispered line keeps it short of luminous.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Controlled lyrical third‑person with consistent focalization and selective detail; rhythm modulates smoothly from clinical calm to tender memory. One brief line of dialogue is natural and subtextual. Diction occasionally tilts clinical, but the voice remains coherent to Elara’s world. No head‑hopping or unearned omniscience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sentences carry layered work—image, motion, theme—without drag; no scaffold or synonym loops. Figurative language is apt (maze, brain coral), with minimal mixed metaphors. A few clinical phrases are slightly prosy but do not blunt the closure image. Line‑level control supports momentum and quiet charge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Translating a child’s cast into a neurosurgical key via brain coral is an elegant, specific synthesis. The risk‑laden, non‑erasing cure rethinks trauma narratives. Choices feel inevitable in hindsight and grow from concrete particulars. Bold without gimmickry.</comment>
