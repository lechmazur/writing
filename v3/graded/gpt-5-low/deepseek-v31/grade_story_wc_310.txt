<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Alaric’s motive—preserve a single frequency with integrity—drives each micro‑choice, from handling the coins to rejecting the “peace” coin after the backwards prophecy. Interiority is specific (the coins’ tactility; the shard biting into his palm) and his doubt actively reshapes tactics. The contradiction between quiet enthusiasm and desperate focus lands credibly under pressure. Visible cost arrives as renunciation of safety (peace) and the painful, risky self‑insertion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Situational lens holds: the coherent pressure of an irreversible, singular choice tightens when the backwards prophecy forecloses the “peace” path. The turn from casting a coin to feeding his own intention constitutes a decisive change with conceptual and felt cost. Orientation is clean from the first paragraph, and the final image (“the universe breathing in”) closes the causal arc. No step relies on a late rule change; costs are legible on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The “ambered observatory deck,” crystal viewport, and the collapsed sphere provide a vivid, selective atmosphere aligned to the decision’s cosmic scale. The coin collection functions as micro‑setting, charging the final image through the obsidian shard. While the environment doesn’t strictly constrain movement, it consistently shapes tone and focus. World rules are delivered through action (static bursts, frequency) rather than expository dumps.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear early: choose a single note for the next universe. Escalation tightens at the prophecy reversal, converting a seemingly virtuous option into an existential trap, forcing a harder, riskier choice. The final act—offering his own resonant frequency—pays a cost and forecloses other paths. Tension coheres at sentence and beat scales without detours.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: struggle vs. stagnation, doubt as catalyst, and agency over pre‑ordained purpose. The backwards prophecy reweights “peace,” refusing simplistic morals. A slight explicitness in the line about aligning with the “truth of choice itself” edges toward statement but remains earned by the scene. The closing breath invites reflection without sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent with the fable‑cosmic register, with clean focalization tied to Alaric’s perceptions. Rhythmic modulation supports pressure shifts (quiet handling of coins → frantic sift → still, final offer). No head‑hopping or stance slippage. Elevated diction feels character‑apt and steady under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lines are tight and purposeful; images carry dual duty (coins as history and choice). Minor abstract recurrence (“frequency,” “static”) is patterned and functional rather than purple. Syntax varies, and the final line is clean, resonant, and earned. No loops or mechanical scaffolding dull the climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The coins-as-cosmos interface and the backwards prophecy create a fresh angle on cosmic rebirth. The pivot from “peace” to chosen struggle is non‑obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Risks (mythic diction, conceptual stakes) are integrated rather than gimmicky. While the premise nods to classic cosmic chooser tales, execution feels particular and vivid.</comment>
