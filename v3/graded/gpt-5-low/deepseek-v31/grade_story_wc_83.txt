<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Kaelen’s hollow ache from surviving a drone‑struck wedding drives every move, and the terror/euphoria mix during the awakening shows contradictory impulses in scene. His hunt for “unused potential” manifests in concrete micro‑choices (dropping the geode, moving through corridors, choosing to permeate the mirror). The final renunciation/embrace—becoming a “variable” with cost that does not erase his trauma—feels earned. A relational crucible is absent, but not needed at this scope.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens is clear: a small perturbation triggers new perception → hunt → mirror choice → machine reconfigured. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the telescope’s parameters are altered, with the cost that his scar remains and his agency now carries consequence. Orientation is crisp from the first lines (who/where/when), and the circuit‑breaker clock pinches the window. The cost is more conceptual than visceral, but legible in the charged final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The floating observatory is tactile and purposeful (ozone, capacitors, mirror chamber); the mirror and cooling cycle constrain timing and choice. The environment directly charges the ending: the telescope “refocuses” on unused potential. Details are POV‑filtered by the new sense (stress points, heat ghosts), integrating world rules through perception. Economy stays tight with no postcard excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding a locus of potential—is signaled early and escalates as the silence deepens and perception widens. The key tightening is the time pressure of cooling breakers and the shift from seeing to choosing to permeate the mirror. Cost registers as accepting the permanent scar within the pool and altering a vast instrument without a safety net. The pressure is internal and lyric, but coherent and rising under the chosen lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perturbation theory refracts into a thematic inquiry about small deviations reweighting lives; the geode’s opacity/knowing and the mirror’s potential pool evolve this idea. The final image reprices the premise: he guides a machine to seek “unused potential,” a moral stance born from loss without tidy consolation. Subtext of survivor’s guilt threads through images (heat ghosts, screaming static) rather than declaration. No sermonizing; resonance lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent with Kaelen’s heightened state; diction and rhythm modulate as pressure builds. POV boundaries hold; certainty expands only as his perception plausibly shifts. Patterned metaphors align to electricity/structure/frequency, maintaining a distinct perceptual signature. No dialogue needed; compression serves the mode.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sentences carry momentum with purposeful variation; most lines do double duty (world + psyche). Figurative density is high but coherent to the motif; few, if any, paraphrase loops. Occasional elevated phrasing (“intangibly tangible”) risks purplish hue but remains thematically keyed and clear. Final beats land cleanly without scaffolding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: perturbation theory as spiritual aperture in a sci‑fi observatory, with a geode as personal micro‑cosm. The ending avoids spectacle for a conceptual turn that feels inevitable in hindsight. Risks a high‑lyric register and lands it with clarity. Not derivative of common templates despite familiar components.</comment>
