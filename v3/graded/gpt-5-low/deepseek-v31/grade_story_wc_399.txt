<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear, specific motive (“preserve the echo”) drives concrete tactics; agency is steady and competent. Interiority is filtered through craft (peripheral vision, tactile link to the parapet) rather than label-speak. Status dynamics with the prophet are legible through dialogue and stance. Minor ding: little contradictory impulse or visible emotional cost beyond urgency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: waiting → spotting clearing → consecration → prophet pressure → parapet distraction → sealing the pearl. Orientation and rules are taught through action early and pay off. Closure lands on page with a preserved vessel and an implied cost (only a shard saved as the prophet’s “truth” approaches). Cost is felt conceptually more than viscerally, keeping it just short of exceptional.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and functional: the murmuring pavilion and dunes’ kinetic parapet shape options and enable the decisive tactic. Sensory choices support the calm/pressure contrast without cataloging. World rules feel consistent and are learned through use. Strong constraint link elevates beyond mere atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early and tightens when the prophet’s presence threatens collapse. The Line Walker’s tactical shift (triggering the parapet) creates a clear narrowing of options to complete the ritual. Stakes remain contained but coherent. The on‑page price is subtle, mostly as risk and the acceptance of preserving only an echo.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Themes of loud, absolutist truth vs. quiet, plural wisdom emerge through concrete acts (consecration as “libraries for feelings”). The final image reweights the premise with the pearl of whispers preserved underground. Some lines state the thesis a touch baldly (“Feelings change. Truth does not.”), slightly diluting subtext. Still, resonance lingers without a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Controlled third-person with a distinct perceptual signature (soft focus, edge-sight) and measured lyricism. Dialogue distinguishes voices and advances pressure with subtextual status. No head-hopping or stance drift. Minor flourish at times, but cadence remains purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High information density with clean syntax; images do multiple jobs (e.g., “whisperfield,” “kinetic parapet”). Figurative language is consistent and supports world logic; momentum rarely stalls. Slight purple edges do not blur clarity or causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: peripheral observation magic, kinetic dune engine, and consecrated clearings feel fresh and cohesive. The prophet vs. whisper motif avoids cliché by dramatizing through mechanism and tactic. Risks are controlled and payoff is earned. Not radically reinventive, but notably original.</comment>
