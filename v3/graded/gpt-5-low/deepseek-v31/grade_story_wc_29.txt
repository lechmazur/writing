<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Aris’s cautious hope versus her decision to break protocol creates credible internal tension, and her embodied work (fingers on charts, exhaustion) grounds motive under pressure. The choice to “interfere” aligns with her suspicion-driven drive to outwit manipulators. Cost is present but light—professional/ethical breach and battered hope rather than a sharper personal loss. Leo’s role appropriately supports rather than dilutes her agency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clear causal chain: anomalous signal → discovery of subsonic carrier → decision to craft canceling wave → broadcast → crowds’ confusion and signal’s collapse. Orientation is precise from the outset, and the single-scene build lands a Decisive Change with an Earned Stasis flavor in the aftermath. The cost is implied more than dramatized, but the before/after is legible and felt. Drive lens reads as Causal and holds through closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The university radio station is tactile (ozone, old coffee, humming consoles) and functionally shapes tactics—the array becomes the means of the counter-attack. The astronomical charts filter perception and reprise in the final image, charging the ending. Technical details are used sparingly but plausibly to guide action. The environment constrains and enables rather than serving as backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—protecting communal agency—tightens as crowds polarize on the quad while Aris programs the sequence. The reversal is her protocol-breaking broadcast, which narrows ethical options and carries a modest on-page cost. Escalation is coherent and protagonist-driven without coincidence resolving the core problem. A clearer price (e.g., institutional fallout) would raise pressure further.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: vigilance against seductive patterns, ethics of interference, and the politics of belief. The ending’s reweighted charts and “ether was watching” provide a resonant conceptual repricing without moralizing. Subtext around manipulation and agency hums beneath the plot and dovetails with the tone. No thesis-stating; insight is earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a distinct texture—measured, technical yet lyrical—matching Aris’s mindset. Diction stays inside her plausible lexicon; no head-hopping or unearned omniscience. Rhythmic modulation at peak pressure (programming/broadcast) adds urgency without opacity. A few elevated turns verge on purple but remain controlled.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Sentences carry multiple jobs—setting, motive, and momentum—with minimal scaffolding. Imagery (“tapestry of human curiosity,” “antidote of noise”) is vivid and mostly precise. Minor lushness does not slow clarity or causality, and no paraphrase loops or template cadences drag the beat. Final lines land cleanly with charged specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The premise—countering a mathematically elegant alien lure via subsonic cancellation—freshens first-contact tropes. “Ethereal grit” as stance and the radio-station micro-setting sharpen distinctiveness. Turns feel earned from character logic rather than gimmick. Not radical, but confidently integrated and memorable.</comment>
