<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—witnessing loss yet compelled to seek the paths that endure—is specific, embodied in the tapping habit and the reef memories. Her micro-choices (cross‑referencing data, assembling a kit, undertaking the voyage) align cleanly with that drive. The internal contradiction (moored to grief, drawn toward hope) is credible and pays off in the final charged poise. Slight softness remains in the lack of resistance or error under pressure, keeping the arc a touch friction‑light.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the pattern of data‑bound vigilance → anomaly → journey → reef discovery produces a slow cadence shift culminating in a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is crisp early; causality is clean from atlas page to field deployment. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing with felt cost (acknowledging irreversible loss while accepting a smaller living refuge). The absence of a sharper on‑page obstacle keeps it below the top band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The station, post‑ban seascape, and hydrologic peculiarity are vivid and filtered through a working oceanographer’s eye. Environment supplies the inciting object (atlas jammed in a sensor) and resources, and the final mask‑tap image is physically situated in the water. While setting shapes possibility, it rarely constrains choice under pressure. Sensory balance and world logic are strong without postcard excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (can hope be responsibly reclaimed) is signaled and steadily deepened: the atlas anomaly tightens from curiosity to mission. The meaningful tightening occurs when she reframes the site as a refuge and commits to the field excursion. Cost is emotional and conceptual rather than tactical; no external resistance tests her resolve, tempering escalation. Still, the internal/external weave lands via the living reef revelation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme coheres through concrete particulars—the tapping, the atlas shard, the post‑ban world—toward a nuanced view that healing is a continuum, not an event. The final image reweights earlier material without moralizing, holding grief and endurance together. Occasional declarative lines (“a species trying to correct its course”) flirt with thesis but stay anchored in scene. Subtext accrues through motifs of paths, currents, and refusal to vanish.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The lyrical, sea‑calibrated voice is consistent, with rhythmic control that tightens during research and softens in the closing dive image. Perceptual signature (oceanographic attention, tide‑pattern tapping) feels specific. No head‑hopping or register slips; elision is purposeful. A couple of coined phrases (“periodically eternal”) risk preciousness but remain voice‑motivated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Sentences carry multiple jobs with clean momentum; images (“ghostly white skeletons,” “a punishment and a promise”) are largely sharp. Minimal scaffolding and no paraphrase loops; transitions are efficient. A few intensifiers and paradoxes edge toward purple but don’t blur sense. The final line resolves with a clear, charged image tied to prior motifs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The premise—post‑ban oceanographer decoding an atlas fragment to a climate refuge—feels fresh and integrated. The clue lodged in a sensor housing is a striking, specific turn rather than a generic MacGuffin. Emotional synthesis (witness vs. hope) reads authentic. Originality is strong if not radical, held back only by low overt resistance.</comment>
