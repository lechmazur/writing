<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—decoding growth in the “silent spaces”—is specific and drives her micro‑choices from handling the shard to the decision to testify. Interiority is embodied (heart hammering, the hush, the shock at the shard’s effect) and consistent with a reticent scholar pushed into speech. The turn to testify is earned by the chandelier’s revealed function and her long obsession. The cost is mostly vulnerability rather than loss, but it’s felt on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, sound‑memories intensify toward a conceptual repricing: the library reconfigured from tomb to seed vault, charged through action. Orientation is clean and the sequence of shard discovery → cascade of voices → climb → testimony holds. Closure lands with on‑page testimony and a witness (the janitor) as proof of impact, with emotional cost. Minor softness: wider-world stakes stay implied rather than tested, but the local closure is solid.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The shadowed library and chandelier are vivid, sensorially layered, and crucial as tools that enable and constrain action; the shard and fixture literally shape tactics and the final image. World rules (sonic capture) are learned through interaction, not exposition dumps. The environment mirrors and pressures the internal arc (hush → charged resonance). The final tableau—scholar, chandelier, janitor—leans on the space to carry meaning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: will she remain a silent observer or risk public testimony that redefines meaning’s “growth.” Escalation is clear: discovery → overwhelming sequences → choice to ascend and speak, with a small but real audience registering consequence. The cost is primarily reputational and psychic; no alternative path is explicitly foreclosed beyond continued isolation. One decisive tightening lands via her climb and address rather than multiple reversals, which suits the length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Themes of living language and communal memory arise from concrete images (voices fossilized in crystal) and are reweighted at the end through testimony and witnessed reception. Some lines verge on thesis‑speak (“She had to testify… make them hear”), slightly flattening subtext in the final third. Still, the chandelier’s sonic archive offers an earned, resonant answer to the central question. The closing image sustains reflection beyond the scene.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The voice is controlled and lyrical without losing clarity, with a distinct perceptual bias (sound as meaning) that tightens under pressure. POV remains stable, modest in knowledge, and uses inference rather than omniscience; dialogue is minimal and purposeful via echo. Rhythmic modulation supports the turn from hush to chorus. No head‑hopping or register slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and carries momentum; images do multiple jobs and stay coherent to the sound/light motif. Figurative language is dense but mostly precise and purposeful; no muddling at the climax. Minimal scaffolding and no paraphrase loops slow the read. Diction is clean and proofed.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The chandelier as an acoustic archive reframes library tropes with a fresh, sensuous logic, and the “last dictionary” premise avoids gimmickry by tying to character need. The fractured‑sequence mechanic is imaginative and integrated with the choice to testify. Emotional truth—earned vulnerability—grounds the high concept. Risks are coherent and pay off without obscuring clarity.</comment>
