<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is crisp and coherent—repairing a ruptured bond through completing the translation—and her “cautious exuberance” manifests in embodied, character‑particular action (tilting the flawed inkwell). The careful/reckless contradiction operates in scene rather than label‑only. Interiority remains specific to her linguistic mindset. The reconciliation at the end feels earned by prior choices, though the felt cost is understated.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Under a causal lens, the sequence is clean: stuck translation → hunch with the cracked inkwell → sigil revealed → conceptual key (“to witness”) → completion → silent reconciliation. Closure lands as a Decisive Change in knowledge plus a Charged Poise in the relationship. The price—risk of permanent silence—is present but lightly dramatized on the page. Orientation is immediate and stable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The Archive’s hush, dawn light, and the inkwell as micro‑setting are integrated with action and meaning; the environment literally enables the discovery via refraction down to the “vow” sigil. Sensory choices feel filtered through an arcane linguist’s priorities. The inkwell returns in the final image to charge the ending. World rules remain consistent without exposition drag.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clear (finish together or lose the relationship), and pressure coheres, but escalation is subtle: the primary tightening arrives at the light‑through‑flaw discovery. The agency beat (her “carefully reckless” tilt) credibly triggers the turn. The cost side is more implied than pressed, so tension never quite bites. Still, the knowledge shift narrows options decisively.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Promises, vows, and witnessing refract the thematic line about trust and truth without overt moralizing. The “dirge” reinterpreted as testimony reweights earlier material and links the intellectual puzzle to the emotional pact. The glass flaw becoming a conduit for truth deepens the theme. A touch of explicative phrasing (“This was it.”) trims some subtlety.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The third‑person close is steady, with diction and rhythm suiting a meticulous scholar under pressure. Voice carries a distinct perceptual signature (grammar as promise, syntax as weave) and modulates cleanly into the final quiet. No head‑hopping; elision is minimal and legible. Lyric flourishes remain controlled.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lines are precise and propulsive with strong verbs and purposeful images; the prose earns its lyricism. Occasional repetitions (“symphony of truth,” echoed) are thematic rather than redundant. No significant scaffold or filter‑verb stacks slow momentum. Minor intensifiers could be trimmed, but clarity remains high.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Linguistic method as “interconnected promises” and the cracked inkwell refracting a sigil feel fresh and specific, elevating a familiar reconciliation frame. The “to witness” turn integrates craft and emotion with neat inevitability. The overall pattern is elegant rather than radical. Risk is moderate but coherent.</comment>
