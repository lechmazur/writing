<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Viola’s drive (truth-seeking) and flaw (intellectualizing under pressure) are specific and embodied—the metallic taste, the pen nib’s weight, the telescope as “judge.” Her internal contradiction (profit/expediency vs. truth) operates simultaneously and culminates in an earned renunciation with visible cost (boring page‑five corrective). Minor safety lies in how smoothly rational the decisioning is; struggle remains largely conceptual.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Single scene, clear causal chain: proposition → logical test → realization that inaction equals assent → decisive intervention. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Decisive Change with conceptual cost; the “page five” choice forecloses sensationalism and potential power. Orientation is clean from the first lines, and the lens (causal with situational pressure) holds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The observatory’s echoing dome, telescope, and clouds create a charged, coherent atmosphere that mirrors the moral calculus without feeling pasted on. The rosewood nib functions as micro‑setting and returns to charge the final act. While the environment doesn’t materially constrain options, it meaningfully frames them and fuels the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth vs. profitable lie) is tight, with one solid tightening: recognizing that “to do nothing was to assent,” which forces an active countermeasure. The price—eschewing spectacle and courting dullness—is legible and binds to her legacy. Escalation is internal but coherent and consequential.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The motif of astronomy (“orbits of regret,” black holes, aphelion/perihelion) integrates theme and culminates in a resonant quiet action. A couple of lines verge on thesis (“It was the only way. The truth… was the ultimate intervention.”), edging toward moralizing, but the ending image largely earns its weight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Controlled, character‑specific elevated diction suits a patrician heiress in an observatory; the rhythmic confidence holds under pressure. The perceptual signature—logical, celestial metaphors—remains consistent. No head‑hopping or stance slippage; elision is minimal and purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is tight and vivid, with layered images doing double duty; the astronomical metaphors are coherent rather than mixed. Slight density pressure from repeated gravitational imagery risks purple but mostly serves pattern and momentum. No visible scaffold or loops; final cadence lands cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The hybrid of newsroom ethics and celestial logic (proof by contradiction in an observatory) feels fresh and integrated. The quiet corrective column as climax is a non‑obvious, principled move. Not revolutionary, but confidently singular in texture and frame.</comment>
