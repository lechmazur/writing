<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Aelia’s motive—to heal the land by rallying the settlers—is clear and consistent, and her nightly draining effort embodies real cost. Interiority is present but largely summarized; we get little contradictory impulse beyond care versus depletion. Her decisive shift (revealing herself at the arch) is motivated and earned, though internal conflict at the moment of risk could be sharper. Secondary characters are collective and off‑page, limiting relational crucible pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Hybrid with an accumulative texture leading to a causal reveal: nightly instructions → map → communal viewing → manifestation and reweighting. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: the settlers’ role reframes from obedience to partnership with visible emotional cost (frayed faith, Aelia’s depletion). Orientation is clean from the first paragraph; no lens ambiguity. Slight softness in on‑page price at the end keeps it shy of the top band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The orchard planet with floating arches, dew‑chiming bell, and chalked sidewalks is vivid and purposeful. Environment and objects constrain tactics: dew enables the bell’s honesty, the deserted paths permit chalk instructions, the highest arch dictates the climactic vantage. Sensory detail is selective and tied to stakes. World rules stay consistent and are learned via action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (heal the blight by preserving trust) is established early and tightens as faith frays. The meaningful deepening arrives with the map and “Look Up,” changing knowledge and restoring cohesion. Aelia’s agency drives every turn, though the explicit price of manifesting (beyond prior depletion) could be sharper. Tension coheres without contrivance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of trust, partnership, and ecological interdependence emerges through actions and images rather than moralizing. The bell’s honesty, the chalk orders, and the nebula’s healing reframe obedience into co‑creation. The final image reweights prior steps and avoids neat sermonizing. Complexity is present—their efforts were necessary but incomplete—without heavy didacticism.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The lyrical third‑person closely tracks Aelia with consistent stance and controlled rhythm. Diction is apt for a planetary warden and remains stable; no head‑hopping or register drift. Cadence modulates well at the climax with a calm, luminous hush. No dialogue is needed or missed.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lines carry high information density with clean syntax and varied sentence rhythm. Occasional lushness (“velvety cobalt,” “tapestry of cultivated life”) skirts purple but remains purposeful and coherent. Minimal repetition and no scaffold loops. The final paragraph resolves by image without explanatory drag.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—an altruistic planetary warden using a dew‑chimed bell and chalk to orchestrate a communal cure via a nebular alignment—feels fresh and specific. Turns are earned from earlier particulars, not late rule changes. The imagery avoids genre clichés and commits to a singular vision. Risk is measured and coherent, heightening rather than obscuring clarity.</comment>
