<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Felix’s motivation is clean and consistent—save the commuters from being “unwritten”—and his occupational confidence reads credibly under pressure. The resilient positivity is dramatized (steadying the crowd, choosing hope as signal) rather than merely labeled. However, internal contradiction is light; he rarely struggles or pays an emotional price on the page beyond the closing awareness. The endurance at the end (keeper of the threshold) lands, but the cost could be sharper.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Clear causal chain: rupture → recognition of timelines → hourglass+radio tactic → call to converge → merge → afterimage of cost. Orientation is established early and the single-scene structure is well contained. Closure lands with a decisive change plus conceptual repricing (“permanent transient tone”). The only soft spot is the relative ease of the merge, which slightly attenuates perceived cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The spectral grotto and city/water contrasts are vivid and purposeful, filtered through a deckhand’s sensibility (waves vs. a shudder “through the fabric of reality”). The hourglass and radio act as micro-setting objects that shape tactic and closure. Environmental rules stay consistent and integrate with action (overlapping ferries, starlight cavern). Descriptive lushness is mostly disciplined and supports tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prevent unwriting) is clear and escalates coherently as commuters fade and overlapping ferries intensify. The meaningful tightening is Felix choosing a risky, nonstandard tactic—broadcasting to the vessel across “the static hiss between seconds.” Yet the path contains few setbacks or tradeoffs, and the price is largely conceptual at the end rather than felt mid-crisis. Agency drives the turn, but cost on the peak beat is muted.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Resonant theme—permanence vs. transience, duty as a threshold-keeping act—emerges from concrete particulars (ferry routines, passengers’ moments) and the charged hourglass. The final image reweights the premise without moralizing, though the sentence “all moments are simultaneous and fragile” approaches explicit statement. The ferry-as-constant/people-as-transient motif is integrated and earned. Subtext of vocation as quiet heroism lands.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a lyrical but grounded maritime lexicon; the perceptual signature (patterns of routes, bolts, lines) feels character-specific. Diction stays controlled and modulates with pressure; the brief dialogue is functional and in character. No head-hopping or stance slippage. A few elevated turns risk purple but remain legible and voice-justified.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong: varied sentence rhythm, high information density, and purposeful images. Occasional stacked metaphors (“cavern of impossible dimensions,” “captured starlight,” “luminous web”) flirt with excess but preserve clarity and momentum. Minimal scaffolding or loops; transitions track cleanly. The final cadence is crisp and image-driven.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The blend of nautical routine with cosmic time shear, plus addressing the “concept of the vessel” via radio and using an empty hourglass as an anchor, feels fresh and integrated. The tactic grows from the established world and Felix’s temperament rather than arbitrary rule-dropping. The reconfiguration to “permanent transient” is a strong, specific after-taste. Slightly low struggle prevents it from vaulting higher, but the vision is distinctive.</comment>
