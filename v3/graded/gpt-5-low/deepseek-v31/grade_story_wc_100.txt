<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Silas’s motive—“to give rest a permanent address”—is clear and enacted through specific choices from prep to installation. His weariness versus iron resolve creates a modest but credible inner tension without melodrama. The grandfather’s silent presence focuses his values under pressure. The change at the end (earned stillness) feels credible though the on‑page cost is more spiritual than bodily.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: package → dive → discovery → task → lens installed → release. Orientation is prompt and steady, with a single scene drive and coherent stakes. Closure lands on the page (the light activates; the grandfather dissolves) with a felt conceptual cost (transforming distress into welcome and ceding the role). Pressure is gentle but sufficient for this scale.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The underwater library is richly specific (“Georgian columns entwined with slow‑dancing kelp,” books breathing ink) and learned through action. Environment and object constrain choice (the dome housing; the lens’s imperfect fit) and directly charge the final image. Sensory balance and selective detail reflect the POV’s professional bias toward order and rest. World rules are consistent within the magical premise.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes are legible early and deepen upon the silent request to restore the beacon. Escalation is primarily procedural and imagistic rather than oppositional, but the decisive act—mounting a broken lens—narrows options and tests his commitment. The cost is understated; risk and exertion are implied rather than dramatized. The single tightening suffices at this length though a sharper dilemma would elevate pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme coheres: transforming distress into welcome, giving the dead a “permanent address,” and reframing duty as peace. The broken lens becomes a moral calculus about sufficiency and repair; the final light reweights prior material without sermonizing. The grandfather’s release delivers a resonant non‑literal answer to the question of rest. Ambiguity lingers in the cost of keeping such a beacon lit beyond the scene, in a good way.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Controlled, lyrical third‑person with a distinct perceptual signature grounded in Silas’s occupation and temperament. Diction, cadence, and image density modulate appropriately from preparation to underwater hush to prismatic closure. No head‑hopping or stance leakage; purposeful compression remains legible. The lyric register is elevated but consistent with the mythic premise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentences carry multiple jobs (image, mood, action) with minimal scaffold and clean sequencing. Figurative language is frequent but coherent and not mixed; rhythm varies and avoids template cadences. A few high‑tone phrases flirt with purple but do not obscure causality or the closing image. Overall, density sustains momentum without drag.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The fusion of undertaker ethos with an underwater library and a broken lighthouse lens feels fresh and thematically integrated. The turn from warning to welcome is non‑obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Risks are aesthetic rather than structural, executed with confidence. Echoes of mythic fabulism exist but the synthesis feels singular.</comment>
