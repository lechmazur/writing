<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara’s motives are clear and coherent: avoidance born of shame gives way to a deliberate confrontation with her failure. Interiority is specific (the book as “heavier than she remembered,” the bodily pacing) and choices track to pressure. The internal contradiction—yearning for solitude vs. need to reengage—is dramatized in concrete actions (hiding the invitation, then going). The final renunciation (rejoining without surrendering self-definition) feels earned with a subtle, credible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Under a situational/accumulative lens, the sequence is clean: invitation → threshold crossing → direct engagement with the failed theorem → repricing of meaning. Orientation is solid early; the secret library reveal is motivated and legible. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/CR with an on‑page stance shift and cost. The causal chain is simple but sufficient for the scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The cottage, shop, hidden panel, and soaring library are vivid and filtered through Elara’s sensibility, not a tourist list. Setting actively shapes action (secret door mechanics; the carrel as a crucible; the exact section housing her failure). The environment charges the final choice by making the confrontation possible and contained within a ritual hush. Details are purposeful and consistent with tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes are internal but coherent: reclaiming agency over a humiliating error. Pressure tightens once meaningfully as she moves from avoidance to direct contact with the incriminating chapter and discovers the nested paradox. The price—foreclosing self‑exile and accepting ongoing public memory of error—registers, though it remains understated. No extraneous reversals; escalation is modest but real.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Themes of failure-as-structure, self-definition vs. external judgment, and coexistence (“staying while leaving”) arise from action and image, not sermonizing. The “nested paradox” reframes both the theorem and her life stance with elegant symmetry. The final walk “into the new night” offers a resonant answer without flattening ambiguity. A slightly on-the-nose line names her method, but it’s supported by prior beats.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third‑person limited holds steady with a controlled, lyrical register matching Elara’s temperament. Rhythm modulates well from hush to slight quickening and back. Diction is consistent and character‑plausible; no head‑hopping or unmotivated stance shifts. The voice’s quiet confidence suits the reflective pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sentences are clean, economical, and carry multiple jobs; imagery is precise without purple excess. A few elevated phrases recur (“enlarged tranquility”) but feel motif‑driven rather than redundant scaffolding. Momentum holds through reflection by anchoring to concrete objects and actions. No notable cadence templates or figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The secret library and prodigy‑in‑exile frame are familiar, but the “beautiful failure” reframing and coexistence credo add freshness. Specifics (pressure point on a whorl, carrel wear, glimmering books) avoid generic fantasy gloss. The conceptual symmetry between paradox structure and life stance is elegant, if not radical. Overall, refined more than groundbreaking.</comment>
