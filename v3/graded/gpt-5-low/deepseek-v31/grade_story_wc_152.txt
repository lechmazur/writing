<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s motive and method are crisply defined—she refuses to hand over a damning chart and instead chooses a subtler, risk‑aware guidance. Her composure under pressure shows character‑specific competence, and the “foolishness as cover” trait informs action. Kaelen’s status shift from arrogant to teachable is legible and earned. Slightly limited internal contradiction for Elara keeps it shy of top tier.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Single continuous scene with clear anchors and a coherent causal chain: coup pressure → Kaelen’s plea → Elara’s strategic alternative → Kaelen adopts a plan. Closure lands as a Charged Poise: he leaves with a specific tactic and a reconfigured understanding of power, while Elara recommits to her hidden stance. Cost is implied (risk, secrecy), not fully paid on the page, tempering the impact. Lens reads Hybrid (situational pressure with causal instruction) and holds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is rich and purposeful: the Cobalt Observatory, autumn chill, and the eternal candle’s unique light directly shape the tactic and vision. The flame functions as a tool and teaching device, not mere décor, and charges the final image as she returns to stitch. Sensory selection aligns with Elara’s professional eye. Minor restraint on environmental constraint prevents a 9+.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (thwart the coup without exposure) is clear and tightens when Elara forbids the direct chart and prescribes a desynchronizing gambit. The shift from confrontation to manipulating a weak link is a meaningful deepening that narrows options credibly. The price remains mostly conceptual on the page, but tension is sustained. No contrivance or coincidence resolves the problem.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Listening over force, “what light touches rather than its source,” and synchronization/desynchronization coherently dramatize a theme of subtle power and pattern literacy. The ending reweights prior material as Kaelen’s perception transforms, avoiding moralizing. A touch of explicit instruction in Elara’s counsel trims the lingering ambiguity, but subtext remains active.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The voice is lyrical yet controlled, filtered through Elara’s perceptual bias; diction and rhythm fit the observatory and her craft. Dialogue carries subtext and action—she teaches while concealing; he pivots from demand to understanding. No head‑hopping or stance slips. A few elevated turns flirt with purple but remain purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is tight, vivid, and economical with layered images doing multiple jobs (flame as illumination, oracle, and strategy). Minimal redundancy and good sentence variety sustain momentum. Occasional intensified modifiers are well‑placed; nothing obscures sense or causality. The final line lands cleanly without scaffolding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The embroidery‑as‑intelligence and candle‑shadow pedagogy feel fresh and integrated, transforming familiar court‑coup material. The “adjacent possibilities” frame is applied tactically rather than as a mere flourish. Risks are measured and coherent with world logic. Slight genre familiarity in the court intrigue frame keeps it short of revelatory.</comment>
