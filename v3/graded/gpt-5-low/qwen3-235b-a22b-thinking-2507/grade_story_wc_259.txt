<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara’s motive is clear and pressure-tested: risk self-erasure to purify nostalgia. Interiority is embodied and specific (dust on the tongue, jagged steps, claps) with credible contradictory impulses—she feels the pull of memory yet denies narrative. Micro-choices under stress reveal values and cost. Slight idealization of competence is tempered by palpable struggle and trembling.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single-scene spine, clean orientation, and a held Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through cadence disruption and sensory density. The closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: success via refusal of pattern, with visible cost (anguished joy, heavied veil). Causality is coherent—her tactic elicits the pagoda’s softening and stabilizes the atoms. The before/after is legible without mechanical overwrap.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The archive and bronze pagoda are vividly realized and filter through Elara’s priorities. The environment and object constrain tactics (weaving through shelves, circling the pagoda unpredictably), and the pagoda’s behavior charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful beyond the visual. World rules are learned through action rather than expository dump.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—purify without being consumed—is clear and escalates as memories intensify, forcing adaptive tactics. The tightening is driven by agency: breaking emerging rhythms and refusing pattern even as the lure strengthens. The price is felt (scattering cherished moments, tears, heaviness) and reweights the ending. No antagonist is needed; pressure coheres around the ritual’s risks.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—nostalgia’s danger and the necessity of impermanence—emerges organically from the method and its cost. However, the final paragraph leans toward explicit moralizing (“They had sought to harness nostalgia... trapped their souls in endless, looping grief”), reducing subtext. The last image still resonates (fragile light, heavier veil), but the thesis is somewhat stated rather than wholly earned through implication. The conceptual reweighting remains strong despite the didactic tint.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third-person closely held to Elara; diction and rhythm match her scholarly yet strained state. The voice modulates with pressure, tightening during the ritual and softening at closure. No head-hopping or stance slippage; inference remains within plausible knowledge. Elevated language feels voice-true rather than grafted on.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense but largely efficient, with images doing multiple jobs (pagoda light as response and meaning). Minor purple tendencies are kept coherent; syntax varies and momentum holds through the ritual. No significant loops or template cadences; clarity of action and causality is maintained. The final lines land cleanly without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>“Atoms of nostalgia” purified by pattern-avoidance is an original, integrated conceit; the tactic feels both fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The pagoda-as-reactive archive tech, the jagged ritual, and the costed repudiation of narrative loops cohere. Risk-taking in concept and execution heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The closing repricing of innocence is memorable and specific to this vision.</comment>
