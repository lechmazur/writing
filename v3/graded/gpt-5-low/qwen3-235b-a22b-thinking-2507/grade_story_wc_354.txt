<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and character‑particular: he values beauty and principle over reinstatement, and his refusal to name the traitor informs the present vow of silence. Embodied tics (the dented worry stone, shadow placement, stance) ground his interiority. However, internal contradiction is modestly dramatized—the struggle reads mostly resolved, so the peak feels low‑friction. The final choice to return with a solution costs him little visibly beyond continued exile.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory and ritual density builds to a charged poise where he reconceives the eclipsed covenant and chooses a course. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost (keeping the vow, accepting exile) rather than a decisive external turn. Orientation is crisp from the start; the beat sequence tightens coherently toward the shooting‑star/bishop diagonal reveal. The cost is felt but muted, keeping this just shy of higher bands.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The magnetic nexus and twilight are vivid, purpose‑driven, and constrain action (alignment with fading light, compasses misbehaving, hum that cues phase). The worry stone functions as micro‑setting, charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through a strategist’s eye (diagonals, arcs, alignment). World rules are consistent and integrated through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove the theory before the next phase—stays coherent, with a clear tightening at the celestial alignment and the bishop diagonal realization. Pressure remains mostly internal, with minimal visible price or foreclosed option on the page. The time pressure and humming nexus provide soft escalation. Resolution stems from his agency but faces little resistance, which limits amplitude.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Chess as a grammar for truth and vows, and eclipse as concealment rather than rupture, converge into a thoughtful, resonant theme. Recurring images (stone, alignment, silence) reweight meaning at the end. A few explicit theme lines (“The game was never about winning...”) approach moralizing and slightly thin the subtext. Still, the closing gesture (returning at dawn not for reinstatement) lands an earned, quiet answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The close third voice is steady, lyrical, and suited to a contemplative strategist; diction is controlled and patterned without head‑hopping. Perceptual signature—seeing star paths as piece moves—feels distinctive. Mild abstraction creeps into peak beats but doesn’t obscure legibility. Modulation from twilight patience to charged, hushed certainty is clean.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is polished with varied rhythm and purposeful imagery; many lines do double duty (world + psyche). Some conceptual repetition (“beauty in the difficult,” “translating silence”) and abstract phrasing slightly slow momentum. No major figurative muddle or scaffold loops; syntax remains clear. The final image is crisp and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of celestial mechanics, chess pedagogy, and covenantal ethics feels fresh and coherent. The “translating silence” method and the magnetic nexus are inventive without gimmickry. The arc is quiet rather than surprising, but inevitability accrues well. Strong specificity lifts it above template allegory.</comment>
