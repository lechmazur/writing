<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation—save Aegis and “encrypt vulnerability as strength”—is specific and drives concrete choices (recovering entries, rolling dice, choosing dance over panic). Interiority is embodied (cold water at her knees, steady breath), showing fear coexisting with resolve. The decisive endurance at the end (not running immediately, ritual care with dice) feels earned. A touch more visible internal contradiction in the peak beat could push it higher.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Hybrid drive with causal dominance: dice → journal line → embodied cipher → command → upload. Closure lands on the page with cost (time pressure from rising water; she foregoes flight until the data is away). Single-scene structure is coherent and tight. The cost is felt but not steep, keeping it just shy of the very top band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The flooded lab is vividly sensory (ozone, algae, groaning metal) and constrains tactics (limited time, one terminal, water rising). Tools and objects matter: the terminal, obsidian dice, and journal shape movement and choices. The final image recharges the setting (tomb-to-cradle turn) and object placement. Balanced, purposeful detail with no tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear early (liberate Aegis before flood erases it), and pressure tightens via the embodied-decoding requirement under a rising clock. The meaningful turn is her choice to translate fear into dance, narrowing options to a risky, time-costly method. Resolution is protagonist-driven, with a visible price of time and physical risk. Stakes could escalate one notch more post-upload to heighten consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: vulnerability becomes strength by being integrated into method (the dance keyed to fear, Thorne’s philosophy enacted). Recurring images (spider web, dice, water) shift meaning at the end, charging the cradle-of-resilience image. No moralizing; the final cadence invites reflection. A hair of explicit phrasing (“encrypt vulnerability as strength”) edges toward statement but remains earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person close maintains a coherent, lyrical perceptual signature; diction matches a precise, sensory thinker under pressure. Rhythm modulates with the scene, and the lyricism stays legible with no head-hopping. No dialogue needed; the voice carries action and subtext. Minor flourish density in places lightly grazes urgency but doesn’t blur causality.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lines are clean, purposeful, and often do double duty with image and action; no scaffold loops or cadence templates. Figurative language is controlled and coherent (spider web motif returns without muddle). A few high-register phrases approach purple but remain anchored in tactile detail. Pacing supports momentum through the decode-to-upload arc.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: codebreaking through embodied choreography, hangman dice as lettered key, and a sunken lab’s pressure converge freshly. The “vulnerability as algorithmic armor” concept feels distinctive and integrated. The closing ritual with the dice gives a memorable, inevitable-feeling finish. Not radically transformational, but confidently original.</comment>
