<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—atonement and restoring trust—is concrete and drives each micro‑choice (which text first, what promise to weave). The carefully reckless/cautious duality is embodied through the fragile ink well and measured pace under a ticking clock. Internal conflict is present but muted; after the first breakthrough, resistance becomes minimal and competence dominates. Still, her humility-by-necessity feels earned by the prior failure and the looming council vote.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: vow → linguistic resonance → visible shift in glyphs → progressive loosening → unraveling. Closure lands on the page with a decisive change (the Knot undone, charter unified) and a charged forward pressure (council imminent), with felt cost in risk, reputation, and time. The lens reads primarily causal with an accumulative texture; it holds through the end. The only shortfall is the lack of a meaningful setback or price beyond exertion and risk.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The subterranean archive, single oil lamp, bone-carved prayer, and the glass ink well create a tactile micro‑setting that both constrains action and charges the final image. Object-as-setting is exemplary: the ink well’s fragility governs tactics and closes the piece as symbol and tool. Sensory detail is selective and purpose-driven, filtered through a linguist’s gaze. World rules (promise‑linguistics) are learned via action, not exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes are singular and legible early: save the archive by restoring trust through a corrected translation before dawn. Escalation is present via breakthroughs (laughter/rivers root; Ondari vow) and the time pressure, culminating in the unraveling. However, the path is smooth after the first connection; there’s little counterforce or loss to sharpen the price. The ending’s cost rests in reputational risk rather than a contested final hurdle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Themes of reparative truth as harmony emerge organically from the act of weaving promises across languages. The final image—cautious exuberance and a reweighted silence into melody—rings, though a couple sentences verge on thesis-stating. The ink well as fragile trust metaphor is earned and integrated, not grafted. Resonance is solid, if a touch overt in the last third.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third-person with a distinct perceptual signature suits a scholar under pressure. Diction is consistent and modulates as intensity rises (ink flares, glyphs realign). No head-hopping or stance drift, and elisions feel intentional. The lyric register occasionally brushes the edge of purple but stays clear and purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lean, image-dense lines move the scene while carrying world-building; metaphor is generally coherent (starlight ink, frozen constellations). Minor repetition of phrasing and concept (“carefully reckless,” “symphonies of truth”) grazes redundancy but does not stall momentum. Syntax and paragraphing vary well, with strong verb choices. The final cadence lands cleanly without scaffolding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Magic-by-promise as linguistics is a fresh twist, with cultural vows as the operative mechanic rather than generic spellcraft. The glass ink well’s fragility as both practical constraint and ethical emblem feels specific and memorable. The arc’s turns grow from this premise rather than borrowed tropes. If a true pushback beat existed, it might have vaulted further into standout territory.</comment>
