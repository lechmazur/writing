<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Aris’s motives are precise and embodied—the drive to “quantify the ache” meets the visceral cost of transposed empathy. Contradictory impulses (control via math vs. surrender to feeling) collide under pressure once the fragment threatens to infect the press. The final renunciation—placing the fragment away and choosing to carry rather than solve—reads earned. Minor hedge: the realization skirts thesis-speak, but the choice itself remains character-grounded.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: discovery → inundation → contamination fear → repricing/renunciation. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing when Aris refuses analytical mastery with a felt cost (abandoning the math and accepting burden). Orientation is clean and sustained within a single scene. Each beat causally intensifies toward the ending image without soft resets.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The workshop’s tactile specificity (lead ‘e’s, indigo ink, gas lamp) is vivid and POV-filtered, and the press itself constrains choice via the contamination fear. The halo fragment functions as charged micro-setting, reprojecting geometry and emotion that alter tactics. Tone and environment fuse (“lucid turbulence”) and charge the final act of returning the fragment to the drawer. World rules stay consistent and are learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes are legible early (self-integrity and preventing empathic contamination) and tighten when the fragment lands on set type. The reversal from analytical mapping to protective renunciation deepens cost rather than solving neatly. Pressure is internal but coherent, with the contamination threat supplying external edge. One could want a sharper concrete consequence, but at this length the escalation suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through image and choice: the impulse to measure feeling yields to an ethic of carriage and stewardship. The collective sigh sequence reweights the premise without needing didactic resolution, though the line “Emotion wasn’t a solvable equation” edges close to overt thesis. The halo fragment’s refiguration at the end converts tool to reminder, giving resonance. Ambiguity lingers productively without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The voice is controlled, sensorially precise, and consistent with Aris’s sensibility and craft; no head-hopping. Rhythm modulates with pressure (frenetic sketching vs. steadier cadence at closure). Diction feels owned by the POV—technical and tactile without register drift. Lyric maneuvers are taught early and remain legible through the final image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High-density prose largely avoids purple overreach; metaphors track the physical and emotional logic (angles/sorrow, indigo-stained fingers). No evident loops or scaffolding; sentences carry multiple jobs with momentum. Minor abstract lines appear but do not blur causality or the closure image. The final cadence is crisp and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis—letterpress craft, halo fragment, and transposed empathy—feels singular and inevitable in hindsight. The contamination-of-print turn smartly literalizes the theme. Risks in diction and concept pay off without obscuring clarity. The final reweighting avoids familiar templates while honoring the piece’s peculiar logic.</comment>
