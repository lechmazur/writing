<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s drive (to conduct the unheard before exhaustion) is precise and embodied through tactile actions with the shell and memory-mapping. The abandonment of “hollow phrases” grounds her motive. Internal contradiction is modest—desire versus dwindling stamina—so the arc reads linear rather than contested. Still, micro-choices under pressure (what memories to map, when to raise hands) are credible and specific.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: memory motifs stack into a sonic ritual, then cadence breaks at the solstice threshold. Closure lands on the page with cost—she conducts, shapes a final silver note, and collapses. Orientation is clear from the first lines (who, where, when), and constraints (dawn, ice, spire) persist through the ending. The wake-up coda confirms Earned Stasis without undoing the price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The glass spire and frozen lake actively shape action and sound (ice as choir, wind as brass), not mere backdrop. The mirrored horizon functions as sacred stage and charges the final image as the sun crowns. Object-as-setting (nautilus) ties bodily method to place, constraining her tactic of memory-mapping. Sensory selection is purposeful and character-filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—complete the symphony before exhaustion—tightens as dawn advances and her breath frays. The meaningful turn arrives at the threshold (sun breach), narrowing options and forcing the final conducting push. Cost is unmistakable in her collapse. Conflict is mostly internal/environmental but coherent and escalating under the chosen lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Memory as music, patience as craft, and silence reweighted into meaning all converge without moralizing. The final silver note and collapse provide a resonant answer: mastery costs and is cyclical, not owned. The fortune-cookie past reframes earned wisdom against platitude. Ambiguity lingers productively about the “unheard symphonies” as both literal and metaphoric.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third-person close stays consistent and character-specific, with a perceptual signature keyed to sound and pattern. Elevated diction matches the ritualized mode and does not outpace plausibility. Psychic distance tightens appropriately at the climax without head-hopping. Elision patterns are taught early (image-to-sound mapping) and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Line-level craft is vivid with high information density; most images do more than one job. A few repeated phrasings (e.g., “mirrored horizon”) flirt with redundancy but remain functional as leitmotif. Figurative language is rich yet coherent, with minimal purple drift. Momentum is steady through cadenced sentences that quicken at the threshold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis is fresh: a former fortune-cookie writer conducting the earth via childhood constellations at a mirrored solstice horizon. Risks in lyric structure and conceptual worldbuilding pay off with a concrete cost. The nautilus as method-object is an inventive, non-generic anchor. The final cadence reweights the whole in a distinctive, memorable way.</comment>
