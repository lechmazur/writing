<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s longing and despair are embodied and motive-driven, culminating in a costly, coherent choice to sacrifice herself. The internal push-pull (weariness vs. duty to “recommence”) is credible and enacted rather than told. Minor limitation: contradictory impulses could be more directly dramatized at the decision beat rather than implied through description.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Clear causal chain: rummage-box discovery → puzzle pieces repair the loom → urgent recommencement → sacrifice. Closure lands decisively with on-page cost (loom dies; Elara’s essence departs). The convenient fit of jigsaw pieces risks coincidence resolving the central blockage, but the final outcome still relies on her agency and price paid.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The orchard, bamboo encroachment, Ghost Loom, and amber bead form a tactile, charged environment that shapes action and the final image. Tools and objects (ports, shuttle, bead) constrain tactics and closure. Atmospheric specificity is high without feeling like a tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early and tightened by the loom’s brief reanimation and the “now or never” bridge. The reversal is costly and earned, with agency centered on Elara’s recommencement and self-offering. Slight undercut from the coincidental repair method, but pressure still coheres and escalates.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sacrifice, remembrance, and communication across time accrue through objects and images rather than thesis statements. The bead’s final ascension reweights “raveling silence” into a price-paid release, not a platitude. Complexity holds without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Consistent, lyrical close-third with a strong perceptual signature; no head-hopping or stance wobble. Diction and rhythm modulate with pressure at the climax. Occasional high-density metaphor clusters skirt purple but stay controlled.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lines carry momentum with high information density and minimal scaffold. A few stacked modifiers and recurring constructions (“raveling silence,” “stoically sparkling”) verge on excess but do not blur action or cost. Final images are clean and precise.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The fusion of loom-magic with jigsaw mechanics and a sap-amber soul-message feels fresh and specific. The central sacrifice reanimates familiar motifs with a distinctive object logic. Minor convenience in the puzzle mechanism tempers the ingenuity score slightly.</comment>
