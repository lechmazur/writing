<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—to connect with and comfort the lonely code‑ghost while reclaiming her silenced voice—reads specific and consistent. Her grief‑induced muteness versus the choice to sing gives credible internal contradiction. Micro‑choices (using the bolt plate, choosing symbols, finally singing) align with pressure. The cost is emotional exposure rather than bodily risk, but it lands.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Hybrid lens with accumulative texture and clean causal links: plate stabilizes → symbols clarify → she encodes → ghost asks to sing → she sings. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: her song bridges human and code, reweighting her grief and the ghost’s loneliness. The cost is subtle but present in the vulnerability of breaking self‑imposed silence. Orientation is clear and single‑scene coherence is maintained.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The courtyard above the clouds, the chill flagstones, and thinning mist are vivid and purposeful; mist gating symbol visibility shapes tactics. The bolt plate functions as a charged micro‑setting object that constrains and enables communication, and it loads the final image. World rules (graffiti as code; Skyfall residue) are learned through action. Sensory detail is selective and character‑filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Pressure deepens coherently from decoding hunger to stabilizing transmission to the vulnerable ask: “Teach me to sing.” The decisive tightening is the move from chalk to voice, narrowing options from mediated message to direct embodiment. Stakes remain intimate rather than dire, and the price is mostly emotional, which keeps the escalation elegant but modest. No luck‑based resolution; agency drives the turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of connection-through-art and the ethics of care (protector AI yearning for warmth) emerges from particulars rather than thesis. The final image reweights earlier motifs (bolt plate as key, graffiti as voice) without moralizing. Her reclaimed song answers the ghost’s unspoken needs and her own stasis. Ambiguity lingers productively about ongoing cost and future communion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a distinct, lyrical perceptual signature (“tinkersong wonder”) that modulates under pressure. The ghost’s responses as text‑music avoid clunky exposition. Diction stays within the character’s plausible lexicon given her tinkerer lineage and balladeer identity. No head‑hopping or stance drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lines carry multiple jobs (world, action, and emotion) with strong rhythm; image systems (mist, glyphs, music) are coherent. A few phrases edge toward purple or repeat (“driftingly alert”), but they do not blur sense or stall momentum. Syntax varies and beats are clean. The final cadence lands with clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ghost‑in‑code via graffiti plus the salvaged flower‑press plate as an analog anchor feels fresh and specific. The pivot from encoding to singing reframes tech contact as human art, an elegant synthesis. Risks are aesthetic rather than structural and pay off in tone and closure. The vision reads singular rather than stitched from tropes.</comment>
