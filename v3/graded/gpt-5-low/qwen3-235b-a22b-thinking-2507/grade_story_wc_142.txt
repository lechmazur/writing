<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Kael’s dual allegiance is dramatized through concrete micro-choices—reading the graffiti, convening the meeting, and choosing to reorganize rather than confront. Interiority is specific and embodied (“hope warred with desperation,” the calliope’s tune under his chest) and aligns with his role as culture shock absorber. The handoff of the chip to Elara externalizes his internal shift credibly. A slight neatness in the pivot to leadership keeps it shy of the very top tier.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The causal chain is clean: graffiti → decoded message → meeting with proof of privatization → plan → new coordinating graffiti. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: they cannot stop privatization, but they claim endurance via a coordinated network and symbol. Cost is on the page (acceptance of loss, displacement acknowledged) and the lens holds. Orientation is crisp within the first lines with no teleports or unkept setups.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The raft-city carnival is vivid and purposeful, shaping tactics (graffiti language, buoy hub, moving kitchens) and charging the final image. The foundation stone chip functions as a micro‑setting object that constrains choices and culminates in the closing symbol. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Kael’s priorities. Strong integration without excess panorama.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around the imminent privatization and escalates with Elara’s contract, forcing a tactical stance. The choice to reorganize “around them, not against them” forecloses direct resistance and carries a felt price. The tightening is modest but sufficient at this length, with the network plan as a concrete adaptation. Stakes remain consistently legible and focused.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Themes of community resilience versus commodification emerge through action and object (the chip) rather than lecture. The line “They own the paper, but not the spirit” leans declarative but the closing image reweights it with earned resonance. Subtext in the coded graffiti system and buoy hub adds depth. Complexity is present without false equivalence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The voice blends tactile lyricism with grounded clarity, consistent to Kael’s perceptual bias. Dialogue is minimal but functional, carrying pressure and status (Elara’s rasp, Kael’s directive calm). Distance control is steady, with no head‑hopping or register drift. Rhythmic modulation supports the escalation and landing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lines carry multiple jobs with vivid yet controlled imagery; momentum holds without scaffold or loops. Occasional heightened metaphors (“calliope’s tune,” “pulse of resistance”) are coherent to the world and do not clog pressure. Syntax varies well across beats. Minor density in the planning paragraph is balanced by concrete, actionable detail.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>A floating carnival city confronting privatization via a coded graffiti network feels fresh and specific. The foundation chip as communal relic is an inventive, grounded motif that reframes the ending. The plan’s “around not against” tactic offers a non‑obvious stance. Risk is measured, with world and concept integrated rather than ornamental.</comment>
