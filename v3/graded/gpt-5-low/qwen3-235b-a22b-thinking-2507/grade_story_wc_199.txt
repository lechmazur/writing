<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—decoding the leaves to save the arbor—is clear, embodied in tactile work and precise micro‑choices (withdrawing the speck, the exact prod, sacrificing the last spore). Interiority is filtered through her vocation with specificity (“mossy delight”), avoiding stock feeling labels. The internal contradiction is mild (orderly ritualist choosing to risk and expend rare seeds), so pressure on her psychology remains gentle. Still, the sacrifice of the last sky‑orchid spore gives her final choice credible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal. Because/therefore progression is tight: Hush → crimson leaf → prod the speck → deciphered map/plea → deliberate monuments → arbor’s release and stars. Closure lands on the page as a Decisive Change with a legible price (using last viable spore and abandoning the sorting). No orientation debt; the ending’s change reconfigures options and the cost is present in the moment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The ashen skyborne arbor is vivid and functional; environment and objects (seeds, chest, moonstone) shape tactics and charge the final image of haze parting and green shoots. Sensory choices feel filtered through a seed sorter’s priorities, avoiding tourist catalog. World rules (Hush amplification, stone’s eye) are learned by action, not dump. Setting constrains stakes and action, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible early (the arbor’s slow death vs. remembrance), and escalation coheres under the causal lens: the Hush tightens, the cipher is unlocked, and Elara must expend precious materials to act. The visible cost (the last sky‑orchid spore) sharpens the peak choice. Tension is lyrical rather than combative, but the narrowing of options reads. No coincidence resolves the conflict; her agency drives the turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme—restoration through remembrance rather than conquest—emerges from concrete acts (monuments as memory anchors) and reweights the closing image. A single explicit line (“The prophecy was clear… only if the forgotten things were remembered”) edges toward statement, but the scene earns it. The final reconfiguration invites reflection without tidy moralizing. Subtext in the seed‑work and “mossy delight” threads through without feeling schematic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The close third‑person voice is controlled, sensory‑precise, and consistent with Elara’s perceptual signature. Lyric diction modulates with pressure (calm order → hushed charge → released breath) without head‑hopping or register drift. No dialogue, but the narrative cadence functions as action. Elision is minimal and purposeful; certainty stays within what Elara can infer.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Line craft is strong: varied syntax, purposeful nouns/verbs, and layered images that carry multiple jobs. A few lush clusters flirt with purple (stacked modifiers, repeated “ash/grey”), but clarity and momentum hold. No scaffold loops or template cadences; key beats are dramatized, not summarized. The final line returns energy cleanly to earlier motifs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Seed‑sorting as vocation + moonstone dust lens + Hush folklore synthesize into a fresh, coherent mechanic; building seed‑monuments as memory anchors feels original and inevitable in hindsight. The world image (skyborne arbor under ash) is distinctive without gimmickry. The decisive act grows from established particulars rather than a late rule change. Risk‑taking in tone and concept elevates without obscuring clarity.</comment>
