<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Kael’s motivation to trust the ghost and mobilize the colony is clear and embodied (frost, bell, sprint to the hub). Interiority is specific—“hope like brambles”—but internal conflict is light; he pivots to belief quickly with minimal ambivalence. Secondary pressures (Anya’s skepticism vs. Renn’s leap) help, though they’re brief. The visible cost is mostly labor and risk of misallocation rather than a sharper sacrifice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Clean causal spine: dawn message → reinterpretation of “roots” → collective dig → aquifer gush. Orientation is anchored early (who/where/when), and the closure is on‑page with a decisive change in circumstance. The cost is plausible (time, stamina, stakes of failure) and the pattern of prior messages earns today’s risky choice. Resolution is swift but credible within the length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Veridia’s floating arches, permacrete, and thin atmosphere are vivid and filtered through Kael’s urgency. The bell and nebula charge the final image, while the arches and “Under Arch Seven” cue subtly shape tactics. Details serve mood without tourist‑catalog sprawl. Strong, purposeful atmosphere, if slightly more postcard than constraint at times.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (water/survival) is clear, and pressure coheres from skepticism to mobilization. The key tightening is the reinterpretation of “roots,” narrowing options toward a labor‑intensive bet. The price (exhaustion, lost morning if wrong) reads, though the path to success faces little active resistance once they commit. Closure is earned by agency rather than coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>“Reexamine the roots” refracts as both agronomy and community ethos; the bell/nebula images reweight hope from bramble to bloom. The altruistic ghost frames a theme of trust and collective effort without sermonizing. The final image offers a resonant, non‑literal answer: respite is made through concert, not miracle alone. Slight sentimentality is contained by concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The close third POV stays steady, with diction that matches Kael’s lived world and urgency. Dialogue is economical and functional, carrying status (Anya’s fatigue vs. Renn’s tilt to faith). Rhythmic control is confident without preciousness. No leakage or unearned omniscience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lines are clean, image‑rich, and purposeful; “hope like brambles” and the bell/nebula reprises carry weight. Minimal scaffold or synonym loops; momentum holds. A few stacked modifiers verge on purple but don’t blur sense. Cadence varies to match pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The sci‑fi orchard, floating arches, and an altruistic ghost guiding communal survival feel fresh in synthesis. The chalk‑at‑dawn mechanism and the bell/nebula motif elevate beyond template. The solution’s twist—geological “roots”—is neat and earned. Not radical, but distinct and memorable.</comment>
