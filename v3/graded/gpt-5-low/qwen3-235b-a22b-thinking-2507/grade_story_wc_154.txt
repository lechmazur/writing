<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Aris’s interiority is vivid and embodied, with a clear throughline from translator-guilt to the micro-choices of decoding, revising the cast’s symbol, and relinquishing the coral. The contradiction—shrewdness paired with tenderness under anesthetic haze—animates his perception and tactics. The ethical risk of promising “return” adds complexity and cost. Mei’s presence functions as crucible without becoming a cipher herself.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hybrid drive with an Accumulative/Textural dominance: the scene tightens through the decoding act and culminates in a resonant reconfiguration (he gives up his anchor and reframes “alone” to “return”). Orientation is clean and stakes are legible early. Cost is on the page (relinquishing the coral and accepting the ache), and the final image reweights prior material. A touch of stated rationale (“This was why he’d stayed”) slightly softens the pure scene-based closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The misty atrium, rain, and coral are not mere backdrop; the raindrop and coral’s grooves directly enable the decoding and the symbol’s revision. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Aris’s translator/proxy-oceanic lens. The coral as micro-setting/tool charges the final image. A few lyric flourishes risk overt symbolism but stay integrated.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around whether Aris can translate and transform Mei’s fear into something holdable; the decoding intensifies stakes toward an ethically fraught promise. The meaningful turn is his alteration of the cast and the relinquishing of his anchor, which forecloses self‑soothing in favor of shared resilience. External antagonism is minimal, but the moral risk supplies real cost. Tension is quiet yet sustained.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—translation as an act that re-makes pain—emerges through objects and action rather than thesis. The coral’s reweighted meaning and the child’s cipher deliver an earned, resonant answer about remaking wounds. One sentence edges toward overt statement (“This was why he’d stayed”), but the closing image restores subtlety. Emotional aftereffect is tender without tipping into sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The lyric third‑person closely tracks Aris’s perceptual signature, modulating cadence with the anesthetic’s haze without losing clarity. Dialogue is minimal and subtextual, fitting the characters’ statuses and aims. Diction is elevated but coherent for this sensibility. No head‑hopping or stance drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lines carry high information density and purposeful imagery; rhythm varies and sequencing is clear. Occasional purple notes (“lotus‑hearted ache,” “indigo and pearl”) verge on lush but remain controlled. Minimal redundancy and clean mechanics. The prose breathes at turns and tightens in the decode without artifact clutter.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The brain‑coral as decryption key for a child’s cast is a striking, specific synthesis of war, oceanic memory, and translation. The final reweighting via gift and symbol change feels inevitable in hindsight. Risks (quiet stakes, lyric density) pay off without obscuring meaning. The angle on shared anxiety through material maps reads fresh and memorable.</comment>
