<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—ignite a silent revolution under cover of the blackout—is clear and drives her choices. Competence and calm inventiveness are embodied in the quill‑holder alignment, though internal contradiction is limited. The heritage object adds particularity to her inner life without yielding substantial ambivalence. The final commitment to “melt back into the shadows” reads earned, with implied cost but little on‑page fracture.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: blackout → descent → sundial mechanics → coordinates → commitment to the cradle. Closure lands as Charged Poise: she acquires decisive knowledge and commits to action with the cost implied in the risk of misalignment and treason. Orientation is clean and the single scene coheres. Slight softness: cost is mostly conceptual, not palpably felt in the final beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful: the luminous fort’s darkness, garden, sundial, and observatory interlock with the tactic. The blackout and ancient stone constraints shape movement and choice; the quill holder functions as micro‑setting/tool that charges the final image. Detail selection reflects Elara’s professional eye. Occasional lyric excess skirts purple but stays controlled.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (launch the revolution) is clear and tightens at the sundial alignment where a misstep could doom them. Escalation is quiet but coherent: confusion below, precise manipulation, and the reveal of coordinates. Cost remains more implied than dramatized—no on‑page near‑miss or loss—keeping the pressure strong but not searing. Agency drives every turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Themes of light vs. silence and knowledge vs. surveillance emerge through concrete images (half‑painted sundial, “angles where light forgets to fall”). The final image reweights the motif—“whisper, then blaze”—without moralizing. Subtext of lineage and suppressed scholarship subtly deepens stakes. Some symbolism edges toward explicit statement in mentor’s maxim but still earns its place.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>A consistent, lyrical third‑person close holds throughout, with a distinct perceptual signature anchored in Elara’s professional noticing. Rhythm varies and supports tension; no head‑hopping or stance slips. A few elevated turns risk purple but suit the piece’s hush‑and‑glow aesthetic. Elision of dialogue is apt for the stealth mode.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is polished with good momentum and high information density; sentences often carry multiple jobs. Minor stacked modifiers and color‑heavy metaphors (“bruised purples,” “winking hush”) flirt with over‑embellishment but do not obscure sense. No notable loops or scaffold. Final line resonates cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The half‑painted sundial with coded angles, activated by a bronzed quill holder, is a fresh, specific device. The blackout as ally for a whisper‑born uprising reframes familiar coup tropes with restraint and ingenuity. Emotional stakes are credible if understated. The synthesis feels particular and memorable.</comment>
