<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Kael’s motivation and ethos (“gentle radical,” warmth wrapped in steel) drive every action from debris-sifting to confronting Varr. Interiority is embodied through tactile details (ash, cool ceramic biting his palm) and specific values. The main lack is a sharper on‑page cost or contradiction; he never wavers much, so complexity is strong but not maximal. The status dynamic with Varr briefly deepens character under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Clear causal chain: discovery of the tessera → retrocognitive vision → key placement → revealed inscription → confrontation → demolition paused → intent to rename. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/charged poise with social cost implied (defying the council’s narrative) and an immediate consequence (crews lower tools). Orientation is crisp from the outset; single POV and scene hold. Cost is more conceptual than visceral, keeping it just shy of the top band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The plaza’s ash, fractured mosaic, and “shattered sky” are vivid and integral, not decorative. The environment and recurring object (tessera/stepping stone) constrain action and decisively shape the outcome by revealing the erased name. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through Kael’s priorities. The final image is charged by place, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (erase vs. confront truth) is signaled early and tightens with the on‑page reveal and Varr’s arrival. The key deepening is the script’s emergence, which changes options and halts demolition. The price is mostly social/political and not fully cashed on the page, but the moment of public defiance carries weight. Tension eases quickly after the reveal, limiting further escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Themes of mercy versus vengeance and the politics of memory emerge organically from the mosaic’s reveal and the renaming act. Subtext operates in the soldiers’ “aberrant mercy” and the city’s desire for a simple narrative. A few lines verge on overt moralizing (“We bury this truth, we bury our chance to heal”), slightly flattening the resonance. The final threshold image still reframes the premise effectively.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The lyric third‑person voice is consistent, textured, and character‑specific, with controlled shifts in intensity. Dialogue is lean, purposeful, and carries status/subtext without exposition dumps. Diction fits the world and Kael’s sensibility; no head‑hopping or stance slips. Elevation is strong without drifting into omniscient commentary.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythms vary and carry momentum; most lines do multiple jobs (setting, action, theme). A few phrases trend purple or abstract (“paradox of warm coldness,” repeated “aberrant mercy”), but clarity holds. No paraphrase loops or filter‑verb stacks impede closure. The final cadence is clean and image‑driven.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The tessera as retrocognitive key to a repressed civic truth is fresh, and renaming as radical compassion feels non‑obvious and earned. The synthesis of archaeology, memory politics, and mercy lands with specificity. Risks are thematic boldness and lyric density, which the piece manages without obscuring clarity. It stops short of radical formal innovation but reads distinctive.</comment>
