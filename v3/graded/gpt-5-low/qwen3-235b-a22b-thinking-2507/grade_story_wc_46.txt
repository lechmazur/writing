<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent—supplying flameless light under fire risk and honoring her grandmother—rooted in embodied acts (weighing, polishing). The internal contradiction (earthbound loss vs. found purpose) is present without melodrama. Micro‑choices (selecting the “pearl of stillness” shard, committing to the village display) reveal values. The cost—renouncing the dream of orbiting observatories—registers, though its sting is mostly recollected rather than acutely contested on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of ritual and memory builds toward the village illumination, which functions as a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is clean, with one transition from grotto to square that maintains continuity. Closure lands with a charged final image (flameless lanterns igniting; communal relief) and a conceptual price (staying earthbound), though the pressure is gentle. Slight softness in on‑page cost keeps it below the highest band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The grotto, mist, salt drip, and jasmine air are vivid and purpose‑driven, filtered through a star watcher’s bias. Recurring objects (sea glass, cloth, plinths) evolve into the final image, and the no‑fire constraint ties setting to choice. Sensory detail is rich without turning into a static catalog, though the prose edges lush. The environment meaningfully charges the ending even if it doesn’t overtly corner a single tactical move.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (safe, flameless light) is clear, with coherent pressure from village fear and drought. Escalation is a textural deepening (search → selection → polishing → communal ignition) rather than a hard reversal; it works under the chosen lens but lacks a sharpened trade‑off. The visible cost is primarily internal and historical, with minimal on‑page sacrifice. Tension remains lyrical, not tensile.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of remembered light, inheritance, and stillness as vessel accrues through particulars and culminates in a non‑literal answer: warmth without consumption, grief transmuted into guidance. The grandmother’s maxim is integrated, not sermonized, and the closing image reweights earlier motifs. Some lines verge on stating the thesis, but they are supported by scene work. Resonance lingers without cheap uplift.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The voice is steady, lyrical, and plausibly filtered through Elara’s vocation and history. Diction and rhythm modulate with the polishing ritual’s cadences; no head‑hopping. A few repeated constructions (“memories resurface,” “reflectively vibrant”) and lushness occasionally threaten monotony. Overall control and coherence remain strong.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is vivid and largely efficient, with images doing multiple jobs (sea glass as tool, grief vessel, starlight echo). Occasional redundancy and purple tincture (“reflectively vibrant,” stacked modifiers) slow momentum slightly. No major scaffolding or filter‑verb stacks, but some sentences could tighten without loss. The final third remains clear and effective.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sea‑glass as inherited technology for flameless illumination is a fresh, coherent synthesis; the wartime blackout lineage and disability reframing add specificity. The risk is in committing to a quiet, ritual‑driven arc, which the piece sustains. While not formally radical, the conceptual reweighting feels earned and particular to this world. A hair more pressure or a singularly surprising turn could lift it further.</comment>
