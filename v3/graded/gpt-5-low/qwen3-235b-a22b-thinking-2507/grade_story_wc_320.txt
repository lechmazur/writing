<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara’s motive and method are clear and consistent, and her shift from filtering to resonating reads earned. Interiority is specific (tuning to “hush,” refusing safety protocols), though contradictory impulses under pressure are muted. Embodied detail (boots on grating, shard’s weight/heat) supports character. The felt cost is modest, so the endurance/renunciation beat lands more as conviction than sacrifice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Orientation is immediate and clean; the accumulative/textural lens holds as density builds to the resonance. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: silence redefined, city/gorge reweighted, frequency locked, and the “map” secured. Cost is present but light (safety override, structural strain), slightly softening the decisive feel. The throughline remains coherent with one tightening turn at perigee.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The radio‑tower city and Whisper Gorge are vivid and purposeful; the mists become the medium, charging the final image. Physical constraints (height, groaning structure) and tools (array) shape tactics. Detail selection tracks POV expertise and urgency. The environment is not mere backdrop; it informs the logic of the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is focused: capture the beginning within the ending during a narrow window. Escalation is driven by her choice to break protocols and retune the array, with perigee and structural strain tightening pressure. The price is mostly procedural and physical risk rather than a deep personal loss, limiting sharpness of cost. Still, the turn credibly narrows options and reweights knowledge.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Themes of silence-as-language and cyclical beginnings/ends emerge through action and image (the shard of hush, the gorge mist as carrier). The final realization reweights earlier material without collapsing into moral, though one or two lines verge on explicit statement. Resonance is earned via the tactile ritual of tuning and the recorded “map.” The piece invites reflection more than it asserts.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and confident, with a lyric‑technical blend fitting Elara’s vocation. Diction and rhythm modulate with pressure, and patterning (“serenely electric,” hush) is controlled. No head‑hopping or register slips; inference stays within what she can know. The voice carries specificity without over‑explaining.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is clear, propulsive, and image‑dense; most sentences do multiple jobs. Occasional repetition (“serenely electric,” restating the thesis) risks mild purple tone but remains purposeful. No significant scaffold loops or template cadence; syntax varies and the climax reads cleanly. Minor compression could heighten momentum, but the line‑level is strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—tuning to a “shard of hush,” a hollywood star fragment as key, a mist‑carrier city—feels fresh and internally coherent. The decisive reweighting (silence as active medium) lands as non‑obvious yet inevitable. Risks are taken in blending hard and mythic registers without gimmickry. Slightly softer cost keeps it shy of truly singular.</comment>
