<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s motives—post‑euthanasia clarity redirected into learning “the sound of approaching endings”—are specific, embodied, and drive her micro‑choices (volunteering, trawling, handling the parasol tip). Contradictory impulses (end/understand endings; patience/fold in patience) operate simultaneously in scene. The near‑crack and talisman choice reveal character under pressure without therapy‑speak. The change to an earned stance (listening within endings) forecloses the prior self‑erasure path with credible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural, held through to closure. Closure arrives as a resonant reconfiguration/CR when the final distant calving sound reweights her goal and method; the cost is endurance/presence in wreckage rather than escape. Orientation is clear early (Arctic marina, relief work), and the parasol → fissure → talisman chain tightens coherently. The on‑page near‑miss anchors consequence, preventing the lyric mode from floating.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The drift‑ice marina, wind, and ice acoustics shape choices (she scrapes, retreats at the fissure, stands on refrozen dock to listen). Sensory work is purposeful beyond visuals—sound is thematic and tactical. The parasol tip functions as micro‑setting/object charging the final image. Weather and ice behavior remain consistent and consequential.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (how to meet endings) is tightened by the parasol discovery and the fissure crack, which forces a tactical retreat and reframes her listening. Escalation is a density/cadence deepening rather than a causal gauntlet, appropriate to the lens. Cost is a renunciation of flight in favor of risky presence and attention. A touch more explicit price (fatigue, loss, or immediate forfeit) could heighten the peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Themes of patience, surrender, and grace within endings emerge through recurrent sound images and the parasol’s reweighted meaning. The line “Endings weren't heralded by a single sound...” nudges toward telling, but it’s earned by prior particulars. The final distant calving delivers a non‑literal answer with lingering resonance. Subtext runs in the wind/ice acoustics rather than speech.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A distinct, coherent lyric voice fuses perception with acoustics; elevated diction feels character‑bound, not editorial. Psychic distance modulation under stress is controlled (vision → crack → scramble). No head‑hopping or stance leakage; free indirect texture remains consistent. Compression is purposeful and legible through closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lines carry high information density and clean sequencing; most sentences do double duty (image + psychology). Occasional conceptual restatements (“windborne solace,” “fold in patience”) recur, but they evolve rather than loop. Figurative load is heavy yet coherent; clarity remains intact in peak beats. Minor tightening of repeated abstractions would further sharpen momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—euthanasia tourism refracted through Arctic relief, an heirloom parasol tip as conduit, and an acoustic ethic of endings—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risks in tone and structure pay off without obscuring stakes. The final reweighting via distant calving sound lands as an original closure image. A small step beyond familiar trauma‑to‑epiphany arcs keeps it just shy of the rarest tier.</comment>
