<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and consistent—she must disperse seeds “without using fire”—and her lineage charges her choices. Interiority is particular (tears crystallizing, ache for cycles she can’t halt), though contradictions are mild (grief vs. resolve rather than a sharper clash). Micro‑choices (slotting the gear, adjusting tactics as density changes, releasing seeds) align with motives. The earned endurance at the end reads credible, with an emotional cost held rather than solved.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: sonar density mapping, approaching desolation, harmonic stabilization, then the returning ping that reweights the mission. Orientation is solid early (who/where/mission/tools), and the ending lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise—mission completed with cost felt in the burden of being last steward. The closure image (touching the warm gear, vow kept) is on‑page. Slightly soft cost (no on‑page loss) keeps it below the top band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The nebula garden is richly rendered and operational—density, drifting petals, barren sector—constraining navigation and tactics. The gear and sonar function as micro‑setting/tools that shape action and charge the final image. World rules (light without fire; sonar through gas) are consistent and taught via action. Vivid sensory economy avoids mere “postcard” description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear and pressed: safely disperse the last Luminara seeds. Escalation arrives as she nears “desolation,” pings intensify, and the faint echo reframes risk and legacy. The visible price is primarily risk endurance and restraint rather than a concrete loss, but pressure coheres and tightens once. Resolution flows from her agency (using the gear, choosing where to release seeds).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Themes of non‑destructive stewardship, generational repair, and retooling wartime tech into care arise organically through objects and action. The grandmother’s garden echo reweights legacy with a nuanced answer: quiet endurance over spectacle. The recorded line risks explicitness, but the final image (“light for generations unborn”) earns resonance through particulars. No sermonizing override; ambiguity lingers in the “troubling serenity.”</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a distinct lyrical signature suits the piece; diction and rhythm are controlled. The recorded whisper is the only dialogue and feels integrated. POV modesty is maintained; inference reads as inference. A slight purple tilt appears in spots but rarely blurs perception.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>High information density and clean syntax with purposeful rhythm; many sentences do double duty. Some repetition (“quiet sigh of falling petals”) and stacked figuratives flirt with overwriting but largely cohere to the taught texture. No major loops or scaffolding slow momentum; closure image is crisp. Minor density drag keeps it from the top band.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: nebula gardening, a gear that “approximates infinity” repurposed from war, and sonar‑guided seed dispersal. The legacy echo turning into a living signal is non‑obvious yet earned. Emotional truth grounds the speculative frame. Strong, singular vision without gimmickry.</comment>
