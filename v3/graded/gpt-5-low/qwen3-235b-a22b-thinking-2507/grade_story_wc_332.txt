<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—finding her sister—drives every choice, from the dawn vigils to the light‑photography and the final departure. Interiority is textured through tactile objects (salt‑fogged lens, chipped palette) and a credible obsession. However, internal contradiction is light; we don’t see competing impulses beyond persistence and hope. The closing choice forecloses comfort (library) for risk (forbidden island), but the felt cost is more implied than embodied.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Clear causal chain: dawn observation → insight about light → systematic sunrise photography → decoded coordinates → decision to leave. Orientation is strong from the first paragraph (who/where/when), and the solstice photo provides a satisfying on‑page turn. Closure lands via Decisive Change as she steps onto the causeway. The price is present but soft‑focused; the forbidden island and relinquishing her sanctuary carry the cost mostly by implication.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The Sea‑Whisper Library, coral‑windowed stacks, tide‑locked causeway, and the palette on the sill create a vivid, integrated environment. Setting constrains tactics (must use sunrise light; must leave at low tide) and charges the final image. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through her vocation. A touch more physical obstruction from sea or weather could have heightened pressure further.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find the sister) is clear early; escalation comes with the light insight and the weeks‑long dawn pursuit culminating in the solstice reveal. The meaningful tightening is the decoded, forbidden destination that forces a departure. The internal price (abandoning post, danger) is legible but underplayed on the page. No antagonist is needed; pressure stays coherent under a causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Themes of absence transmuted by the right light and longing becoming action emerge organically through the palette and dawn mechanics. The final repricing—absence as a canvas awaiting light—reweights prior images without resorting to moralizing. Occasional phrasing (“cipher of longing,” “luminous absence”) edges toward declarative theme but remains earned by scene work. The resonance lingers as pursuit replaces stasis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The lyric third‑person close is consistent and confident, with a tactile, sea‑salted perceptual signature. Rhythm modulates well between hush and urgency (solstice beat), and no head‑hopping or stance slips occur. Diction fits the character’s sensibility without academic drift. A touch of sentence‑length variation in the densest passages could sharpen propulsion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is polished, image‑rich, and largely multipurpose; lines carry atmosphere and advance plot. Minor repetition of motifs (whispering, luminous) skirts purple without tipping into muddle. Syntax is clear and avoids scaffolding; the beats read cleanly. A few high‑flourish compounds could be pared to increase pressure at the turn.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>“Painting with light” via a chipped palette as a refractor that decodes watery stains is a fresh synthesis, and the archipelago library setting feels singular. The sunrise photography method grounds the magic in tactile craft. The solstice photo as decisive intensification is earned and non‑obvious. The emotional calculus is familiar (lost‑sibling quest) but transformed by the specific method and place.</comment>
