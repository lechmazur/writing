<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s motivations (data‑driven neutrality versus ethical duty) are clear and in tension, and her micro‑choices—examining the dye, encoding the message, leaving the gate unlocked—flow from those traits. The interiority is specific to a meticulous observer and avoids stock phrasing. The change (from strict solitude to selective, covert action) is earned with a felt risk (expulsion). Slight safety in her high competence trims friction, but not fatally.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal drive is tight: followed unease → pigeon arrives → decode and infer infiltration → covert re‑encode → dispatch → gate unlocked. Orientation is clean from the outset and the single scene holds. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost. The price remains mostly implied rather than tested on the page, keeping it just short of exceptional.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The courtyard, dusk light, and weather tools are vivid and POV‑filtered; they shape tactics (log, anemometer, sundial, pigeon behavior) and charge the ending image. The world logic of the quarantine is learned through action rather than exposition. The unlocked gate under moonlight reprises and reweights space as choice. A hair shy of 9+ only because environmental constraint is subtle rather than overtly binding.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (integrity vs. risk to the zone) is clear, and pressure tightens with the off‑grid warning and suspected infiltration. The decisive act—sending a coded misdirection—narrows options and carries risk. Tension operates across beats without reset and culminates in the unlocked gate. A more concrete on‑page consequence would heighten the felt price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of integrity reframed as quiet, unseen action emerges through particulars (pressure readings, lateral wind symbol, unlocked gate). Subtext in weather/pressure metaphors works well. However, the final declarative line (“Integrity… act unseen”) edges into stated moral, slightly undercutting the earned resonance. The piece still invites reflection beyond plot.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is steady, with a distinct perceptual signature of a precision‑minded observer; diction and rhythm are controlled and apt. No head‑hopping or unearned omniscience. Lyrical register remains plausible for the character. Minor elevated turns brush the edge of lyric excess but stay consistent with voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lines are clean, varied, and purposeful; images carry multiple jobs (setting, theme, pressure). Momentum holds with high information density and minimal scaffolding. A few adjective stacks and reiterated phrases (“layered tranquility,” pressure metaphors) skim purple but don’t impede clarity. The final cadence is crisp and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis—storm recorder ethics, rogue quarantine politics, a pigeon‑borne covert network, and “lateral” tactics—feels fresh and coherent. Turns grow from character logic, not contrivance. Risk‑taking is quiet but confident, especially in recoding weather data as resistance. Slight familiarity in dystopian frame prevents a higher mark, but execution is distinctive.</comment>
