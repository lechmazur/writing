<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—rekindle the beacon to prove pattern in “coincidence”—is clear and embodied in tactile choices (placing/angling the shard). Interiority is vivid and character‑particular, with fear and conviction coexisting in her trembling and breathless focus. Internal contradiction is present but mild; doubt never seriously contends with her certainty. The final choice feels earned, with emotional cost shown in tears and physical strain rather than declared.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Hybrid lens with causal dominance at the end: her precise alignment of Vega through the shard directly produces the new light. Orientation is strong from the outset (who/where/when clear) and the single scene tightens toward a concrete act. Closure lands as a Decisive Change: the beacon rekindles, reconfiguring options and tone. Cost is primarily emotional/ideational, not material, but registers on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The glass humming pavilion and beacon tower are sensorially specific and functionally constraining (aperture, cradle, shattered panes, hum → hush). The shard/prism micro‑setting directly shapes tactics and charges the ending image (hum turning to melody; light in seeds). Detail selection is POV‑true and purposeful, not a catalog. World rules are consistent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rekindle or be swallowed by silence) is signaled early; pressure tightens as Vega crests and the hush deepens. Escalation is driven by her agency and precise micro‑choices (“one degree more,” final twist). The felt price is mostly risk of failure and emotional exposure, which reads but remains modest. Coincidence motifs complicate rather than resolve; the act resolves.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Thematic throughline—meaning vs. randomness—emerges via recurring particulars (lark, thistles, stars) that reweight at the end. Occasional thesis statements (“the universe wove patterns”) risk overtness but are supported by scene pressure. Final image offers a resonant answer: a fragile, living light that reframes “coincidence” as patterned grace. Sentiment is earned through concrete struggle rather than told moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyric third‑person closely held to Elara, with sustained, confident diction and rhythmic control. Perceptual signature is distinct (sound as texture; hush as substance) and modulates under stress without head‑hopping. No dialogue needed; voice carries subtext through image. Certainty stays within what Elara can infer or recall via retrocognition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lines are dense and musical with mostly efficient imagery; momentum holds through the peak beats. Minor purple lean (“ink faded to whispers,” “silver needle stitching”) remains coherent and purposeful. No significant loops or cadence templates; syntax varies to fit pressure. Final sentences land cleanly without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The “shard of hush” and retrocognitive alignment blend science‑ritual with ruin lyricism in a fresh way. Motif weave (thistle/lark/hum) feels inevitable at closure rather than ornamental. Risks in concept and diction pay off without obscuring clarity. The beacon‑rekindling premise is familiar, but the specific mechanics and texture feel singular.</comment>
