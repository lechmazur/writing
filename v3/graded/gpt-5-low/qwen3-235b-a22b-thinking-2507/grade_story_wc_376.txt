<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s motive (“to find where lost conversations went”) is clear and sustained, and her honesty‑triggered vulnerability produces concrete, character‑specific choices. The Ben beat externalizes her flaw at a cost and sharpens her tactics. Interior admissions while assembling the map feel earned, not tidy epiphany. The final “bloom” tracks to established traits, though the relationship pressure is brief rather than crucible‑transformative.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal—discover map → dishonesty pressure → method clue (“candor…”) → honesty assembles map → banyan unlock → Archive accessed. Closure is on‑page and paid: her costly truth‑admissions narrow options and become the method. No teleporting props; the zinc fragment set‑up pays off at the console. The cost is more vulnerable than perilous, but it’s legible and integrated.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The greenhouse city, toxic sky, and banyan infrastructure are vivid and filtered through Elara’s craft‑eye, with purposeful sensory detail (orchids, condensation drip). Environment and object function as constraints: interior corridors, the banyan’s console, and the zinc plate’s grid are necessary to the outcome. World rules (postal grids, toxic sky) are learned via action, not dumps. Scale and choreography track cleanly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes are signaled early and tighten once meaningfully when dishonesty physically incapacitates her and the map resists force until paid with candor. The discovery of the “method” raises both internal and external costs and commits her to a vulnerable tactic. Resolution flows from her agency (truth as tool) rather than coincidence. Pressure could sharpen further with a stronger external counterforce, but the deepening is sufficient at this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—connection restored through truth rather than extraction—is dramatized through the assembly method and the Archive’s logic, not moralized. The final image (“She didn’t wilt. She bloomed.”) reweights earlier material without telling us what to think. The zinc/route system ties honesty to infrastructure, giving the idea teeth. Minimal sermonizing; complexity remains in the cost of vulnerability.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third‑person closely held to Elara maintains consistent distance and diction, with tactile craft‑specific noticing. Dialogue is brief but subtextual (Ben’s “checking” vs. her physical wilt). Rhythm modulates with pressure; no head‑hopping or stance drift. Occasional heightened figurative language stays voice‑motivated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lines carry multiple jobs (world, pressure, character) with minimal scaffold; images are specific and fresh (“sun‑scorched celery,” “magnetic pollen”). No paraphrase loops or filter‑verb stacks dulling momentum. Figurative density remains coherent at peak beats; syntax varies. A couple lush phrases flirt with purple but don’t obscure causality or the closing image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—truth as a physical assembly method unlocking an arboreal sound‑archive via a postal grid—is original and feels inevitable in hindsight. The craft‑profession lens (gilded‑leaf calligrapher) personalizes trope terrain. Risks are taken without gimmickry, and payoffs are integrated. Slightly low external hazard keeps it shy of a higher band.</comment>
