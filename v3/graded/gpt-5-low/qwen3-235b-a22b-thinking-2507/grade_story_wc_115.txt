<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Leo’s skepticism, curiosity, and tactile engagement with the beaded valve yield credible micro-choices (tuning the radio, lifting/dropping/shouldering the wheel) under rising pressure. Contradictory impulses—mocking ghosts yet feeling their presence—play simultaneously, not in neat stages. The shift from scoffer to “keeper” feels earned if a touch stated. Minor on-the-nose phrasing trims subtlety but not motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the radio confession, hush, and charged object build to a conceptual repricing: truth’s “weight” redefined and accepted at cost. Orientation is clean from the first line; the pressure coheres through the tunnel, radio, and valve. Closure lands on the page with the dawn exit and shouldered wheel as a new compass. The psychic coincidence leans uncanny rather than contrived, sustaining coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The tunnel’s damp, rails, and phantom train hum are vivid and purposeful; the valve wheel functions as a micro‑setting/object that charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective (wet stone, bone‑like beads) and filtered through Leo’s bias. The environment subtly constrains options and cadence. A slight tendency toward emblematic description never breaks plausibility.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes tighten from idle debunking to confronting the embodied lie as the ghost shift gathers—a clear deepening that narrows Leo’s stance options. The radio hush and track vibration create a live pressure point prompting the drop, then the costly lift/recommitment. Cost is chiefly conceptual/identity-based rather than material but is felt through the burden/absolution trade. No extraneous reversals or soft resets.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Themes of confession, guilt, and the monetization of truth’s “weight” accrue through beads, hush, and the wheel-as-remorse. The final image answers the inquiry without a moral lecture, though a few lines (“This was it—the swallowed truth given form”) edge toward thesis-speak. Subtext hums in the radio’s mediated confession and the phantom shift’s labor. Resonance lingers in the charged acceptance rather than tidy absolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A consistent, sensorially alert close-third voice carries lyric density without blur; diction fits Leo’s pragmatic skepticism turned awe. Radio snippets add texture and subtext without head‑hopping. Rhythm modulates well through hush and surge. No withholding or stance leakage undermines reliability.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong line economy and image work (“beads clicking like counting bones”) propel mood and meaning. Minor reiterations around “weight/truth/hush” approach over-insistence but don’t stall momentum. Syntax varies, and metaphors hold physical logic. Clean mechanics and sequencing support a crisp final cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—abandoned tunnel + beaded industrial relic + live talk‑radio confession—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The conceptual pivot from metal weight to confessed lightness is memorable. Risks (lyric seriousness, psychic radio device) heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. Familiar ghost‑story elements are transformed by the specific object and thematic calculus.</comment>
