<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara’s vow-driven motive is clear and consistently enacted under pressure, and her micro-choices (jamming the mallet into the breach, reading clouds to shift tempo) align with character. Interiority is tactile (salt stinging, mallet against chest) but leans more toward competence than contradiction. The piece would benefit from a sharper internal counter-impulse or cost to deepen complexity. Still, her endurance and craft-centered agency feel specific and credible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single-scene escalation from first rogue wave to “massive wave” and the orchard-saving arpeggio lands a on-page turn with closure. The Hybrid drive (causal beats under an accumulative lyric surface) holds through to the calm and moon-lit mallet. Cost is present though modest (exertion, damage, risk), and options narrow believably at the breach and wave crest. Orientation is established early and remains clean.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The driftwood-circled orchard, creaking platform, and storm-tuned instruments are vivid and integrated with action; the environment directly constrains choices and supplies resources (planks as keys). The xylophone mallet functions as a micro-setting object that charges the final image (moon on the tip, heartbeat sync). Sensory texture is balanced—wind, water, wood, sound—filtered through Elara’s craft. World rules stay consistent via discovery-in-action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—saving the floating orchard—tightens coherently: breach, then the cresting wave, then resolution via transformed force. Escalation stems from Elara’s tactics (cloud-reading tempo shifts, fractal strikes) rather than coincidence. The visible price is mainly physical risk and damage, not a deeper sacrifice, which trims the upper band. Still, the decisive wave strike is a clear narrowing and pay-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The thematic thread—turning obstacle into instrument—emerges organically through enacted craft, not lecture. The closing images (sea breathing in tune; silence turned to possibility) reweight the premise with a quiet, resonant cadence. A few explicit articulations (“a testament to turning dread into music”) edge toward stating the thesis. Even so, the imagery-driven subtext largely carries the meaning.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A confident, lyric third-person closely held to Elara’s sensorium; diction and rhythm feel intentional and modulate with pressure. Recurrent terms (fractal generating, sketched resonance, dubbing) create a coherent idiom rather than tic. No head-hopping, no unearned omniscience, and the voice remains character-filtered. The prose sustains control during action without losing clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong: verbs carry weight, images are specific, and sentences propel. The density of metaphor occasionally crowds (“echoed not once, but infinitely” alongside multiple instrument metaphors), but the pattern is taught and mostly purposeful. Minimal scaffold or synonym loops; momentum holds through peak beats. Clean mechanics and purposeful variation in sentence rhythm support the scene.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of maritime survival with sound-as-physics (“sketched resonance,” “fractal generating,” “dubbing the tempest”) feels fresh and committed. The orchard-on-driftwood stage and single mallet as world-engineering tool are striking and memorable. Turns arise from established logic (cloud-reading → tempo → storm transformation), not late-rule convenience. Risky lyricism pays off with a distinct vision and earned closure.</comment>
