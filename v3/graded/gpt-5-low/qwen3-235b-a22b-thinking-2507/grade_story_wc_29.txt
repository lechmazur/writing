<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Aris’s motive—protect the truth of the signal—drives concrete, risky action, and his “cautiously hopeful” stance threads decisions under pressure. Interiority is particular (spectral lines, grounding schematics) and embodied by tactile choices (rerouting power, bypassing safeties). Internal contradiction is present but light; he largely suppresses institutional anxiety to focus on craft. The moral cost (breaking protocols, risking shutdown) lands and feels earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: protests → cover for tricksters → Aris’s infrasound plan → brief success → power surge cost → charged final stance. Orientation is clean from the first paragraph (who, where, when). Closure arrives as a Charged Poise: a clear signal gained at the price of likely administrative reprisal, with the rolled chart as concrete proof. The only soft spot is the speculative leap in method, but it’s seeded and paid off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The station’s infrastructure (deep-earth grounding rods, feed horn) materially constrains and enables the tactic, and protests as environmental pressure register as interference. Technical specificity (21-cm line, Cygnus X‑1) is filtered through Aris’s expert attention. The final image is charged by place and tools (chart as banner; vibration in bedrock). A touch more spatial choreography of the station under stress could have pushed higher.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear and tight: preserve/clarify the cosmic signal before institutional shutdown. Escalation is protagonist-driven—the infrasound counterpulse beats the tricksters briefly, then triggers a power surge that narrows options and raises cost. The administrators’ exploit of the surge as pretext is plausible and sharpens consequences. Stakes remain personal/institutional rather than global, which fits the scope.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The mirrored “power plays” above and below integrate with action rather than mere commentary, culminating in a quiet defiance that reweights the conflict from committee rooms to evidence in hand. Recurring images (static vs clean signal; charts as maps of resistance) earn the ending’s resonance. The theme is stated a bit overtly in places, slightly dulling subtext. Still, the final whisper of the cosmos lands as an earned counterpoint to noise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>POV control is steady, with a technical-lyric texture that feels character-specific and confident. Diction balances astrophysical precision and tactile immediacy without head-hopping. Some repeated phrasing (“power plays”) edges toward rhetorical overuse. Rhythm holds under stress, especially through the surge and alarm sequence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Sentences carry multiple jobs (world, motive, action) and maintain momentum; the surge sequence is especially tight. Minor redundancies and intensifier stacking appear but don’t stall clarity. Figurative choices are mostly clean and apt; technical terms are accurate and purposeful. The final line resolves by image and avoids scaffolding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Repurposing grounding infrastructure to transmit infrasound that affects a radio signal is a distinctive, character-driven tactic, and the Earth-as-tuning-fork image is memorable. The campus unrest as cover for cosmic deception is a sharp, fresh mirror. The piece takes a risk by marrying technical plausibility with lyric closure and largely pulls it off. Slight familiarity in the academia-versus-truth frame keeps it shy of the top band.</comment>
