<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Clear, character‑specific motivation—escape before inheriting his father’s disbelief—drives the piece, embodied by tactile cues (cold bars, salt spray). The internal tension between inherited lie and private truth is present, though slightly stated rather than dramatized in contradiction. Micro‑choices (not turning the knob, carrying the lattice, choosing hush over plea) reveal values under pressure. A felt change occurs as he renounces being defined by his father, though the emotional cost could be shaded with one sharper conflicting impulse.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV, one continuous sequence, clean anchors (boy, lighthouse prison, reef) and a coherent magical rule introduced and held (the beam’s “sustaining” quality). Under an accumulative/textural lens, pressure tightens as bodies are found, guards mobilize, and the beam enables a charged path to the ledge. Closure is a Decisive Change—escape into the sea—with conceptual cost (self‑erasure, perpetual suspicion avoided only by vanishing). A touch more on‑page price in the last image would push this higher.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The lighthouse/reef/beam ecology is vivid and functional: the rotating lamp and confessional architecture shape tactics and enable the impossible hover. Sensory detail is purposeful (salt dust, copper glow, scuffed door) and filtered through the boy’s urgency. The setting constrains choices and charges the final image (release onto the ledge, copper‑dark sea). World rules remain consistent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (escape before blame fixes to him) is clear and tightened by the clock and discovery. The choice to pursue hush via the confessional and beam is an internal/external fusion that forecloses pleading or confrontation. Cost is implied in self‑effacement and risk of the sea rather than overtly felt harm; still, the narrowing of options is legible. A sharper external obstacle or immediate loss would elevate escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Themes of truth, confession, and inherited disbelief are woven through particulars (lattice as talisman, confessional as portal, hush vs alarm). The closing image reweights the premise: he chooses silence to assert truth, not to hide it. A few abstract declarations (“weight of inherited lies,” “sustain the impossibility of his innocence”) edge toward telling, but the images carry the load. Resonance lingers without tidy moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a distinct, lyrical texture keyed to copper light, hush, and salt. Rhythm modulates with pressure, and the perceptual signature (objects noticed, choices framed) feels character‑bound. Purposeful elision around the magic reads taught and paid off via pattern. Slightly elevated diction risks uniformity, but remains coherent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong, efficient lines with layered images doing multiple jobs; momentum largely holds. Minor recurrence verges on redundancy (“threaded the labyrinth with his own story” twice; “copperlight repose” reiterated), but doesn’t stall clarity. Figurative language stays coherent to the lamp/sea/confessional palette. No scaffold clutter or syntax monotony detectable under pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: a lighthouse‑prison built on a monastery, a confessional lattice as talisman, and a beam that “sustains impossibilities” reframing the “cry wolf” legacy. The hover is a fresh, character‑charged solution rather than a gimmick. Risks in tone and concept cohere and land in the ending image. Feels singular and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
