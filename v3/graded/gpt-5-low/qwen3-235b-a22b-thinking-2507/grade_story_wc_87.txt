<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Leo’s contradictory impulses—drawn to open water yet forcing himself shoreward—play out in embodied choices (humming through tears, counting poles, dropping the compass, beached with phone in hand). Specific memories (missed graduation, first crab) sharpen motive and cost. A slight overuse of explicit labels (“align heart and action,” repeated “merrily melancholic”) trims the edge of subtlety but doesn’t undercut credibility.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single‑scene, tightly framed moment: kayak launch to muddy bank. The closure lands on the page with cost via the renunciation of the compass and the charged act of turning and reaching for the phone. The inferred lens is Situational with causal linkage; pressure coheres from clouds/failed stars → utility poles → current vs intent → shore. No orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting details are vivid and purposeful: overcast sky and useless compass constrain tactics, utility poles become an improvised navigation system, current pulls toward open water, muddy bank dictates the landing. The final image (sun gilding poles) charges prior objects and the choice. Sensory economy stays character‑biased and lived.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (presence vs pursuit) is clear early and tightens through concrete turns: counting poles, the current’s pull, the drop of the compass, and the shoreward pivot. The cost is legible and enduring—abandoning his old navigational idol and confronting feared contact. Escalation remains coherent without needing an antagonist.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Themes of atonement and choosing presence emerge through images and action (compass vs poles, clouds vs sliver of sun), not just assertion. The ending reweights earlier motifs without a moral lecture, though phrases like “utility poles of obligation” edge toward explicit thesis. The resonance lingers in the charged decision and the reconfigured tools.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The close third‑person voice is consistent, briny, and image‑driven, with rhythmic control that tightens under stress. Refrains (“merrily melancholic”) risk over-marking but the acoustic of shanty/sea works and never slips out of Leo’s plausible lexicon. No dialogue needed; interior cadence carries action.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Clean, propulsive lines with purposeful figurative work tied to nautical life. Minor redundancy (repeated label phrases; a couple of sentiment‑near abstractions) slightly slows momentum in spots but does not blur causality or the closing image. Syntax varies and the final line lands clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Redemption at sea is familiar, but the fresh spine—navigating by utility poles when the stars fail—feels specific and inevitable in hindsight. The compass renunciation is a crisp, original token of cost. The piece takes a quiet risk by letting a small physical turn carry moral weight without spectacle.</comment>
