<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Aris’s motive—guarding the inner spark—consistently drives concrete choices (decoding the seed, planting under a live sweep). The interiority is specific and embodied (the cracked spectacles, soil, drone light) but shows little contradictory impulse or wobble under stress. He reads highly competent with minimal visible struggle, softening the felt cost. The relationship with Elara adds pressure and context but doesn’t force a hard trade-off.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Clear causal chain: decode → plan to “warp” → plant before dawn → Harmonizer pulse → garden disrupts. Orientation is clean within the first lines and the single transition is motivated. Closure lands on the page as a localized disruption (Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid), though the price is more implied risk than paid consequence. The lens holds as Causal with light textural accumulation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The greenhouse, community garden, drones, and Harmonizers are vivid and purposeful; the gourd seed functions as object-as-setting that charges the final image. Environmental resources (gourds) directly constrain tactics and outcome. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Aris’s perspective, keeping momentum. World rules remain consistent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—plant and warp the pattern before the census—tightens with the drone sweep and the arriving Harmonizer pulse. The decisive act is planting under imminent scan, which momentarily confuses the drone and counters the pulse. Cost is present as exposure and urgency but feels light; no clear loss or painful trade-off is paid on-page. Still, pressure coheres and escalates appropriately for the length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Themes of resistance-as-craft and communal cultivation arise organically from the tactic of making the garden the message. A few lines verge on thesis (“they cannot tax the geometry of resistance,” “the message is chaos”), slightly flattening subtext. The ending image reweights prior material—laughter and a flicker of anger signal restored agency. Resonance lingers without a tidy moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Voice is distinctive—lush but controlled—and maintains a consistent POV with clean dialogue mechanics. Elevated diction suits Aris and the clandestine, scholarly milieu. Minor slogan-like lines skim didacticism yet don’t break voice coherence. Rhythm varies with pressure and lands the final cadence cleanly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and economical, with images doing multiple jobs (the gourd seed as tool, symbol, and acoustic counter). A few high-register aphorisms introduce mild purple notes but clarity holds, and there’s little scaffold or repetition. Syntax and paragraphing support momentum through the planting and pulse beats. Figurative density stays legible at the peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: gardening patterns as aerial ciphers and gourds as frequency jammers is fresh within a dystopian frame. The tactic grows from world rules and character, not a late gimmick. While the surveillance-state backdrop is familiar, the soil-based subversion and acoustic twist feel specific and memorable. Risk-taking in concept heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
