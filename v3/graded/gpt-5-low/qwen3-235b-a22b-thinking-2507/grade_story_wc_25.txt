<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Silas’s competence, ethos (“whispers travel farther than shouts”), and gait-reading are dramatized through concrete micro‑choices under pressure. The interiority is efficiently embodied (mimicking walks, pebble flick) rather than explained. Internal contradiction is light—this is more an earned stasis/validation than a fraught change—so the emotional cost remains modest. Still, actions consistently align with motive and reveal character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal drive is clean: map → key → path → obstacles (collapsed walkway, overseer) → adapted tactics → delivery → response note. Closure lands on the page with a concrete success and conceptual price/validation under the “quiet methods” ethos. The cost is mainly risk and stealth, not a heavy sacrifice, but it remains legible. Orientation is crisp early and the single-scene arc stays coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The container labyrinth and geomagnetic storm are tactile, rule‑bearing constraints that shape every tactic (echoes, sirens failing, bridge workaround, bioluminescent map). Tools and environment actively gate access and enable the crossing. The final image is charged by setting-logic (aurora, humming metal, hidden mechanism). Specificity stays POV‑filtered through a veteran worker’s eyes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear (deliver by dawn to avert crane sabotage and prove a method), with meaningful tightening through patrols, the collapsed walkway, and Rourke’s guard. Escalation is protagonist-driven: using the key to reveal a path; mimicking gaits; whisper‑precision distraction. Price is primarily exposure risk rather than a loss, but the narrowing options and adapted tactics land.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The “whispers over shouts” theme is organically embodied in tactics and environmental acoustics, culminating in the quiet proof note. However, the closing sentence states the thesis a touch outright, edging toward moralizing rather than letting the image alone resonate. Subtext still works via echoes, footsteps, and the storm’s noise failing where subtlety succeeds.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>A controlled third‑person close with a distinct perceptual signature (occupational noticing, rhythm tuned to the maze). Diction and cadence fit the character’s competence without register drift; images recur with intention. Dialogue is minimal by design; the barked orders function as ambient pressure rather than speech scenes, keeping POV stable.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lines are vivid and purposeful (“tuning forks,” “whisper-precision”) with good syntactic variety and momentum. Figurative texture is rich but mostly disciplined and legible; minimal redundancy or scaffold. A few high-color phrases approach purple but do not obscure causality or dull the closure beat. Information density remains high throughout.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis feels fresh: a bioluminescent, fold‑cipher map keyed by a “lockless” key amid a geomagnetic storm, paired with gait mimicry and a philosophy of quiet action. Turns arise from these specifics rather than generic stealth tropes. The Whisperer challenge and port‑labyrinth world produce memorable images and tactics that would not transpose easily. Ingenuity serves character and pressure, not gimmickry.</comment>
