<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Clear, particular interiority and tactile choices (pruning deeper, salvaging the seed, keeping vigil) reveal a stubborn, tender resolve. The tasting of memories embodies emotion without therapy‑speak and informs micro‑choices. Internal contradiction is present but quiet—pain/ache versus persistence—rather than a sharp split. A few thesis-like lines (“gentle rebellion”) tell what the images already show.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pruning, tasting, clearing space, planting, and vigil accrete toward the charged dawn image. Closure lands with the shoot’s emergence and her tasted memory of resilience (RR/Charged Poise) with a felt cost (fatigue, time, risk). Orientation is clean early; world rules (alignment-enabled growth) are taught and then paid off. The arc is quiet but coherent, with no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The rusted greenhouse, caved‑in sun patch, iron lattice, and blackberry cluster do real work, guiding tactics (where to plant, what to prune) and charging the final image. Sensory specificity is high and POV‑filtered through a chef’s palate. The environment evolves with action and the celestial light shapes the scene’s cadence. Objects recur with purpose (shears, dented can, beam), not as postcards.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around creating beauty from neglect under a ticking cosmic window; she adapts (prunes deeper, selects the sun‑dappled corner, endures through the night). The cost is present (ache, stamina, a stolen seed’s ethical sting) but relatively soft, with no on‑page opposing actor. The alignment’s peak provides a meaningful tightening. Stakes remain intimate and legible throughout.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Themes of reclamation, embodied memory, and hope as labor arise through concrete acts and sensory echoes (bitter jasmine grief → blackberry joy → resilience). The final image reweights the premise without a didactic bow. Occasional explicit framing (“quiet revolution,” “how to heal without a single shout”) leans toward statement over subtext. Overall resonance is earned and lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a distinct sensory signature—culinary metaphors and neural language align with the character’s lens. Rhythm varies well, modulating around the vigil and dawn. Elevated diction fits the lyrical mode without slipping registers. No head‑hopping or stance confusion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lines are vivid and purposeful; images often carry double duty (cut scent → memory). Minor density/echoes (“synaptic plasticity” repeats, a few thesis phrases) flirt with over‑explanation but do not stall momentum. Syntax and paragraphing create clean propulsion from setup through dawn. No figurative muddle in the close.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—chef who tastes memories, a knowledge fruit, and a cosmic‑aided growth in a rusted greenhouse—feels fresh and internally coherent. Risks (science‑lyric blend, quiet revolutionary frame) pay off in a distinctive voice and closure image. Turns arise from prior particulars rather than gimmick. It’s memorable without resorting to tropey scaffolding.</comment>
