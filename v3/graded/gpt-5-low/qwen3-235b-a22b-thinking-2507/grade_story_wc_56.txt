<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is precise and consistent, and her tactile engagement with the sundial grounds her interiority. The shift from legend‑chasing to dismantling fraud is credible and earned by her training and discovery. However, internal conflict is relatively frictionless; the epiphany arrives cleanly with limited on‑page resistance. Emotional cost is implied more than embodied.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece builds toward a Conceptual Repricing: the sundial reweights the entire legend and redirects her mission. Orientation is clear early (towpath at dawn, radio silence) and causality holds (training → salvage → inscription → realization → purpose). Closure lands in her decision to pursue the radio archives, with a felt conceptual price of relinquished myth. The cost is real but quiet, keeping it below the very top band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The canal and the “silence of morning radio” are vivid and purposeful, not postcard filler. The canal’s altered route becomes evidentiary, and the sundial functions as a charged micro‑setting that shapes discovery and the final image. Sensory detail is selective and aligned with her professional gaze. The environment presses gently rather than coercively, but it charges the ending effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes center on epistemic integrity and reclaiming narrative, and the tightening comes when the sundial reframes the myth as survey fraud. Escalation is primarily internal, coherently deepening rather than sharply reversing. The final choice forecloses the magical‑artifact path in favor of investigative labor. The price is subdued—no acute loss on the page—limiting peak tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: truth versus myth, media complicity, and capital’s sleight‑of‑hand. The sundial’s refiguring from mystical object to survey tool is a strong thematic pivot that lingers. A few lines edge toward thesis (“capital dressed theft in wonder”), but the closing image—sundial as compass toward justice—carries resonance without sermonizing. The piece invites reflection beyond its scene.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The voice is controlled, lucidly lyrical, and consistent in focalization. Diction suits a trained, skeptical seeker, and the narrative stance remains close and credible. Recurrent phrasing (“silence of morning radio,” “training instincts”) feels intentional, not mechanical. No dialogue is needed for this mode, and none is missed.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is clean, with strong verbs and purposeful images that pull double duty. Minor repetition skirts paraphrase loop but largely functions as motif. Rhythm varies well and the final lines land with economy. No muddled metaphors or register drift appear in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The reframing of a myth via infrastructural fraud and radio’s role in perpetuation feels fresh and specific. The sundial as survey tool repurposed—then re‑repurposed as a moral compass—shows ingenuity tied to character. Risks are measured and coherent, if not radical. The synthesis reads inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
