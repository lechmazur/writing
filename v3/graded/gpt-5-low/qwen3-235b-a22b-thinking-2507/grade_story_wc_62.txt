<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Silas’s motive—to transmute solitary grief into a collective vessel—is clear and enacted through embodied, trade‑off laden choices (ribbons tied at charged sites). The gravestone carver’s worldview (stone vs “space between”) generates a credible inner conflict reframed by Corvin. He pays a visible cost (first tears since the funeral) that forecloses the old stance. Minor note: the mentor’s guidance edges toward neatness, but the change still reads earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: ritual actions densify meaning until a cadence shift (the monarchs form a bowl). Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: grief redefined as greenhouse‑vessel, with cost marked on the page. Orientation is crisp early; each move (look up → ribbons → reconfiguration) coheres. The spectral nudge is causal without shortcutting the earned final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The ancient greenhouse is indelible and operative: iron bones, ivy, dusk light, and rafters shape the butterflies’ collective pattern and the final bowl image. Objects (ribbons, rose cane, cracked fountain) are site‑specific and charge choices. Environmental logic is consistent and POV‑filtered through a stone carver’s sensibility. The closing greenhouse-as-grief metaphor is earned through the place’s architecture.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes are singular—can he find a shape for collective grief—and pressure coheres as he ties successive ribbons, each reweighting the moment. The “look up” beat tightens options by challenging his default (stone) tactic. The cost is emotional and credible, even without an antagonist. Escalation is subtle but sufficient for this lens, cresting at the bowl formed by monarchs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme arises organically from ritual, craft, and migration—memory living in “space between” lines and wings—culminating in the charged vessel image. The Neruda/Dickinson/Rilke threads weave a non‑literal answer without overexplaining. A slight on‑the‑nose tilt comes via Corvin’s explicit thesis statement, but the scene work carries the resonance. The afterimage lingers as communal remembrance versus monumentalization.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The lyric voice is controlled, textural, and POV‑true; diction reflects Silas’s craft and grief without register slips. Dialogue is spare and purposeful, with Corvin’s lines operating as action rather than exposition. Rhythm modulates to match pressure, culminating in a clean, resonant final cadence. No head‑hopping or stance wobble.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is dense yet precise; metaphors (stone, wings, vessel) harmonize without muddle. No noticeable loops or scaffolding; sentences carry multiple jobs and propel scene and mood. A high figurative quotient risks purple, but clarity remains intact, especially at closure. Syntax variety and clean mechanics support momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis—gravestone carver, poem‑ribbons, spectral mentor, monarch swarm forming a bowl—feels fresh and inevitable by the end. Risk‑taking in the ritualized action and living mosaic pays off without gimmickry. The greenhouse as grief reframes familiar mourning tropes with specificity. Closure grows directly from these uniques rather than generic images.</comment>
