<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Motivation is crystalline—save and plant the seeds—and actions align under pressure (decoding, retrieving, planting, shielding). Embodied perception is vivid (chains, dust, tremors), but internal contradiction is minimal; she almost never wavers. “Patience was her shield” is dramatized, yet her competence rarely missteps. The endurance choice at the end carries cost but not much moral friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: decode → open drawer → retrieve seeds → plant → shield, each “therefore” tightening under the crumbling wall. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she forecloses self‑preservation to anchor the seeds, with visible physical cost on the page. Orientation is clean from the opening image and never wobbles. The arrow rule and piano code are set and paid off without late conveniences.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The abandoned carnival is specific and tactile (ticket dispensers, prize counter, skylight dust), and the micro‑setting constrains tactics—the counter hides the access panel; chains and collapsing structure shape choice. The arrow‑as‑tool and debris alter movement and outcomes, charging the last image. Sensory balance favors the visual with effective dust/smell accents. World rules remain consistent within the piece’s slightly speculative tilt.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear and present early; siege pressure coheres and intensifies with each structural shudder. The meaningful tightening arrives as the wall starts to give, forcing immediate decoding and then the irreversible act of shielding the seeds. Price is legible in her bodily sacrifice under the beam. One could want a sharper mid‑scene reversal, but the escalation is coherent and earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Resilience through sacrifice and the redefinition of “liberation” emerge organically from action (chains as eventual anchor). Recurring images (chains, arrow, dry soil) reweight at the end without sermonizing. A couple of declaratives (“It would be enough”) skate near assurance, but the dust‑quiet finality and rain scent keep sentiment earned. The vault’s loss reframed as purpose‑fulfilled delivers a resonant conceptual shift.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Consistent close third with lyrical compression that fits the character’s resolve; no head‑hopping or stance drift. Diction maintains a controlled elevated register without breaking plausibility for the world. Rhythm tightens under pressure and modulates around the decoding and collapse beats. Minor repetitions (“staggering grace”) are intentional but slightly audible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lines carry high information density with strong verbs and concrete images; momentum rarely stalls. Occasional purple glints and repeated metaphoric frames (“staggering grace,” “the wall… life will rise”) introduce a faint echo. Syntax varies cleanly and action sequencing is clear. No major scaffolding or filter‑verb stacks; proofreading is clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The fusion of a derelict carnival, a seed vault, and a jewel‑beetle fletched arrow that projects a code feels fresh and integrated. The arrow’s re‑use as a trowel is a memorable, earned reweighting. Emotional truth (sacrifice for future fertility) avoids generic apocalypse beats through specific objects and tactics. Risks in lyric tone and world detail cohere without gimmickry.</comment>
