<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—preserving the prophecy by mapping silence—remains precise and propulsive under pressure. Her interiority is embodied (ink‑salted fingers, ear to cold stone) and consistent. Internal contradiction is subtle (shore‑born attunement versus ridge‑fort vigilance) rather than overtly dramatized, which keeps this shy of elite. Her final stance (silence as ground) feels earned by accumulated micro‑choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the pattern of lulls and roars builds to the “one star” hinge and the final blackout. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the endless night becomes navigable via the shape of silence. Cost is legible—the star winks out, the world darkens; she chooses charged poise over light. Orientation is clean early and the single scene respects scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The ridge fort and storm actively shape tactics (listening for lulls, pressing ear to stone, arrow‑slit salt spray that contrasts with the shore). The flaking gold leaf booklet functions as a charged micro‑setting that constrains care, and the candle’s guttering marks time and risk. Sensory detail is purposeful across senses, never touristic. The environment decisively charges the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finish the map before the light dies) is clear and tightened by the countdown to the last star. Escalation arises through deepening attention to silence rhythms, culminating in the total blackout. The price is conceptual endurance rather than injury or loss, but it reads on the page. A slightly sharper on‑page trade‑off would push this higher.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme coheres through recurring, reweighted images (lulls as glyphs, silence as topography) culminating in silence reframed as footing. The insight is earned by sensory labor rather than stated moral, though the final line edges close to a thesis. Ambiguity remains purposeful: the map is hope, not a fix. Resonance lingers beyond the scene.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The lyrical third‑person close is steady, with a distinct perceptual signature keyed to acoustics and texture. Rhythm modulates with pressure—surges during wind, lengthens in lulls—without head‑hopping or register slips. Diction stays character‑plausible and pattern‑taught. No withholding or omniscient leakage undermines stance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is lush but largely clean; figurative density serves pattern (ambered hush, marbled stillness) and remains coherent. Minor repetition (“flaking gold leaf booklet”) functions as motif rather than scaffold. Momentum holds with good sentence variety and purposeful compression. A hair more pruning of modifiers could sharpen the high‑pressure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mapping silence as navigational cartography of an apocalypse is a fresh, integrated conceit. The “ambered hush” and single‑star clock create singular texture and pressure. Risks in lyric accumulation pay off at closure without obscuring clarity. The synthesis feels distinctive and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
