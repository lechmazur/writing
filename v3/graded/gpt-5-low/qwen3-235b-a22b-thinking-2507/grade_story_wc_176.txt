<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—to preserve erased voices—drives every micro‑choice and is filtered through her craft competence. The guilt-to-forgiveness arc is credible and rooted in tactile action (aligning holes, rebraiding, pouring bronze). Internal contradiction is quieter (fear vs. hard‑won calm) and could show more friction under pressure. The final endurance/renunciation (accepting emotional exposure as cost) reads earned, if a touch tidy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ritual steps intensify to illumination, then to casting, with a felt emotional price. Orientation is crisp from the first line; setup → method → activation → preservation is coherent. Closure lands on‑page as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the names’ sound becomes light fixed in bronze, and she exits changed. The cost is primarily emotional and conceptual rather than material, but it’s legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The sanctum, ice, aurora, rope, and brittle card are not wallpaper; they constrain choices and charge the final image (alignment under auroral pulses, fragility in cold, light etched into frost). Sensory detail is selective and purpose‑driven, matching a caster’s eye. World rules stay consistent and are learned through her acts. The environment functions as both resource and pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear and escalates via steps that narrow options: brittle scrap → precise rebraiding → aurora flare test → irreversible casting. The meaningful tightening is the decision to pull taut and then pour bronze, foreclosing revision. Prices are largely internal, but the risk of loss and the irrevocability of casting create tension. A slightly sharper on‑page jeopardy spike would elevate further.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Themes of forgiveness as groundwork and preservation as resistance emerge organically through objects and action (card → rope → light → bronze). The “Forgiveness had been the key, but preservation was the gift” line edges into stated moral, softening subtext. Still, the final constellation of bronze/light under ice provides an earned, resonant answer. Complexity remains, with resistance to oblivion framed as tender craft rather than sermon.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is steady and confident; diction and rhythm match a meticulous artisan in a sacred space. Lyric cadence flexes with pressure (calm precision to flaring aurora to quiet aftermath). No head‑hopping or stance drift; inference reads as inference. A few intensity spikes flirt with purple, but the voice remains controlled.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and efficient enough, with strong verbs and concrete handling; images often do double duty. Some modifier stacking and repeated rhetorical flourishes (“technically gentle,” “snowmelt ardor”) approach excess but do not blur sense or stall momentum. Syntax varies and supports propulsion through the ritual. Copy is clean and sequentially clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Combining lost-wax metallurgy with auroral rope‑braid illumination and a street‑organ punched card is striking and coherent. The method feels inevitable in hindsight given her craft and motive. The final bronze‑light constellation under ice refreshes the preservation trope. Risk‑taking elevates without obscuring clarity.</comment>
