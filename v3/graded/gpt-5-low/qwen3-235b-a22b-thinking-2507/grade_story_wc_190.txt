<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Silas’s motive—transforming brittle silence into a comforting hush—is clear and consistent, and his tactics (calibrated humming, decibel management) align with it. Interiority is specific to his acoustic mindset, but his competence smooths away friction, and contradictory impulses are muted. The decision to forsake fare is a light cost rather than a crucible. He reads distinct, though the repetition of “fluidly logical” flirts with label over embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, beats cohere from approach → hum calibration → terrace-wide shift, with a clear on‑page reconfiguration when the storm glass clears and the city’s hush changes quality. Orientation is strong early (who/where/when/stakes), and the closure is legible. The cost is mostly conceptual/emotional; tangible risk remains implied, keeping the turn elegant but soft. Still, the arc lands cleanly and earns its final cadence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The drifting prism terrace, earpiece, and storm glass constrain choices (decibel ceiling, vulnerability of thin prisms at the nexus) and charge the final image. Sensory specificity is vivid and character‑filtered through an acoustician’s priorities. World rules (sound shatters prisms, monitored by tools) are consistent and learned via action. Slight tendency toward lyrical ornament doesn’t stall momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes (prevent fracture/transform hush) are signaled early and deepen via the move to the nexus and the raise to 35 dB. Escalation is protagonist‑driven, but the scenario lacks a palpable counterpressure or near‑failure; success arrives with minimal resistance. The emotional release of bystanders and the child’s laugh offers a satisfying, if gentle, pressure payoff. A more visible risk or tradeoff would elevate the tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Silence redefined—from prison to balm—is dramatized rather than declared through image: the storm glass clearing, the terrace’s “sigh,” the child’s laugh absorbed without fracture. Recurring motifs (light, prisms, hum) reweight at the close. One sentence edges toward thesis statement (“teach silence how to comfort”), but it’s backed by action. The piece invites reflection on trauma’s echo without sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The POV’s perceptual signature is distinct—sound metrics, resonance, and measured diction—and remains stable. Lyric cadence matches the meditative stakes and modulates subtly as pressure rises (numbers, adjustments, then release). No head‑hopping or stance drift; certainty stays within the character’s plausible knowledge. Occasional elevated phrasing fits the world and voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lines carry high information density with purposeful imagery; verbs do work and syntax varies. Minor repetition (“fluidly logical” appears twice) and a touch of purple in places don’t obscure clarity. The climax is rendered in concrete beats (32→35 dB, vial’s response) without scaffolding. Rhythm supports the accumulative pressure and breathes on the release.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of sound ecology with a prism‑terrace Venice and a storm glass barometer feels fresh and coherent. “Teaching silence to comfort” executed via calibrated humming is a striking, non‑obvious turn. Closure grows inevitably from seeded particulars (tools, rules, site choice). Risk lies in the quietness of conflict, but the vision is distinctive.</comment>
