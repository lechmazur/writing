<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s motive (recovering the diary to deepen a lifelong ethic of empathy) is clear and consistently dramatized through tactile choices with the tuning forks. Interiority is specific and character‑particular via her taxonomy of silences. Internal contradiction is light—more devotion than struggle—so cost reads primarily as emotional rather than conflicted. Still, the final reorientation toward carrying silence inside feels earned by the scene work.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the pattern of attempts (C, E‑flat, A 432Hz) coheres and deepens pressure toward the opening. Orientation is clean early (workshop, fireworks pending, singular goal). Closure lands on‑page with the clasp blooming and a conceptual repricing of silence/empathy; cost is subtle but legible in her tears and the relinquished need for the lock. The causal thread stays intact without teleports or resets.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The workshop and tuning forks function as micro‑setting constraints that shape tactics and outcome; the fireworks’ hush versus blast charges the final image. Sensory detail is purposeful and POV‑filtered (rosin dust, brass petals, moth wings). The environment evolves with action (hum, glow, opening) and culminates in listening past the spectacle to the “deeper silence.” Setting is not postcard; it governs choices and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear and time‑pressured by the impending fireworks; escalation occurs through successive, distinct frequency tests with a meaningful tightening at the E‑flat hum. The decisive turn is the A‑432 choice grounded in her grandmother’s lore. The price is primarily internal and conceptual, not a hard trade‑off, keeping the pressure strong but gentle. Still, agency drives the resolution without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Themes of empathy and silence emerge organically from objects, actions, and her practiced listening. The diary line about silence and breath is a potent image that reweights prior material. A touch of explicit moralizing (“For empathy had been recovered…”) slightly flattens subtext in the final third. Overall resonance lingers through the final shared‑awe image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The voice is lyrically controlled with a distinct perceptual signature (naming silences, musical lexicon) and stable POV. Rhythmic modulation suits pressure—hushed attention in attempts, widened cadence at fireworks. Minimal dialogue is apt and voice‑true. Occasional flourish edges purple but remains legible and character‑motivated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is tight, with vivid verbs and layered images doing multiple jobs. A few dense metaphors risk saturation, but syntax varies and momentum holds. No significant loops or scaffold; cause/effect stays clear through the peak beat. Final image lands crisply without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The frequency‑locked diary and taxonomy of silences are fresh, integrated, and emotionally grounded. The fireworks’ counterpoint to inward quiet reframes spectacle with human connection. The mechanism (harmonic resonance of truth) is both inventive and thematically coherent. The synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight without gimmickry.</comment>
