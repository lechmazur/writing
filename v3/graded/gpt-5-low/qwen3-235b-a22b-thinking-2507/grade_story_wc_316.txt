<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Aris’s numbness-as-wall is embodied and motivates concrete choices, culminating in choosing connection at real emotional cost (tears, vulnerability). His internal contradiction—void versus yearning to feel—operates in-scene. Kael is one-note but applies credible pressure that reveals Aris. A touch of told motivation (“His motivation was clear”) slightly flattens interiority early.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clear causal chain: Kael’s ultimatum → Aris decides to act → vivification → legal/personhood shift and inner thaw. Closure lands on the page with both external reconfiguration (custody conceded) and internal change. Cost is emotionally legible though not protracted. Orientation is strong from the opening and the lens holds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The floating dojo and history-rewriting skyline are vivid, selectively described, and integrated (tilting platform, stuttering history reflecting the inner stakes). The brain-in-jar micro-setting charges beats and the final image. World rules feel consistent for this fable-like frame. Setting could constrain tactics slightly more rather than primarily mirror emotion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (custody/personhood bound to Aris’s capacity to feel) is signaled early, with a meaningful tightening at Kael’s threat of force. Escalation is driven by Aris’s choice to vivify, reweighting options decisively. The resolution tilts quickly with minimal resistance, reducing felt price and aftershock on the page. Still, the external concession and internal shift interlock cleanly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of complementary opposites and personhood-through-connection emerges through action and images (warm palm vs cold fluid, constellated neural light). However, the closing moral statements (“defeating numbness required connection, not control”) are explicit, reducing subtext. The final image of the pulsing brain and settled meadow retains resonance despite the didactic edge.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and textured; the perceptual signature—stoic clarity under surreal flux—fits Aris. Dialogue functions as pressure and status—Kael’s clipped certainty contrasts Aris’s inward attention. Slight register lift toward aphorism at the end softens the edge. Overall, rhythm and diction are controlled under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Sentences carry momentum with purposeful imagery; several lines do double duty (setting as emotional mirror). A few abstractions and repeated constructions (“complementary opposites,” moral summaries) verge on purple or redundant in the final third but do not obscure causality or dull the closure image. Overall clarity and propulsion remain strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: floating rock dojo, corporate clone custody, and metaphysical vivification via opposites feels fresh and thematically coherent. The decisive turn arises from established elements rather than a late rule-change. Minor conventional notes (corporate enforcer as foil) keep it shy of exceptional. Still, the final reweighting is memorable.</comment>
