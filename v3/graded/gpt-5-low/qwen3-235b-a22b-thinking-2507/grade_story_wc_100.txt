<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas’s motive—an undertaker seeking to give rest a permanent address—drives every action and coheres with his inadvertent stubbornness. Interiority is concrete (calloused fingers, groaning bell) and filtered through his trade; he adapts precision from burial to restoration. The cost lands in his chosen endurance: “his own rest forever deferred.” Minor shortfall: simultaneous contradictory impulses are more implied than dramatized in‑scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: package → descent → navigation of the library → alignment of the cracked lens → calming beam → spirits settle. Closure is an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: he restores rest for the lost while accepting ongoing duty as price. The cost is explicit and on the page at the ending image. The single-scene window is coherent and honors scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The underwater library and lighthouse infrastructure aren’t just decorative; they constrain tactics (diving bell, pressure, corroded housing) and supply resources (sunken workshops). Sensory specificity is rich across modalities: cold glass, bioluminescence, water vibrations, silted shelves. The setting charges the final sweep of light, making the environment inseparable from the closure. World rules feel consistent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes are singular and legible—granting rest to the unburied dead—and the pressure coheres as he descends and works under the ocean’s claim. The meaningful tightening is the choice to use the crack as a prism, transforming a flaw into a tactic with consequence. The cost—ongoing maintenance, deferred rest—reads at the end. Escalation is steady rather than sharp, but appropriate for the length and mode.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Themes of grief, repair, and transforming damage into service emerge through concrete acts rather than statement. The broken lens becoming a prism reframes loss into a sustaining vigil, and “chased stillness” complicates peace with fragility. The final image reweights the premise without moralizing, inviting reflection on duty versus rest. Ambiguity is purposeful and resonant, not vague.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The lyrical third‑person close sticks to Silas’s perceptual signature—tools, bodies, and rites—and maintains consistent stance. Diction is elevated but character‑credible for a ritual-minded undertaker, and rhythm modulates with pressure. No head-hopping or cheap elision; the voice carries accumulated weight into the ending. Slight flourish risk remains, but control holds.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is vivid with high information density; most sentences do multiple jobs (world, mood, pressure). Occasional intensifiers (“silent scream,” “chased stillness”) edge toward purple but remain coherent and purposeful. Syntax varies and sequencing is clear; minimal scaffolding or loops. The final line cleanly resolves by image without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>An undertaker restoring a drowned city’s lighthouse lens to soothe spectral unrest via bioluminescence is a fresh synthesis. The object’s unique use (aligning a crack into a prism) feels inevitable in hindsight and thematically integral. Risks in tone and imagery pay off without obscuring clarity. The piece commits fully to its premise and avoids template moves.</comment>
