<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara’s motive is clear and consistent—hush the coded prophecy—and her micro‑choices (mapping silence, placing and dipping the wing, pushing harder) align with that aim. Embodied stress is present (sweat, steady fingers, breath work), though inner contradiction is minimal; she reads more as composed practitioner than conflicted person. The cost lands as endurance and the loss of the tool rather than a deep personal rupture. Strong, focused, but short on layered ambivalence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Single continuous scene with clean anchors (Elara at the brook at night) and a coherent accumulative/textural drive: density of hush vs. coded hum builds to a cadence shift where the prophecy is contained. Closure is on‑page: the wing is spent, the air loosens, and she remains to guard—an Earned Stasis with tangible price. Because/therefore links are steady, with no teleports or resets. Cost is felt but modest, keeping this just shy of the top band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The brook and stone function as operative setting, not wallpaper: liquid flow carries absorbed discord away and the stone becomes a temporary altar. Sensory detail is vivid and POV‑filtered (moss breathing starlight; paper’s warmth), and the environment constrains tactics (she needs the nexus and current). World rules hold consistently through action rather than exposition. Lush description mostly serves momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible early, and pressure escalates from hovering dissonance to the wing pulsing with captured sound to the final hush. The meaningful tightening comes when the hum seeks purchase and she must “push harder,” channeling silence through the wing as the brook deepens. Price is the tool’s depletion and her ongoing vigil; still, the danger’s on‑page bite is aesthetic more than visceral. Tension is steady and coherent under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Silence as craft and ethic—“mapping silence,” “liquid silence,” “contained within the flow”—organically fuses theme with action. The “terrestrially cosmic” motif reframes harmony between earth and stars without sermonizing, and the final earned stillness reweights the earlier imagery. Resonance persists via the spent wing/altar and the charged promise of her continued watch. The piece avoids tidy moralizing while offering a clear experiential answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third‑person closely held to Elara sustains a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic modulation under pressure. Diction is elevated but consistent with the ritual frame; no head‑hopping or stance slips. Patterned phrases (“terrestrially cosmic,” “smoothed hush”) recur as motif rather than filler, though their repetition skirts excess. No dialogue, but the narrative voice carries subtext and action.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished, with varied syntax and high information density; images often do double duty (tool and theme). A few phrases edge toward purple or redundancy (“terrestrially cosmic” repeats; “liquid silence” is a conceptual near‑double), modestly slowing momentum. Clarity remains intact through the climax; no scaffold loops or filter stacks. The final image is clean and well‑timed.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The ritual of “mapping silence” via an origami wing at a brook is a fresh synthesis of object, method, and setting. While elders/prophecy are genre‑familiar, the tactic and textural build feel singular and committed. The ending’s charged stasis with a spent, inert tool adds a memorable tilt. It’s distinctive rather than radical, with risk taken in lyric density rather than structure.</comment>
