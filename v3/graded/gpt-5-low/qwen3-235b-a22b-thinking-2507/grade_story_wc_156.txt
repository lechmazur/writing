<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara’s internal pivot from habitual certainty to chosen curiosity is legible and grounded in action (the nickel flick). Embodied details (coin’s temperature/weight, brush work) keep her interior alive. The cost of relinquishing certainty reads more conceptual than felt, which softens the turn’s bite. The visitor adds light pressure but doesn’t deepen her contradiction beyond a single nudge.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: nested awakenings escalate density and reweight the central stake. Orientation is clean early (restorer in sound wave garden before a festival query). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing—she adopts a new artistic stance and the world replies. The on‑page cost is implied (risking the job’s certainty) rather than dramatized as a consequence, trimming impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The garden’s tuning fork, mirrors, and resonance chamber integrate tightly with action and directly shape options. Sensory specificity (sound sculpting light, rippling mirrors) feels purposeful and filtered through a restorer’s eye. World rules are learned through doing, not exposition. The environment charges the final image (coin humming; garden “sigh”), enhancing closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around the choice to risk certainty during a public deadline and then intensifies via layered awakenings. The decisive act is hers; the resulting revelations deepen options/knowledge. However, the external stakes remain soft—the visitor’s pressure drops quickly and no concrete negative consequence tests her new stance. Escalation is elegant but low in cost visibility.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Themes of curiosity vs. certainty and art as living resonance emerge organically through the device of reflected sound and the coin. Subtext exists in the “pause between question and reply” and in the mural as sonic record. The explicit thesis line (“Curiosity... is the most vital restoration of all”) edges into moralizing and blunts the otherwise lyrical implication. Still, the final cadence reframes restoration as listening, which lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>POV is steady and confident; diction and rhythm suit a meticulous, sensuous craftsperson. Lyricism modulates with the awakenings without slipping into haze. Dialogue is minimal but functional and natural. No head‑hopping or stance leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sentences carry multi‑function density—image, action, and theme often co‑operate. Repetition patterns read intentional (nested awakenings) rather than padded. A few explicit statements could be trimmed for sharper momentum, but clarity and cadence remain strong. No figurative muddle or mechanical distractions.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The sound‑lit garden, hobo nickel as tuning device, and “recorded pigment” are fresh syntheses. The nested awakening structure feels earned by the method rather than tacked on. Emotional truth (exchanging safety for wonder) lands without gimmickry. Risk is aesthetic rather than plot‑peril, slightly limiting the afterburn.</comment>
