<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Thorne’s contradiction—amoral profiteer with a tender fixation on the lark—drives credible, embodied choices, culminating in the sacramental placement of the egg. Interiority is textured and specific (the boyhood feather, the tactile attention to cracks and salt). Lena’s presence adds just enough social pressure to expose status dynamics without hijacking POV. The final renunciation (leaving the egg) reads earned and costly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is immediate (who, where, what he carries; salt flat; Lena at the jeep) and the structure tightens under the storm’s lull. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: the offering placed, the first raindrop, and his walk away with the pouch emptied—an on‑page cost and foreclosed path. Minor softness in external consequence prevents higher.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The salt flat, cracks, and thunder are vivid, tactile, and character‑filtered, with professional detail (aerial surveys, conduits) shaping how he navigates. Environment constrains choice—the “map” of fissures determines the spot and the storm’s lull narrows the window—while the egg-in-crack image charges the ending. Sensory specificity (crunching earth, gritty salt, first fat raindrop) is selective and purposeful. World rules remain consistent with no expository drag.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether he can enact a meaningful act against the silence he made—is clear. Pressure coheres via the time‑bound lull, Lena’s skepticism, and the choice of the precise fissure; the first raindrop closes his window. The cost is conceptual and emotional rather than peril‑driven but still legible. A shade more antagonistic pressure or a sharper trade‑off would push it higher.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Themes of extraction, false benevolence, and futile atonement emerge from actions and images (egg as offering into the wound he created). The “echo” motif transforms from biology to resonance, reweighted in the final image with the raindrop and emptied pouch. Dialogue carries subtext without sermonizing, though “They remember the song” grazes the edge of overt statement. The aftertaste is complex and unsentimental.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third‑limited voice keeps tight focus on Thorne’s perceptions and compulsions. Diction and rhythm fit his cultivated, obsessive sensibility; the prose modulates with pressure toward the closing cadence. Dialogue is sparse, natural, and status‑aware, adding subtext without exposition. No head‑hopping or stance leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished: strong verbs, purposeful images, and clean mechanics. Occasional high‑register phrasing (“fractured grace incarnate”) toes purple but remains voice‑motivated and clear. No loops or scaffold; sentences carry multiple jobs and sustain momentum. The final line lands with image rather than explanation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The premise—an architect of scarcity making a futile, ritualistic offering to a vanished bird—is fresh and coherently executed. The crack‑map method and drought capital amplify originality beyond trope inversion. The closure feels inevitable in hindsight given his flaw and fixation. Risk is measured and purposeful without obscuring clarity.</comment>
