<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—an honest calculus to save a dishonest father—is specific, credible, and drives each micro‑choice (equations, proposal, refusal to lie). The internal tension (inheritance of brilliance vs. moral rot) is present on the page without therapy‑speak. Some beats feel a touch too tidy—her certainty under stress rarely frays—limiting felt struggle. Still, action and interior align and culminate in a stance with visible cost (only a partial concession secured).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Causal chain is clear: preparation with the ink → constructed proposal → presentation to Reynolds → conditional concession. Single scene, single stake, and the knock/arrival provide a clean turn; closure lands as a Charged Poise with risk remaining (“must be airtight,” board review). The ink’s quasi‑magical influence on Reynolds is implied rather than dramatically tested, softening the cost’s bite. Orientation is early and firm.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The prep room is vividly rendered through smell, tools, rain, and the “deathly vitality” motif, all filtered through Elara’s occupational eye. The vintage ink pot anchors atmosphere and charges the final image. While the environment doesn’t tightly constrain tactics, it meaningfully colors the stakes and tone of the negotiation. Specificity is selective and purposeful, avoiding tour‑guide excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear from the outset, with time pressure and the agent’s entrance tightening the screws. The meaningful turn is Reynolds’ shift from revocation to conditional consideration; agency belongs to Elara’s prepared pitch. Cost is moderate—no guarantee, only a shot—so the pressure doesn’t fully bite down. Still, internal ethics and external stakes interlock effectively.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme—fairness as calculus versus deception—emerges through the specific act of modeling value rather than mere assertion. Life/death imagery in the prep room refracts the ethical bargain, culminating in a resonant final touch on the ink pot. A few explicit thesis lines (“Political asylum wasn’t charity; it was a pact”) flatten subtext slightly. Overall, the ending reweights prior images without didacticism.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The voice is controlled and distinctive, balancing clinical precision and lyric intensity consistent with Elara’s mindset. Dialogue is concise, goal‑driven, and credibly formal on Reynolds’ side versus earnest precision on Elara’s. Occasional elevated phrasing edges toward grandiosity but remains within character plausibility. Psychic distance and tense stay coherent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and dense with purposeful detail; sentences usually do more than one job. A few lines skirt purple (“ink’s viscosity defying gravity,” “alchemy for the mind”) but don’t blur sense. Minimal redundancy and clear sequencing keep momentum intact. Final image lands crisply without scaffolding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Funeral prep room plus a mind‑shifting ink pot brought to bear on an asylum calculus feels fresh and integrated. The “honest child of a con artist” lens enlivens a familiar immigration dilemma. Risk‑taking is measured and coherent, with the charged object and bureaucratic negotiation playing off each other. Slight safety in resolution (board review) keeps it from the very top.</comment>
