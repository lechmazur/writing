<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s motive is crystal: transmute grief by craft, with credible contradictory impulses (“descends while ascending”) embodied in action. Micro‑choices under pressure—continuing to polish through pain, choosing lantern over crane—reveal values with cost. Interiority is concrete (plum blossom scent, knuckles white) and character‑particular. Minor ding for one slightly declarative insight line, but the choice still feels earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Clean accumulative drive: climb → polish → sensation flood → gem reveal → lantern assembly → garden placement, culminating in a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis closure. Causality is tight—polishing triggers pain and clarity; setting the gem reconfigures the dream. The cost (enduring the dream’s tearing and tears) is on‑page at the ending beat. Orientation is clear early; scope is well‑contained.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The basilica, tea garden, geodes, and lantern tools are vivid and purpose‑driven, filtered through Elara’s craft eye. Objects function as micro‑settings that shape tactics (polishing bench, wires, glass) and charge the final image (lantern pulsing in mist; basilica blazing). Sensory detail is balanced—light, texture, sound (chimes). World rules stay consistent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (transform grief/Kael’s last dream) is signaled early and escalates via the painful polishing sequence that narrows options from folding to alchemical labor. The decisive tightening is installing the gem, a committed act that reweights the dream and forecloses passivity. Cost is palpable, though external pressure is primarily internal/lyric. Tension threads sentence‑to‑sentence through bodily and sensory strain.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—art as transmutation of grief; love and loss on one spectrum—emerges through concrete acts, not just assertion. The lantern’s lavender light reframing the dream offers a resonant, non‑literal answer and reweights cranes from grief to hope. One line states the thesis a bit directly, but it’s earned by the scene’s specifics. Ambiguity remains (she climbs again), avoiding tidy moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice with consistent close POV and sensory selectivity; cadence tightens at peaks without head‑hopping. Diction aligns with a maker’s perspective (wires, blown glass, friction) and modulates from knife‑bright to warm lullaby. No dialogue, but the internal rhythm carries subtext. Purposeful elision around rules is taught through action and paid off by closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lines are dense yet clear; images do multiple jobs (light as knife and balm). Repetition (“descends while ascending,” “luminous torment”) functions motif‑wise without sliding into loops. A touch of purple is present but controlled; syntax varies with good propulsion. No noticeable scaffolding or muddled metaphors in the final third.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—dreams in geodes polished into lantern‑light on a floating tea garden—is fresh and cohesive. Turns arise from craft choices, not gimmicks, and the final reconfiguration feels inevitable in hindsight. Risks in worldbuilding and diction pay off without obscuring clarity. Memorable premise and image‑logic elevate beyond trope.</comment>
