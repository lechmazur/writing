<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear, urgent motivation and embodied interiority (“ache in his molars,” “azure coat flapping”) ground him as a competent, “logically emotional” engineer. Micro‑choices under pressure (humming, fractional adjustments) reveal values and resolve. Internal contradiction is light—he rarely wavers—so the arc skews endurance over moral complication. Cost lands as exhaustion and strain rather than a deeper renunciation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: failing harmonics → ascent to lantern → key insertion/tuning → hum and minute adjustments under a sunset clock → harmonic resolution. Closure is a decisive change with cost (physical strain, near‑deadline, tower shuddering). The drive lens reads Causal throughout and holds to the end. Slight ease of success (no major setback) keeps it just shy of the top band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The drift‑ice marina and tower are vividly rendered through sound and cold, and the environment constrains tactics (lantern room access, ice harmonics, sunset). The obsidian key functions as an object‑as‑setting that charges the final image (now warm, glow persisting). Sensory selection aligns with an engineer’s ear‑led perception. World rules stay consistent and are learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake is explicit and present on the page; the sunset clock and increasing dissonance tighten pressure. The meaningful turn is the matched frequency locking the ice into stillness. Price is felt in stamina and risk rather than a hard trade‑off or loss. Lack of a failed attempt or sharper foreclosed option limits escalation’s ceiling.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme coheres: harmony as salvation, the union of math and spirit, protection of fragile systems. The final pure tone reweights prior images without moralizing and delivers a resonant answer. A few on‑the‑nose phrases (“sonic absolution,” “fragility”) flirt with statement but are earned by the concrete struggle. Subtext of stewardship and care emerges through action rather than thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The limited third voice is steady, sensorially precise, and sound‑attuned, with rhythm that tightens under pressure. Lexicon matches character (frequencies, harmonics, offsets) without slipping into didacticism. Slight purple notes (“fleshly ethereal”) brush the edge of register, but clarity remains strong. No dialogue means all weight sits on narration, which holds.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and propulsive, with good sentence variety and momentum; images work in multiple registers. Occasional modifier stacks and lush phrasing risk over‑saturation but do not blur causality. Minimal redundancy; actions and images carry the load. Final cadence is clean and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lighthouse fantasy anchored in acoustic engineering feels fresh; the cryptic “key” as resonant tool is a smart twist. The synthesis of physics and numinous stakes is specific and coherent. Not radical, but confidently executed with memorable particulars. The ending’s sonic reconfiguration feels inevitable from the set‑up.</comment>
