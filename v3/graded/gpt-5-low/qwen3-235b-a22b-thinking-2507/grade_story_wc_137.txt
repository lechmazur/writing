<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is concrete and embodied (salt spray, white knuckles), her skepticism credibly challenged by an on‑page vision, and her choice to risk ridicule for the whales reads motivated. The internal contradiction—skeptic guarding relics vs. latent belief—operates in scene and resolves into a believable stance shift. Slight softness: villagers’ quick acceptance reduces the social price we feel she pays for speaking up.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: tile → vision → knowledge of star‑shift → public risk → communal action; closure is a decisive change (rerouting ships) coupled with an internal reconfiguration (skeptic → witness). Orientation is clear from the first paragraph, and the single transition to the square tracks. The cost lands but could be sharper; community buy‑in arrives a touch easily for maximum consequence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful—the open tower, ocean, dredging vibrations—filtering through Elara’s trained perceptions. The magic tile and tower function as object‑as‑setting that constrain action and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and tied to stakes (whale songs, bruised sky), with world rules learned through action. Minor restraint keeps this just shy of a 9+.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (saving whales vs. risking social standing) is clear, and pressure coheres with one meaningful tightening: the vision reframes the problem and compels public action. The transcriptions as proof are a credible tactic under time pressure (migration underway). Tension would climb higher if resistance at the wharf pressed harder before the turn to agreement.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Listening as repair, interspecies memory, and responsibility emerge from particulars (tile, songs, dredging) rather than thesis. The final reweighting—“not just reflection, but repair” and “witness”—lands as earned repricing of her role. A few explicit lines skirt moralizing, but the concrete images carry most of the load.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Consistent, lyrical third‑person close with a distinct perceptual signature (scientific tools, mythic cadence) and clean modulation under pressure. Dialogue is brief but functional and subtextual, serving action. No head‑hopping or register drift; rhythm tightens effectively at decisive beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong line‑level control: sentences carry multiple jobs, images are fresh and not over‑stacked, and momentum is steady. Minor elevated diction fits the voice and never muddies clarity. No loops or scaffolding evident, and the final line cleanly recharges earlier motifs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Whales, altered stars via dredging, and an obsidian magic square create a distinctive synthesis with emotional truth. The entangled‑memory device is integrated and not a late patch, and the turn to civic action avoids genre cliché. Freshness is high without gimmickry.</comment>
