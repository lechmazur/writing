<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elena’s motive (reviving empathy for Clara) is clear, embodied by her ritual precision and the constraint of prosopagnosia. Interiority is specific (mist density, paces, texture of silk) and actions align with her limits. Contradictory impulses are present but muted (guilt/failure vs. method), so the peak choice feels steadier than conflicted. The small on‑page relationship moment with the man reveals values credibly without overexposure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Hybrid lens with an accumulative build culminating in a causal nudge: the declaration and portrait prompt the witness to surface. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—“the cold case was warming”—with a felt (if modest) cost in Elena’s exposure and long endurance. Orientation is clean early and the single scene holds. The coincidence risk is mitigated by the act that triggers response.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The quarry and mist are specific and functional: they shape her ritual (paces, density notes), cloak the witness’s approach, and charge the final cadence as the mist thins. Details are POV‑filtered (texture of silk, limestone walls) and tone‑aligned. The environment affects access and mood without static postcard listing. Strong object‑as‑setting interplay with the ribbon at closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rekindling the case through empathy) is signaled early and tightens through the declaration and drawing. Escalation is modest but real: solitude/ritual → assertion → witness emergence, with a tangible change in options. The price on the page is mainly emotional exposure rather than a sharp trade‑off. Resolution reads earned under the chosen lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Concealment vs. exposure integrates via mask/ribbon and prosopagnosia; the final image reweights memory into presence. However, explicit thesis lines (“Masks show us…”; “justice found a new path”) edge toward moralizing and reduce subtext. The portrait as essence is a strong thematic vehicle that largely carries the weight. Resonance lingers more through images than arguments.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Voice is steady, lyrical, and filtered through Elena’s perceptual habits; diction suits the mood without head‑hopping. Dialogue is sparse, natural, and advances the turn. Rhythm varies enough to avoid drumbeat monotony. A few repeated constructions are stylistic rather than mechanical and don’t muddy POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Clean, economical lines with purposeful imagery (“lanced the silence,” “furrowed hush”) and good sentence‑level propulsion. Minor purple lean and repetition of key phrases are controlled and serve tone. No significant scaffold or paraphrase loops; clarity remains high. The closing paragraph lightly overstates, but does not blunt the final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>A face‑blind portraitist solving a cold case by rendering essence via a ribbon is a fresh, coherent synthesis. The quarry/mist/mask triad feels specific rather than generic. The witness arrival is familiar but reframed by the art‑as‑summons move. Risks are measured and land without obscuring clarity.</comment>
