<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elias’s motive—hoarding hopes to force an ending—collides with his fear of erasure, producing credible micro‑choices (kneeling, tracing, forcing the shell, then releasing). Embodied cues (salt mist, trembling hands, the shell’s hum) keep his interiority specific. The contradiction—collector vs witness—operates in scene, not summary. The renunciation at the end reads earned and costly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single‑scene accumulative structure is clean: cameos intensify, the failed capture (soldier dissolving) triggers a conceptual pivot, and the final release seals the arc. Orientation is immediate (who/where/why) and the nexus rule‑set is consistent. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with clear cost. No causal seams or soft resets.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The feral nexus, salt mist, and tool‑like shell are not décor; the place shortens cameos and resists preservation, constraining tactics. Sensory detail is selective and POV‑colored (“droplets clung to his coat like liquid stars”). The environment charges the final image of walking out with the hush settling behind him. World rules are learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible early and tightens when the nexus rejects capture (soldier’s star dissolves), forcing a tactic shift to witnessing. The price—abandoning the collecting mission he came for—lands in the release of his younger self’s hope. Pressure coheres under the accumulative lens without needing multiple reversals. Quiet but unmistakable escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—witnessing vs possession under mortality—emerges from ritual acts, failures, and the shell’s limits; the spiral motif reweights at the end. One explicit articulation of thesis (“meant to be witnessed, not hoarded”) is a touch on‑the‑nose, but the closing images do the heavier lifting. Emotional aftereffect is earned and unsentimental. Ambiguity remains in the cost of release.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lyrical third‑limited voice holds steady with a distinct perceptual signature (“swirling hush,” “liquid stars”) and modulates as pressure rises. No head‑hopping or stance drift; compression is purposeful. Rhythm supports turns (from ritual precision to letting go). Lexicon matches the character’s contemplative mode.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lines carry high information density with varied rhythm and clean sequencing. Occasional repetition (“swirling hush,” “solemnize”) skirts lyric redundancy but mostly functions as motif rather than scaffold. Figurative language is controlled and coherent; no mixed vehicles muddy peak beats. Minimal to no copy errors.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The nexus of visible hopes, the shell as imperfect vessel, and the pivot from collecting to witnessing feel fresh and integrated. The spiral/younger‑self echo is an elegant turn that reads inevitable in hindsight. Risks in lyric compression and concept pay off without obscuring clarity. Not derivative of a common template.</comment>
