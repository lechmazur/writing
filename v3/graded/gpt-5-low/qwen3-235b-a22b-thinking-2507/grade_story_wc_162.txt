<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s goal is clear and steadily intensifies: stabilize reality and understand sacred thresholds tied to her father’s disappearance. The final renunciation—bowing instead of rushing—credibly forecloses a path with felt cost. Interiority stays particular (bench grain as “maze corridors”), revealing methodical tenderness under stress. A touch of tidy articulation (“Thresholds feel sacred…”) edges toward thesis but is grounded in character memory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Hybrid lens with an accumulative texture feeding a causal turn: bench-grain decoding → WX‑9 insight → three‑pace step back → terrace stilled and father visible. Closure lands as Charged Poise/Earned Stasis with a clear price: holding distance to preserve reality and relationship. Orientation is clean from the outset; no lens drift. Stakes and tactic linkages are motivated without contrivance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The drifting prism terrace exerts continuous pressure—each step risks rewriting reality—and the wood‑grain bench functions as a micro‑setting tool that constrains her tactic. Environmental rules (butterfly effect, thresholds) are learned through action, not dump. The final image is literally charged by setting: stilling the terrace and the clear pane framing her father.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around a single dominant stake, tightening with “before the terrace dissolved entirely.” The decisive adjustment (WX‑7 → WX‑9 → three paces) is her agency under constraint, and the cost is refusing immediacy of reunion. No antagonist needed; internal and external vectors interlock. Minor abstraction in mid-paragraph explanations slightly blunts tactile strain but not the escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—honoring necessary distance as love—emerges through object use and final posture, not mere assertion. The reprise (“sacredness wasn’t in the threshold itself but in the distance maintained”) risks explicitness yet earns its weight via the bow. Recurring images (grain, codes, thresholds) reweight meaning at the end. Complexity holds: reunion depends on restraint.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A distinct lyrical voice with controlled rhythm and a coherent perceptual signature (“featherly determined,” weather codes braided with wood grain). POV remains tight and plausible; elisions serve pressure. Lexicon toggles (WX codes) feel character‑bound rather than authorial intrusion. No head‑hopping or explanatory overreach.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High information density with vivid, purposeful imagery; lines often do double duty. Occasional purple tint and repetition (“featherly determined,” “fractured hush”) flirt with overstatement but don’t muddle sense or dull closure. Syntax and paragraphing breathe with the scene’s pulse. No loops that stall momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis—corn‑maze aeronautics, bench‑grain divination, and a physics‑of‑love “necessary distances”—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The final Charged Poise risks quietness and lands. Specificity resists template beats; each element reappears with new utility. Bold but not gimmicky.</comment>
