<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation—“to store wonder in the cellar of reason”—is specific and propels concrete, expert choices under time pressure. Embodied grief coexists with disciplined method, though internal contradiction remains modest (she stays largely unruffled). Micro-choices (millimeter tilts, watching reflections not prisms) reveal a precise hierarchy of values. The ending’s endurance choice (keep wonder, not Silas) lands with a quiet cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single-scene causal chain is clean: observation of light → misalignment insight → re‑calibration → captured echo. Closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration with cost: she secures a fragment of Silas while accepting his absence and the season’s narrowing window. Orientation is immediate (who/where/when), and the seasonal deadline charges the final act. The cost is subtle but legible in the refusal to pursue resurrection in favor of keeping a fragile echo.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The marble cavern and seasonal light are not backdrop; they dictate tactics (prism placement, dawn/noon/dusk resonance) and charge the last image. Tools (quartz prisms, brass mechanics) are handled with practical specificity filtered through a locksmith’s eye. Sound, temperature, and light are integrated economically and purposefully. Environment constrains choice all the way through to the vial’s capture.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear early (recover echoes before blizzard) and tightens with the misalignment discovery. The pressure escalates via patterned tests (dawn/noon/dusk) culminating in a precise, high‑stakes alignment. The price is primarily emotional/timebound rather than material, so the struggle feels controlled rather than harrowing. Still, the final narrowing and capture are earned by her tactics, not luck.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme coheres: reason as a vessel for wonder, memory embedded in matter, and grief transformed into kept resonance. The closing act reframes “harvest the echo, not the sound” into an ethic of keeping what can be kept. Recurring images (light angles, prisms, resonance) accrue meaning without moralizing. Sentiment is restrained; the glow in the vial delivers the charge.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The voice is controlled, lyrical, and filtered through a technician’s sensibility; diction stays consistent with a reflective, precise mind. Rhythm modulates well between observation and fine-motor action. No head‑hopping; focalization remains tight to Elara. Occasional elevated phrasing serves tone and does not outstrip the POV’s plausibility.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line work is clean and purposeful, with high information density and minimal scaffold. Metaphors are apt (“gears like frozen leaves”) and rarely pile up to opacity. Syntax varies and supports momentum, with no loops or filter stacks dulling immediacy. A touch of lyric lushness skirts purple but stays legible under pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The Seasonal Ear and “harvesting echoes” via light-calibrated prisms in marble is a fresh synthesis. The peripherally focused method and the credo of storing wonder ground the concept in character rather than gimmick. The ending’s small, luminous victory feels non‑obvious yet inevitable. Risks are quiet but confident, integrated without exposition bloat.</comment>
