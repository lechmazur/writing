<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Clara’s motivation—truth versus filial loyalty—drives concrete micro‑choices (the pen, the columns, the call) and her embodied perception is character‑specific. The regret over firing Ben counterweights her competence, giving the decision a moral bite. The internal contradiction is present but resolves a touch too cleanly, with limited felt cost on the page. Still, her traits (devoted observation, newsroom upbringing) credibly compel the final act.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal drive is clean: the call → observatory tools → logic test → decisive instruction to publish. Orientation is crisp early (observatory, chronometer, timestamp dispute) and the ending action lands closure. The cost is implied more than dramatized, slightly softening the punch. Nonetheless, the throughline is coherent and concludes with a Decisive Change.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The observatory, glass floor, and chronometer are not postcard details; the atomic clock’s calibration becomes the case’s fulcrum and the final image (satellite) recharges theme and stakes. Sensory specificity (fogged eyepiece, soft glow) is purposeful and filtered through Clara’s newsroom lens. The setting’s rule (time signal) consistently governs choice. Environment and object‑as‑setting constrain and charge the ending.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth of the photo and her father’s legacy—is signaled early and tightens as she commits to publish evidence. The proof‑by‑contradiction beat is the key deepening that narrows options to a single ethical path. The price (institutional risk, public blowback) is felt but not concretely paid on the page, tempering escalation. Still, agency cleanly drives the resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Time versus truth entwines with “Time doesn’t lie” and closes on a released satellite—conceptual repricing of legacy through evidence. “Orbits of regret” returns with a reweighted meaning as she breaks the orbit via action. A brief brush with on‑the‑nose logic exposition risks didacticism, but the images largely carry the resonance without a stated moral. The thematic afterglow is earned and coherent.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The voice is controlled, precise, and character‑true: elevated but credible for a newsroom heiress, with a distinct perceptual signature. Dialogue is minimal yet functional and subtext‑aware. Psychic distance modulates cleanly around peak beats (the click of the cap as a starting pistol). No leakage or head‑hopping undermines confidence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is taut, with images doing multiple jobs (chronometer as tool, symbol, and plot device). Figurative language is dense but coherent and disciplined; metaphors (orbits, satellite) reinforce motif rather than clutter. Rhythm varies well, and there’s minimal scaffolding or loops. The proof paragraph is clear and propulsive without academic drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The fusion of an alpine observatory’s atomic clock with a journalistic proof‑by‑contradiction is fresh and specific. The rosewood pen and “Time doesn’t lie” adage refract legacy and ethics through concrete particulars. The ending’s satellite image feels inevitable in hindsight. Slight safety in conflict texture (limited counter‑pressure) keeps it shy of the topmost band.</comment>
