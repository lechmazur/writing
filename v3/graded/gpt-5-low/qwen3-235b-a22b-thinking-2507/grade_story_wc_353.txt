<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Aris’s motive—to make music in a world that has gone silent—is vivid and character‑particular, grounded by tactile craft and the teacher’s maxim. Embodied perception (porcelain’s hum, thrum up the spine) reveals a lived practice. The internal contradiction—summoning song at the cost of widening cracks—is present but could be sharpened earlier. Still, actions align cleanly with values and culminate in an earned, tender renunciation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece escalates from stillness to swelling resonance and resolves in a Charged Poise: a final chord and the acknowledged price of further splintering. Orientation is crisp (grove, oak monolith, porcelain insulator), the sequence coherent, and the closure image carries cost. The porcelain’s warm pulse promises continuation, reweighting the world’s silence without neat fix. The ending lands on the page with felt consequence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The grove, oak monolith, stress cracks, and porcelain insulator are integrated as lived environment and tool; they constrain tactics (listening via cracks, bowing along grain) and charge the last image. Specific sensory selection (dew, filtered sun, birds’ chests vibrating) serves the pressure. World rules are learned through action, not exposition. The final forehead‑to‑wood posture cashes the setting’s emotional capital.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes are singular and legible: conjure music without destroying the relic. Escalation manifests as density increase (from faint hum to swelling chorus) and the explicit knowledge that cracks will widen. Agency drives each turn (choosing which fracture to strum, speed modulation), with the cost acknowledged at peak. A harder pinch point—risk nearly tipping into irreversible break—could heighten pressure further.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: empathy as technique transforms damage into notation, turning flaw into voice. The final chord and whispered thanks reprice “silence” as listenable rather than empty, without moralizing. Recurrences (insulator as empathy conductor, stress cracks as scale) culminate in a resonant answer. The siskins’ tentative chirps embody communal re‑voicing, deepening the afterimage.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The close third‑person lyric voice is consistent, textural, and confident; diction suits an artisan‑listener’s mind. Rhythm modulates well from stillness to swell to hush, with clean focalization and no head‑hopping. The single quoted maxim fits voice and frames craft ethos without breaking stance. A few high‑lyric flares flirt with lushness but stay controlled.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is strong: concrete verbs, layered images doing multiple jobs, and momentum that never stalls. Metaphor is coherent (cracks as notation, porcelain as conductor) and rarely overstacked; syntax varies to match tempo. Minor density surges approach purple but preserve clarity and propulsion. The closing line reprises motifs with precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The premise—bowing a cracked oak monolith with a salvaged porcelain insulator to read and release stored song—is striking and feels inevitable in hindsight. The hedgehog and siskins are fresh, grounded inflections rather than whimsy. The rule‑set (listening as technique; damage as score) is followed through without retreat. Risk‑taking in concept and diction heightens stakes while remaining legible.</comment>
