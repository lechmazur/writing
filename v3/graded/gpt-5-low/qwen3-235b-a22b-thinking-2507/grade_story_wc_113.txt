<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s drive is clear and active, with embodied urgency in micro-choices like guiding a droplet to “a keyhole” stain. Voice and perception feel character‑particular to a musician in a drowned house. Internal contradiction is light—he rarely hesitates or reveals competing impulses—so cost reads more situational than psychological. Still, actions align cleanly with motive and culminate in an earned stance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Under a causal lens, beats link cleanly: search → discovery → interpretation via water → choice to act and exit with proof. Closure lands as a charged poise/decisive change: he secures the program and commits to exposing truth. The cost is present (fragility, time pressure, flood risk) but modest on the page. Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph with no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The flooded opera house, lantern flicker, and tactile debris are vivid and filter through a musician’s gaze. Environment constrains choice—water both threatens the artifact and becomes the decoding tool—charging the final image. Sensory selection is purposeful and consistent. The setting’s rule (water alters images) is learned through action, not told.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around a single stake—decoding before dissolution—and tightens when the images start changing, forcing the droplet tactic and a swift exit. Escalation is internal and environmental rather than antagonistic, yet it narrows options credibly. The felt price (risk, loss if the booklet disintegrates) is clear though not severe. The resolution stems from his agency rather than coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Decay as language, art as afterlife, and liminal “in between spaces” gather into a resonant closing image (“a single, clear note”). Thematic work arises from particulars—the water-borne code, erased reputation—without sermonizing. The final commitment reweights the premise from haunting to restitution. Ambiguity remains purposeful and suggestive rather than vague.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The lyrical third‑person closely tracks Elias’s sensibility with controlled elevation that suits a musician in a cathedral of sound. Diction and rhythm maintain consistency and swell at pressure points without slipping register. No head‑hopping or stance wobble. The voice carries subtext through images rather than explanation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is sensuous yet largely precise, with images doing multiple jobs (“pages splayed like broken wings” both visual and tonal). Minor purple flourishes appear but don’t blur causality; momentum stays intact. Sentence rhythms vary and scaffolding is minimal. Figurative logic holds at the peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The method of decoding via evolving water damage is a striking, specific twist on the ghost‑message trope. The flooded opera’s liminal mood feels authentic and integrated with action rather than decorative. Turns feel earned and grounded in the world’s particulars. The piece risks lyric intensity without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
