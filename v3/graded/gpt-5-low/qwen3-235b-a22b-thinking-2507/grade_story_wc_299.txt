<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rich, embodied interiority grounds Liam’s motives—his fact‑shielding and grief collide credibly with the tactile appraisal habit. The micro‑choice to keep the cloth is earned by the re-seeing of its specifics (blue gel, heat puckering). Contradictory impulses (professional duty vs. personal resonance) operate simultaneously. The shift stops short of messiness about the ethical cost, but remains believable.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clean single-scene structure with clear anchors and a cohesive accumulative drive toward a resonant reconfiguration. Because/therefore is less central than pattern build; the closure (keeping the cloth, revaluing purpose) lands on the page. Cost is implied (professional compromise) rather than dramatized under pressure, tempering impact. Still, the before/after is legible and felt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The quarry office and pit are vividly rendered through the protagonist’s sensibility (dust motes, metal desk, echoing shovel). Environmental specifics mirror internal states without overt strain and charge the final image as he walks to the edge. The setting doesn’t strictly constrain options, but it deepens mood and stakes throughout. Object-as-setting (cloth) also meaningfully charges the ending.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recovering purpose after public failure—is signaled early and tightens as observation turns to recognition, then to possession. The meaningful turn is when facts slip and personal history reweights the object; that drives the choice to keep it. The felt price (risking integrity as an appraiser) is present but underplayed. Tension is mostly internal, yet coherent and progressive.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Echo/silence/resonance accrue through concrete particulars, culminating in a redefinition of value and purpose. The final movement reframes failure and quiet as charged space rather than void. One line (“Purpose wasn't found in flawless displays…”) veers toward explicit moralizing, dulling the otherwise earned subtext. Overall, thematic weave is strong and honest.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A distinct perceptual signature—technical yet sensual—holds steady; diction and rhythm fit a roadie-turned-appraiser with lived tactile memory. Psychic distance modulates smoothly as pressure rises from appraisal to recollection to decision. No head‑hopping or register slips that break plausibility. Elisions (memories of Maya) are controlled and pay off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is textured and precise; sensory choices do multiple jobs (characterization, theme, momentum). A few metaphor stacks flirt with purple but stay coherent and voice‑true. Minimal redundancy; sentences mostly push forward. Final cadence is clean and image-driven.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: a quarry office as stage for a roadie-turned-appraiser reclaiming purpose via a stained grill cloth “map.” The reweighting of “after the applause” into resonance, not void, feels earned. Risks are tasteful and integrated rather than flashy. Not revolutionary, but memorable and specific.</comment>
