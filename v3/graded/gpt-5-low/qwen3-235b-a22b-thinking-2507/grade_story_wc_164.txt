<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Motivation is clean and specific, and the “cheerful gloom” registers as a consistent, character‑particular texture. Interiority is present through embodied use of the crater glass, but genuine contradiction under pressure is light. Competence stays high with little visible struggle or cost in the decisive beats. The final choice (gathering and teaching) feels earned but relatively low‑risk.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Hybrid with an accumulative/textural dominance: color‑emotions accrue toward a conceptual repricing—paths vanish when the world fractures. Orientation is crisp and the closure lands, but the pivotal turn hinges on a convenient sky‑sparrow that effectively resolves the problem. The cost is more tonal than material, keeping the causal pressure modest. Still, the sequence coheres and culminates on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The geode setting is vivid and sensorially rich, with crystalline acoustics and color casting that filter through Elara’s priorities. The crater glass as tool‑in‑place functions as micro‑setting and charges the final image (cooling glass; twilight shimmer). While not tightly constraining movement, the cave’s properties shape tactics (seed placement, light pools). Strong economy with purposeful detail.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear early (recover the route before memory fades), and the density of emotional readings marks a meaningful deepening. However, escalation relies on coincidence (bird) and faces minimal resistance; options don’t substantially narrow once the seeds appear. The price paid is mostly temporal/tonal, not a concrete trade‑off or loss.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Resonant idea: absence as seeded continuity; the meteor reframes loss into dispersal. The return of seeds and the cooling crater glass build thematic cadence. Final paragraphs tilt toward explicit promise (“She would teach others…”), edging into told moral rather than leaving the image to reverberate. Still, the non‑literal answer feels earned by the particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a distinct lyric texture; color lexicon and mineral acoustics give a clear perceptual signature. Rhythm modulates well, with only one brief line of dialogue. No head‑hopping or stance drift, and certainty aligns with what Elara can infer via the glass. Occasional elevated diction fits the fable‑like register.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is controlled and imagistic without collapsing into muddle; most sentences do multiple jobs. Minor purplish runs (“iridescent,” “opalescent,” “gleaming”) risk saturation but remain coherent. Momentum holds, with few scaffolding lines or loops. The closing image is clean and unblurred.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: a recollectionist translating emotions with meteor glass; migrating birds as carriers of fractured memory; sky‑whales’ erased route. The central reweighting (world‑fracture → dispersed seeds) feels non‑obvious and apt. The turn via a convenient bird softens ingenuity at the pressure peak, but the vision is distinctive and cohesive. Risks taken in concept and diction pay off.</comment>
