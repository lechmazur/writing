<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Silas’s motive (compulsive need to uncover what ceilings hide) is clear and action-driving, and his profession/ghost‑sight inform credible tactics. Interiority is specific (dust reading, tool‑logic), though internal contradiction is mild—it’s sorrow more than a live conflict. His engagement with Thorn shows character under pressure without melodrama. The resolution (freeing the ghost) costs him a cherished “secret‑keeper” stance, but the price reads primarily as quiet sorrow, not a hard trade-off.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Held under a Causal lens: notice → inference → retrieval → assembly → release. Setups pay off cleanly (dust arc to key to compartment to bird to winding) and the closure lands on-page with a felt emotional cost. Some steps feel lightly convenient (key and compartment appear with minimal resistance), keeping pressure modest. Still, the ghost’s release is a decisive change and coherently earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The abandoned circus office is vivid and functional: posters, grime, the big top’s groan, and dust act as investigative terrain. Environment constrains choices (dust/ceiling guide the search; hidden compartment shaped by the counter). Recurring objects (mainspring, clockwork bird) charge the final image. Strong economy and POV-filtered specificity throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—freeing Thorn/learning what the ceiling hides—is established early and tightened by the ghost’s appearance and the discovered method. Escalation is primarily investigative; turns arise from Silas’s choices, but risk and opposition remain low. The final act (winding the bird) is a clear culminating choice with consequence. The pressure is steady rather than punishing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Ceilings, cracks, and time cohere around release versus keeping secrets; the ending reweights Silas’s obsession into an ethic of letting go. Imagery (mainspring/time, bird applause) carries theme without sermonizing. Slight tidiness—ghost freed, dawn breaks—limits lingering complexity. Still, the “weightless burden” evolving to relief is resonant.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable close third with a precise perceptual signature (mechanical diagnostics shaping how he sees dust and structure). Diction suits character and mood; one line of dialogue is crisp and purposeful. Rhythm modulates well between observation and action. No head‑hopping or stance drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clean, propulsive sentences with high information density and minimal scaffold. Figurative language is selective and apt (“holding smoke,” “wings…like distant applause”), not overstacked. No loops or cadence templates dull momentum. Copy is clean and sequencing is lucid.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The blend of elevator tech, ghost lore, horology, and circus ruin feels fresh, with dust‑forensics as a neat twist. The central moves are genre-familiar but given specificity and restraint. Emotional truth lands without gimmickry. Not radical, but distinctly executed.</comment>
