<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Aris’s motive (to free courage) is clear, embodied, and consistent with her “enigmatic locksmith” identity. Her micro‑choices—waiting for Vega, receiving rather than taking, pouring longing—reveal character under pressure. Internal struggle is more implicit than contested; she meets limited resistance, so cost reads modest. Still, the quiet endurance and renunciation of force credibly earn the final stance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: waiting → star’s cue → cosmic understanding → offering longing → release. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing with on‑page cost (spent longing; the ribbon’s ordinary remnant). Orientation is clean early and the pattern is taught through action. No causality breaks; the decisive cadence shift arrives with the Vega beat and the unraveling.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The alley/nexus and Vega’s angle materially constrain tactic and timing; the setting isn’t decorative but functional. Sensory specifics are vivid and selective (damp bricks, ivy, silver needle of Vega). The blue ribbon as micro‑setting object charges the final image. World rules stay consistent and are learned via use, not exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early and tightens with the first star as a live clock, then deepens through the disorientation and the choice to offer longing. Pressure is coherent but relatively gentle; the piece avoids robust reversals. The felt price is there but soft, leaning into quiet endurance. Resolution follows from her agency rather than coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Themes of fear, longing, and liberation arise through concrete images (vault shaped like a keyhole only longing can open) rather than abstract lecture. The final repricing—courage as freed, not found—resonates and reweights prior material. Slight moralizing creeps into the closing lines (“courage was never lost, only waiting to be unwound”), tempering subtlety. Overall, the imagery carries meaning without heavy authorial intrusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The lyric third‑person close is stable, with a distinct perceptual signature (locksmith’s tactility; cosmic vocabulary) and controlled modulation under stress. Purposeful elision is taught and paid off; no head‑hopping. Register stays coherent to the piece’s chosen mode. A trace of lushness verges on uniform cadence but seldom blurs intent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Lines are musical and economical enough to maintain momentum, with strong verbs and charged nouns. However, density of figurative language and recurring phrases (e.g., “hush of cosmic possibility”) edge toward overuse, slightly diluting peak beats. Minimal redundancy but some near‑paraphrase could be tightened. Clarity and sequence remain intact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>“Locksmith of ideas” + starlight hair + longing as key offer a fresh synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. The vault/keyhole metaphor is specific and tactically enacted, not just decorative. The risk of high lyricism pays off with a distinct vision and clean closure. Emotional truth grounds the cosmic conceit.</comment>
