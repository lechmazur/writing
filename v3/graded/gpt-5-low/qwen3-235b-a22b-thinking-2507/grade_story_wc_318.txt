<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—to tend and transmute household grief—drives every action, and her embodied choices (yanking cords, singing into wind) align with that aim. The “mournfully eager” tension reads specific rather than generic. Internal contradiction (hurt vs. hope; ritualized control vs. helpless loss) is present, though lightly stated rather than dramatized as a sharp, on‑page clash. The final easing of her shoulders registers a credible cost and earned endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the build from one blower to seven, then voice and leaves to mist, coheres toward a resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands on the page as laughter returns upstairs, with cost in strain and the acceptance of grief’s persistence. Orientation is clean early; the two‑shard transition (tunnel to living room) is legible and motivated. No causality breaks; every step feeds the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The echo chamber tunnel, curved walls, vents, and concrete ribs are not decorative; they shape tactics and the sound’s trajectory. The pull cord as baton and the mist of macerated leaves charge the final image. Sensory detail is vivid yet purposeful and filtered through Elara’s aim. Environment constrains and enables the ritual, meeting the 9‑band gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restoring a household’s access to laughter—appears early and tightens as she escalates from one blower to an orchestra. The key turn is committing to the full ritual (seven blowers plus song), paying a physical and emotional price. Pressure is coherent if not harrowing; the cost is palpable in effort and the risk of failure. Resolution grows from her agency rather than coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Themes of grief as labor, ritual, and transformation emerge organically through concrete acts (macerating leaves into memory‑mist, lullabies becoming wind). “Tending to the unspoken” becomes experiential rather than stated. The ending offers a resonant answer: grief isn’t erased but carried home in a new form. No moralizing; the ambiguity of magic/psychology enriches subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The lyric voice is consistent, controlled, and character‑specific, with rhythmic modulation that swells and eases with the machinery. POV remains tight and plausible, even in the upstairs shard, which reads as perceived consequence rather than head‑hop. Diction choices match the heightened register taught from the opening. No dialogue is needed; the voice carries subtext and pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is strong, with purposeful imagery and momentum; the paragraphing supports the swell and fade of the ritual. A few phrases flirt with purple or redundancy (“mournfully eager,” “not just… but…”) but do not obscure sense or dull the close. Syntax varies and verbs are active; no scaffold loops or filter stacks. The final sentence precisely recharges earlier motifs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The leaf‑blower requiem is an original, memorable synthesis of the mundane and the numinous. The ritual’s mechanics feel idiosyncratic and necessary rather than quirky. The upstairs laughter as sonic return closes the loop unexpectedly yet inevitably. Risk‑taking in concept and tone heightens stakes without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
