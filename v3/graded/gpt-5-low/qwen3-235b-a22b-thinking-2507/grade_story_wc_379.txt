<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—to listen and heal—drives clean, aligned actions (pocketing the locket, convening neighbors, unlocking the box). Interiority is present but safe; little contradictory impulse or visible personal cost under pressure. Secondary characters offer distinct, efficient impressions without real counterpressure. The final renunciation/endurance cost is mostly communal and emotional rather than personally risky.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Hybrid lens with clear causal spine: locket → key → mailbox → letters; accumulation via neighbors’ memories. Orientation is crisp early (store, courtyard, dawn), and the closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (community reknit by hearing Rajan’s letters). Cost is felt but gentle (exhuming grief). No major broken linkages or unkept setups.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Courtyard at dawn, saffron sari, bougainvillea, chai—sensory specificity supports tone and theme. The mailbox as a recurring object charges the final image; the environment itself mostly frames rather than constrains. Detail selection is economical and POV-filtered. Strong atmosphere, modest functional constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear (open the mailbox to heal), and escalation proceeds through gathering testimony and the unlock. Resistance is minimal—no one meaningfully opposes, and the key works on first try—so tension stays low. The tightening deepens knowledge rather than foreclosing options. Emotional price is present but soft.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Images and actions embody the theme (listening as communal repair), but the final paragraphs state it overtly (“This simple act of listening… was the strongest thread”), tipping toward moralizing. Subtext does operate in the crowd’s tears and Rajan’s letter, which could stand alone. The resonance is genuine yet dulled by explicit thesis restatement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stable close third with clean switches to dialogue; diction suits the piece’s lyric‑quiet aims. Refrains like “sandstorm calm” provide a perceptual signature without obscuring clarity. Dialogue sounds natural and advances plot. No head‑hopping or stance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose is clear and paced; images are well-chosen with minimal scaffold or loops. Occasional purple or summary statements (“Listening had woven them back together”) flatten what’s otherwise shown. Rhythm varies; sentence craft supports momentum to the unlock and reading. Final lines verge on abstraction but don’t obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Locket/key/long‑locked mailbox and lost‑lover letters are familiar; the piece’s freshness comes from communal storytelling and tonal restraint. Execution is poised but not transformative. Some cultural texture helps specificity; the conceptual frame remains conventional. No bold structural risk or subversion to lift it higher.</comment>
