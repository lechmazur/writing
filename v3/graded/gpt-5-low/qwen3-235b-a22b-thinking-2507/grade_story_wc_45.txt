<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is textured and concrete, with a clear flaw (arrogant skepticism) evolving into a principled, grace‑tempered stance. The decisive micro‑choice—repurposing the tooth and committing to teach the village children—aligns with her motivation. However, internal contradiction is largely resolved before the scene, so pressure in the moment is modest. Finn’s presence warms but doesn’t substantively test her resolve.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the scene coheres cleanly: object (tooth), setting (garden/sundial), and metaphor (bone setting) accrete toward a Conceptual Repricing. Closure lands with cost—she foregoes certainty for a scarred, guiding praxis—embodied in the final plan to install the tooth as beacon. Orientation is crisp, and the single scene holds. The price is more conceptual than visceral but legible on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The secret garden, hedge maze, stone well, mossy bench, and central sundial do focused work beyond ornament. The environment shapes the final choice (placing the tooth in the sundial) and charges the closing image (moonlight catching the tooth). Details are POV‑filtered and tactile without cataloging. The garden evolves from refuge to workshop, deepening tone and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to mend a fractured worldview into communal guidance—is clear and tightens through the tooth’s re‑purpose and the Hemlock analogy. Escalation is soft but present: reflection crystallizes into action (sundial plan, gathering children), foreclosing the path of burying pain. The son’s injury provides gentle external pressure rather than a true test. The cost is embraced rather than wrestled with on the page, limiting intensity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Themes of fracture, acceptance, and transmutation are integrated through recurring images (cleft, bone setting, constellations, maze/ivy). The final image reweights prior material without requiring a spelled‑out moral. A few overt statements (“Mistakes… weren’t dead ends but pivot points”) flirt with didacticism but don’t derail resonance. Subtext in Finn’s questions and the Hemlock metaphor is effective.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The voice is lyrical yet controlled, with consistent focalization and natural, age‑appropriate dialogue for Finn. Rhythmic modulation fits the reflective mode; free indirect texture stays coherent. One or two meta labels (“nostalgic innovation”) feel on‑the‑nose. Overall, diction and stance suit the character and frame.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is polished, image‑dense, and largely purposeful, with good sentence variety and clear sequencing. Some metaphor stacking (cleft/porcelain/constellations/beacon/gardener) edges toward purple and occasionally repeats conceptually. The line “gardener tending wounds into wisdom” and similar constructs verge on summary‑moralizing. Clarity remains high, but trimming a few abstractions would sharpen momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Changelings reframed through bone‑setting and a sundial‑tooth beacon feels fresh and emotionally true. The synthesis of skepticism/wonder with communal pedagogy avoids template beats. A few familiar aphoristic turns dampen risk slightly. Still, the final repricing image is distinctive and memorable.</comment>
