<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clear, embodied motives—duty versus claustrophobic dread—drive micro‑choices (“prudence meant moving slow… adventure demanded she push forward”). The internal contradiction holds in scene and guides tactics. Her restraint with the booby‑trap check earns the final grab and reads character‑true. Minor reliance on familiar images (“heart… like a trapped bird”) slightly lowers distinctiveness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hybrid lens, dominantly causal: the organ’s thrum halts the mutiny, revealing the alcove; she probes, retrieves, escapes. Closure lands with a decisive change (key obtained) plus charged aftermath cost (hollow victory, ongoing duty). Setups (fallow lull, organ’s subterranean carry, compass calibration) pay off. The organ intervention skirts coincidence but is foreshadowed and functional.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The nexus and its “spatial mutiny” tangibly constrain movement and tactics; the compass and narrowing corridors shape choices. Sensory detail is purposeful across modalities (vibration through boots, damp granite, dust). The broken spire/organ silence recharge the final image. World rules feel consistent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake is active early and tightens: erratic compass, narrowing passages, then a fleeting window to act when the organ arrests the mutiny. She trades safety for opportunity and pays in mounting pressure during escape. The cost is primarily emotional/psychic but legible. One strong tightening is sufficient at this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Entropy versus human duty, and “mutiny born of longing” develop through particulars (organ as grief/hope carrier; key as insufficient cure). The final walk toward the church holds a resonant, non‑literal answer. A single line edges into stated moral (“healing demanded more than just a tool”), trimming subtlety. Overall, subtext outweighs statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A coherent, lyrical close third with controlled modulation under stress; perceptual signature favors geometry and sound. Diction fits the character’s vocation and fear without head‑hopping. Rhythm tightens at crisis and relaxes at exit. Slight purple glint in a few metaphors but not enough to mar control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High information density with few redundancies; lines often do double duty. Occasional familiar metaphors (“spilled ink,” “trapped bird”) and stacked modifiers nudge toward overwriting but don’t blur causality. Syntax varies and supports momentum. Copy is clean and sequencing clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>“Spatial mutiny,” a geometry‑piercing drafting tool, and a church organ’s resonance as a tactical device feel fresh and integrated. The blend of science‑adjacent precision with mystic acoustics gives the piece a distinct angle. Turns arise from established elements rather than late inventions. Not revolutionary, but confidently singular.</comment>
