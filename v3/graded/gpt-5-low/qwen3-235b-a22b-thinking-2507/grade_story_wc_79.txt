<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Kael’s motive—understanding the watchers via the city’s “language”—is precise and embodied, with tactile habits (chalk, ochre, stylus) revealing character under pressure. The “quietly driven” trait coheres with his patience and risk tolerance, culminating in a credible resolve to go. Internal contradiction is modest (curiosity vs dread) rather than actively colliding in‑scene. Still, actions align cleanly with motives, and the last choice feels earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Clear causal chain: whistle → resonance → crack → hidden map → revaluation of watchers → decision to follow. Closure lands as Charged Poise/Earned resolve with a conceptual cost (walking into danger, reconfiguring the city from mute relic to guiding agent). Orientation is solid from the first paragraph; the lens holds. The price is felt even if not yet paid on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The turtle‑shell city is vividly integrated and constrains choice: the shells’ resonance and fracture geometry dictate tactics and reveal the path. Weather and glare pressure perception and mood, while the whistle‑shell system charges the final image. Details are selective and POV‑filtered, avoiding tourist inventory. World rules are learned through action, not dump.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (seek answers from watchers) is established early; pressure coheres through dread and isolation. The decisive deepening is the crack revealing the older map, which narrows options and forces a stance. The cost—choosing to walk toward the watchers—is legible, if more existential than immediate. Escalation is primarily knowledge‑driven but effective.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Themes of language, resonance, and the ethics of inquiry emerge organically via image (spirals, lichen trails, wind paths) rather than thesis. The final shift—from watchers as passive to waiting—reweights the entire premise with unease. No moralizing; the city’s complicity adds ambiguity and lingering charge. The reprise of the whistle aligns insight with risk.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A coherent, lyrical third‑limited voice with a strong perceptual signature (material textures, sound, heat) sustains throughout. Rhythm modulates cleanly—measured set‑up, tightened cadence at the crack and realization. No head‑hopping or register drift; diction suits the character’s craft. Compression stays legible under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense but controlled; images do double duty for mood and mechanism (chalk dust vibrating, shell geometry). Minimal redundancy and clean sequencing support momentum. A few intensifiers recur (“sunwashed dread”) without clogging clarity. Syntax varies and the final line lands with image, not explanation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>World‑turtle shell‑city + acoustic cartography via a reed whistle is striking and specific, not a template. The hidden spiral map emerging through resonance feels inevitable in hindsight given the patterned set‑up. Risk‑taking is coherent and thematic, not gimmicky. The watchers’ reframed role adds a fresh, unsettling inflection.</comment>
