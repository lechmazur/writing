<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Kaelen’s guilt-driven motive and contradictory impulses (to fix vs. to accept) are concrete and character‑particular. His embodied stress (“knot of guilt,” hunched posture) and micro‑choices at the console under pressure feel earned. The renunciation at the end forecloses a path with visible cost. Minor note: one line (“professional posture one of being confidently uncertain”) risks label over show but is supported by later action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single POV, tight scene, and clear anchors establish who/where/when early. Under a situational lens, the new signal applies coherent pressure; attempts to edit trigger cascading consequences that force stance crystallization. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: he refuses to alter the past and instead appends a “footnote,” paying the price of relinquishing salvation. Causality is intact and the final image is charged by the persistent constraint (the anomaly).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The gravitational anomaly is more than mood; it enables the time‑fold and frames tactics and the final act. The station’s tactile atmosphere and the pen as micro‑setting recur to charge the last image. Detail selection tracks Kaelen’s professional lens without tourist cataloging. The environment constrains choice and meaning at the end, satisfying the high‑band gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: fix the colony’s past or learn to live with the cost. Escalation tightens as each attempted “edit” produces a different disaster, narrowing viable options toward an ethically loaded refusal. The renunciation is active agency with a felt price. Pressure is coherent and grows to a meaningful turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Themes of culpability, acceptance, and the impossibility of clean correction emerge organically from the attempts and the final “commentary” choice. The pen motif and the “threshing” lexicon deepen the repricing of meaning. One sentence (“The goal was never to undo, but to understand.”) edges toward thesis‑statement clarity, slightly dimming subtext. The final image reweights prior material without sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third‑limited voice with a clear perceptual signature (technical precision braided to grief). Diction and rhythm modulate under pressure without head‑hopping or register slips. Purposeful compression in the experiment montage reads clean and earned. No dialogue needed; POV remains consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sentences carry multiple jobs with clean momentum; imagery is fresh and coherent to the world (“creases” of time, “thresh” of meaning). Variations in syntax and paragraphing support pressure then release. Minor repetitions (“strange comfort”) work as purposeful echo rather than scaffold. No figurative muddle or template cadence in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Time‑editing guilt arcs are familiar, but the “footnote instead of revision” turn and the agricultural threshing metaphor feel specific and non‑obvious. The anomaly as cloister rather than cage is a fresh emotional reframe. While not radically new in premise, the integration of method, object, and moral calculus is deft. The piece takes a tasteful risk with a quiet, renunciatory climax.</comment>
