<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Aris’s motives—logic as bulwark against her father’s chaos—are clear and consistently tested by the subway quest. Contradictory impulses (need for certainty vs. attraction to the father’s intuitive map) coexist on the page, culminating in the lantern‑lighting. Interiority is specific (probability professor lens) and embodied via object interactions. The closing acceptance carries a felt cost without tidiness: she widens perspective without becoming him.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Hybrid drive with an Accumulative/Textural dominance: the graffiti quest accrues pattern until the balcony inscription reweights meaning. Orientation is clean; two shards (library → city traverse) resolve into a clear closure image. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing/Earned Stasis: accepting “beautiful risk” and lighting the lantern. The on‑page cost is conceptual, not logistical; still credible at this length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful: the rainwashed library yields the mica key; the subway’s “steel veins” channel the pilgrimage; the rail yard balcony frames the charged final view. The lantern/mica functions as a micro‑setting object that constrains perception and charges the last image. Sensory detail is selective and POV‑filtered, avoiding postcard cataloging. Weather and season modulate tone rather than clutter.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes center on whether Aris will relinquish pure probabilistic control for a lived risk; pressure coheres as the weeks‑long quest narrows to a final statement. The meaningful tightening is the move from circulating trains to the off‑map maintenance stairwell and balcony. Cost is primarily internal; we don’t see a tangible sacrifice beyond stance, which slightly limits intensity. Still, the final act (lighting the lantern) is a decisive acceptance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Themes of order vs. chaos, map vs. soul, and “lucid contradiction” emerge through particulars (mica cipher, subway glyphs, balcony inscription) rather than meta‑commentary. The note’s “Start with the light” gains earned resonance in the final image. One line edges toward thesis (“To live without risk was its own kind of gamble”), but it’s grounded in her specific journey. Ambiguity remains humane: understanding without endorsement of recklessness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The close third voice is coherent, precise, and colored by a mathematician’s sensibility without sterile jargon. Rhythm shifts appropriately from clinical certainty to lyric openness as she moves through the city and at the balcony. No head‑hopping; elisions are purposeful and legible. Diction remains within character plausibility while achieving a distinct texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lines are clean, with high information density and few redundancies; images like “steel veins” and “clover melancholy” are fresh and controlled. Figurative language rarely stacks or muddies logic, and the final sentence lands with clarity. Minor abstract phrasing appears but doesn’t slow momentum. Syntax varies, supporting a measured propulsion toward the close.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The subway‑cipher pilgrimage via a mica‑etched lantern pane is a striking synthesis, transforming familiar grief and inheritance tropes. The “beautiful risk” closure feels earned by the specific path rather than a generic epiphany. The tonal invention of “clover melancholy” and the father’s city‑soul map add memorable texture. Risk‑taking is disciplined, not gimmicky.</comment>
