<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elara’s motive and method are precise and character‑particular, and her curiosity-to-ethics tension surfaces in the final renunciation. Interiority is embodied through tactile listening and careful handling rather than abstract labeling. The conflict remains quiet, so her struggle never quite bites hard enough to expose deeper contradiction. Still, actions align with motive and reveal a credible hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, discoveries progress cleanly—hum → diaries → Prometheus → choice—and closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise. The cost is conceptual but legible: she refuses to carry or expose the legacy, returning the evidence to the hearth. Orientation is strong from the outset; no causal seams show. The because/therefore chain is implicit yet coherent across beats.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The ivy‑veiled passage, damp flagstones, and fireplace are vivid and functional; environment and small objects guide action. The sunbeam through ivy to read the film negative charges the central revelation, and the hearth anchors the final image. Details are filtered through the cartographer’s professional perceptions. Setting consistently mirrors and pressures the internal stakes without postcard excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes are ethically scaled: whether to claim, expose, or leave the burden. Pressure coheres and tightens through the discovery sequence toward a single renunciation that forecloses a path. The price is felt but subtle; we don’t see tangible fallout beyond the chosen restraint. Even so, escalation reads as a decisive intensification appropriate to the mode.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically—legacy, culpability, and the ethics of witnessing—without sermonizing. The final notation “A burden of knowing” reweights the scene and reinterprets the cartographer’s vocation. Subtext in the walls’ “dream” and the Prometheus image deepens resonance. It stops short of profound reconfiguration only because the personal cost remains primarily conceptual.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The voice is controlled, sensuous, and consistent with a professional listener’s perceptual bias. Diction and rhythm modulate to match discovery and recognition; no POV leakage or unearned omniscience. Lyric compression is purposeful and legible. Absence of dialogue is fitting and never leaves a vacuum.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is clean, varied, and economical despite lush texture; images carry multiple jobs. No scaffold loops or template cadences dull momentum. Figurative language is disciplined and coherent; a few elevated phrases flirt with purple but don’t occlude sense. The closing image lands with clarity and charge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The “corridor echo cartographer” is a striking, original frame that synthesizes science, haunt, and ethics. The Prometheus reveal is familiar in concept but made fresh through tactile process and environmental discovery. The ending choice resists the obvious exposé, lending distinctiveness and moral ambiguity. The whole reads as a singular vision rather than a stitched trope set.</comment>
