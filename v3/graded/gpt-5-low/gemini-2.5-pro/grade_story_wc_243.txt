<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is precise and enacted on the page (preserve small moments → restore the photo → go to the jetty). Interiority is textured through craft-specific perception, but contradictory impulses are limited; she rarely hesitates or faces a live trade-off beyond procedural risk. The final stance—exultant yet haunted—lands credibly from prior beats. Tomas functions as a mirror rather than a pressure source, keeping the relational crucible modest.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: restoration work accretes meaning that reweights the jetty scene; closure is a resonant reconfiguration with a conceptual cost (“haunted by the ghosts of generations”). Orientation is clean, the two-shard structure is coherent, and the locket → recognition → meeting is legible. Coincidence (Tomas’s arrival, blooming flowers) pushes toward the mythic but doesn’t undercut the earned repricing. The cost is felt rather than merely asserted in the last line.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Atmosphere is exceptional: walnut husks, iron gall, milky blur, phosphorescent buds, and salt-scrubbed wood filtered through an archivist’s eye. The locket and jetty recur and charge the final image; while the environment doesn’t tightly constrain choices, it meaningfully frames the reconfiguration. World rules allow soft magical realism consistently. Sensory hierarchy matches mood and craft.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes cohere around revealing and reweighting the founders’ truth to heal a feud; escalation tightens via the restoration gamble and the decision to go to the boundary. Agency drives the turn (the steep, the walk, the reveal), though pressure feels gentle rather than coercive. The miraculous blooming functions as intensification rather than a solution. Felt price is primarily conceptual and historical, not personally risky.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Themes of preservation, misread history, and love’s restorative power arise organically from actions and objects. Recurring motifs (locket, ink, jetty, twilight) shift meaning at the end without sermonizing; the final “haunted euphoria” resists tidy moralizing. One sentence (“The failure of the past became the immediate responsibility of the present”) edges toward thesis, but the scene work earns it. The ending reweights the premise convincingly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The lyrical third-person limited is steady and character-specific, with craft lexicon anchoring voice. Modulation at discovery and at the jetty is controlled; dialogue is sparse but natural and subtext-bearing. No head-hopping; inference remains within plausible knowledge. Occasional elevated diction flirts with grandiosity but stays coherent with the chosen register.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lines carry high information density with varied rhythm; images do multiple jobs. A few abstract phrasings (“chemical covenant,” “proximate causes”) risk purple but remain intelligible and thematically aligned. Minimal redundancy and clean sequencing. The final image is crisp and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>An archivist’s chemical restoration catalyzing a magical-botanical reconciliation feels fresh and specific. The synthesis of material craft with mythic blossoming is memorable, with the locket as a strong throughline. Risks (soft magic, coincidence) are integrated rather than patched. The human cost note prevents sentimentality.</comment>
