<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is specific and embodied—professional curiosity braided with grief guides micro‑choices (separating the form, unfurling the corner, ceremonially sleeving the button). The contradiction between personal ache and meticulous care is dramatized rather than told. Her final act (transcribing the message and officially reuniting object and file) reads as an earned stance, not a tidy cure. The cost remains present (“not healed”), which grounds the change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, each discovery tightens meaning toward a clear closure unit: the hidden note reconfigures the stakes from procedure to witness. Orientation is clean early; causality is plausible (dust pattern → unfurl → button → indentation message). The ending lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost: sorrow persists but is reweighted into service and ceremony. No beat contradicts the lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The file room’s tactile specifics (decaying paper, binder’s glue, dust stratigraphy) are filtered through an archivist’s eye and drive the pivotal find. The button functions as object‑as‑setting, charging the final image and constraining action (gentle handling, archival protocol). Sensory detail is purposeful and varied, and the environment meaningfully shapes tactics. World rules and occupational cues read consistent and lived‑in.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether she can translate private grief into meaningful custodianship—tightens through the physical act of unfurling and the ethical choice to conspire with historical empathy. The reveal escalates pressure from curiosity to responsibility, producing a clear change in options (to officially reunite object and meaning). The cost is subtle but legible (continuing ache, duty assumed). Quiet, but coherent and earned under the chosen lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: the clandestine kindness of a clerk, the endurance of an object, and the archivist’s ceremonial response. Subtext hums in the collusion across time—“so he is never lost to us”—without overt moralizing. A couple of lines verge on articulation (“This was the magnification she sought”) but remain anchored in image and action. The final reweighting lingers with genuine emotional aftereffect.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The voice is precise, measured, and character‑true—lyric without drift, with a distinct perceptual signature (material culture vocabulary, careful verbs). Psychic distance is stable; inference matches what she can know. The modulation from clinical attention to hushed ceremony is controlled and persuasive. No dialogue is needed; the narration carries subtext and pressure cleanly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is strong: varied rhythm, tight syntax, and images that do multiple jobs (dust as both setting and mechanism). Minor familiar notes (“her breath hitched”) don’t impede momentum. No paraphrase loops or muddled metaphors; information density is high and propulsive for a quiet scene. The final sentence resolves by image rather than summary.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>While the “archival discovery that heals” frame is familiar, the execution finds fresh specificity in post‑emancipation intake forms and the dust‑forensics trigger. The ethical complicity of an anonymous clerk across time feels newly alive. The closing ceremony elevates without gimmickry. It’s not radical in premise, but it’s artfully, authentically realized.</comment>
