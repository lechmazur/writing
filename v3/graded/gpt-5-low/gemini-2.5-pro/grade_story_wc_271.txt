<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority is precise and embodied—the freeze, the ice blooming, the jaw knot, and the tactile refuge in soil and resin read character‑specific rather than generic. Contradictory impulses are active in scene: she must freeze and she must care for the pine. Her choice to endure and resume work is an earned renunciation with felt cost. No therapy‑speak; the “pearl of stillness” is behaviorally grounded.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single, coherent scene with clear anchors and a tight arc from calm care → trigger → paralysis → grounding → deliberate resumption. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she acknowledges ongoing menace yet recommits to careful tending (“just enough”). The cost is on the page (somatic aftermath, ache, ongoing vigilance). Situational lens holds: coherent pressure forces stance crystallization.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The arboretum, cliff, glass walls, surf, and Wollemi pine are not postcard decor; they actively supply the grounding tactic (geologic sound, soil grit) and charge the ending image. Professional bias colors detail selection credibly. The recurring micro‑setting (tree, soil, water) constrains and enables her choices. Atmosphere deepens theme without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can she navigate a trigger without losing her capacity to care—is legible from the first paragraph. The tightening arrives with the shadow/thrum and bodily lock; options narrow until she executes her practiced grounding. The price and recovery cadence are clear, culminating in a deliberate, measured act (“just enough”). Internal and external pressures interweave cleanly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Hope versus realism is dramatized through particulars: ancient tree care, automation replacing keepers, the photograph’s softened edges, and “It meant nothing. It meant everything.” The final image reweights the premise without moralizing. The “pearl of stillness” reframes resilience as practice, not epiphany. Resonance lingers through the juxtaposition of geologic time and aerial menace.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Close third voice is steady, textured, and modulates under stress without losing clarity. Diction and syntax align with a careful, plant‑attuned mind, tightening appropriately during the freeze. No head‑hopping or register drift; purposeful lyricism serves pressure. Repetition is intentional and charged rather than scaffolding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lines carry high information density with sensory specificity; sentences vary rhythmically to mirror tension and release. Figurative language is controlled and coherent (“sound of geology, not technology”). Minimal redundancy; no evident template cadence or filter‑verb stacks dulling immediacy. Opening and closing lines are earned and well‑cut.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis—arboretum care of living fossils, post‑keeper lighthouse, trauma from a sky‑borne catastrophe—feels fresh and inevitable once seen. The photograph as tactile trigger and the “pearl of stillness” method avoid cliché. Risks are quiet but confident, privileging interior pressure over spectacle. The reconfiguration at the end is specific rather than generic uplift.</comment>
