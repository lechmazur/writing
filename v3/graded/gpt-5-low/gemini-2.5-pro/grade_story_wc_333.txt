<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation is crystalline (freeing an idea from fear), and the Locksmith’s actions align cleanly with it. Interiority is mostly externalized through ritual and image rather than contradictory impulses; he meets little resistance beyond the lock’s design. The mother’s grief is present and embodied but lightly used as a crucible. Change is earned, though the Locksmith’s near-frictionless competence softens character drama.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: tension condenses toward the first star, then the humming and dissolution create a clear cadence shift to release. Closure lands on the page: the lock unravels, the idea departs, and the woman’s longing is replaced by charged silence (a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost). Orientation is solid from the outset; causality is coherent within the fable logic. The price—letting the symphony go into the world rather than “return” to the son—is legible and poignant.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The circle of salt stones, nexus under twilight, and starlight are not mere backdrop—they constrain method (work begins at the first star; light must pass through hair). Sensory detailing is selective and purposeful (ozone tang, shimmering lattice). World rules stay consistent and are learned through action. The final image is charged by the setting’s constraints, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear early: liberate a trapped composition. Escalation occurs via a tight clock (first star) and a tactical deepening (disorient fear through pattern rather than forcing a key). The price is the release into the solar winds rather than a personal reclamation. It’s a graceful tightening rather than a reversal, but pressure coheres under the chosen lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Themes of fear as a jailer, stewardship over ownership of ideas, and liberation over possession emerge from action and image. “He believed ideas were living things” risks stating thesis, but scene work earns it. The ending reweighs longing and creation, resisting tidy moralizing. Subtext in the Locksmith’s “payment” being silence is deft.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is assured, lyrical, and consistent in distance; controlled omniscience stays close to the Locksmith with restrained access to the mother. Rhythm modulates well at the peak (hum deepens; lattice wavers). Diction fits the mythic register without slipping into abstraction. Dialogue is sparse and natural when present.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line-level craft is clean, with varied syntax and strong verbs; images do double duty (lattice as both technique and broken melody). Occasional elevated phrasing remains coherent and earned by the fable tone; minimal redundancy. Momentum holds without scaffolding or filler. The final sentences land with clarity and cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The locksmith-of-secrets trope is invigorated through a specific, tactile method (starlight filtered through hair to disorient fear). The “payment as silence” and the idea as a freed, migratory being feel fresh and inevitable. Risk is taken in leaning fully into accumulative lyric without losing legibility. The synthesis is memorable and coherent.</comment>
