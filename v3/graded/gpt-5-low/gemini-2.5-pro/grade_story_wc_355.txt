<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear, particular motivation (cataloging silences for empathy) with embodied interiority (synesthetic tasting of tones). The choice not to read the diary and to “recover the feeling” aligns with his values and reveals him under pressure. Internal contradiction is mild—time pressure versus reverence—so the struggle feels gentle rather than fraught. Still, micro-choices (overshooting the dial by feel) credibly earn the final act.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single-scene accumulative build toward a clean on-page closure: the tuned absence-tone and the audible click. Orientation is immediate; causality holds from set-up through the climax. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (he preserves devotion without violating privacy) with a modest but legible cost (renunciation of reading). The fireworks’ entrance tightens the window effectively without gimmicks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Rich, purposeful specificity—ozone, paper, brass, calipers, dial—filtered through his sensibility. The workshop tools constrain and enable tactics; the diary clasp as a recurring object charges the final image. External environment (fireworks) shapes time and tone, becoming counterpoint to the preserved hush. Details serve both action and theme without excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: capture a specific silence before the fireworks break it. Pressure escalates via wrong frequencies, ticking clock, and the intuitive leap past increments, narrowing options toward risk. The price is subtle (foregoing words, trusting feeling under time), fitting an accumulative piece. Stakes remain intimate rather than sharp-edged, keeping it just shy of higher intensity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme coheres: empathy through honoring unvoiced devotion; love as a protective silence. The final image (open, unread diary on the labeled shelf against exploding sky) reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext carries in objects and contrasts (noise/quiet, spectacle/hush). The resonance is strong, if intentionally gentle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A distinct, lyrical POV with controlled diction and rhythm suited to a sensorial tinkerer. The voice modulates with pressure (from rapt attention to decisive turn) and stays within plausible lexicon. Minimal dialogue is purposeful and character-revealing. No head hopping or stance leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line-level craft is polished: varied syntax, vivid verbs, and images doing multiple jobs. Figurative density (taste colors, sound textures) is consistent and legible, not purple. No noticeable loops or scaffolding; momentum holds through the click. A few lush lines flirt with ornament but remain purposeful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Capturing silence via frequency-tuning a diary clasp is a fresh synthesis, made specific by synesthetic perception and ethical restraint. The fireworks counterpoint enriches rather than decorates. The intuitive leap feels inevitable in hindsight. Bold enough to stand out while coherent and human.</comment>
