<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Aris’s scientific detachment versus felt grief is dramatized through concrete perception and micro‑choices (returning with a stool, then choosing the shovel). The orchid→weed transfer reframes his stance credibly, and the final wipe is an embodied renunciation of his “filter.” A couple of thesis‑like lines risk neatness, but the emotional progression remains earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: repeated observation through the dust filters reweights the central stake until the orchid→weed insight triggers a Conceptual Repricing and a Decisive Change. Cost is on the page—“unfiltered reality was jarring, chaotic, and full of pain”—and the final act (seeking the shovel) forecloses the prior remove. Orientation is clean from the opening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The storm‑damaged greenhouse and the dust‑filmed pane are tactile and specific, and the pane functions as a tool that charges the final image (circle wiped clean). Sensory detail (silt’s smell, humidity weight) is purposeful and filtered through a scientist’s gaze. The environment constrains perception and prompts the closing choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around whether he will stay in filtered observation or engage with messy decay; the middle deepening (seeing resource transfer from orchid to weed) narrows options by reframing loss. The final action pays a visible price (relinquishing the protective filter) and aligns internal and external stakes. Quiet but decisive escalation fits the lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars—the dust as lens, decay as transfer, and the closing acceptance of participation—but a few lines tilt toward explicit moralizing (“The universe wasn't just... it was this messy... exchange,” “full of purpose”). Despite that, the last image reweights prior images with honest resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The third‑person close voice carries a distinct perceptual signature—precision, system metaphors, and measured cadence—consistent with a physicist. Lexicon and rhythm modulate with pressure without head‑hopping or register slips. No dialogue, appropriately so.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is clean, vivid, and efficient, with strong verbs and image density doing multiple jobs (the pane as canvas/lens/filter). Occasional elevated abstractions stay anchored in scene; redundancy is minimal. The closure beat is crisp and un-muddled.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The butterfly‑dust‑as‑optical filter is an original, resonant device that ties science and grief into a fresh synthesis. The transfer insight and the ritualistic wipe feel inevitable in hindsight. Risk is quiet but confident, avoiding gimmickry.</comment>
