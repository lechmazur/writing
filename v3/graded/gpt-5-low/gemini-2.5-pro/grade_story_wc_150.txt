<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—to touch lineage and restore faith—is concrete and consistently drives her choices, and the ship etching reorients her belief without feeling unearned. Interiority is embodied through tactile work (freeing the stone) and sensory attention. Internal conflict is subtle (cautious enchantment vs. the risk of disturbing graves) rather than sharply dramatized, keeping the pressure quiet. The change at the end reads earned but low-cost emotionally.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the pattern of wandering → discovery → excavation → placement culminates in a conceptual repricing via the hidden ship carving. Orientation is clear early (who/where/why), and beats link coherently. The cost is modest but legible—patient labor, acceptance over answers—charging the final image. Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration that marks a before/after in her stance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard is vividly specific; roots and bones materially constrain the work and thematically frame continuity. The sundial base and missing gnomon function as object-as-setting that charges the last image (sunlight on the base). Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through Elara’s priorities. Strong integration without over-descriptive drag.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes center on recovering faith through reconstruction; escalation deepens with the discovery, the slow freeing, and the final placement revealing the carving. Pressure remains coherent and grows in a quiet register appropriate to the lens. The visible price is endurance and the relinquishing of tidy answers rather than a sharper trade-off. One meaningful tightening is present and sufficient at this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Themes of interrupted journeys, inheritance, and continuity emerge from particulars (displaced sundial, ship etching, roots and bones) instead of moralizing. The final realization reframes interruption as perpetual departure, reweighting earlier images. A hair close to exposition in the last lines (“Her faith… was slowly being restored”), but it’s grounded by image. Subtext carries through motifs rather than speech.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third-person voice with a distinct perceptual signature—botanical, tactile, and reverent—stays consistent. Rhythm modulates well between meditative wandering and the focused labor of excavation. No head-hopping or stance slips, and inference stays within what Elara can plausibly know. The lyric register is sustained without drift into abstract vagueness.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line-level craft is clean, with varied syntax and strong noun-verb choices; imagery is lush but not purple. The prose carries multiple jobs (atmosphere, character, theme) without redundancy or loops. A few elevated phrases skirt summary but don’t sap momentum. The closing image is crisp and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The “catacomb orchard” and sundial-as-capstone with a hidden ship etching feel fresh and specific; the synthesis of diaspora return, botanical ossuary, and time-measuring object is memorable. The turn from interruption to perpetual beginning is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Risks are aesthetic rather than structural and pay off in coherence. Quiet originality over cleverness.</comment>
