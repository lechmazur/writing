<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—salvaging the sacred in erasure—is embodied in tactile choices: keeping the bread, planting herbs, and risking engagement with authority. Contradictory impulses (her “private sin” of hoarding vs. public planting) coexist credibly and drive the climactic offering of the heel. The patrolman’s brief arc reads human and specific, with status softening in subtext. The final endurance—continuing her quiet defiance after only being “seen”—feels earned and costly at this scale.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single-scene structure is tight: gardening → interruption → uncloak via story and object → patrolman’s memory → altered stasis. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise/Earned Stasis): being “seen” shifts the field without absolving risk, and she resumes with reweighted quiet. Causality holds cleanly, and the cost (risk of punishment, relinquishing secrecy) is legible on the page. Orientation is clear from the outset; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The courtyard/tea house with moss, ivy, and fissures is vivid and functional: it supplies gardening affordances and patrol pressure. Weather and season shape tactics (cloak, seed choice), and the micro‑settings (mortar gaps, statue base) become action-sites. The bread as recurring object charges the final image alongside the fragile green patches. Atmosphere coheres with theme without forcing symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (risk of censure vs. preserving memory/life) is clear early and tightens with the patrolman’s arrival. Elara’s choice to uncloak and offer the bread raises cost and narrows options; his memory line turns the beat. Resolution is an earned endurance with altered social terrain. Stakes remain intimate but felt, appropriate to length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Themes of memory, erasure, and the sacred ordinary accrue through concrete acts (planting herbs, offering the heel) and the shared ghost of Miller’s. Subtext in the patrolman’s response reframes authority as also bereaved. The final cadence—“tenuous absolution” through tending—resonates without moralizing, though the phrase is slightly on‑the‑nose. The ending reweights prior images rather than explaining them.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistently filtered through Elara’s sensibility; diction fits her perceptual bias. Dialogue is spare, charged, and indirect, revealing status and shared history without exposition. Rhythm modulates well from stillness to pressure and back to a charged quiet. No head‑hopping or stance slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sentences carry multiple jobs with clean momentum; figurative language is precise (“fine, grey dust,” “slow green conquest”) and earned. No scaffold loops or clutter; transitions are organic. The final image is crisp and unblunted by purple flourishes. Minor elevated diction stays coherent with the piece’s lyric mode.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The guerrilla gardening as gentle rebellion in a decaying civic space feels fresh, especially paired with the fossilized bread as reliquary. The humanizing pivot via the patrolman’s memory avoids cliché resolution. The conceptual synthesis (absolution via small, persistent acts) reads specific rather than generic. It’s quietly bold without gimmickry.</comment>
