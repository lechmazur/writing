<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elias’s cold, data‑driven motive and Anya’s raw need for relief are cleanly opposed and consistent in action. Interiority is more suggested than inhabited; Anya’s internal conflict is glimpsed (“feeling exposed,” “dizzying shock”) rather than layered. Elias’s borrowing of Anya’s cadence shows character under pressure without over‑explaining. The final reconfiguration lands for Anya, though the emotional cost is conceptual more than viscerally dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Single scene, tight progression: arrival → setup of method → press activation → stamped card → aftermath. The accumulative/textural lens holds; the closure is a Conceptual Repricing when grief is reframed as “shape” with grief persisting as cost. Orientation is clear from the opening, and no causality breaks. The vanishing/birth of constellations brackets the action to give a crisp cadence shift at silence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The topaz workshop, iron press, and halo fragment are tactile and integrated with action, not postcard décor. The tool and environment directly produce the card that charges the final image. Sensory specificity is high yet purposeful; light and vibration evolve with the press’s operation. World rules (physics/divinity hinge) are consistent and learned through use, not lecture.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: Anya seeks alteration of grief; Elias seeks comprehension/data. Pressure coheres and tightens with the lever pull and the room’s transformation; the price is that pain remains, reframed. Agency skews to Elias, with Anya mostly enduring, but the escalation still reads earned under the chosen lens. One decisive intensification suffices at this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Themes of empathy as translation, form vs. feeling, and “structure requires pressure” emerge from concrete acts, not abstracts. The card’s symbol provides a resonant, non‑literal answer: grief can be borne differently when given shape, not erased. Ambiguity around Elias’s ethics and Anya’s relief invites durable reflection without sermonizing. Recurrences (light, pressure, print) cohere without tokenism.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A steady, controlled close third with lyric texture; no head‑hopping and clean modulation during the press’s peak. Dialogue is minimal but subtextual and functional (“Structure requires pressure”). Diction fits the myth‑mechanical milieu and stays within the piece’s established register. Rhythm tightens at the press sequence and resolves into crisp stillness.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High information density with few redundancies; images do more than one job (cosmic light as both mood and mechanism). Lyrical prose risks purple but largely avoids muddle; metaphors cohere around optics/pressure/geometry. Syntax varies to support momentum; no noticeable loops or scaffold lines. The final line lands with clean, charged economy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of a cosmic letterpress, halo fragment, and the mathematics of grief feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The transposed‑empathy mechanic is novel and integral rather than a garnish. Risks in diction and concept heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. The closing object as “shape of grief” is an original, memorable reweighting.</comment>
