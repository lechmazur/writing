<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear, particular motivation (seeking beauty via pattern) and embodied interiority (the ache of fillings, the dented stone) read strong. However, internal contradiction is mild; he rarely strains against himself or risks error. Competence dominates with little depicted struggle before the payoff. The final renunciation (dropping the stone) lands as a credible, earned shift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: attention to hums/silences densifies until the alignment manifests and reconfigures meaning. Orientation is clean early, and the closure is on the page with a cost—the reweighted identity and letting the stone fall. The decisive intensification is the visible aurora syncing with the decoded rhythm. Stakes are modest but coherent and resolved without contradiction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid and POV‑filtered (obsidian ridge, purple sun, hums felt in teeth), and world rules are learned through his method. The recurring object (basalt stone) charges the final image, satisfying the 9‑band gate. The magnetic nexus and twilight materially shape what he can perceive and when. Sensory balance (sound/silence/visuals/tactile) feels intentional and integral.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—wresting pattern/beauty from chaos—is signaled and tightened by the approaching “next phase.” Escalation is a density increase rather than adversarial conflict, but the cadence shift at the alignment is decisive. The on‑page price is subtle (renunciation of the past via the stone), not visceral, which keeps tension refined rather than gripping. Still, the deepening reweights options and pays off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: strategy in silence, beauty in difficulty, exile repriced by discovery. The chess metaphor inflects perception without collapsing into allegory; the final “checkmate” image reweights prior material. A few declarative lines edge toward thesis (“He sought no power… to discover beauty in the difficult”), but don’t undermine resonance. The ending’s hopeful melancholy lingers with conceptual clarity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV distance and lexicon suit an erudite tutor; syntax and diction maintain a coherent perceptual signature. Rhythmic control supports the accumulative build without head‑hopping or register slips. Figurative texture feels purposeful and consistent with the character’s mind. No dialogue needed; narrative voice carries subtext through image and pacing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lines are clean, varied, and purposeful; images often do double duty (hums as moves, silences as strategy). Occasional lushness skirts purple but remains legible and scene‑propulsive. No meaningful scaffold or loop artifacts; the final image is crisp. Information density and cadence are well‑managed for the mode.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: translating silence as a strategic system, chess logic mapped to a magnetic nexus, and an auroral checkmate. The worry stone reprises with meaning rather than ornament. Risks (lyric‑accumulative structure, conceptual closure) are coherent and pay off. Only the low external jeopardy keeps it from a higher band.</comment>
