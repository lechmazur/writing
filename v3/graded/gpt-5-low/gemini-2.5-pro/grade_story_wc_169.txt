<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—engineering hope through repeatable “equations”—is clear and consistently enacted. Interiority is specific to her perceptual habits (drips, hum, needle), and the breath‑catch when the gauge dips provides embodied pressure. Internal contradiction is light; she is largely competent with little felt moral trade‑off beyond risk of failure. The closing stance shift (quiet satisfaction, planning the next attempt) is earned but modest in cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Orientation is crisp from the outset (grotto, device, goal), and the scene proceeds through a clean causal chain: design → tide catalyst → light/hum → gauge dip and rise → stable reading. Closure lands on the page with a Decisive Change (needle stabilizes higher) and a conceptual price (experiment spent, risk weathered). The drive lens reads primarily Causal with lyric texture; the cost is present but subtle. Scope discipline holds to a single scene and stake.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The tide‑polished grotto is vivid and functional: the returning sea is the activating constraint that makes the pattern work. Sensory specifics (salt film, phosphorescence, hum) are filtered through Elara’s scientific‑lyric gaze. The environment tangibly shapes options and charges the final image when the pattern dissolves back into shells. World rules remain consistent and are learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around the single stake: whether the trial will stabilize a dying timeline’s vitality. Escalation concentrates at the needle’s plunge—a meaningful tightening that tests her method and resolve—before the controlled ascent. The price is primarily risk and expended resources; no external antagonist or hard trade‑off appears. Nevertheless, the turn is earned and legible under the chosen lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Thematic throughline—hope as designable, resilient pattern versus self‑consuming revolution—emerges through the action (fractal design, tide activation, stable rise). The final image reweights prior material without sermonizing, though phrases like “new theorem of optimism” edge toward explicit statement. Subtext in the “serene upheaval” and the spent equation carries emotional aftereffect. Complexity is maintained without false equivalence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A controlled, lucid voice fuses scientific diction with lyric sensibility, consistently anchored to Elara’s perceptual signature. Psychic distance is steady; no head‑hopping or unjustified knowledge. Rhythm modulates well at the dip/ascend beat. No dialogue is needed or missed.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lines are polished and purposeful; images do double duty (light as math, tide as catalyst). A few abstractions recur (“equations,” “vitality,” “timeline”) but are grounded by tactile detail, avoiding purple excess. No paraphrase loops or template cadences drag momentum. The final cadence lands cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis—a grotto lab using shell‑fractal decorations and an altitude gauge to nudge parallel timelines—is striking and specific. Turns arise from established mechanics rather than late rule changes. The risk is imaginative but coherent, with a fresh tonal mix of serenity and experiment. Only the cost dimension keeps it shy of the highest band.</comment>
