<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clear, character‑specific interiority with credible contradiction (serenity vs the “first tremor of doubt”). The alder story stick and the hollow‑eyed spectator concretize his ethical stakes. His decision to “reverse its trajectory” is earned and forecloses a prior path without neat self‑absolution. Minor note: a few theme-forward declarations brush close to discursiveness but remain grounded in action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lens: Causal. The argument → doubt → ethical recalibration → decision to stage a response show forms a clean because/therefore chain. Closure lands as a Decisive Change with conceptual cost (accepting responsibility without betraying method). Quiet but legible pressure; the cost is relational and artistic rather than externalized.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The radar dome and “meteor hush” create a distinctive, lived atmosphere; the viewport stars and polished concrete are purposefully chosen. The campfire story stick functions as a micro‑setting object that charges the final image and choice. Environmental constraint is primarily tonal rather than tactical but strongly integrated with theme and ending.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—ethical responsibility vs artistic method—is clear early and tightens with the remembered audience member and Elara’s accusation. The meaningful turn is the vow to answer the prior show, not retract, which reweights risk. Cost is felt but subtle (no tidy absolution, acceptance of possible harm). Slight softening from limited external opposition on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Themes of narrative responsibility, ambiguity, and communal clarity arise from particulars (stick, puppet king, hollow‑eyed man) rather than abstract sermonizing. The final image (“point toward the dawn”) reweights “half‑lit epiphanies” without moralizing. One direct thesis line (“handing an audience a conclusion was a form of tyranny”) skirts on‑the‑nose but is earned by context.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled voice with a precise lexicon that matches an urbane artisan. Psychic distance stays stable; quoted past dialogue is sparing and effective as pressure. Rhythm modulates with intent, and perception is character‑coherent throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density; images do multiple jobs (“meteor hush,” “baton being passed”). Figurative language is rich yet coherent, with no noticeable loops or scaffolding. Cadence supports momentum from contemplation to resolve without purple spill.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—calligrapher‑marionettist in a radar dome wrestling with ethical ambiguity via a response performance—feels fresh and specific. Turns grow from character and tools (story stick, marionettes), not gimmicks. Risk‑taking is controlled and legible.</comment>
