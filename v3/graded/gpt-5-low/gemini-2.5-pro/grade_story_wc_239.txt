<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear, compelling motivation—unify with the hush—drives continuous micro‑choices (spiral walk, dictionary consultation, final renunciation). Interiority is specific and embodied for a lyric mode, though emotions skew conceptual over visceral. The lingering individuality vs. dissolution provides credible tension. The final cost (selfhood surrendered) reads earned by the established ritual.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: pattern density intensifies toward the center, culminating in a decisive reconfiguration. Closure lands on the page through the silent drop and cessation of witnessing, with clear cost. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when), and the ritual spiral provides structural cohesion. No causality breaks; the tightening is purposeful and sufficient at this length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid and purposeful: obsidian hall, resounding hush, and the lost‑in‑time library charge the mood and final image. The setting’s properties (hush, timelessness, concentric architecture) meaningfully contour the ritual and end state. Sensory detail privileges sound/its absence effectively. It stops short of physically constraining a choice, hence just under the 9‑band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—selfhood vs. dissolution—escalates via the spiral approach and the reinterpreted definition that narrows options toward merger. The decisive tightening is the move from witnessing to becoming. Stakes stay internal yet coherent; the cost is legible. Slightly limited by a lack of a mid‑scene reversal beyond deepening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>“Spiral arbitration” reframes conflict/peace and reweights prior images, delivering a resonant, non‑literal answer in the final silence. The dictionary’s redefinition shifts from term to ontology, aligning concept and act. A touch of thesis‑forward phrasing (“It wasn’t a theory; it was…”) edges toward telling but doesn’t undercut the earned image. The aftereffect is contemplative and precise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Steady, assured close third with a distinct, lyrical cadence; syntax modulates as she nears center. Diction matches the metaphysical register without drifting into academic abstraction. No head‑hopping or stance slippage. Elision is purposeful and legible through the ritual frame.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lines are clean, image‑dense, and purposeful; rhythm supports the accumulating hush without syntactic monotony. Figurative choices cohere (silence as plenum; spiral as process) with minimal purple excess. Minimal redundancy and strong verb choice maintain momentum. The final sentence crisply resolves motif and action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: librarian as end‑of‑history witness, “spiral arbitration,” and a time‑marooned library converge into a memorable conceptual arc. Risks in tone and abstraction pay off through specific ritual and object work. The ending feels inevitable in hindsight. Distinctive without gimmick.</comment>
