<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Silas’s compulsion to decode the gesture is clear and rooted in his solitary, observant nature; the duty-to-light vs. compulsion tension adds nuance. Interiority is concrete (“man made of absences,” the tactile handling of the boutonnière) and character‑particular. The change at the end (curating the flower as a monument) reads as a credible endurance/renunciation with emotional cost. Slightly limited by low external pressure and minimal contradiction beyond a gentle pull between vocation and obsession.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: repeated nightly engagements with the boutonnière build to a cadence shift and conceptual reweighting. Closure lands in the final act of placement and the realization of surrender (“He had brought his mountain to the sea to let it drown”), with felt cost. Orientation is clean from the opening and time progression is legible. Quiet, but structurally tight and coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Atmosphere is rich and specific: mist, opal dock, the lighthouse’s beam as metronome, and lived‑in tools (sextant, sea glass). The lighthouse and beam subtly charge the ending image without becoming overt symbolism. Sensory detail is purposeful and POV‑filtered by a keeper’s eye. It stops short of constraining choice, which keeps it just under the 9‑band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (to decode the final gesture) is clear and tightens through the ritualized nightly sessions. The escalation is primarily textural, culminating in the interpretive click and the museuming of the flower. Cost is felt but internal; little is foreclosed beyond an emotional stance shift. Tension is continuous but gentle, befitting the mode.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Themes of isolation, memory, and surrender emerge organically through images and choices; the Edelweiss’s reweighting at the end resonates. Subtext is strong: the ocean as rival to a mountain and the act of curation as witnesshood. No moralizing; the final image offers a non‑literal answer with lingering ache. The insight feels earned through the patterned method of “observing gaps.”</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The third‑person close POV is steady, with a distinct perceptual signature (precision about light and absence). Diction is lyrical but grounded and consistent with a solitary keeper’s sensibility. Rhythm modulates well at the climax without head‑hopping or register drift. Elision around the stranger remains purposeful and integral to the voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is controlled, image‑dense, and largely free of loops or scaffolding; sentences carry multiple jobs efficiently. Metaphors are coherent and not overstacked, with “man made of absences” and “metronome for his thoughts” doing crisp work. Momentum matches the contemplative mode and doesn’t stall. A few elevated turns risk purple but stay justified by voice and pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lighthouse keeper + Edelweiss + “borrowed memories” yields a fresh synthesis; the ocean vs. mountain counterweight is non‑obvious and satisfying. The investigative method via absences is an elegant twist on detection. Emotional truth reads specific, not templated. Quiet risks are taken and pay off without obscuring clarity.</comment>
