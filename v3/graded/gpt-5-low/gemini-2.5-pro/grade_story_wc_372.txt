<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Kaelen’s motive is clear and consistent—salvage essence, not stop the end—and his micro‑choices (tuning, whispering “Hold,” stabbing the rune) align under pressure. Interiority is restrained but embodied (breath fog, careful handling) and competence feels earned. Internal contradiction is minimal; he endures rather than wrestles, keeping the arc subtle. The earned stasis at the end reads credible, if emotionally cool.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Orientation is crisp from the outset (who/where/when), and the accumulative/textural drive holds. The closure lands on the page with cost: the vow extinguishes as he captures a single tone; the slide is placed in “Extinguished,” and the ledger line becomes both tombstone and seed. Pressure coheres as the light falters and frequencies scatter to a last flare. The final window image reweights the action without hand‑waving.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The frozen spire above the cloud‑sea is vivid and purposeful; the cold, silence, and crystal apparatus filter through a professional gaze. The environment shapes behavior (breath fogging, vaults, hush) and charges the final image at the observation window. Object‑as‑setting (resonator, slide) integrates with space and tone. While constraint isn’t extreme, atmosphere and tool/body interplay do real work.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—capture the vow’s frequency before it dies—is signaled early and tightens as the projection frays and the light pulses like a “failing heartbeat.” Agency drives the escalation (tuning, searching for the carrier wave, decisive capture). The last flare and single tone provide a clear pinch and price. The cost is conceptual and emotional rather than physical, but it’s legible and felt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: preservation vs. loss, reciprocity distilled into physics, the ethics of witnessing. “It was a tombstone and a seed” elegantly reweights prior images without sermonizing. The archive as lexicon of essences reframes endings into meaning, a conceptual repricing that lingers. Ambiguity is purposeful, not vague.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The lyrical third‑person close is steady and controlled, with a distinct tactile lexicon (hoarfrost, resonator, carrier wave). Rhythm modulates with pressure, tightening as the light falters. No head‑hopping or register drift; the voice stays plausibly within a meticulous archivist’s lens. The single whispered line fits the hush and avoids faux drama.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished: strong noun‑verb pairs, vivid yet controlled imagery, and purposeful repetition (“hush,” “slide,” “frequency”). Figurative density is high but coherent, avoiding mixed metaphors; momentum holds through the technical sequence. Minor risk of purple is managed by concrete action and clean sequencing. The final cadence lands cleanly without scaffolding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The premise (archiving fading vows via light/frequency) synthesizes familiar tropes into something specific and memorable. The resonator’s “single tone” as essence and the “quartz hush” in a frozen spire feel fresh. Turns arise from established logic, not late rule changes. It’s bold and singular without gimmickry.</comment>
