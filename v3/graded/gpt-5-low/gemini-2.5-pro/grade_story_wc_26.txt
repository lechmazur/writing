<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Kael’s motive—preserving Elara’s full, flawed self—drives every choice, with embodied details (the river stone, the meticulous video study) revealing his temperament. The refusal to “slash and burn” and the choice to integrate show credible values under pressure. Internal contradiction (love vs. the risk of reviving pain) is present but resolves smoothly; the struggle could show more friction. Still, his actions align with a clear hierarchy of values and pay a visible emotional price.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under a causal lens, the chain is tight: undetectable blight → comparative analysis → origin identified → choice to integrate → on‑page reconfiguration. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with cost (keeping sorrow), crystallized in the final image. Anchors (who/where/when) are established early, and no causality gaps appear. The resolution is earned without resorting to a mechanical “fix.”</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The Lumina‑Arbor’s tactile tech (pearl console, light‑vines) and the charged micro‑setting (river stone on the node) directly shape tactics and the ending image. Specifics like the archive’s detection limits justify Kael’s method and the need for human curation. Sensory and atmospheric choices are purposeful and POV‑filtered. The closing window-on-clouds tableau coheres tonally and thematically.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes (preserving Elara’s true self) are clear early; escalation tightens as observation becomes intervention. The decisive turn is Kael’s integration choice that forecloses deletion and embraces cost. The process runs without overt resistance or a counterbeat testing his resolve, which tempers intensity. Nonetheless, the price (enshrining sorrow) is unmistakable and charges the ending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—wholeness through integrating darkness—emerges from concrete acts (comparison, integration) rather than abstraction. Recurring images (hands, laugh, light‑vines, stone) reweight meaning at the end to a credible, bittersweet stasis. One line skirts explicit thesis (“saved not by erasing the darkness...”), but sentiment stays earned. The afterimage of luminous regret invites reflection without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent with Kael’s perceptual bias; diction fits the elevated, elegiac register. Psychic distance stays stable; no head‑hopping or unjustified omniscience. Rhythm modulates well from analytical to tender. Elision is purposeful and legible through the closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lines carry high information density with few redundancies; images do double duty (light‑vines as system and metaphor). Figurative language is rich but largely coherent and not overstacked to the point of blur. Minor purple tendencies (“poisonous vine strangling a perfect rose”) never obscure sense or causality. The final cadence is clean and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The memory‑garden curator integrating a self‑generated trauma‑shadow offers a fresh synthesis of SF and elegy. The method (silent video comparison) and the ethical calculus (preserve scars) feel specific and non‑obvious. Some genre ingredients are familiar, but the execution feels singular. The closing re‑coloring of the archive (silvery blue) is an elegant, inevitable turn.</comment>
