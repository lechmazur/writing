<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation—to momentarily resurrect her father’s lost vision—is clear, embodied, and enacted through specific craft choices. Her steadiness versus desperation gives quiet tension without melodrama. The tear freezing and her calm acceptance at the end read as an Earned Stasis with cost. Slightly limited internal contradiction keeps it just short of peak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Orientation is immediate (who/where/when), and the accumulative/textural lens holds: breath-pattern → frost-pattern → ephemeral capture → collapse. Closure lands on the page with cost: the mountains shatter and she chooses acceptance/repricing (“a boundary…could be erased”). The sextant’s reprise in her hand seals the before/after. No causality breaks or soft resets.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The fogged, ruined orchard and twilight frost are vivid and purpose-driven; frost is both setting and mechanism. Tools (mirror, broken sextant) function as micro‑setting that constrains tactics and charges the final image. Sensory selection tracks urgency and craft bias. Environment directly affects outcome, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake is tight: remake the dream on her terms. Pressure coheres through a single deepening—the breath‑guided crystallization—culminating in a shattering that tests her intent. Agency is continuous and the price (ephemerality, relinquishing possession) is legible. Stakes remain intimate but consequential.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of erasing boundaries—self/world, memory/present, science/sympathy—emerges through action and image rather than thesis. The final acceptance reweights the premise from conquest to translation (map over trophy). A faintly declarative line (“She had proven…”) skates near telling but doesn’t blunt the resonance. The glass‑mountain image meaningfully transforms by the end.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyrical, controlled third‑person closely tracks a craftsperson’s sensory priorities; rhythm modulates with breath. Diction is unified and confident without register drift. No head‑hopping or withholding. Voice sustains pressure through cadence rather than plot pyrotechnics.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High line‑level control: images are precise and functional (“plume of white mist,” “lattice of frozen breath”). Repetition in the breathing passages is patterned and purposeful, not looped scaffold. Minor lushness never clouds clarity. Final image is clean and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Recreating lunar highlands via breath‑induced frost on a black mirror is striking and specific. The broken sextant repurposed toward the mirror reimagines science as sympathy. The synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight under the fog constraint. Bold yet coherent without gimmickry.</comment>
