<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Clear, compelling motive (redeem Eva) drives concrete choices, and “nervously confident” reads on the body (thumb on nail, trembling, cliff‑edge feeling). Contradictory impulses—fear vs. idealism—coexist in scene and earn the final stance shift. Micro‑choices (programming the drone, pressing the nail) align with character. The only shortfall is limited on‑page cost or error under peak pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong causal chain: journals → coded stanzas → micro‑vortex → weeping rock → copper key → logbook → call to Archives. Closure lands as a decisive change in stance and options (from private suspicion to formal challenge), with a conceptual repricing of history. The cost is implied (institutional backlash, storm risk) more than dramatized in the final beat, softening impact. Orientation is crisp from the first lines.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The Far North station, fog, basalt monolith, and micro‑vortex are vivid and functional, not decorative; the environment and tools (drone, climate data) directly enable tactics. The copper nail and rock aperture operate as micro‑setting constraints. Weather and dampness mirror internal pressure and modulate at the end (“beginning to dry”). A small quibble: the station’s technical texture could bear one more tactile detail under stress.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible early and tightens through the expedition and unlocking sequence. The key tightening is Elias choosing to leave the station into hostile weather and commit the nail—no easy out once pressed. Prices (physical risk, institutional danger) are present but lightly felt at the peak; the aftermath moves briskly to resolution. Still, agency drives each turn without coincidence solving the problem.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Erasure, legacy, and map-versus-territory cohere via recurring wetness/dread imagery reweighted by the drying final image. The cartographical curse reframes institutional power without sermonizing. One explanatory sentence stack (“magically scoured… a void… reverse”) edges toward telling, slightly blunting subtext. Overall resonance lingers with the “air beginning to dry” as a thematic answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Controlled close third with a distinct perceptual bias (cartographic thinking, weather literacy). Rhythm flexes between lyric image and procedural purpose without head‑hopping. Diction stays consistent to character and world. Minor expository patches are integrated smoothly enough not to break the voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clean sentences with good propulsion and multi‑tasking lines (“spongey dread” motif carries tone and theme). A few redundancies (“his first breakthrough came through…,” restating “nervously confident”) and brief telliness in the reveal paragraph modestly slow momentum. Figurative language remains coherent and purposeful. Punctuation, grammar, and sequencing are crisp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: climatological upheaval + map librarian + coffin‑nail key + reversible exile via coded verse. Turns feel earned from prior particulars, not late rule changes. The cartographical curse and environmental specificity distinguish the piece from common discovery tropes. Risk lies in mythic‑procedural blending, which the story manages with clarity.</comment>
