<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara’s drive is clear and character‑specific, and her sequence of micro‑choices (repositioning the fragment, inverting gain) aligns with that motive. However, internal contradiction and felt cost are light; despair is noted but quickly supplanted by smooth competence. The mentor’s maxim risks tidy epiphany rather than pressure‑forged change. The ending registers a credible stance shift, but without a sharp personal trade‑off on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Hybrid with an accumulative/textural dominant: pressure builds via perigee and widening channels to a pattern break where silence is “carved away.” Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—listening for absence—on the page. Causality is clean and motivated by her tactical choices. Cost is present (system strain, risk of overwhelm) but conceptually weighted more than concretely paid.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The abandoned radio tower city, Black‑Lip Gorge, and perigee charge the air and inflect tactics (groaning tower, crackling pressure) with vivid, selective sensory detail. The Hollywood fragment functions as charged object‑setting, integrated with action. While atmosphere is rich and purposeful, the environment rarely constrains options beyond ambient risk, so it stops short of 9‑band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capturing the “shard of hush”) is signaled and pressure escalates as she opens every channel and the system threatens to fail. The decisive tightening is the inversion to seek a structured null, which reweights options. The price feels modest—no tool failure or loss forces a trade‑off—so the climax leans elegant rather than costly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme coheres—finding beginnings within endings—realized through the experiential discovery of a meaningful silence. The final image of a waiting city resonates, but the explicit moralizing line (“proving that the deepest truths...”) states what the scene already earned, damping subtext. Subtler trust in image would heighten after‑echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a distinct, lyrical yet controlled register; diction matches a technical mystic. Rhythmic modulation under pressure (“inviting the storm,” “the roaring static didn’t just stop”) is effective and legible. No head‑hopping or stance slips; inference stays within plausible knowledge.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Line craft is clean, with strong verbs and purposeful imagery; sentences carry multiple jobs without sludge. Occasional purple tilts and near‑summary lines appear but don’t obscure action or closure. Rhythm varies well; minimal redundancy. Technical language is sparing and character‑motivated.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The “structured silence” and the off‑path use of a supernova fragment as a resonant anti‑noise key feel fresh. The tactic of un‑asking assumptions integrates ingenuity with plot. Risks are taken without obscuring clarity, though the win’s smoothness trims the sense of peril that might have elevated uniqueness further.</comment>
