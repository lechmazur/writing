<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kaelen’s motive (recovering Elara’s erased truth) is clear and intensifies as he discovers her marks, with embodied emotion (“tenderness so fierce it threatened to crack his ribs”) balancing the volcanic rage. Contradictory impulses (hot anger vs. intuitive restraint) act in scene and drive the key choice. The final renunciation of fire for creation feels earned by his pattern‑reading and her anticipations. Slightly tidy self‑summarizing lines temper the messiness of human contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: clue trail → sealed chamber → tapestry lens → projected constellation → hidden text → reconfigured aim. Closure lands on the page as a stance shift (from arsonist to curator) with felt cost (foregoing vengeance for long, careful work). Orientation is early and stable; single scene coherence holds. Pressure plate, light fissure, and lens use keep turns motivated rather than coincidental.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The Xylos Archive is vivid and tactile (basalt walls, petrified paper, vellum, fissured sun) and its properties constrain choice: the window’s light and the tapestry’s weave are required to reveal the text. Recurring objects (tapestry, vandalized canvas) charge the final image. Environmental tools (ancient pigments/binders) directly inform the closing decision. Detail remains purposeful and POV‑filtered rather than touristic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recovering and honoring Elara’s truth—tightens with the vandal’s initials (rage spike) and the reveal that destruction has been integrated into the art. The key turn is Kaelen choosing creation over retaliation, foreclosing the prior path of arsonous vengeance. Escalation is more deepening than reversal but coherent under the causal lens. The price is primarily internal and credible for this scale.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Erasure vs. survival and theft vs. authorship emerge through concrete images (black slash as canvas; light revealing hidden testament) rather than thesis. The ending reweights the premise: destruction becomes substrate for voice, and tenderness is reframed as durable fuel. A few explicit summative sentences edge toward stating theme, but resonance still arises from particulars. The emotional aftereffect lingers as defiance transmuted into care.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Single‑POV voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature (analytical patterning meeting sensuous detail). Modulation under pressure is apt: sentence rhythm tightens at reveals and calms at resolve. No head‑hopping or stance slips; inference reads as inference. Slight rhetorical flourish at the very end is within voice and does not blur lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High information density with minimal scaffold; images often do double duty (setting + theme). Figurative language is rich but coherent and spaced; rhythm varies well. A few near‑summative lines risk purple but don’t stall momentum. Mechanics are clean, and the final line resolves by image and recharged motif.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The tapestry‑lens constellation reveal and the use of vandalism as medium feel fresh and inevitable given the seeded clues. The lost‑civilization archive and art‑forensics blend produce a distinctive synthesis. The arsonist‑to‑curator pivot avoids cliché by embedding cost and honoring craft. Not radical innovation, but executed with specificity and conviction.</comment>
