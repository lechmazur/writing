<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara’s need to save the blighted orchard is clear, and her choices consistently align with that motive. Her embodied responses (the hum in her bones, the controlled silence) give her an interior texture. However, internal contradiction is minimal—she reads chiefly as competent and steady under pressure, with little friction beyond time. The final stance feels earned but lightly priced emotionally.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Orientation is immediate and clean: who, where, when, and the “Inversion” window are established early. The causal chain holds—gravity flips, the river becomes the path, the arrow guides, the shard is taken, and the escape beats the returning gravity. Closure lands with a conceptual repricing: the shard reframes “cure” as memory of resilience Elara carries back. Cost is present but modest (time pressure, possible harm to the source), which keeps this shy of the top tier.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The environment is vivid and consequential: inverted rivers, floating arches, and the geode‑cavern actively constrain navigation and choices. The arrow relic as tool‑within‑setting and the timed gravity shift both shape tactics. Sensory texture (levitating droplets, silent ballet of fish and leaves) supports tone without stalling momentum. World rules are learned through action and stay consistent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (secure planetary resilience) is clear, with pressure cohering around the one‑hour inversion and the narrowing path through the geode. Escalation is credible (river entry, mounting hum, crystal center, gravity’s return), and the extraction beat forces a time‑bound decision. The visible price is mainly risk and potential damage to the source, not a tradeoff that bites on the page. Still, the tightening cadence reads earned and focused.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Themes of remembered vitality and intergenerational stewardship arise organically via the “gathering of echoes.” The seed pod’s instant growth powerfully enacts the idea. Some conceptual language (“core concept... life force”) edges toward telling, slightly flattening subtext. The final image—carrying memory rather than a simple cure—lands as a resonant answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The voice is confidently lyrical with a consistent perceptual signature rooted in Elara’s piloting focus and reverence for the orchard world. Rhythmic control suits the pressure—measured sentences in the approach, tightening as the window closes. No head‑hopping or stance drift; diction remains apt for SF‑lyric mode. Elevated phrasing is purposeful rather than performative.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lines carry strong image density with clear sequencing; most sentences do multiple jobs. Figurative flourishes (“whirling silence,” “gathering of echoes”) are vivid and coherent to the world’s physics. Minor lushness never muddies action, and there’s little scaffold or repetition. The final cadence is clean and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The inverted river as navigational method, the Anechoic Heart storing life’s echoes, and the relic’s halved arrow together feel fresh and integrated. The discovery’s reframing of “cure” as memory‑transmission avoids a stock fix. Risks are taken in blending lyric tone with hard constraints, and the synthesis holds. Only the brief explanatory gloss tempers absolute novelty.</comment>
