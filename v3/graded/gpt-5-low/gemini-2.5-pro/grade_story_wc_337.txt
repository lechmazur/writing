<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Motivation is precise and embodied—she restores spirits as she restores masks—while the apprentice’s fear and dawning resolve give the relationship texture. Interiority is specific (breath‑holding, bone‑cool needle), and actions align with vocation under pressure. Internal contradiction is modest (weariness vs. duty), not profound, keeping the emotional profile strong but not searing. The closing handoff credibly shifts burden with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Clear orientation from the first lines; single scene; pressure coheres under an accumulative/textural lens. Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration: a knot released, ambient pressure eased, and the charged transfer of the needle. Cost is legible (exhaustion, ongoing burden) and the final image tightens options (“thousands more”). The causal line within the ritual (choose knot → tease → release) is clean without over‑explaining.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary, faceted starlight, and the net are vivid and purposeful; the environment’s rule (accumulating and absorbing silence) directly shapes tactics and the ending image. Sensory detail is balanced (cold air, brine scent, light tremor) and filtered through craft‑specific perception. The needle and net function as micro‑setting objects that constrain choice. World rules stay consistent and integrated with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—grounding unrest before it unravels creation—is translated into a concrete test: one sailor’s knot. Escalation arrives as density and focus rather than reversals, culminating in the precise, risky untying; cost surfaces as physical/psychic depletion and the scale of remaining work. Stakes skirt abstraction early but get localized credibly in the release beat. The final handoff sustains pressure by foreclosing respite.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme coheres: restoration as an ethics of attention; silence as both refuge and burden; apprenticeship as inheritance of cost. The mask‑restorer metaphor threads action to meaning without sermonizing, and the final image reweights craft into duty. Subtext—naming “exhume their story” before release—grounds the moral calculus in care, not conquest. Resonance lingers without tidy moral closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>A consistent, lyrical first‑person voice with controlled rhythm and image; diction fits a ritual specialist without drifting into academic register. Dialogue is spare but carries subtext (naming “lucid unrest,” the needle reveal, the closing charge). Psychic distance stays stable; perception matches plausible knowledge. The prose modulates under pressure without head‑hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Line craft is mostly taut; images do multiple jobs (light, net, brine) and avoid mixed metaphors. A lush register risks purple but remains purposeful and clear; no noticeable loops or scaffold. Syntax varies and supports momentum through the untying sequence. Final cadence lands cleanly with an image rather than explanation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The net that “accumulates silence” and the restorer‑as‑psychopomp premise feel fresh and integrated. The ritual mechanic (tapestry needle, knot exhumation) transforms familiar ghostwork into specific craft. The apprentice handoff as closure is classic but recharged by the world’s logic. Risks are aesthetic rather than structural and they pay off.</comment>
