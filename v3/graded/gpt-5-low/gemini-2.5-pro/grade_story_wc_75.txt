<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Alistair’s motives are clear and embodied: a curator’s urge to preserve becomes the engine of a survival choice. His historically oriented mind credibly produces the sonic‑resonance tactic, and his status shift from ignored petitioner to conductor tracks. Emotional texture is specific (the emerald lens as comfort and tool; the warm ‘A’ as catalyst). Internal conflict is present but light; despair to resolve turns quickly without much on‑page friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal. Because the waterfall freezes and fractures threaten collapse, Alistair studies the ice, recalls archival knowledge, persuades the council, and directs the singing that triggers a controlled thaw; the waterfall’s return is an on‑page Decisive Change. Cost is implicit (risk of collapse, social resistance) rather than dramatized as a loss. Orientation is crisp and the chain holds cleanly through closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The grotto city and frozen cataract are vivid, tactile, and pressure the choices; the dimming phosphorescent moss and silence reinforce stakes. The emerald lens functions as micro‑setting and tool that affects tactics in the climax. Sensory balance is strong (cold, hiss, roar, yeast warmth) and filtered through Alistair’s professional gaze. A minor factual gloss on resonance physics stays plausible at this length.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (survival beneath the ice) is established early and tightens as the fractures are revealed. The escalation from council doubt to a city‑wide, risk‑bearing song is protagonist‑driven and culminates in a felt environmental response. The price is mostly contingent (the danger they invoke) and morale‑based, which slightly softens the edge. Still, the turn to “We can persuade it” convincingly narrows options into a singular, communal tactic.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Art as survival, memory becoming method, and community over despair cohere through particulars (anthems as tool; bread as identity). The final image reweights culture from museum artifact to active instrument without a stated moral. One line flirts with thesis‑speak (“that is the art that will rescue us”) but the scene earns its sentiment. The resonance metaphor works both physically and culturally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The voice is controlled, lyrical without excess, and consistent with a cultivated guide’s sensibility; diction fits the POV. Dialogue is brief but functional, marking status dynamics (Elder Maeve’s resignation vs. Alistair’s urgency). Rhythmic modulation at the climax (“Higher! Hold that note!”) sharpens immediacy. No head‑hopping or stance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is clear, image‑rich, and mostly free of loops or scaffolding; sentences often do double duty (world + pressure). The “rosewater dread” coinage and waterfall imagery recur with purpose. A few elevated phrases approach purple but do not blur action. Momentum holds through exposition because it keys to present stakes.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis—opera lens, sonic thaw, displaced culture saved by communal song—feels fresh and earned. Specificity (phosphorescent moss, initials bread, emerald filter reading fractures) distinguishes the world. The arc avoids gimmickry and lets one bold idea carry both plot and theme. Only the neat success slightly tempers the sense of risk.</comment>
