<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias’s motive—finding the “shape of collective grief”—is clear and organically rooted in his craft and family legacy. Embodied interiority (stone, ribbon textures, storm-sound) keeps emotions grounded while his obsession narrows his life plausibly. The spectral grandmother adds pressure without diluting single-POV integrity. The epiphany risks tidiness but is earned by the iterative retracing and night-by-night cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: recurring images (butterflies, ribbons, etched lines) accrete toward a conceptual repricing at the nexus cut. Orientation is crisp early (who/where/when), and the storm serves as the cadence break that tightens focus. Closure lands with a concrete artifact (the abstract web on slate) and a renunciation (no name/date). The cost is subtle but legible: he abandons the conventional endpoint to honor a networked grief.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The greenhouse is vividly tactile and thematically apt—decay, growth, glass panes rattling under the storm—and it charges the final image by situating the nameless slate “among the living, growing things.” Objects-as-setting (chisel, slate, ribbon roll) are filtered through his artisan’s gaze. Weather affects action and tempo. Not quite a hard constraint on options, but it consistently shapes mood and method.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early and deepens through the iterative retracing; the escalation spikes with the storm and the convergence “nexus” moment. Agency manifests as endurance and a precise, culminating cut that reconfigures meaning. The price is a chosen departure from individual memorialization toward communal abstraction. Tension is quiet but coherent, operating through density rather than reversals.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme coheres without sermonizing: grief as an interdependent network reframed through orchids, woven ribbon, and migration paths. The final object embodies the thesis instead of stating it, and the poem line is a credible family vector rather than a thesis drop. Ambiguity remains (how the town will receive it) while offering a resonant answer to the central question. Emotion is earned, not sentimental.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The lyrical third-person closely tracks a single consciousness with controlled diction and rhythm, modulating well under the storm’s pressure. No head-hopping or register drift; perceptual signature (artisan tactility, meditative cadence) is consistent. Elisions serve mood rather than obscure causality. The voice sustains “thundering calm” without purple excess.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is clean, image-dense, and purposeful; most sentences carry dual duty (atmosphere + character). Figurative language clusters at the peak but remains coherent to motif. Minimal scaffold or loops; rhythm varies and supports momentum. A few elevated turns (“thundering calm,” “spectral mentorship”) land because the piece has taught its lyric mode.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A gravestone carver seeking the topology of communal grief via an unfinished heirloom slate in a storm-battered greenhouse is a fresh synthesis. The butterfly migration as a live clock and network analogy feels inevitable in hindsight. Risks (quiet climax, abstract payoff) pay off through specific craft detail and a tangible final artifact. Not revolutionary, but distinctly executed and memorable.</comment>
