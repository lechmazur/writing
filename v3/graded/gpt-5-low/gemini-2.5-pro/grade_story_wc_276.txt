<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Kaelen’s motive (“to catch the echo”) is clear and consistently embodied through tactile choices (humming counter‑frequency, tapping the spike). The interiority lands via concrete sensation (pressure behind eyes, hollowness) rather than labels. However, conflict within him is minimal—his competence largely smooths the path, with few contradictory impulses dramatized. The final endurance reads earned but with limited visible cost beyond the brief sorrow‑antenna moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single scene, single POV, and an accumulative/textural drive that coheres through to a clear closure: the echo is caught, manifests, dissolves, and the world’s patterns settle. The cost is legible (he channels ancient grief and risks dissolution), and tactics flow from prior set‑ups (counter‑humming, spike as divining rod → voicing silence). Orientation is clean from the opening. Slight smoothness in the middle pressure prevents a higher mark.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The sound wave garden is vivid and integral—its rules are learned through action (shattering harmonies, static chasms), and it shapes navigation and risk. The rail spike functions as a micro‑setting object that constrains tactics and charges the final image. Sensory selection is purposeful across auditory, visual, and tactile registers. World logic remains consistent without expository drag.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear and pressured by an unstable environment and a live constraint (the breaking‑patterns night). Escalation tightens at the hollow of absolute quiet, forcing the “voice silence” method with emotional cost. Still, the path to success features few tests that truly imperil the goal; he adapts fluidly with limited setbacks. The price paid is felt but brief.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Loss, memory, and the paradox of giving silence a voice are woven through concrete acts rather than declared. The final image—the echo’s held‑breath form dissolving—reweights the entire quest with elegiac resonance. No sermonizing; the theme emerges organically from pursuit and method. Ambiguity lingers productively around what “catching” costs and means.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The voice is assured and distinctive—lyric without losing control—and remains stable in close third. Diction and rhythm modulate with pressure (from hum to pure inverse tone) while maintaining coherence. No head‑hopping or unmotivated stance shifts. The elevated register fits the mythic frame.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentence‑level craft is strong: varied rhythms, high information density, and purposeful metaphor tied to action. A few stacked figuratives approach purple, but they remain legible and thematically apt. No notable loops or scaffold; propulsion is maintained. The closing cadence lands cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality is high: a sound‑garden navigated by emotional transliteration, sleepwalking constellations, and “voicing silence” synthesize into a singular vision. Each strange element serves character and closure rather than ornament. Risks in concept and diction heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. The final reconfiguration feels both inevitable and fresh.</comment>
