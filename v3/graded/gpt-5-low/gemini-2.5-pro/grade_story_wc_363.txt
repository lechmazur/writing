<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—send a message at the price of her own memories—is precise, consistent, and escalates to a final renunciation. The falter “last night” versus the recommencement “this morning” shows real internal conflict resolved by action. Embodied details (the scent of his hair, the cadence of his laugh) turn memory into currency, revealing character under pressure. The ending’s earned stasis—choosing peace in emptied longing—feels paid for.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive holds: the puzzle‑map and loom’s price accrete toward the final sealing weave. Closure lands on the page with cost when the tapestry flares and she is left unable to recall why—visible payment for success. Orientation is clear early (orchard, bamboo, loom) and the single scene coheres. No causality breaks; the bead insertion and locking threads cleanly trigger the end state.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The loom, bead, and puzzle‑frame function as micro‑settings that directly constrain action and charge the final image. The orchard/bamboo enclave sustains isolation and inevitability; the loom’s “price” is a world rule learned through use. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, with objects integrated into choice. The final image is inseparable from these tools and place.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (send message vs. self‑erasure) is legible from the outset and tightens at “recommence” and the “locking threads.” The decisive act forecloses a path: she cannot remember the beloved, even as the message departs. Cost is unmistakable in the name’s void and the clean, contextless longing at the end. Quiet pressure escalates credibly under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Love, memory, and art-as-sacrifice interlock without moralizing, culminating in a resonant repricing: success equals total personal loss. Recurring images (threads, star‑map frame, bead) mature thematically into a meditation on communication’s cost. The final peace without context refuses sentimentality while deepening the premise. Subtext—craft as grief‑work—operates beneath the overt task.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A consistent, lyrical third‑person close voice with a distinct perceptual signature guides the piece. Diction and rhythm modulate under pressure (from hush to nova) without head‑hopping or register drift. Purposeful elision is clear and paid off by the closure image. No dialogue needed; internal gaze carries action.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is controlled and image‑rich with good sentence variety and momentum; key lines do more than one job. Occasional density skirts purple but remains legible and purposeful. No loops or scaffolding dull the closure; the final paragraph lands cleanly. Figurative logic is coherent (threads, map, nova) and consistently applied.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis—puzzle edges as a star‑charted loom pattern, an amber bead as heart of a message, memory unraveled into thread—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risks in lyric compression and mythic tone heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. Objects and rules are particular and non‑templated. The conceptual turn (message sent equals self‑erasure) is bold and integrated.</comment>
