<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s motives (from paid grief to witnessing and acting through “small gestures”) are specific and drive micro-choices—the stepping code, the refusal to speak, the weaponized authenticity of tears. Her contradiction (former crisis actor vs. real survivor) is dramatized rather than told. The Regent’s “benevolent ruthlessness” is credible and complicated by her flinch. The only ding is the speed of the Regent’s reversal, which skims the edge of convenience.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: sensing the prisoner → coded pacing → intensifying tapping → grief performance → U-N-B-I-N-D → key turns, door opens. Closure is decisive and on-page with cost (Elara’s risk, Regent’s cracked composure). Orientation is swift and stable; single scene tightens without detours. The whispering gallery’s acoustics and the barred window function as persistent constraints shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The Great Dome/whispering gallery, barred window, dusted floor, and obsidian chessboard are vivid and selectively used. Environment constrains choices (acoustics broadcast tremors; dust holds letters) and charges the final image (empty pawn ranks reframing the Regent’s calculus). World logic holds with minimal exposition. Tone and setting fuse to heighten pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (freeing the hidden prisoner/altering the Regent’s stance) tightens through patterned attempts and a culminating risk-laden performance. The escalation from “SECRET” to “RELEASE” to “UNBIND” constitutes a clear deepening. Cost is felt (exposure to excision; moral rupture for the Regent). Slight neatness in the Regent’s compliance keeps it shy of the top band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: performance vs. truth, governance as chess without pawns, mercy vs. control, and the ethics of witnessing. Subtext thrives in the chessboard motif and the embodied code; the final “Unbind” reframes both policy and heart. A brief overt line (“It was a command, a plea, and a prophecy…”) edges toward statement but doesn’t undercut resonance. The last image reweights the world with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice with consistent focalization; metaphors feel earned and character-filtered. Rhythm varies and tightens at pressure points; dialogue is sparse but functional. Elevated diction matches Elara’s theatrical sensibility and the Dome’s gravitas. No head-hopping or POV leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lines carry multiple jobs—image, action, and subtext—with minimal scaffolding. Figures like “click… like a breaking bone” and “luminous absence” are sharp and apt; density is high without purple drift. No loops or template cadences drag momentum. Minor flourish in one sentence of abstraction is the only small excess.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis feels fresh: a crisis actor leveraging embodied code and authentic grief against a chessboard polity in perpetual twilight. The walking-spell method is inventive and integral, not gimmicky. The “no pawns” memorial recontextualizes power with a memorable final turn. Risk-taking in tone and structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
