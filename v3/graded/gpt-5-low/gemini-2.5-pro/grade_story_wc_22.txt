<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and specific—atonement through planting—and actions align tightly with it. Interiority is textured (listening to “dead languages,” reverence with the satchel), though true contradiction or internal friction is light. The small cost (aching back, lighter satchel) supports an earned endurance stance. Lack of on‑page counterpressure or doubt keeps the arc contained rather than transformative.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: listening, selection, planting, then the charged poise of the final image. Orientation is crisp from the opening, and the beats connect coherently via the birds’ guidance. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—a garden on a gravestone—with a felt, if modest, cost. The structure is strong but the decisive change is gentle, not pressure‑driven.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The jetty, dead reef, and chemiluminescent blooms are vividly particular and filter through the coachman’s priorities. Environment constrains choices (salt, stone fissures, silt pockets) and charges the ending image. World rules are learned through action—bird calls as inherited ocean memory—without expository drag. Minor note: a few lush descriptors risk density, but clarity holds.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reclaiming the dead sea’s edge—remains coherent and grows via the birds’ instructions and the practical constraints of rock and salt. The tightening is primarily textural: selecting sites and seeds under time (twilight) and scarcity (limited soil, satchel contents). Cost is present but soft; there’s little direct opposition or reversal. Resulting cadence is compelling yet low‑temperature.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: atonement, translation, and continuity of memory (“submerged concord”) through concrete acts. The birds as “ocean’s librarians” deepen subtext without sermonizing; the final line reweights hope against loss. The garden‑on‑gravestone image offers a resonant answer, avoiding tidy moralizing. Complexity persists as an ongoing duty, not a solved problem.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A distinct, assured lyric voice with controlled metaphor and consistent psychic distance. The perceptual bias (hearing languages in calls, handling seeds as vows) reads character‑specific. Rhythm modulates well from broad tableau to tactile action. No head‑hopping or register slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentences carry high information density and purposeful rhythm; images often do double duty (worldbuilding and theme). Figurative language is mostly clean and disciplined with minimal redundancy. Minor lushness skirts purple at moments but never muddies causality or closure. Lineation supports momentum through the scene.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: a coachman who “drives” purpose, translating extinct sea languages through birds to plant a liminal garden. The “submerged concord” idea and librarianship of gulls feel inventively inevitable in hindsight. Risks are taken without gimmickry; world and action cohere. Only the gentle pressure ceiling keeps it from the very top.</comment>
