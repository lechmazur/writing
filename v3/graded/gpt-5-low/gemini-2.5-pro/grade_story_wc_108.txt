<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interiority is specific and embodied (acrophobia, claustrophobia, the cast as a gut-punch), and the contradictory impulses (fear vs. focus) play on the page. The adaptive trait informs micro-choices (spotting the maintenance phone, refusing the chase). The protagonist’s stance shifts credibly from survival to identity-claim. Minor convenience in rapid decryption is outweighed by the emotional plausibility of the turn.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: shell → hidden panel → cast cipher → code → containment, culminating in sirens and Julian’s panic. Closure is decisive (containment triggered) with a conceptual/emotional cost (renunciation of “broken puppet” role). Orientation is clean early; the single-scene pressure is coherent. Slight plausibility stretch on the failsafe access doesn’t undercut the on‑page causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The rusted library and shattered dome aren’t decorative; the constellations become the cipher key, and the height pressures behavior. The maintenance phone as a lived-in detail enables the decisive action. Atmosphere (metal bite, star-spray) aligns with the internal stakes. Object-as-setting (cast, shell) charges the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear (survival/agency vs. erasure), and escalation tightens with Julian’s arrival and the choice not to flee but to trigger containment. The refusal to engage in a fight scene forecloses an option and redefines the conflict on the protagonist’s terms. Cost is primarily internal (risk, exposure), felt in the tremor at the end. Stakes remain coherent and rise under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of vulnerability as power emerges through the child’s cast guiding the adult self and the refusal to perform the expected stunt. The seashell’s whisper → silence reweights identity and agency. One explicit thematic statement (“My motivation was no longer...”) edges toward telling, but the final image earns resonance without sermonizing. Subtext in how the environment teaches the code is effective.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>First-person voice is controlled and particular, with a stunt worker’s perceptual bias and clean focalization. Diction and rhythm modulate under pressure (from lurching fear to clipped tactical action). Sparse dialogue works as status play and breaks at the right moment. No head‑hopping or stance leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is tight, image-rich, and purposeful; sentences pull double duty (setting + psychology). Minor intensifiers (“violent, powerful certainty”) flirt with excess but don’t bog momentum. Syntax varies and carries tension cleanly through the beat. No significant loops or scaffold clutter the closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Familiar “constructed identity” trope is freshly inflected by the stuntman frame, the whispering shell, and the constellation-cipher on a child’s cast. The outwitting via an overlooked failsafe grows organically from betrayal and adaptation. The final image recasts “ghost” as agent. Risks are taken without obscuring clarity.</comment>
