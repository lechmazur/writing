<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Kaelen’s motive (“aberrant mercy”) is clear and consistent, and his actions align with it. Interiority is specific (static-tasting air, ghost-ache) and embodied. However, internal contradiction is minimal; he faces little doubt beyond a generalized burden, which softens the crucible. The Retro functions more as pressure than as a character, limiting relational complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Orientation, lens (Causal), and stakes are established early and held: tessera → activation → renaming → identity reset. Closure lands on the page with a Decisive Change and visible cost (loss of Joric; Kaelen’s “hollow ache”). Setups pay off cleanly; no causal gaps or late conveniences. The cost is more conceptual than dramatized, but still legible in the final exchange and aftermath.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The shattered-sky plaza and mosaic technology are vivid and integrated, not postcard décor. The tessera/stepping-stone interface constrains tactics and charges the ending image. Sensory detail is selectively sharp (lapis lazuli coolness, humming cracks) and filtered through purpose. World rules remain consistent and learned by observation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around the ethical and functional risk of erasing identity to end suffering, tightening as the humming intensifies and the man goes rigid. The decisive act (renaming) narrows options and carries cost. However, opposition is largely unresisted—no real chance of failure appears on the page—so escalation feels controlled rather than perilous. The stakes remain intimate and focused, fitting the length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete acts: mercy as erasure, identity as a name, lotus rebirth from ruin. The final reconfiguration (“Ren” replacing “Joric”) reframes suffering and healing with a chilling tenderness. A few explicit labels (“memory was a tyrant,” “not a healer; an editor”) nudge toward thesis-stating. Still, the ending invites reflection without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The voice balances lyric precision and calm authority, consistent with the character’s methodical compassion. Dialogue is minimal but purposeful, with tonal restraint that heightens the turn. Diction and rhythm are controlled and cohesive; no POV leakage. Elevated register fits the mythic-ruin ambiance and stays character-plausible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lines carry multiple jobs—world, action, theme—without padding; cadence varies and supports momentum. Imagery is rich but coherent, with minimal metaphor pileups. Small recurrence (“arms of steel”) functions as charged reprise rather than looped filler. No noticeable scaffolding, template cadence, or syntactic drag in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Renaming as literal identity-forge via a ruined mosaic interface in a post-fire theocracy feels fresh and integrated. The “aberrant mercy” ethic gives the trope a distinctive moral angle. While adjacent to familiar memory-wipe SF, the particulars (tessera, plaza, shattered sky) make it singular. Risk is measured but confident, landing a clean, haunting close.</comment>
