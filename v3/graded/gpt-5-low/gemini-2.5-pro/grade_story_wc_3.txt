<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s grief-driven curiosity is specific and embodied (soil under nails, reading tablets to the seed), with a credible tension between mourning and inquiry. Her translator’s mindset motivates tactics and the final shift. The renunciation—“not to get him back, but to prove their shared work”—feels earned. A touch of declarative thesising trims some messier, contradictory impulse texture.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the sequence tightens from preparation to planting to hum‑shift to luminous sprout, culminating in a clear Conceptual Repricing. The ending lands on the page with cost: she forecloses retrieval in favor of translation into a new syntax. Orientation is clean and single‑scene coherence holds. Minor reliance on stated belief over dramatized constraint keeps it shy of 9+.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The magnetic arbor is integral: field strength dictates where she plants, the hum modulates stakes, and the final filament pulses in time with it. Specific textures (blue emptiness, crystalline lattices, silver‑leafed vines) serve character and theme rather than postcard description. The environment actively charges the closure image. World rules feel consistent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake (can understanding reconfigure loss?) is signaled early and deepens via the decision to plant at the central node and the hum’s subtle shift. Pressure accrues through ritual and patience, culminating in the luminous sprout that reweights options. Costs are mostly internal and conceptual, but clear enough under the chosen lens. The absence of external antagonism is felt but not fatal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme coheres through the translation metaphor and the conservation of information reframed as grief-work, culminating in the final image’s non‑verbal “answer.” The shift from “haunted” to “illuminated” ambition resonates without moralizing. A few lines verge on explicit thesis, but the physics‑as‑language motif is largely earned through particulars. The ending invites reflection without closing ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A distinct, lyrical-scientific voice suffuses perception and remains consistent in distance and diction. POV modesty holds; assertions read as her belief rather than authorial omniscience. Rhythm modulates with pressure, especially around the planting and hum‑shift. No dialogue needed; the internal music carries.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentences carry multiple jobs with few redundancies; images are controlled and purposeful. Metaphoric density is high but coherent, avoiding mixed vehicles. A couple of elevated formulations skim the edge of purple, yet momentum and clarity persist. The final line resolves via image cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of cuneiform translation, magnetic botany, and physics-of-grief feels fresh and specific. The Knowledge Fruit as Rosetta Stone is an elegant, non‑obvious bridge that pays off in the luminous sprout. Risks in tone and concept are unified by character and setting. The turn reads inevitable in hindsight without gimmickry.</comment>
