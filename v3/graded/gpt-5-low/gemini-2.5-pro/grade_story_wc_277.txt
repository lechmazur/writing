<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Celeste’s motives are clear and character‑particular: a precise, observant daughter leveraging logic to defend her father while accepting the cost of exposing an uncle. The solemn/playful register under pressure reads earned, not performative. Interiority is embodied via tactile anchors (the hum of the dome, the rosewood nib). The only slight shortfall is limited on‑page ambivalence about harming family—the cost is implied more than felt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: the inciting call → Celeste’s tactic (proof by contradiction) → Davies’s realization (“His brother…”) → reweighted ending. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing; the lie’s orbit breaks and the father’s story is reframed. Orientation is crisp from the first lines; no lens ambiguity. The cost is present but more conceptual than dramatized, keeping this from the 9‑band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The observatory above clouds, the dome’s hum, and the telescope are vivid and integrated, with the rosewood nib functioning as micro‑setting/object that charges the final image. Details are POV‑filtered and purposeful; atmosphere and spatial grounding are clean. While the setting shapes tone and image superbly, it doesn’t materially constrain choices, so it peaks below 9.0. The final stargazing image earns its weight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around a single dominant stake and tightens through Celeste’s structured dismantling of the journalist’s premise. The reversal comes via Davies’s pivot when confronted with the contradictions. The price—risking family exposure and relinquishing the safety of silence—is legible but understated. Stakes are intellectual/emotional rather than visceral, limiting peak intensity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The orbits motif and the final image (father among stars, orbit complete) reweight earlier material without moralizing. Sacrifice, regret, and truth versus narrative emerge through action and implication, not sermon. A line or two edges toward explicit explanation (“She had found the hidden truth…”), but it doesn’t undercut the resonance. Subtext in silence/breathing on the line works well.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent with an educated, observant heiress; dialogue is goal‑driven and subtly shaded. The “proof by contradiction” cadence gives the exchange distinct texture while remaining natural. No head‑hopping or stance leakage; modulation under stress is controlled. Elevated diction fits the character and setting.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is precise, image‑rich, and largely free of scaffolding or loops; sentences carry multiple jobs with clean momentum. Metaphoric density is high but coherent and pattern‑true (celestial/orbit lexicon). No template cadences or filter‑verb stacks blunt immediacy. Minor lyric flourish occasionally borders on ornate but remains disciplined.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Marrying a high‑society observatory setting to a mathematical tactic in dialogue feels fresh and organic. The pen nib as evidence and emblem is an elegant device; the orbits motif is integrated rather than decorative. The core premise (child reframing a parent’s scandal) isn’t new, but the method and imagery elevate it. Risk is confident without gimmickry.</comment>
