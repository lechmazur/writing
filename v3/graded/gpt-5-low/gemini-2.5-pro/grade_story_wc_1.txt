<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Kaelen’s fear of fire versus need for purpose is embodied and specific, culminating in an earned decision to light the kiln. Micro-choices (rising before dawn, refusing to enter the cave, sealing the ledger) reveal a credible hierarchy of values. The interiority is vivid without therapy-speak, though the smugglers’ assumption she was a witness lands a touch quickly. Overall, the change reads as costly endurance turned into action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hybrid with an accumulative/textural dominance: image-density builds toward a reconfiguration, while a causal spine (ledger → frost cipher → cave → kiln) holds. Closure lands on-page with cost in the final firing and glass-encased ledger, foreclosing avoidance. Orientation is clean from the outset. A slight plausibility stretch in decoding smugglers via frost doesn’t break the chain.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The canyon’s cold, wind, topology, and dawn frost aren’t backdrop; they dictate method, timing, and path, and charge the final image. The kiln and glass function as micro-settings that constrain choice and cost. Sensory selection is purposeful and POV-filtered, with environmental rules consistent. The setting actively shapes tactics and resolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes are primarily internal (trauma vs. purpose) with an external pressure (smugglers’ menace) shadowing choices. Escalation tightens via the dawn routine and discovery of the cave; refusing to enter and then firing the kiln registers as a trade-off with risk. Quiet but firm pressure under the chosen lens; no soft reset.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fire and ice entwine as lived dialectic rather than stated theme; the final piece fusing blurred glyphs with etched frost achieves a resonant, non-literal answer about making meaning from survival. The canyon’s silence reweights from indifference to conversation—an earned CR/RR. No moralizing, just image-led repricing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The lyrical third-person closely held to Kaelen’s perceptions remains stable and controlled. Diction and rhythm modulate with pressure without slipping registers. No head-hopping or helpful narrator intrusions; inference reads as inference.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lines carry multiple jobs with few redundancies; imagery is fresh and coherent to glass, fire, frost, and canyon. Rhythm breathes and tightens appropriately, and the final sentence pays off motifs without purple excess. Minor lushness never muddies action or logic.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The frost-as-cipher for smuggling routes welded to a glass artist’s trauma recovery is an original synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in method (reading dawn ice) heightens stakes and meaning without obscuring clarity. The closure object transforms premise into artifact cleanly.</comment>
