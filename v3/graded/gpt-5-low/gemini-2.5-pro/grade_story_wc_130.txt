<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elian’s motive—to map grief rather than “find” Lyra—is specific and coherently dramatized through tools and ritual, not declarations. Interiority stays embodied (wet limestone, chipped tiles, weight of absence) with a credible tension between analytical control and ache. The final Earned Stasis (peace, not happiness) feels earned, though there’s little visible resistance or failure before the lattice ignites. The character’s gentleness as method reads particular and consistent.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the scene coheres: setup of goal and tools → quiet invitation → hum → lattice → fade → reweighted stance. Orientation is strong from the opening; causality is persuasive within the taught magic logic. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with cost (“the loss was not gone”), and the final action (picking up the eyes, continuing) seals it. A touch more friction prior to ignition could have deepened cost, but the on‑page turn is clear.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The cavern orchard, stalactites, and mosaic path are vivid and functionally integrated; the environment and the micro‑setting (mosaic and depressions) directly enable the tactic. The moon through a fissure and the stalactite‑fed orchard charge tone and plausibility of secrecy. The glass eyes as tool/object‑as‑setting constrain and shape the final image. Detail selection is disciplined and POV‑filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake (reconfiguring ambiguous loss) is legible early and tightens when the chosen method either will resonate or fail. The single deepening—projection of the living theorem and its “dovetail”—reweights options and produces a felt price (acceptance without relief of absence). Pressure is internal and textural rather than adversarial, consistent with the lens. Slightly more risk of failure or cost pre‑projection would heighten the squeeze.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme arises organically: the mathematics of emotion is enacted, not asserted, and the final lattice reinterprets absence/presence without moralizing. “Buried optimism” surfaces in the seedling image, reframing grief’s geometry without erasing it. The dovetailing concept bridges love, memory, and endurance with resonance beyond the scene. No platitudes; the insight feels earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The lyric third‑person close is consistent and confident, with a clear perceptual signature (material precision, gentle invocation rather than command). Diction and rhythm modulate with pressure, achieving a poised cadence at the lattice moment. No head‑hopping or stance slips. Elevated register fits the character’s sensibility and world.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sentences carry multiple jobs (world, emotion, action) with minimal scaffolding, and imagery is controlled and congruent. A few high‑lyric lines flirt with density but stay coherent and purposeful. No loops or cadence templates dulling momentum; the final line cleanly recharges earlier motifs. Copy is clean and precise.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Conjuring grief as geometry via mosaic chips and taxidermist’s eyes feels fresh and specific, not a genre default. The orchard beneath stalactites and the quiet, persuasive magic give the premise singular texture. The dovetailing of absence/presence as a living theorem is a striking turn that feels inevitable in hindsight. The risk—quiet interior climax over spectacle—pays off.</comment>
