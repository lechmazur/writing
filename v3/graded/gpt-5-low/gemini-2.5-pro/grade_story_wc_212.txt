<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and rooted in legacy and understanding, and her “furiously tranquil” stance reads character‑particular. Interiority is embodied through sensory focus (gathering scents, laughs, ozone) rather than labels. However, internal conflict is minimal; she rarely wavers or pays a felt personal price beyond concentration. The closing realization is earned but safe, with little moral or relational cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, pressure coheres from dissolution toward quieting order; the method repeats and intensifies to a clean on‑page closure (the core reopens). Orientation is crisp from the outset, and the object/action chain is coherent. The cost is light—success comes without a visible sacrifice beyond effort—so the ending’s RR lands more as serene resolution than hard‑won change. Still, the before/after is legible and decisive.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The icebound atrium and starlit frost are vivid, selective, and filtered through her role; the acorn cap functions as object‑as‑setting with agency. World rules emerge through tactile use rather than exposition. The environment charges the imagery and final poise but only lightly constrains tactics. Rich atmosphere supports theme without museum‑tour excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (save the pocket reality) is explicit and the escalation is a steady cadence shift from chaos to thrum, driven by her chosen method. There’s one meaningful tightening as the acorn draws heat and the vortex slows. The conflict remains largely unopposed internally or externally; no reversal or explicit trade‑off is forced. Cost and risk are implied rather than dramatized, which limits peak tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of stewardship and entropy transformed into communal memory is integrated through action, not sermon. The final repricing—“texture of borrowed time” as cool water over ancient stone—reweights the inheritance from possession to attunement. Ambiguity is purposeful and resonant without moralizing. Slight neatness and safety at the end prevent a higher score.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is steady, controlled, and confident; the lyric register matches the metaphysical task and never head‑hops. Diction and rhythm modulate with pressure—from storm to thrum—without wobble. The perceptual signature (seed‑keeper as entropic gardener) is distinct. No dialogue needed, and elision is minimal and purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is lush but mostly efficient; images carry multiple jobs and avoid mixed metaphors. A few lines flirt with purple (“a thunderstorm held perfectly still in a single drop of rain”) yet remain legible and apt. Momentum holds, with minimal scaffolding and no looped paraphrase. Density and clarity stay balanced through the climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—cosmic egg, pocket‑reality inheritance, entropy gardening via an oak cap—feels fresh and internally coherent. Turns arise from specific, tactile ritual rather than abstract incantation. It risks lyric quiet over spectacle and largely succeeds. Slight conventionality in the fully serene outcome trims the top tier.</comment>
