<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kael’s motive—ending the loop by “conquering the labyrinth of self”—is clear and drives his choices, with a credible final renunciation (accepting the painful memory). Interiority includes tactile specifics (ozone, gritty tablet) that anchor emotion, though some abstractions (“procedural generation,” “algorithm”) temper immediacy. We get a believable contradiction—avoidance vs. surrender—resolved through an earned shift. The cost reads as emotional integration and loss of buoyancy (the gift) at the end.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Hybrid lens with accumulative dominance: descriptive density and pattern-shift culminate in a decisive change as he accepts the seed memory and stabilizes the world. Causality tracks: the codex → seed memory → acceptance → stabilized geometry → regained gravity/self. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when on the viaduct). The on-page cost is legible in the loss of his defiance and the dissolution of echoes into him.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The glowing viaduct after rain is sensorially vivid and filtered through POV priorities; the tablet works as a recurring object that charges the final image when it goes inert. Environmental rules (shifting geometry, internal light) stay consistent and shape tactics (gaining height for perspective; homing to a coordinate). Tone and atmosphere support theme without over-signaling. The final dawn image reweights the prior sterile glow effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (escape the loop by facing the origin memory) is set early; escalation occurs as he shifts from treating the tablet as map to codex and chooses acceptance rather than avoidance. The pressure is internal but coherent, and the “seed” mechanism narrows options to one painful act. Cost is felt but quiet, not harrowing; still, it forecloses the prior coping strategy. No antagonist is needed; agency drives the turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of integration through accepting grief is earned via concrete events (the hand slipping, echoes rejoining, loss of buoyancy, dawn replacing sterile glow). The procedural‑generation metaphor for trauma is conceptually rich without didacticism. The final image offers a resonant answer—wholeness through facing the drop—without moralizing. Subtext of control vs. surrender hums beneath the codex/map reframing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Single close third voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent; diction choices feel justified by the SF‑lyric register. Rhythm varies well, with image-driven lines that avoid clutter and maintain clarity. Purposeful elision around the “seed memory” is paid off cleanly. No head‑hopping or stance drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is polished with high information density and few redundancies; images (ozone, fallen stars on parapets) feel precise. A mild register seam appears where abstract terms cluster (“algorithm,” “procedural generation”), but it suits the conceit. Momentum holds despite reflection. The last line lands cleanly on an image rather than exposition.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of roguelike procedural logic with a grief loop is fresh and thematically integrated. Closure grows from earlier particulars rather than a late rule; the tablet’s recoding is elegant. While loops and self-integration are familiar, the execution feels singular to this setting and voice. Risk sits in the conceptual metaphor, which pays off.</comment>
