<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Clear, compelling interiority: duty to “the unremembered” is in live tension with visceral claustrophobia. The panic at the collapsed corridor and refusal to squeeze through dramatize contradiction, leading to a creative pivot. Micro‑choices (pinching the gold fleck, whispering equations) reveal values under pressure. Slight safety in the outcome (no messy moral residue) keeps it shy of the very top.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: tide window → blocked corridor → phase transition → insertion of the fleck → release. Closure lands as a Decisive Change with felt cost (risk, surrender of the ghosts, his solitude). Orientation is crisp by ~120 words. A touch more on the live clock in the middle beat could have tightened pressure further.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The facility and sea frame every choice: the collapse forces phasing; the console slot and flooded floor shape tactics; cables hold the ghosts. Sensory detail is purposeful and character‑filtered (“crashing hush,” “fossilized leviathans”). The gold fleck as micro‑setting charges the final image. Strong balance across senses without tour‑guide excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible: free the trapped consciousnesses despite the tide and claustrophobia. The blocked corridor is a true tightening that forecloses a path and demands a costly adaptation (phasing through rock). Resolution is earned by his choice to complete the system and accept their absence. Stakes could press harder mid‑scene with a tangible time loss or additional risk.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Themes of remembrance, completion, and release arise from particulars: return of the fleck, the one‑second human outlines, and the final hush. The piece resists platitude; the act frees others but leaves him alone, a clean, bittersweet cost. The “return” motif coheres across action and idea. Slightly neat closure trims ambiguity that might deepen aftertaste.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>A steady close third with lyrical inflection; diction and rhythm fit the character’s mind under stress. Patterned phrases (“crashing hush”) are purposeful and paid off at the end. No head‑hopping or stance drift. Minor elevated register is consistent with the voice’s contemplative tilt.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lines do multiple jobs with strong cadence and minimal scaffold. Figurative language is vivid yet controlled; metaphors track (“heat‑shimmer distortions,” “metal artery”). No loops or muddling at peak beats; action order is clear. A few lush modifiers flirt with purple but don’t impede momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: undersea cables as soul‑relay, a medieval “illuminant” fleck closing a modern failure, and phase‑equation ghosting. The combination feels inevitable in hindsight once the console slot appears. Risk is aesthetic rather than structural, but it pays off in image and closure. Slightly conventional hero’s calm after the act keeps it from the 9‑band.</comment>
