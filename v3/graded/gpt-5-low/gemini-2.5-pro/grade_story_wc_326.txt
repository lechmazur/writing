<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—salvaging wisdom from Aris’s failure—drives concrete, tactile choices (ink work, heartbeat as metronome). Her “clerical ghost” status particularizes interiority without therapy‑speak. Internal contradiction is subtle (erasure vs. agency), not dramatized as a live clash, which limits depth under peak pressure. The closing repricing feels earned but pays a light cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Clear single‑scene accumulative drive: ritual attempts → pattern coalescence → conceptual repricing. Orientation (who/where/when) lands early, and the taught method pays off causally. Closure is on‑page (“The architecture…”) and reweights her life; the cost is largely conceptual (choosing meaning in absence), credible for this scale. Slightly soft pressure on consequence keeps it just shy of 9‑band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The opal observatory and snow‑buried hush are specific and tonally integrated; the slate, ink, and shard function as micro‑setting tools. Environment constrains tactics (manual ink mapping under the lens) and charges the final image. Sensory economy is tight and POV‑filtered. Strong, if not radically environment‑driven beyond isolation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible early (contact/defragment to glean wisdom), with a meaningful deepening when the ink finally coheres. Escalation is accumulative/textural—hours of failure then a distinct break—rather than adversarial. Price reads as stamina/attention and an existential tilt rather than a concrete loss. Earned and coherent, if quiet.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: ghostliness, broken shard, void constellations, and the final reweighting toward meaning in absence. The console line risks thesis‑clarity, but the true resonance comes from the reapplication to Elara’s “gap” life. No sermonizing; the last image is a lived adjustment of stance. Depth is strong, though ambiguity could push further.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a lucid, controlled lyric texture. Diction fits the character’s contemplative, technical focus without register drift. Rhythm modulates well between hush and the surge at recognition. No head‑hopping or unjustified elision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Clean, high‑density lines that do multiple jobs; images are precise (ink as terminal; void‑constellation chart). Figurative language is controlled and coherent; no scaffold or paraphrase loops. Cadence supports momentum without purple excess. Minor adornment under pressure but never obscuring sense.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: analog ink chaos as interface for a digital ghost; void‑chart reframing cosmology; a protagonist officially “dead” finding agency in absence. Risks are purposeful, not gimmicks, and the payoff feels inevitable in hindsight. Fresh without straining for novelty. A touch more confrontation or cost could have elevated it further.</comment>
