<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Clear, coherent motivation and a calm, precise interiority; the choice to leave the globe earns a credible endurance/renunciation. Internal conflict is present but tidy; the analytic reconciliation arrives a bit cleanly. “Mortimer” is an intriguing, under‑explained facet that hints at contradiction without fully pressuring a choice. Emotions are contained yet embodied through methodical action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: discovery → note → realization → renunciatory choice. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: “I would leave the object where it was,” with the cost legible in the relinquishment. Orientation is crisp from the opening, and the single transition to the surface is clean. The persistent constraint (the globe-as-anchor) shapes the final stance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The abyssal library is vividly, economically rendered and filtered through a professional eye. Environment and objects constrain tactics (manipulator arm, fused strongbox) and charge the ending image (leaving the globe on the seafloor). Details like swollen pages and bolted tables avoid postcard description. The setting’s rules remain consistent and integral to meaning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding/letting go) tightens as knowledge deepens; the note reweights options, culminating in the refusal to extract the globe. The cost is quiet but legible; the choice forecloses a tempting path. Escalation is more deepening than reversal, appropriate for the lens, but the on‑page pressure remains contemplative rather than acute. Still, the cadence shift at the note and the final renunciation are clear.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The themes of preservation vs. release crystallize through the globe’s charged image and the final refusal. The “physics of letting go” paragraph is elegant but somewhat thesis‑forward, risking over‑articulation. Subtext nevertheless operates strongly in the beautiful‑prison motif. The ending reframes the premise without simplistic moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Controlled first‑person with a distinct analytic-lyric texture; diction and rhythm are confident and consistent. The brief address to Mortimer adds color without breaking stance. No head‑hopping or unjustified knowledge; compression through inference is clean. The voice modulates subtly with discovery and acceptance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High information density with purposeful imagery (“pages swollen into pale, indecipherable flowers”). Minimal scaffolding and no discernible loops; syntax varies to support momentum and hush. A hair of purple in the thematic paragraph, but clarity remains intact. The final line resolves by image and breath.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: a sunken ship library, a lead‑fused strongbox, and a snow globe as a literal anchor to a pocket moment. The causal revelation via note avoids gimmickry and feels inevitable in hindsight. Risks (lyric science meditation, quiet renunciation) pay off without obscurity. The result feels singular and memorable.</comment>
