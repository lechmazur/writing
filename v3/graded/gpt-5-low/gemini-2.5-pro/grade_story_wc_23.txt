<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear, compelling motive (build a beacon to answer grief) with embodied emotion (“tears trace paths,” the censer’s hum) and coherent choices. Internal contradiction is present but subtle—purpose versus the ache of loss—without a sharp on‑page dilemma. The final acceptance (he can’t bring his daughter back) reads as an earned endurance/renunciation with felt cost. A slightly deeper clash of impulses in the rooftop moment could push this higher.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Hybrid leaning Accumulative: the midnight call cues a precise act, the placement triggers the signal, and the ending lands as Earned Stasis with cost (accepting permanent loss while building a road for others). Orientation is clean, the phone calls scaffold the build, and the final thrum reweights the frame. The causal chain is simple but tight; one decisive tightening suffices at this length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The starlit signal station, rooftop dish, and patina bronze foot create a charged micro‑setting that constrains timing (full moon) and action (placement at the array’s heart) while infusing tone. Details are selective and filtered through Elias’s purpose, avoiding touristic catalog. The environment and object decisively charge the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (can he build a beacon that offers a path home) is clear; pressure coheres through the ticking midnight call and moon‑limited opportunity. The tightening arrives with the instruction and the irreversible placement, foreclosing the fantasy of personal retrieval in favor of communal solace. Escalation is modest but real; the price is internal and legible.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of grief transmuted into service and homecoming emerges organically from images (dead wires, reverse migration, censer‑turned‑beacon) rather than stated morals. The final cadence reweights “home” without sentimentality: solace is raw and partial, yet sufficient. Ambiguity about the architect of return enriches resonance without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>A steady, lyrical third‑person closely held to Elias, with diction and rhythm matching the desolate, numinous mood. The rasping phone voice contrasts effectively without breaking register. No head‑hopping or stance slips; compression feels purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Line craft is strong: vivid yet controlled metaphors, varied syntax, and minimal scaffolding. A few high‑flown phrases (“grinding stars,” “obsidian sky”) flirt with purple but remain coherent and voice‑true. Momentum holds through to the charged final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Familiar post‑collapse grief is refreshed by the censer‑as‑frequency, midnight bakelite calls, and a lighthouse for the lost of a reverse migration. The synthesis feels specific and earned rather than ornamental. Not radically risky, but distinctly imagined and emotionally credible.</comment>
