<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation is strong and consistent—she’s dedicated to honoring overlooked histories—and her actions align tightly with that. Interiority is specific (the lens as “anchor,” the tactile “wrenching pull”), though internal contradiction is minimal; she reads as highly competent with little real doubt. Micro‑choices (following the lens’s tug, selecting the flawed seascape, committing to the unfastening) reveal priorities. The felt cost is present but modest, keeping the arc credible yet not deeply conflicted.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: the lens draws her to the tent → deliberate errors signal the keyhole → intention‑bending lens reveals the buried truth → she unfastens the lie → the canvas corrects. Orientation is crisp early and the single‑scene structure holds. Closure lands on the page with a Decisive Change (the painting transformed; history acknowledged) and a felt exertion cost. The cost is not large, but it’s legible and scaled to length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The alchemist’s market is vivid and selective—bottled starlight, caged echoes—filtered through a professional’s eye. The lighthouse lens functions as a charged tool that constrains choice and shapes the final image. World rules are learned through action (the lens bends intention), with sensory detail supporting tone without stalling. Spatial and atmospheric coherence never wavers.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (liberate a suppressed history) is clear, and pressure tightens from discovery to an active, strenuous unfastening. The protagonist’s agency drives the turn and resolution. The price is primarily psychic/energetic (the “silent, wrenching pull”), credible but not harrowing. Still, the deepening from seeing to altering reality is a meaningful escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of retrieving silenced truths through art and intention is embedded in events and images rather than moralizing. The final reconfiguration—truth acknowledged, lens lighter—offers a resonant answer about stewardship and release. A mildly explicit line about her unwavering motivation edges toward telling but doesn’t undercut the earned resonance. Subtext in the town’s complicity and the quiet absolution of the sea lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>First‑person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature (“translating essence,” “bending intention”). Diction stays within an apt, character‑specific lexicon and modulates under pressure. No dialogue, but rhythm and sentence control carry momentum. The “eternal instant” beat is well handled without cheating POV limits.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is polished and image‑dense without tipping into muddle; metaphors align with the world’s logic. Sentences do multiple jobs and avoid scaffold or paraphrase loops. Rhythm varies to suit beats, with clarity maintained in the peak action. Minor lyric lushness never obscures cause/effect.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The fusion of an alchemical market, a refractive lens of intention, and truth‑extraction via deliberate painterly errors feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The lighthouse lens as heirloom‑tool is a strong, specific choice. The central act—unfastening a lie from pigment—transforms familiar tropes of revelation. Risks in concept and diction pay off without gimmickry.</comment>
