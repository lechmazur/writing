<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elara’s motive is clear and consistent, and her micro‑choices in the rite (the sequence of knots) align with her purpose. However, she reads near‑mythic and under‑conflicted: “alarming serenity” dominates without a credible contradictory impulse on the page. The chastity/mystique frame is intriguing but never pressures her with a live cost. Strong embodiment in the dance, but the internal struggle feels pre‑solved.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds through the knots to the judge’s keystone and releases in a wave. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—hidden truths returned—though the cost is more conceptual than personal or tactical. Orientation is clean from the first paragraph. The causal scaffold (each echo → final keystone → release) is coherent and earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The silver courtyard, snow, and prism sanctuary are vivid, integrated, and filtered through Elara’s sensibility. The prism functions as a charged micro‑setting/object that anchors action and the final image. Weather and space skew toward mood rather than constraint, so the environment rarely alters tactics. Still, specificity and atmospheric control are high.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early (free the echoes to disrupt conformity) and tightens toward the judge’s knot. The escalation is primarily textural via the dance’s sequence, with the keystone providing a single meaningful intensification. Price is muted—little sense of risk or sacrifice beyond exertion and the conceptual shock delivered to the city. The resolution is earned but low‑friction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Themes of conformity, secrecy, and humane reawakening arise from concrete images (harvested echoes, the colorless wave, “whispers” over “swords”). The final image reweights prior material without a spelled‑out moral, though a few sentences edge toward thesis (“She had simply returned their own hidden truths to them”). Subtext in posture and ritual works well. The piece invites reflection more than it argues.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third‑person with a distinct perceptual signature; diction and rhythm suit the character and premise. No head‑hopping or stance slippage; compression is purposeful at the climax (“between sigh and smile”). Minor purple glints appear but don’t blur sense. The voice remains steady under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Sentences carry layered work—image, mood, and motion—with mostly clean propulsion. Some figurative density (“salvaged starlight and frozen tears”) risks ornament, but coherence and pacing hold. No significant loops or scaffolding; the climax’s phrasing is crisp. Overall polish is strong though not razor‑spare.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The fusion of courtesan, psychic echo‑harvest, and prism rite feels fresh and internally coherent. The “whisper revolution” via returned truths is a smart turn on familiar rebellion tropes. The risk profile is aesthetic rather than structural, but the synthesis reads memorable. Slight idealization of the protagonist limits the bite.</comment>
