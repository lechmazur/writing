<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation and competence are vivid and coherent, and her blindness meaningfully shapes method and choices. Interiority is mostly conveyed through tactile focus and breath control rather than thought, which suits her but limits contradictory impulses. Stakes drive clear micro‑choices (diagnose deeper fracture; patch plus reinforce) without visible moral trade‑offs. The emotional cost is implied more than felt beyond fatigue and time pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Under a Causal lens, each step flows: broken hum reveals disorder → diagnostic via basins reveals hidden fracture → targeted repair → clean hum and concentric ripples → ship departs. Closure lands as a Decisive Change with a charged final image (still water, ship’s beginning) that reweights the opening noise. Cost is primarily temporal and attentional, but it is legible through the horn‑driven countdown and her unbroken concentration. Orientation is crisp from the first lines (who/where/when) with no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The disused signal box, misted depot, and crystal basins are sensorially specific and integrated with action. Environment constrains and charges choices: fog justifies the drone’s purpose; the bowls and bench transmit vibration; horns pace time. The final image returns to the water basins, now still, charging setting with thematic resolution. Minor: the wider rail‑harbor hybrid is lightly sketched but coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (repair before departure) is clear and escalates via horn blasts and the discovery of a deeper fracture. The meaningful tightening is the hidden micro‑strut damage that forces a combined tactic (patch + reinforcement) under a live clock. Resolution is earned by her method and poise, not coincidence. The price is chiefly time and focus, credible at this length if modest in magnitude.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme coheres around translating chaos into clarity, embodied in vibration-to-knowledge and blindness-to-perception. The water/ripple motif shifts from dissonant ripples to concentric calm, offering a non‑literal answer without moralizing. One line states motive outright (“to decode feedback into direction”), slightly on‑the‑nose but supported by scene work. The ending’s quiet resonance lingers without closing off ambiguity about cost or future stakes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The third‑person close voice is steady, precise, and texturally aligned with Elara’s tactile perception. Rhythmic modulation matches pressure (from dissonant thrum to settled tone) with no head‑hopping. Diction remains controlled and consistent, carrying lyricism without drift. Sparse dialogue fits the scene and avoids exposition crutches.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is clean, economical, and image‑rich; most sentences do multiple jobs (world, action, mood). Figurative choices (jewel waiting for fire; concentric ripples) are apt and not over‑stacked. Minor tendencies toward elevated phrasing are balanced by concrete mechanics, preserving clarity and momentum. No scaffold loops or cadence templates dull the peak beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The crystal‑basin refraction method translating light into touch is an inventive, character‑true innovation. The hummingbird drone as a ship’s fog‑eyes, paired with a blind artisan’s tactile diagnostics, yields a fresh synthesis. The final still‑water image recasts the whole in memorable terms. Risks are purposeful and land without obscuring clarity.</comment>
