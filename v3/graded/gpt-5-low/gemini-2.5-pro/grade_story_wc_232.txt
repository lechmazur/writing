<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elias’s grief‑driven, empirically intuitive nature is dramatized through concrete tactics (sugar trails, maps) and a credible renunciation at the end. Interiority is specific and embodied (the “patience of a glacier,” the chip warming in his palm). The final refusal forecloses a fantasy of alternate lives with a felt cost. Slight neatness in the epiphany keeps it just shy of the top band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Clear Causal lens: ants → fissure → cavern → chip activation → doorway → renunciation. Orientation is strong early and the closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing with cost (choosing understanding over entry). Setups (chip, timing window, promise) pay off cleanly. The chip’s interface is a touch convenient but pre‑seeded.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The blooming cavern, glowing fungi, and archway aren’t postcard detail; they shape access and charge the final image. The chip-as-tool and archway-as-threshold directly constrain the choice. Sensory specificity is vivid and filtered through a map dealer’s priorities. Environmental logic is consistent and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (fulfilling Elara’s promise/what to do at the doorway) tightens as the creek rises and the archway manifests. The key deepening is the vision of alternate lives, which forces a tradeoff and a refusal with cost. Pressure remains coherent without an antagonist. Stakes are felt more internally than physically, but the price is legible.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Themes of grief, choice, and acceptance emerge from particulars (ants’ paths, foundry chip, mirror‑doorway) and culminate in a resonant refusal. The multiverse imagery reweights the lived path without sermonizing. One line (“wasn't an exit, but a mirror reflecting the validity…”) edges toward explicitness, slightly dulling subtext. The aftereffect is nonetheless strong and earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a distinct, textured voice tied to Elias’s sensibility; diction and rhythm modulate well. No dialogue to test, but narrative confidence and perspective remain steady. Purposeful lyricism stays within the character’s plausible lexicon. Control holds under pressure at the doorway beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lines are clean, economical, and often do multiple jobs; imagery is vivid without bloat. Minor familiar turns (“patience of a glacier,” “hungry roar”) appear but don’t stall momentum. Syntax varies and supports cadence. No loops or artifacts that blur causality or the closing image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Following ants to a multiversal threshold via a type foundry chip is an original synthesis; the refusal reorients the trope away from spectacle to earned comprehension. Specifics (map dealer, foundry matrix chip, midsummer bloom) personalize the concept. The move feels inevitable in hindsight. A hair familiar multiverse mirror idea is revitalized by the particulars.</comment>
