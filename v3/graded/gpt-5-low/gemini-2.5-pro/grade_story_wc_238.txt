<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Julian’s motive (an overdue apology before the orchard’s destruction) is clear and embodied, with credible sensory overwhelm during the ritual. His contradiction—wanting reconnection but accepting imperfect closure—lands without sentimentality. Madame Vex’s presence applies pressure and her status dynamic is legible. Minor limitation: Julian’s flaw set is narrow; we glimpse guilt more than a textured pattern of self-sabotage.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: Vex’s device activates → sensory deluge → apology → reconfiguration into acceptance as dawn and demolition loom. Orientation is immediate, single scene, live clock, and the closure carries cost on the page. The Earned Stasis/Resonant Reconfiguration lands via “phantom limb” and the diesel engine cue. No dropped setups; stakes and outcome are proportionate to the length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The archive is tactile and charged—dust, iron gall ink, decaying paper—and the micro-setting directly affects method (clips on staves, oscillator hum). The lilac perfume and ozone fold into the environment to shape action and final image. The impending chainsaws and windows’ light modulate atmosphere and pressure. Specificity serves both mood and mechanics without excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is focused and escalates with the device’s activation into a visceral, high-cost beat that narrows options to endurance and apology. The deluge forces a trade: relinquish ideal reconnection in favor of acceptance. Pressure coheres from external clock to internal flood. Slightly limited by the absence of a second tightening turn beyond the main surge.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Themes of grief, memory, and “imperfect miracle” surface through concrete events (scent release, score shimmer) and a charged final image rather than moralizing. Vex’s metaphors align with the arc and reweight the premise at the end. The resonance lingers in the cost of acceptance versus desire. A touch of aphoristic neatness keeps it shy of top tier.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is controlled and sensuous without drift; Julian’s perceptions are selective under stress, and Vex’s dialogue has distinct idiom (“gravel wrapped in silk”). Rhythm tightens during the peak and relaxes cleanly at the end. No head-hopping or stance slips; elision is purposeful. The diction stays coherent with the piece’s hybrid of the technical and the uncanny.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line-level craft is precise, vivid, and economical; images do multiple jobs (scent as portal, score as conduit). Metaphor density is high but coherent and not redundant; rhythm and syntax vary with pressure. Minimal scaffold or loops; copy is clean. A few aphoristic lines risk polish over rawness but don’t impede momentum or clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis feels fresh: a gossip-column exorcist using induced currents and a perfume bottle wired to iron gall ink in a sheet music archive. The procedural-meets-lyric method grounds the supernatural without cliché, and the ending’s acceptance is non-obvious yet inevitable. Risks in tone and device pay off cleanly. Distinctive without gimmickry.</comment>
