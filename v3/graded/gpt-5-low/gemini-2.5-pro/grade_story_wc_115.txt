<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Motivation is specific and sustained: he seeks a place heavy enough to reframe his secret, and his recklessness and skepticism shape micro-choices. Interiority is embodied (“porous and strange,” the beaded condensation, the cold dread), with a credible contradiction between rational scoffing and compelled engagement. The final choice—treating the haunting as a solvable problem and turning the valve—earns an endurance/renunciation of passivity with palpable cost. No false tidy absolution: he still carries the weight, now measured.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Orientation is clean early (abandoned tunnel, radio psychic, confession), and the causal chain is tight: sound → approach → interpret pressure → identify the valve → act. Closure lands on the page with cost: turning the wheel alters the environment and reconfigures his internal stance. The causal lens holds throughout, with the radio calls functioning as a motivated interpretive device rather than a convenience. No unkept setups or teleports; the payoff is earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purpose-driven—rust, stagnant water, weeping walls, and the beaded valve wheel all feed tactic and mood. The environment constrains options (darkness, water, machinery) and the object-as-setting (valve wheel) decisively charges the final action and image. Sensory detail is selective and integrated, balancing sound, smell, and touch in a crisis-appropriate way. World rules stay consistent without exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Pressure coheres and tightens when the unseen “shift” focuses blame on him, narrowing choices to intervention. The external stakes (haunting machinery crisis) and internal stakes (paralyzed guilt) interlock at the valve. The price—physical strain and acceptance of ongoing burden—is legible and scaled to the length. Escalation is clean and protagonist-driven; no coincidence resolves the problem.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Themes of culpability, inaction, and labor’s psychic residue emerge through concrete particulars (factory ghost shift, radio confessions) rather than moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: by closing the valve for the dead, he calibrates how to carry his own truth—without claiming erasure. The radio callers’ echoes operate as subtext rather than thesis. Ambiguity remains purposeful and humane.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The voice is controlled, textured, and character-specific, with elevated diction anchored in embodied perception. POV is stable and time-place focalization is clear; the radio voices introduce no head-hopping. Rhythm modulates with pressure, and the psychic distance tightens appropriately at the climax. Dialogue via radio feels natural and purposeful, advancing subtext and plot.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong: high information density with minimal scaffold and clean sequencing. Occasional lushness (“damp, devouring dark”) remains purposeful and does not blur action. Sentence rhythm varies and supports momentum; no paraphrase loops or template cadences. Final image is crisp and uncluttered, sustaining charge without over-explanation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The radio-psychic interpretive method atop a “factory ghost shift” haunting is a fresh synthesis, not a stock trope. The beaded valve and industrial atmosphere are particular and tactically necessary, not ornamental. The turn—solving the haunting as a mechanical problem intertwined with moral weight—feels inevitable in hindsight. Risks in tone and concept cohere without gimmickry.</comment>
