<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s motives are clear and embodied: an artist who reads the coast and acts under pressure, shifting from panic to purposeful labor. Her competence is earned by prior habits (“perpetually learning,” grandfather’s projector) and her micro-choices remain tactile. Internal contradiction is light—she hesitates only for a heartbeat—so we don’t see deep cross-pressures, but the clarity fits the length. The final repricing of her vocation feels earned by action rather than declared alone.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal links are strong: discovery → projection → deciphered covenant → actionable diagram → defensive build → wave mitigated → repriced understanding. Orientation is swift and clean, and the single-scene window sustains pressure to a concrete outcome with cost (soaked, exertion, risk). Closure lands as Decisive Change plus Conceptual Repricing without breaking rules. The lantern’s timely instruction skirts convenience but is foreshadowed and integrated enough to avoid a deus ex feel.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The archway and storm are not backdrop; they dictate options and supply the very materials of the solution. Sensory texture is vivid and POV-filtered (“turbine-hum reverie,” slick wall, water to the thigh), and weather meaningfully alters tactics. The projector and slide function as micro-setting objects that charge the final image. Spatial and environmental logic remains coherent through the strike and recession.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>One dominant stake (survive/protect the archway) escalates from hum to imminent obliteration with a decisive narrowing of options. The lantern’s last layer forces a trade: time and effort under a live clock to shape the bulwark, paying physical cost and risking failure. Agency drives the outcome; coincidence complicates but does not resolve. The wave’s division provides a crisp, earned payoff.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Themes of covenant, humility before systems, and “scaffolding complexity with simplicity” arise through actions and the lantern’s layered language. The final image reweights prior material (wood as letters), offering a resonant answer. Slight moralizing creeps in with “The world was not broken,” which states what the scene already shows, softening the subtlety. Nevertheless, the emergent meaning holds.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The lyrical third-person close adheres to Elara’s perceptual signature, with consistent diction and controlled modulation under stress. No dialogue is needed; the voice carries pressure and wonder without head-hopping. Elevated metaphors feel earned by the sensibility on display. Rhythm tightens at the peak and breathes in the denouement.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Line-by-line, the prose is dense yet purposeful, with varied syntax and strong verbs. A few stacked metaphors approach saturation, but most serve sense and momentum rather than purple flourish. Clarity never falters in the action sequence, and there’s no scaffold or synonym churn. The final lines land with a clean, recharged image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—a post-GPS world, a driftwood sculptor decoding a magic-lantern covenant to engineer with a storm—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The object’s layered meanings transform tropey “ancient secret” into a living accord that shapes tactics. Risks in concept and diction mostly pay off without obscuring clarity. The result is memorable and distinct.</comment>
