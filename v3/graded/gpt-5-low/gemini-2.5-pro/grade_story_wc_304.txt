<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Motivation is crystal clear and consistent: she exists to preserve a last spark. Interiority is vivid but largely one-note—calm competence with minimal contradictory impulses or genuine struggle. The micro‑choices (selecting the memory, channeling it) align with her role but never test her limits. The endurance cost is more conceptual than personal, keeping the arc strong but not piercing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Single, coherent scene under an accumulative/textural lens; orientation is quick and clean. Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration: the soul is gone, but a charged fragment remains, explicitly altering the world of the grotto. The cost is legible in the vanishing outline and the aurora’s tonal shift. Causality is straightforward—find note → infuse → enshrine—without slack or contradiction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The aurora and grotto are not mere backdrop; the aurora is the resource that enables the extraction, and the niche‑lined alcove charges the ending. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through her professional lens (obsidian slab, instruments, locket). World rules are taught by use, not exposition. The final image is concretely housed in place, deepening mood and meaning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve a spark before dissolution) is clear and time‑pressured by the soul’s fray. Tension tightens when she isolates the single “true note” and must commit to the infuse. However, pressure remains largely unopposed and success is smooth, with no reversal or exigent trade‑off on the page. The cost lands conceptually rather than through a tested risk.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Themes of memorialization, art as last rite, and the ethics of preservation vs. oblivion emerge through action and image. The ending reweights prior material—her craft’s purpose crystallizes in the locketed “tiny, captured sun.” No moralizing; resonance arrives via particularized ritual. Ambiguity remains productive (fragment saved vs. whole lost).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A controlled, luminous third‑person close sustains a consistent perceptual signature. Diction and cadence match the character’s vocation and the scene’s severity. No head‑hopping or stance drift; elisions are purposeful and legible. Lyric elevation feels earned, not performative.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The prose is polished, rhythmic, and largely economical, with lines doing double duty for mood and function. A few lush phrases flirt with purple (“ghost-scent of forgotten memories”) but do not obscure clarity or momentum. Sentence variety and paragraph rhythm support the scene’s steady pressure. The final line resolves cleanly by image without scaffolding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The “beautician mortician” of souls amid auroral static is a fresh, integrated synthesis. The craft’s mechanics (pattern‑finding, infusion into an emerald, locket ritual) feel specific and inevitable in hindsight. While the arc is quiet, the conceptual frame is distinctive and confidently executed. Risk lies in the solemn lyric mode, which the piece sustains without blur.</comment>
