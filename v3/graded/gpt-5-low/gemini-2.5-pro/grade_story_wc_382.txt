<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clara’s desire to “become fluent” in a building’s language is specific, embodied through touch and listening, and drives her choice to confront Elias. The internal tension—comfort in the “agreed upon lies” versus the need for truth—surfaces credibly in the rooftop invitation and question. Elias’s tutelage and gift meaningfully shape her evolution without overexplaining her motives. The final acceptance of custodianship carries a felt cost: relinquishing their sanctuary of denial.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: details and lessons accrete until the rooftop confrontation reweights everything. Orientation is clean; the sugar-to-tea-to-seal chain motivates the shift from denial to interrogation. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing with cost when she presses the seal and assumes stewardship. No causality breaks; one tight turn (note → rooftop → reveal) is sufficient at this length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The Althea is vividly rendered through tactile and auditory cues that reflect Clara’s professional obsession. The desk seal functions as a charged object-as-setting, culminating in the soil impression that anchors closure. The rooftop garden and meteors are not postcards; open sky thematically pressures truth-telling. Detail selection is economical and POV-filtered (dust and lavender; cold teacups) and shapes the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth versus the comfort of denial—is signaled early and tightened when Clara changes venue to force the conversation. The interrogation is an agentive move, and the cost is clear: ending the protective fiction and taking on duty. Escalation is quiet but coherent under the accumulative lens. The lack of external jeopardy limits ceiling but does not blunt pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Themes of memory, imprint, and consented fiction arise organically from objects and gestures (palming wallpaper, the seal’s spiral, cold teacups). Subtext in their “agreed upon lies” sustains until the rooftop breaks it. Elias’s key/lock explanation toes close to explicit statement but is reabsorbed by the final, reweighted image. The ending offers a resonant answer: stewardship over spectral romance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent with Clara’s sensibility; diction remains character-apt. Dialogue is spare, subtext-laden, and advances pressure (“It is a key... and I am the lock”). Rhythm modulates well, expanding for image and tightening at the reveal. No head-hopping or stance slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lines carry dual duty—image and meaning—without padding; metaphors (galaxy spiral, building “sigh”) stay coherent. Figurative density is high but purposeful, with little redundancy. Syntax varies, and paragraphs earn their space. Minor lushness in places never obscures cause or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>“Human archive” of a building and the seal as key/lock marry familiar ghost tropes to a fresh custodial ethic. The sugar-to-tea social bridge turned ritualized denial is an elegant, specific twist. The rooftop Perseids as teaching board for truth is apt and earned. Not radically new, but executed with distinctive texture and inevitability.</comment>
