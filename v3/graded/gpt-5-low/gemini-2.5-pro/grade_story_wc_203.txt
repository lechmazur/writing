<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Leo’s motive—“to discover what ceilings hide”—is clear and consistently embodied in his choices, especially at the engage/refuse fulcrum. Interiority is concrete (dust patterns, bodily chill, steady heart) without therapy‑speak. The internal tension is modest but present (leave vs. engage), and the final act credibly aligns with his established trait of observant curiosity. The cost is quiet rather than piercing, but appropriate for the piece’s scale.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: power dies → ghost appears → Leo reads the ceiling → retrieves the barrel → ghost resolves. Closure is on the page via the ghost’s release and Leo’s “repair” of the veil, landing as an earned stasis/decisive change hybrid for this scale. Orientation is anchored early and never slips. The cost is subtle (risk, exposure, time), but the engage/leave hinge puts a real before/after into focus.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The abandoned circus ticket office is vividly tactile and purpose‑driven (peeling clowns, drop ceiling, grimy linoleum, ladder, trapped air). The environment constrains choice (ceiling tile + ladder) and charges the final image (brass cylinder in beam). Sensory balance (sound dying, smell of popcorn/rot, dust texture) supports tone and action. Setting integrates with theme (cracks in the façade) without feeling forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Pressure coheres and tightens after the power cut, with a clear choice that alters outcomes. The primary stake is whether Leo engages and risks stepping into the liminal pressure to resolve the tethered spirit. Escalation is quiet but real, culminating in the ladder ascent and reach into the ceiling. The on‑page price remains understated, keeping the ceiling of intensity just short of the top band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>“Cracks in the façade” and the ceiling motif mature into the final image—he “repaired a crack in the veil”—for a resonant, non‑didactic thematic glide. The carousel timepiece and mainspring refract ideas of incomplete tasks and quiet repair of unseen systems. One slightly declarative early line (“the core concept that governed his world”) edges toward on‑the‑nose. Still, the ending earns contemplation without sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The close third maintains a consistent, character‑specific perceptual bias (systems, dust patterns, hum/silence), with lyric control that never blurs POV. Diction fits the mind of a methodical technician tuned to liminal phenomena. Rhythm flexes appropriately at the engage moment and the final, charged stillness. No head‑hopping or stance drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is tight: vivid nouns and precise verbs carry multiple jobs without bloat. Figurative language (“smell of trapped time,” “weightless burden”) is controlled and supports theme. No scaffold loops or template cadences bog momentum. The final sentence cleanly recharges prior motifs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The blend of elevator tech realism with ghost‑work, dust forensics, and a circensic horology thread feels fresh and coherent. The mainspring barrel as a tethering key and the ceiling‑reading method distinguish this from standard ghost vignettes. It’s not radical, but the synthesis is quietly inventive and emotionally true. Risks are measured and land cleanly.</comment>
