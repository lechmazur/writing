<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Li Wei’s motivations and contradictions are particular and embodied: duty to the city versus the ache of “when,” the courier’s knock versus the pull of the ice’s “first, true note.” Micro‑choices (pressing harder with the brush, stepping onto the balcony, letting the courier wait) reveal values. The shift from writing to “conducting” is earned by long‑seeded traits. The cost is subtle (renouncing immediate obligation and identity) but present.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: images and pressures (glass hum, ice groan, intercom) densify toward a Charged Poise closure. Orientation is clear quickly (who/where/when) and the single scene coheres. Closure lands with a stance crystallization—he stops writing to shape the air—though the cost, while felt, remains quiet. No causality breaks or unkept setups.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and functional: the glass spire’s acoustics, the frozen lake’s “cracked mirror,” and the cold balcony shape perception and choice. Environmental music (ice groan) literally charges the final image. The nautilus functions as micro‑setting/tool that refracts time and light into a decisive beat. Sensory detail is selective and POV‑driven.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—continue as oracle or embrace a riskier authorship—tightens through the mirrored horizon, the shell’s fracture aligning with light, and the impatient courier. Escalation is a cadence shift rather than reversals; the pressure coheres into a refusal (Courier waits; he conducts). The price is mostly vocational and interior, not extreme but legible.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: silence as charged potential, holding versus hearing, homesickness as time. The nautilus and mirrored horizon reweight at the end without moralizing; “The silence is not empty” risks on‑the‑nose, but is grounded by image and paid off by action. The final poise offers a resonant, non‑literal answer: creation over transcription.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice with clean focalization and no head‑hopping. Rhythm modulates with pressure; quotes are sparse and purposeful. Diction and imagery feel character‑specific (kerosene, baijiu, sewing machine) and do not overreach. Elision is taught early and remains legible through closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density and strong image economy; metaphors are coherent (music/silence/water/spiral) and not muddled. Minimal scaffold or loops; sentences propel rather than stall. A few heightened lines flirt with overstatement but stay anchored to concrete action. The final cadence is clean and unencumbered.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—an oracle‑scribe in a glass spire choosing to “conduct” a dawn‑splitting lake—is fresh and cohesive. Familiar motifs (shell to ear, drowned village) are transformed through specific use and reweighting. The ending feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk is lyric and formal rather than structural, and it pays off.</comment>
