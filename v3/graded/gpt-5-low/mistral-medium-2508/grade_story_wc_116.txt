<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear motive—“to witness change without judgment”—is embodied through concrete micro-choices (pressing the swan, entering the refuge, not reading). The Earned Stasis of self‑erasure is credible and carries cost (“their edges blurring”). Internal contradiction is muted (acceptance over conflict), but the renunciation of name and personhood credibly forecloses alternatives. Interiority is particular and embodied rather than labeled.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: entry into the obsidian refuge, the paper birds’ dissolution, and the return to folding form a clear cadence that culminates in Earned Stasis. Closure lands with cost on the page (identity thinning, buried name) and reweights prior material (“The waiting was the point. The silence was the answer.”). Orientation is clean and early; pattern is taught and kept. One meaningful deepening occurs in the flock dissolving into the walls.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and integral: overgrown library, underground river, and obsidian monolith constrain access and ritual. The origami swan as tool-object and the refuge charge the final image and govern tactics. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (moss-swallowed books, breathing river). World rules (time pooling) are consistent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Pressure coheres as a deepening rather than a contest: the keeper’s endurance is tested by the refuge’s temporal/ontological pull. Stakes tighten at the flock dissolution and the rising river, which reconfigure costs and options while preserving the central renunciation. The final posture forecloses a different life with felt price. Escalation is quiet but legible under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: witnessing without judgment, the cost of endurance, and regenerative silence as both womb and solvent. Recurring images (swan, seam, river) shift meaning at the end, offering a resonant, non‑literal answer. No moralizing; the final stance reweights the premise with conceptual and emotional charge. Ambiguity is purposeful without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct lyric voice with controlled rhythm and image selection; POV is steady and plausibly bounded. Patterned diction is taught early and sustained through closure. No dialogue to test, but narrative certainty matches what the focalizer can infer. Minor repetition is aesthetic rather than scaffolding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong: high information density, purposeful metaphors, and clean syntax. A few lush phrases flirt with purple but remain coherent and serve scene pressure. Rhythm modulates well between hush and intensification. No meaningful loops or scaffolding that dull momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Obsidian refuge + origami seam + “regenerative silence” is an inventive synthesis that feels inevitable by the end. Risks (lyric quietude, minimal overt plot) heighten stakes through conceptual cost rather than spectacle. Images and rules are specific and non-generic; the final reconfiguration honors groundwork. Fresh, confident execution without gimmickry.</comment>
