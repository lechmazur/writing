<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation is vivid and character-specific—he collects “textures” instead of truth—and his micro-choices (listening, transcribing, beginning a new tree) align. The interiority is embodied through tactile actions (ear to glass, pen nib scraping). Internal contradiction is light; the cost is mostly implied (isolation, renunciation of the town’s waking world). Earned Stasis at the end reads credible if quiet.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the altered lamp hum intensifies the pattern and culminates in a charged recommitment. Orientation is clear early and maintained through a single night-to-dawn arc. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis image—the world can wait, he chooses the dead’s textures—with a felt though subtle price. Causality is soft but coherent for the mode.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Setting is lush and purposeful: bonsai under glass, the mountaintop silence, and the lamp’s hum integrate with action and charge the final glow. Sensory detail is selective and profession-filtered. The environment subtly pressures attention and process rather than dictating tactics outright. Final image is meaningfully charged by place and objects.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—catching and rendering time’s textures—tightens with the “different” hum leading to Elara’s name and a night-long transcription. The deepening is clear, if understated, and culminates in renewed commitment over daily life. The price and narrowing of options are present but muted; no hard reversal, but pressure coheres under the accumulative lens. Tension is chiefly tonal and internal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Themes of invention vs remembrance and the ethics of listening emerge organically via particulars (bonsai monuments, Elara, the hum). The ending reweights the premise with Elara’s laughter and his refusal to look up, avoiding tidy moralizing. A couple of direct thematic claims (“The past was never really gone…”) flirt with didacticism but don’t overwhelm subtext. Emotional afterimage lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, controlled, and consonant with the character’s meticulous sensibility; diction and rhythm modulate with pressure without head-hopping. Patterned lyricism is taught early and sustained. The perceptual signature—textural noticing, time as material—feels specific. No dialogue needed for effect.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Line-level craft is elegant with high information density and purposeful imagery; the metaphors cohere to time, texture, and craft. A sustained lyric register risks lushness but avoids muddle, and repetitions feel motif-driven rather than looped scaffold. Syntax varies and cadence supports the accumulative build. Minimal excess or redundancy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—bonsai mausoleum, lamp-hum frequencies birthing invented lives, a stationer as archivist of textures—feels fresh. Turns arise from established patterns rather than late rule changes. The risk is quiet rather than flashy, but the conceptual integrity is strong. Only the soft cost keeps it from a higher band.</comment>
