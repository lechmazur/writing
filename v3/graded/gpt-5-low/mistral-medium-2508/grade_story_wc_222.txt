<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lirien’s motive is crisp—recover her master’s legacy by amending time’s calculus—and her choices align, from playful sacrilege at the chessboard to the disciplined refusal to flee. The Keeper functions as a credible counter‑pressure with a legible wound (the name in tear‑ink). Interiority is image‑driven yet character‑specific; however, contradiction is light—she rarely falters or doubts. The change at the end reads earned but the emotional price is subtle rather than deeply felt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Hybrid lens (accumulative texture over a clean causal spine) holds: the theft attempt → confrontation → exchange → descent → reweighted sky. Closure lands on the page via a resonant reconfiguration as the sky begins to mend, keyed to her successful swap and the Keeper’s acceptance. Orientation is clear early; set‑ups (the twin lid, the knight/rook switch) pay off cleanly. Cost is present but understated, more conceptual/emotional than materially exacted.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The ice spire and wrong sky are sensorially vivid and rule‑consistent, and they constrain choice (arduous climb, easier descent once the exchange reweights the place). Recurring objects—sundial lid, chessboard—function as micro‑settings that guide tactics and charge the final image. The environment participates in closure (the spire sings; the sky reconfigures), not just decorates it. Detail selection stays filtered through Lirien’s thief‑craft and wonder ethos.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (retrieve/restore the lid to amend a broken sky/time) is signaled and tightened by the Keeper’s emergence and the name reveal. The reversal/tightening arrives when he lifts the piece and chooses to hand over the lid. Tension is elegant but gentle; danger feels abstracted, and consequences for failure are more implied than pressed. The on‑page price is modest, keeping escalation strong but not searing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme coheres around time as debt vs. wonder as amendment, delivered through particular acts (tear‑ink name, whalebone twin, the amended sky). Subtext in the chess swap and the Keeper’s shaken stillness carries more weight than any declared thesis. The final image reweights prior motifs without moralizing. A slightly soft cost keeps it just shy of the very top band.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice with precise rhythms; diction stays within the piece’s surreal register while remaining legible. Dialogue is lean, goal‑driven, and subtextual, reflecting status and shifting power. POV remains stable and confident; no head‑hopping or unearned omniscience. Compression is purposeful and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The prose carries high information density with minimal scaffolding; images do double duty (violet sun, breath not quite smoke). Figurative language is lush but largely coherent and scene‑advancing; rhythm varies to match pressure. No paraphrase loops or cadence templates dull momentum. A few stacked metaphors brush the edge of purple but do not obscure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—tear‑ink names, whalebone twin, saint‑bone chess, a wrong sky mending through an ethic of amendment—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The method of the swap and the ethical reframing of theft as repair transform familiar tropes. Risks in tone and imagery heighten stakes without sacrificing legibility. The result reads as singular rather than stitched from templates.</comment>
