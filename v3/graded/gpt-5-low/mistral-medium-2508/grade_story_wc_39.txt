<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias’s motives (hoarding/repairing the past vs. sharing it) are clear and embodied; his micro‑choices with the jar and the music box reveal a credible hierarchy of values. The girl’s arrival tests him, and his pivot to “keeper of the in‑between” reads earned rather than declared. Emotional textures are specific (the chill, the rusted key, the ache at the dunes’ song). Slight tidiness remains—the resistance to change is brief and the win feels gentle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: environmental music, jars, and the girl’s request accrue to a closure of Resonant Reconfiguration with a felt cost (letting go of ownership/hoarding). Orientation is crisp from the outset; the knock provides the single tightening needed. The closure is on‑page (she winds the box; he reframes his role, sets the melody playing as the sun climbs). Very minor convenience in timing (the visitor) but it doesn’t break the chain.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful—the feral loft, dunes, brine, and sagging balcony feed action (capturing the dunes’ song) and charge the ending image. Objects-as-setting (music box, jars) anchor space and meaning and recur with growing weight. Weather/time and place shape sensory palette and tactics. Strong integration without show‑tour excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (redemption through connection vs. solipsistic collecting) tightens when the girl asks him to “make the past talk.” He risks relinquishing control by giving her the jar and inviting her to wind the box; the price is accepting imperfection and non‑ownership. Escalation is gentle but coherent under the accumulative lens. No major reversal beyond the visitor, but the single deepening suffices at this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motifs (jars, dunes, music box) braid into a thematic answer: redemption via sharing and intergenerational translation. Subtext is often strong (her laugh at the wobbly note), but the piece occasionally states its thesis too directly (“redemption wasn’t in holding tight but in letting go”), trimming resonance. Still, the final image reweights earlier material without tidy moral balancing. Emotional aftereffect is honest and earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lyrical third‑person close holds steady with a distinct perceptual signature (sound‑centric noticing, tactile decay). Dialogue is sparse but age‑true and functional. Rhythm modulates well between quiet observation and the doorway beat. No head‑hopping or stance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is polished and sensory‑dense with generally disciplined figurative choices; most lines do double duty (world + psyche). Minor purple edging and a couple near‑redundancies (“as if the walls had exhaled”) don’t drag momentum. Syntax varies and carries the cadence shifts cleanly. Final lines land by image rather than explanation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>“Bottling sounds” as craft is an original, grounded conceit; the vagrant poet frame is familiar but freshly rendered through tactile specifics and a non‑obvious revaluation. The turn from collecting to sharing feels inevitable in hindsight. Risks are aesthetic rather than structural and mostly pay off. The piece coheres as a singular stance rather than a stitched prompt response.</comment>
