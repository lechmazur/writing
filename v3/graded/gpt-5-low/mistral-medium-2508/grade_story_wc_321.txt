<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira’s competence, humor, and calm under pressure are vividly embodied (rope work, hourglass handling, “Course is relative”), and her micro-choices drive the scene. Motivation is clear—align and preserve the ferry and its passengers. However, internal contradiction is minimal; she never wavers, so complexity is limited. The ghosts offer a relational accent but don’t deepen her conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural with coherent causal threads: the collapsing route (radio’s five-minute clock) forces Lira to merge timelines via the hourglass and pattern alignment. Closure lands on-page with the starlight “snap,” stabilized sky, ghosts solidifying, and the hourglass now full with rising “sand.” Cost is more conceptual than visceral but seeded (“years feeding it moments”) and paid by foreclosing paths as the grotto seals. Single continuous scene maintains orientation and momentum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The spectral grotto under pulsing starlight is specific and dynamically used: patterns literally govern navigation, the ceiling’s constellations teach the operating rules, and the grotto’s collapse pressures timing. The hourglass functions as micro‑setting/tool that charges the final image (rising sand). Detail is selective and POV‑filtered, never mere postcard. World rules stay consistent and are learned in action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear (prevent unraveling, deliver passengers to a stable lane), with a meaningful tightening via the five‑minute collapse. Lira’s choice to “merge the lanes” forecloses simpler options and risks total unraveling; the beat where patterns “snap” provides the escalation’s crest. The cost is felt more as conceptual reweighting than loss, slightly softening impact. Still, pressure coheres and rises under the chosen lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transience versus permanence threads through the hourglass, shifting constellations, and the ghosts’ dual memories; the rising sand reweights the premise at the end. Subtext is earned through images and choices, not summary. One line leans close to thesis‑articulation (“some things…weren’t meant to be permanent”), but it fits voice and doesn’t undercut resonance. The closing “next stop…the one after this one” cleanly embodies the thematic stance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A confident, lyrical third‑limited voice with clean modulation under pressure; dialogue sounds natural and advances stakes (radio as pressure, Lira’s quips as stance). Diction is consistent with character and world; metaphors are apt and pattern‑taught. No head‑hopping or stance leakage. Rhythm supports the climax’s cadence shift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sentence‑level control is strong: images do multiple jobs, and momentum rarely stalls. Figurative density is high but coherent, with no mixed metaphors in peak beats; minimal scaffold or paraphrase loops. Syntax varies and punctuation is clean. Final images (“rising sand,” “starflower”) carry weight without purple excess.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The ferry‑as‑needle through overlapping timelines, pattern‑driven navigation, and the hourglass as vacuum feel fresh and integrated. The conceptual turn (“merging lanes,” rising sand) is surprising yet earned. Emotional truth is more stoic than raw but coherent with character. Risks in worldbuilding and lyric texture pay off without confusing the reader.</comment>
