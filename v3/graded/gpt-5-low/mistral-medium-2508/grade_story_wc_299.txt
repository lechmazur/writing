<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority is specific and embodied—dust, feedback, the tactile cloth—while his contradictory impulses (professional detachment vs. private ache) act simultaneously. Micro‑choices (“I’ll take it,” leaving the station on, rolling the window down) reveal a hierarchy of values. The cost—relinquishing certainty and price as identity—is credible at this length. Slightly modest external pressure keeps this just below the top band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure builds via pattern (quarry blasts/“after”/dust→lighters) to a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis closure. The decisive change lands on the page—he claims the cloth and reframes worth: “He didn’t know what the cloth was worth, but he knew it was his.” Cost is legible: he forecloses the safety of valuation-as-worth and accepts uncertainty. Orientation is clean from the first lines.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The quarry office trailer and its sonic landscape actively charge the stakes and final image (blasts as drum machine; dust motes as lighters; echoes fading in the rearview). Specific sensory choices are POV‑true to a roadie/appraiser. The environment reweights meaning at closure without postcard overreach. It does not constrain tactics physically, but it meaningfully conditions perception and choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes are coherent (meaning vs. price), with one tightening: the “After” inscription reframes the object and forces a stance. The foreman’s “It’s just fabric” adds a light but effective counter‑pressure, sharpening Liam’s choice. Cost is felt rather than dramatic, fitting the lens. Escalation is subtle; no hard reversal, but cadence shifts responsibly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme arises organically from particulars: “after the applause” evolves into an ethic of meaning beyond price. Recurrences (feedback, blasts, lighters, radio hum) accrue and then reprice the premise at the end without moralizing. The final drive into dusk offers a resonant, non‑literal answer that lingers. No token symbolism; each image earns its weight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled close third with musical/technical diction befitting a roadie/appraiser; rhythm modulates with pressure. Dialogue is minimal but natural and subtextual. No head‑hopping; inference stays within plausible knowledge. The perceptual signature (valuing by texture, sound, object history) is memorable and consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is tight: varied syntax, high information density, and images doing double duty. Metaphors are coherent and scene‑true (gravel like static; quarry as wound). No loops or scaffold; momentum never stalls. Minor familiar phrasing appears once but doesn’t touch the closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The ex‑roadie appraiser in a quarry trailer is a fresh angle on “meaning after applause,” with charged, specific objects and soundscapes. The choice to center a scrap of grille cloth as talisman is inventive and thematically precise. Risks are measured and land cleanly, though the core arc is familiar. The synthesis feels singular enough for strong originality.</comment>
