<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear, particular interiority (trembling fingers; “heartbeat of hesitation”) and a credible shift from duty to vulnerability power the choice to wear the pearl. The inspector’s motive evolves from retrieval to communal radiance with embodied cost (“the weight of every confession… became her own”). Internal conflict is mostly internalized and lyrical rather than dramatized against another person, but it reads credible. A few thesis-forward lines risk neatness, yet her refusal to report underscores a felt renunciation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: shells → confessions → pearl → crowning → dissolution of walls, with a clean on‑page reconfiguration. Orientation is immediate (bunker → caves) and the throughline is continuous. Closure lands with cost: she absorbs confessions, forfeits the pearl, and defies the higher‑ups. The radio beat subtly tightens external stakes without derailing the lyrical structure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The crystal caves and bioluminescent veins are vivid and purpose‑driven, shaping mood and signaling intensification (“glow intensifying with every step”). Setting participates in the method (humming crystals feeding on words) and charges the final sky image. While the environment doesn’t physically constrain options, it materially reweights choices and the ending image. Detail selection stays POV‑filtered rather than touristic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—use the pearl to dissolve walls versus obey/contain—is legible and tightens through the escalating confessional trail. The decisive act (crowning) exacts a price (bearing collective fear; losing the pearl to the world). Conflict is primarily internal with a light external nudge (command radio), but the pressure coheres under the chosen lens. Stakes remain intimate yet consequential.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Themes of vulnerability as power and communal unsealing emerge through concrete particulars (shell confessions; “resonant hush” thinning walls). The crown reconfigures “weapon” into a method of relational dissolution, and the ending image seeds a lingering, nonliteral answer. A single on‑the‑nose line (“The walls were never real”) edges toward moralizing but is cushioned by action. Subtext largely rides image, not assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A confident, cohesive lyrical voice with controlled cadence and textured diction (“stitching the words into the air like embroidery”). Psychic distance stays stable; purposeful elisions are taught by pattern. The brief radio line punctures the lyric with effective contrast. No head‑hopping or register slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High information density with purposeful imagery; rhythm modulates well between pulse and hush. Figurative language is frequent but coherent to the world (light, shells, heartbeat), avoiding mixed metaphors. Minimal scaffolding and no evident looped phrasing. A few intensifiers skirt purple but don’t blur clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis—post‑apocalyptic inspection reframed as a ritual of communal confession via shells, with a pearl as method/crown—is fresh and integrated. Turns feel earned from seeded particulars (trail of shells) rather than late rule changes. The final repricing of “weapon” into world‑woven radiance is both non‑obvious and inevitable in hindsight. Boldness remains legible and coherent.</comment>
