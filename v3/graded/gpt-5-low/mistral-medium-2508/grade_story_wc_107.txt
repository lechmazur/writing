<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara’s motives (revive/repurpose her father’s “sanctuary” versus fear of collapse) are clear and tested by concrete micro‑choices: reading the logbook, accepting “controlled collapse,” and turning the final valve. Interiority is embodied through glassmaking habits and frost/heat sensitivities, not labels. The renunciation—leaving without watching the outcome—carries a felt cost and aligns with her character logic. A touch more on her blind spots under stress could have deepened the contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural with a decisive causal act: the thaw reveals plan → bookmark unlocks sequence → she turns the valve. Closure lands on the page with cost: “did not stay to watch the flood reshape the ruins,” while the environment audibly changes. Orientation and stakes are anchored early; the two‑shard transition to dawn is clean and serves closure. The causal sequence is intentionally spare but coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The abandoned control room and active thaw constrain options (valves, pipes, timing) and charge the final images. Sensory specificity is vivid and purposeful—groaning ice, hiss through pipes, glass orbs chiming—filtered through a glassblower’s eye. The bookmark and valve function as micro‑settings that steer choice. World rules remain consistent and felt without exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—risking collapse to create a true safe zone—is signaled early and tightens with the discovery of “controlled collapse.” The meaningful turn is the final valve pull; the price is the intentional flooding and her refusal to watch, foreclosing the refuge of nostalgia. Internal and external pressures interweave without contrivance. A slightly sharper on‑page consequence (e.g., a near‑failure or resource constraint) could raise the pressure further.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Themes of fragility-as-strength, inquiry versus control, and thaw as revelation arise organically through action and object returns. The final vow—“build something fragile enough to matter”—is a resonant, non‑literal answer that reprices the father’s “sanctuary.” Recurring images (bookmark crack, meltwater, glass orbs) accrue and shift meaning at closure. No sermonizing; ambiguity lingers with intention.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A distinct lyric voice with a credible perceptual signature of a glassblower under cold/heat pressure; quoted self‑narration is character‑true and functional. Rhythm modulates with tension (hiss, groan, then the airy ridge scene) without head‑hopping or register slips. Purposeful elision is taught early and paid off at closure. A few aphoristic lines approach loftiness but remain in character.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density with strong verbs and purposeful figurative control; lines often do multiple jobs. No scaffold loops or cadence templates; sentence variety supports momentum. The metaphor web (ice/glass/fire/melt) is coherent and un-muddled under pressure. Slight risk of lyrical saturation is managed; clarity remains intact at the peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—industrial thaw, familial science legacy, and artisan glasswork reframing “safe zone” via controlled collapse—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Object recurrence is used inventively rather than decoratively. Risks (quiet climax, lyric density) heighten meaning without obscuring clarity. Familiar motifs (thaw, return) are recharged through specific, grounded choices.</comment>
