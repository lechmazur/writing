<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear motive (ancient boredom and curiosity) and a credible renunciation (“let go”); interiority is specific to an immortal’s perspective. The emotional cost is conceptual rather than visceral, and internal contradiction is mild—he rarely hesitates. Micro‑choices (pressing the fragment, then dropping it) track to motive. Strong but not maximally conflicted characterization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure accrues through magnetic/space anomalies to the decisive drop, yielding a conceptual repricing of “goodbye.” Orientation is clean early (who/where/when), and closure lands with cost (surrendering control/artifact, identity tilt). Causal beats remain legible while lyric density builds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly particular and integrally used: magnetic fields as “language” drive access, the escondite’s spatial mutiny shapes options, and the copper vein charges the final image. World rules are taught through action, not dump. Environment constrains and then reconfigures the scene’s reality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (will he surrender the anchor and risk unmaking?) tightens cleanly at the corridor’s opening and crystallizes at the drop. The cost is clear though relatively gentle—transformation over harm. Agency drives the turn; pressure remains coherent and focused.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Thematic weave—rebellion against certainty, goodbye as aperture—emerges from concrete images and the immortal’s history. The line “Goodbye wasn’t an ending” veers toward explicit thesis, slightly blunting subtext. Still, resonance is strong and the final image reweights prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Consistent, controlled lyric voice with a distinct perceptual signature (cosmic scale, geometry-as-feeling). Rhythm modulates effectively through short emphatics (“Spatial mutiny.”) and supple sentences. No head‑hopping; stance and distance remain stable.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density with purposeful figurative language; lines do multiple jobs without padding. A few intensifiers risk purple edges but remain legible and pattern‑coherent. Momentum carries cleanly into a crisp closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: spatial mutiny as embodied setting, cursed geometry as curiosity rather than malice, immortal ennui repriced via a kind unmaking. The turn feels inevitable in hindsight and avoids genre default moves. Bold yet coherent without gimmickry.</comment>
