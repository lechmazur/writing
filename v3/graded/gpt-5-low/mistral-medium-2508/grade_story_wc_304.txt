<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Liora’s vocation and temperament coherently drive her choices; “beautician by trade and mortician by calling” shapes how she reads the aurora and treats the dead. Interiority is concrete and profession‑tinted, with tactile focus on breath, bone, and thresholds. The chip’s expenditure registers as a cost and a quiet renunciation. Internal contradiction (beauty/work with death; wanting a spark vs. accepting silence) is present, if subtle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the pattern‑reading builds to the doorway apparition and the received message, a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is clean from the first line (who, where, what she wants). Cost is on the page—the chip goes dull, and the moment vanishes—marking a before/after in her stance toward death. The sequence of focus → doorway → message → spent key holds causally even in a lyric frame.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The skyborne grotto and aurora aren’t wallpaper; the auroral static is literally the language she decodes to act. Specific textures (“petrified mist,” “bones of forgotten winds”) feel tailored to Liora’s sensibility and vocation. The final image (“a slow and endless exhale”) recharges the earlier atmospheric cues. Environment constrains the method and charges the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes are singular and clear: capture a last spark/message before oblivion. Escalation is a decisive intensification when she infuses the chip and the doorway forms, narrowing options to a one‑shot contact with a cost (the chip’s light). Internal and external pressures align, though opposition is atmospheric rather than antagonistic. The price is paid and alters her stance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme arises organically from particulars: thresholds, breath, static as language, all repriced by “tell them, it was beautiful.” The ending resonates as acceptance without sentimentality, though a couple of declarative lines (“thresholds were not walls…”) edge toward spelled‑out insight. The message’s warmth feels earned by concrete ritual and risk. Subtext works through image and vocation rather than meta‑commentary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The voice is distinct—measured, tactile, auroral—matching a mortician’s lucid attention. Psychic distance stays stable; no head‑hopping or unjustified certainty beyond Liora’s perceptions. Rhythm modulates cleanly at the doorway/messaging beat without resorting to prosaic explanation. The single line of dialogue lands with quiet force and subtext.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished: images are fresh, diction controlled, and sentences do more than one job. Lyric density remains coherent to the end with minimal redundancy; the figurative net (breath, static, thresholds) is consistent. A few near‑synonymous phrases could be tightened, but momentum holds. The last cadence resolves by image rather than explanation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Beautician‑mortician reading auroral static via an emerald memory chip is a striking synthesis. The method and setting aren’t gimmicks; they shape process and meaning. The turn to “a key to a moment” feels inevitable in hindsight. Risks in lyric tone and concept pay off without obscuring clarity.</comment>
