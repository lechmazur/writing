<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s motives are coherent and particular—disgraced skeptic drawn by an “invitation,” father’s legacy, and the amber fly’s pull—culminating in a credible leap. Embodied cues (ozone, the fly’s warmth, the terminal’s questions) anchor emotion. The internal contradiction (skeptic vs. pilgrim) is present but resolves slightly cleanly rather than grinding under friction. The final renunciation (most never come back) lands as a felt cost tied to prior traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hybrid lens leaning Accumulative/Textural: density and pattern (spiral, footprints, terminal prompts) escalate toward a decisive choice. Closure is on-page: she touches the galaxy and takes the figure’s hand; conceptual repricing reframes the signal as key and universe as “homesick.” Cost is legible in the “most never come back” warning and the empty lab/dean erasure shard. Orientation is clean from the first paragraph; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The rainwashed tower, ivy-swallowed sculptures, and bronze-filigree door are vivid and functionally constraining—the environment literally shapes the path and the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-shaped (ozone, cold metal, damp impressions). The tower and fly recur to charge the last beat, avoiding postcard description. World rules are learned through action without dumpy exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (accept/decline the “pilgrimage”) tightens via terminal prompts and the figure’s arrival; the “key” realization deepens options into an irreversible choice. The warning (“Most never come back”) crystallizes the price. Agency drives the turn: she refuses to answer, touches the galaxy, then commits by taking the hand. The escalation is coherent and avoids coincidence-as-solution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Themes of faith/science and memory/homecoming emerge through concrete images (amber fly, spiral, footprints) and reweight at the end. The line “Science wasn’t the absence of faith. It was the language of it.” edges into thesis-statement territory but is earned by prior scene work. The universe as “homesick” reframes the premise with lingering resonance. Final images (star calling her name; dean erasing) deliver layered irony without sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A controlled, lyric third-person with a distinct perceptual signature; diction and rhythm modulate with pressure effectively. Dialogue is spare but charged, carrying subtext and pressure. No head-hopping or register breaks; elision is purposeful and legible. The prose maintains confidence without over-explaining.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lines carry multiple jobs (image, action, theme) with minimal scaffolding; rhythm shifts to support tension. A few heightened formulations flirt with purple but stay coherent and purposeful. Repetition patterns (“The tower…” “Always, the stars.”) feel earned rather than looped. Clarity and propulsion remain intact through the closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The “signal as path/key” and “universe homesick” synthesis feels fresh; the amber fly as inheritance-to-technology bridge is memorable. While pilgrimage tropes are familiar, the execution personalizes them through scientific and filial textures. Risks in tone and lyric compression pay off without obscuring stakes. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight via seeded motifs.</comment>
