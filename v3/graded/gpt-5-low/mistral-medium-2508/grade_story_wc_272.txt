<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elara’s motive and contradiction are clear: a portraitist drawn to the dark, surrendering the urge to “capture” in favor of unmaking. Embodied cues (salt, parchment, cane seat unraveling) root her interiority. The renunciation of “artist” to “canvas” reads earned and costly. A touch of declarative thesis (“This was how you painted truth”) slightly flattens the otherwise organic arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the pressure of walls closing and the beam guttering tightens toward a Conceptual Repricing where darkness becomes presence. Closure lands on-page with cost—she relinquishes identity and the lighthouse is swallowed. The tarot redesign causally bridges beats to the final image. Orientation is clean from the opening sentence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The lighthouse-library is vivid and constraining: shelves press inward, air tastes of drowning, the beam’s failure shapes options. The setting directly charges the ending—its last “exhale” mirrors Elara’s and then vanishes. Object-as-setting (tarot box) also inflects space. Sensory specificity is purposeful and POV-filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (embrace necessary dark) is pressured by the physical closing-in and the failed keeper/portrait premise. The decisive tightening is Elara choosing redesign-as-surrender, turning collapse into doorway and stepping into the dark. Cost is legible: self-offering over self-expression. Stakes remain intimate but consequential throughout.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Themes of unmaking, reframing brokenness, and darkness as truth emerge from concrete acts (rethreading meanings) rather than sermon. Recurring images (beam, cracks, threads) shift valence at the end to a resonant, non-literal answer. One overt thematic sentence slightly telegraphs what the images already secure. The afterimage lingers without tidy moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct lyric voice with controlled rhythm and a stable close third focalization. Patterned elision is taught early and sustained without confusion. Diction suits the sensibility and never breaks POV modesty. The final cadence modulates gracefully without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High-density prose largely earns its metaphors and avoids muddle; images do double work for mood and meaning. Minor risk of saturation is managed by sentence rhythm and purposeful variation. No significant loops or scaffolding; momentum holds through the climax. Final images are clean and precise.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The lighthouse-as-library and tarot-reweaving method feel fresh, culminating in the artist-becomes-canvas turn that reads inevitable in hindsight. Risks in tone and abstraction pay off via concrete handling of objects and space. The synthesis avoids genre cliché while embracing a bold conceptual pivot. Specificity keeps the piece from drifting into generalized lyricism.</comment>
