<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Austere but specific interiority—his years of learned stillness, the teeth-ache pressure of the ghosts, the deliberate exhale—renders a coherent psyche under pressure. The contradictory impulse (preserving silence vs. consenting to break a sealed covenant) is dramatized rather than told. His refusal to speak even after renewal lands as an Earned Stasis with cost. Minor note: the inner conflict could peak one notch sharper at the opening beat of the box.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive is clear, building from ruin to visitation to opening and a reweighted world. Closure lands on the page: the box opens, the covenant untangles, and the final images conceptually reprice silence with felt cost (his enduring muteness and disappearance). Orientation is clean from the first lines; the two-shard coda enhances, not resets. No causality breaks; the pattern it teaches (silence/pressure/light) pays off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The oasis-ruin, dunes, and stained glass box are not décor but functional environment charging choice and the final image. Sensory detail is selective (pressure-hum, ribs of buried giants, light-bent wind-reading) and POV-filtered by a beekeeper’s attentions. The box as micro-setting constrains options and frames the closure. Atmosphere and weather turn (first raindrop) meaningfully modulate stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes center on whether he will break the sealed covenant of silence; the pressure coheres as ghosts escalate from presence to activating the seam. His agency (the deliberate breath and lift) triggers the turn; cost is the relinquishment of hoarded silence and, ultimately, himself. Escalation is quiet but decisive under the chosen lens. A slightly clearer pre-open risk could heighten the squeeze.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: silence vs. surrender, covenant vs. oblivion, memory as living labor. The honeycomb of light reweights the premise without moralizing, and the ending’s “mute eloquence” answers the central question in image. Recurring motifs (humming, glass, wind) shift meaning at closure. Resonance lingers without tidy didacticism.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A controlled, singular lyric voice with stable close-third focalization; perception and diction match a man trained in attention rather than speech. Rhythm modulates to the opening’s hush and the wing-charged pivot without opacity. Purposeful elisions teach their pattern and pay off (the covenant, the name carried by wind). No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High-density lines often carry multiple jobs, and the imagery coheres around bees, glass, wind, and pressure. A few lush constructions flirt with purple but stay disciplined and clear; repetition is purposeful rather than looped scaffolding. Syntax varies to support momentum and hush. Final images are crisp and unsmudged by metaphor tangle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis—apiculture, revenant covenant, stained-glass vault of unspeakable promises—feels singular and inevitable in hindsight. Risks (lyric quiet, conceptual closure) heighten stakes without losing clarity. Turns are earned by established patterns and objects, not late rule changes. Freshness arises from specific, tactile imagination rather than novelty for its own sake.</comment>
