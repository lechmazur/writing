<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elspeth’s motive (find the echo, protect the moths/city) is clear and consistent, with concrete micro‑choices (rejecting the boy’s moth; throwing the jar; pulling the thread). Interiority is specific to her illustrator’s eye, avoiding generic feeling labels. A felt cost lands via the boy’s unraveling, though her internal contradiction under peak pressure could be pushed further. Relationship dynamics with the boy carry pressure without overexplaining.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Hybrid drive with a causal spine: pendant hum → rumor/goal → boy’s demand → jar throw → silence/echo leash → pull → partial stabilization at real cost. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the city steadies, moths return to air not page, but the boy is lost and the giant still threatens. Orientation is clean from the opening, and set‑ups (pendant, jar, borrowing time) pay off. A minor convenience remains in the jar’s sudden decisive efficacy, but it’s seeded and thematically coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The rooftop canal city and time‑leaking giant are vividly specific and shape tactics (boat’s drift, jar thrown into canal, thread drawn from water). Recurring objects (pendant, jar, echo thread) charge the final image and constrain choices. Sensory detail is purposeful (ink‑black water, bioluminescent moths) and filtered through Elspeth’s illustrator bias. World rules are learned in action rather than dumped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prevent temporal collapse by finding/controlling the echo) is signaled early and tightens through tangible acts. The jar‑throw “uncaging” turns the scene and forces a trade‑off (boy’s unraveling; risk of waking the giant). Agency, not coincidence, drives the climax as she pulls the silver thread. The cost is legible and lingers, though a further narrowing of options before the final pull could heighten pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Time‑debt, art versus reality, and captivity/uncaging cohere without moralizing; the moths returning to air (not frame) reprice the premise. The “interrupted cadence” refracts through echoes, the boy’s “borrowing,” and the giant’s nap to yield a charged final stance: work remains under threat. Subtext sits in images (pendant heat/cold, teeth like clock hands) rather than statements. The resonance is strong and earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The lyric third‑person close maintains a stable, character‑particular sensibility with crisp, idiomatic dialogue (the boy’s paper‑thin voice, edged grin). Rhythms modulate well around the peak beats (silence arriving as a note; the city gasping). No head‑hopping or register slips. Compression is purposeful and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sentences carry high information density with varied cadence and minimal scaffold. Figurative language is fresh and disciplined (echo as leash, ink bleeding upward), rarely overstacked. Action remains clear through the most lyrical turns, preserving momentum. A few lush images press the edge of purple but do not blur causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rooftop canals, time‑leaking giant, and echo‑as‑leash synthesize into an original, coherent vision. The “uncage” pivot and moths returning to air rather than art feel non‑obvious and inevitable in hindsight. Risk‑taking is evident without gimmickry. Minor reliance on a single decisive object (the jar) slightly tempers the ingenuity band.</comment>
