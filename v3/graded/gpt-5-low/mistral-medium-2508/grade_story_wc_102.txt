<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear, specific motive (to locate “where the unused love goes”) and embodied interiority (“breath form shapes—first a serpent, then a key”). The apparition catalyzes a credible turn, though internal contradiction is gentle rather than pressurized. Final acceptance of the keeper role reads earned, with the jade’s burn/disappearance as cost. Slight softness: minimal friction or competing impulse beyond awe.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: breath, lens, jade, and fog densify toward the on‑page closure. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—he redefines healing and assumes keeper status—at a felt cost (renouncing the jade, taking on stewardship). Orientation is crisp from the outset; causality is lyrical but coherent. The cost is subtle rather than biting, keeping it just shy of the top band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is superbly integrated: the viaduct as threshold, fog/jasmine as active atmosphere, and the camera as tool/setting‑adjacent object that charges the final image. Environment constrains and enables (the shard under the arch; stones “sing” back). Sensory detail is selective and POV‑filtered. High craft, capped only by overall closure intensity not reaching the very top tier.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear early; pressure tightens with the shard touch, shadow split, and apparition—he must decide to breathe in and accept the cost. The renunciation of the object and assumption of ongoing duty provide meaningful consequence. Escalation is textural rather than combative but coherent under the chosen lens. A hint more resistance or risk would heighten the turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rich thematic weave (unused love as embers/sparks; healing as revelation) culminates in a resonant, non‑literal answer. Subtext rides image and action (silver thread, embers rising) with emotional afterglow. A slight lapse into explicit statement (“healing wasn’t mending...”) trims the mystique. Overall, depth without sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Consistent, controlled lyric voice with a distinct perceptual signature; diction suits the character’s sensibility. Psychic distance modulates well under pressure; dialogue is minimal yet potent (“You kept me in your ribs”). No head‑hopping or stance slips. Slight risk of uniform lushness, largely managed.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lines are musical and efficient, with images doing multi‑work (breath as key; camera projecting onto eyelids). Minor density of figurative language edges toward purple in places, but coherence holds and momentum remains. Syntax varies; few to no scaffold loops. Final images land cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: camera obscura, breath‑truth, Kwan Yin’s Tear, and “unused love” as embers yields a fresh metaphysical frame. Turns feel earned by prior particulars rather than gimmickry. Boldness sits in the concept and atmosphere rather than structure; emotional truth reads specific. Slightly conventional epiphany phrasing keeps it shy of the rarest band.</comment>
