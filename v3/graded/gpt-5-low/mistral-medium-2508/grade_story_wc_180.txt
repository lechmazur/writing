<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and specific, with clear motivation to reconnect and comprehend the daughter driving concrete choices (digging, planting, untie/bind, apple bite). Contradictory impulses—pride versus humility, duty versus love—surface credibly in the question “What did you see that I couldn’t?” and the ribbon-binding. The emotional cost is felt, if quiet: relinquishing rigidity and accepting the daughter’s stance. Slight softness remains in the absence of on-page pushback beyond memory and environment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: action builds from dig → box → seed → planting → sprout → ribbon → apple, with each beat reweighting the central question. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing): the contract is renounced while a deeper vow endures, paid for by relinquishing prior posture. Cost is legible in the ribbon bound to the self and the transgressive apple bite. Orientation is clean, and set-ups (satchel, ribbon, light-bend) pay off without contrivance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The orchard-cathedral is sensorially rich and governs tactics: “where the light bends” dictates planting; the apple enables the taboo-breaking choice; the ribbon in the bough anchors the final rebind. Details are POV-filtered (apples smelling “like forgiveness,” quartz pouch, cracked marble as veins) and evolve with action. The setting charges the final image and is inseparable from theme. World rules feel consistent within a lightly magical register.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding and repairing the bond—tightens meaningfully when the note reframes the search and the sprout answers, forcing a choice to rebind the ribbon and eat the forbidden fruit. Pressure is coherent and grows through discovery rather than confrontation, fitting the chosen lens. The price is modest but present (renunciation of old constraints, acceptance of the daughter’s terms). A sharper on-page counterforce could have intensified the squeeze.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The “deciduous vows” motif threads action and culminates in “The contract was dust. The vow was not,” reweighting commitment versus institutional coercion. Images and gestures—not moralizing—deliver the insight: seed/sprout, ribbon, apple, and doll recast persistence as chosen, not imposed. The thematic ambiguity is fertile—endurance with cost rather than tidy absolution. One or two aphoristic lines flirt with overstatement but largely earn their resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice with consistent focalization: tactile verbs and idiosyncratic metaphors feel character-rooted. Elisions are purposeful and paid off (e.g., quartz pouch signals vocation; “light bends” rule is learned through action). Rhythm modulates well from hush to revelation without head‑hopping or register slips. Dialogue snippets carry subtext and history without over-explaining.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Line-level craft is polished: high information density, varied syntax, and images doing double duty. Figurative language is frequent yet coherent and legible; momentum rarely stalls. Minor risk of purple creep in a few stacked metaphors, but clarity and propulsion hold, including at the close. No loops or scaffolding blur the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis—cathedral-orchard, quartz-eye craft, deciduous vows as praxis—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Turns arise from established particulars (note, seed, light rule) rather than late conveniences. Risks in tone and form heighten stakes without obscuring sense. The final arrangement (ribbon on wrist, doll cradling sprout) is memorable and specific to this world.</comment>
