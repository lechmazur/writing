<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Liora’s motive and fear are clear and embodied—the “method…terrified her,” she bleeds to dredge a memory, and she endures throat‑burn to keep singing. The inner contradiction (terror vs. duty) plays in scene and drives action. Complexity is modest, but the micro‑choices under pressure feel earned and specific. The release admission (“It wasn’t just the realm…It was her”) lands with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive is consistent: gathering shards → first note struggle → trees’ hunger → mirror world singing back → communal reprise. Closure is on‑page with cost: light returns, windows shatter from fulfillment, and the night screams as it unravels. Orientation is clean from the outset; the final image reconfigures the premise (prison → door). No causality breaks; the tightening is purposeful and legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The greenhouse/orchard and mica windows are integrated as living constraints—hungry trees, fruit that never ripens, trapped light that later shatters. Environmental change tracks pressure and charges the ending image. The setting’s rules are learned through action, not exposition, and the final image depends on these objects’ specific properties. Atmosphere and function converge without bloat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rekindle a dying realm) is signaled early and tightens through embodied costs (blood, voice strain) to the cadence shift where the world sings back. The escalation is accumulative, not reversal‑driven, yet the hunger of the trees and the thin harmony thread meaningfully raise stakes. The villagers’ entry seals the communal cost/solution without coincidence. Prices are legible and persist into the final state.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Community as a binding force emerges through concrete acts (baker, child, festivals) and converts into action via song. The mica shatter “from fulfillment” and the mirror world turning from cage to door deliver a resonant, non‑literal answer. No moralizing; the closing reprices memory, song, and light with communal stewardship. Ambiguity remains purposeful, not vague.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A distinct, lyrical perceptual signature holds steady; diction and rhythm modulate with pressure without slipping registers. The POV remains tight to Liora’s experience and inference. Patterned elision is taught and paid off (lyric beats accrue to the final cadence). No head‑hopping or explanatory overreach.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density with vivid but controlled figurative language; images do more than one job (“shards” as memory and light). Minor risk of purple is managed by clear action lines and momentum. No looped scaffolding; sentence rhythm breathes with the scene. The final lines are clean and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mirror‑world that eats songs + alchemical orchard + mica memory windows is a fresh synthesis executed with conviction. The communal singing‑back turn feels inevitable and earned rather than a trope. Emotional truth anchors the conceit, avoiding gimmickry. Not radically new, but distinctly rendered and memorable.</comment>
