<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lena’s motives are precise and embodied: seeking hush, reading icicle “language,” gifting moss and ultimately the pendant. Her contradictions—“not hiding” yet retreating—read human and drive action. The relationship functions as crucible without over‑explaining. Only minor: “Brave is a word…” edges toward thesis, but it’s grounded by the tactile exchange.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the scene tightens from sanctuary to shared tending to a charged transfer (the pendant). Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she relinquishes her heirloom anchor and commits to “moss” with a felt price. Orientation is clear early; causal coherence holds. The final image reweights the premise with a visible cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The data center‑turned‑garden is vividly sensory and functionally shapes choice (planting moss in a server rack). Recurring objects (moss, pendant, icicle patterns) charge the final image. The environment’s decay→growth logic mirrors and enables the resolution. Detail is selective and filtered through Lena’s noticing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Pressure escalates quietly but coherently: public backlash → sanctuary → Javier’s arrival → planting → the pendant trade. The cost is legible in the heirloom’s surrender and in their mutual vulnerability. Stakes remain focused on meaning‑making rather than event peril, which fits the lens. A single deepening beat (the gift) narrows options convincingly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme—reframing wounds as soil—emerges through concrete acts (planting, following thaw patterns, the pendant’s revaluation). Subtext rides silence and gesture; dialogue avoids moralizing. A minor directness (“This is braver”) is earned by action and doesn’t flatten complexity. The ending’s image answers the central question without stating a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The voice is controlled, lyrical without drift, and distinctly filtered through Lena’s perceptual signature. Dialogue is spare, natural, and charged by implication; Javier’s lines feel distinct. Rhythm modulates to match pressure, landing cleanly at the final cadence. No head‑hopping or register slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Line work is taut and sensuous with high information density; images do multiple jobs. Figurative language stays coherent and grounded in scene logic (moss, thaw, honeyed hush). A whisper of lyric lushness approaches saturation but maintains clarity and momentum. No loops, scaffolding, or mechanical cadence runs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The moss‑cathedral data center and icicle‑pattern “language” give the piece fresh texture; the pendant exchange subverts the expected comfort object arc. Emotional truth feels specific, not templated. Risks are quiet but committed, avoiding trope‑safe middles. The synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
