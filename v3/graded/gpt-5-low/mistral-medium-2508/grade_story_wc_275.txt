<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Liora’s motives—preserving the roses and her father’s ethic of “engraved quiet”—drive concrete micro-choices (tying the strip, sheathing and then using the knife to carve continuity). The internal conflict between leaving and staying is implicit but felt, especially in “You were supposed to leave.” The endurance choice at the end forecloses a path with cost. Slight limitation: tension remains mostly contemplative rather than pressured by an active counterforce on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Clear orientation and a coherent accumulative/textural lens culminate in Earned Stasis: she chooses to remain and tend, with the fissure and outside ruin as persistent constraints. Cost is legible in the refusal to flee and the plan to stitch the dome—“By dawn, the desert would be ash… and Liora would be there.” The one-scene structure tightens around the crack and wind rattle, then resolves to a charged poise. Slight softness in causal turns is appropriate to the lens and doesn’t undercut closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The dome, fissure, roses, and sandbag form an integrated micro-ecosystem that constrains choices and charges the ending image. Environmental pressure (wind, crack, ash) shapes tactics (tie the sapling, plan to stitch the seam). Sensory detail is vivid and POV-filtered (“roses breathing,” “thrum of roots”). Setting is indispensable to the conflict and resolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—guard the sanctuary versus flee—remains coherent with one meaningful tightening when the fissure appears and the wind rises. Agency shows through endurance and care tactics, with a visible price in staying. The plan to patch the dome reweights risk and commitment. Escalation is gentle but sufficient under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Themes of inherited ethics, transmuted violence, and continuity-in-chaos emerge through objects and acts (knife for carving, sandbag strip, “engraved quiet”). The final image reweights prior motifs without overt moralizing, though “She would weave it back together” approaches declarative. Subtext in the roses’ “memory” and listening deepens resonance. The piece invites reflection beyond its scene.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A consistent, lyric POV with a distinct perceptual signature (“senselessly perceptive silence,” “thrum of roots”) carries the piece. Rhythm modulates well between short, charged lines and longer, textured sentences. No head-hopping or register drift; elision is purposeful. A few heightened phrases flirt with purple but remain voice-motivated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lines are concentrated, sensory, and mostly doing multiple jobs; repetition works as motif rather than loop. Figurative control is strong, with only minor lushness that doesn’t obscure clarity. Sentence and paragraph rhythms vary to support momentum. The closing cadence lands cleanly without scaffolding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The fusion of airship wreckage, a glass‑domed desert rose sanctuary, and a bounty hunter’s pacifist legacy feels fresh. Transforming a knife and sandbag into caretaking tools is a non‑obvious, organic turn. The quiet, risk‑laden Earned Stasis avoids template heroics while feeling inevitable. Not radical, but confidently singular.</comment>
