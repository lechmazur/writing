<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lila’s motive—seeking a non‑numerical answer under the pressure of her father’s condition—is clear and compels concrete micro‑choices (lighting the lantern, choosing blue, then refusing to choose). Interiority is specific (wet paper, old glue, mica reflections) and her contradictory impulses (trained rationalist vs. leaper) act simultaneously. The final renunciation (not choosing a single path) forecloses her father’s model with felt cost. A few thematic lines verge on abstraction, but her actions keep them earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: image density and patterning tighten toward a closure that conceptually reprices “contradiction” as seam. Orientation is clean (library, rain, lantern) and the single transition (dissolve/return) is legible. Closure lands on the page: she surrenders selection, steps into the woven light—cost is stepping beyond her father’s rules under the live pressure of his recovery. No causal gaps undermine the turn.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purpose‑driven—the rainwashed library and the lantern’s mica function as micro‑environment that splits choices and then cracks, charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective (burnt clover, wet paper, hot pavement) and tracks with urgency. The object‑as‑setting constrains action (blue vs. gold; then braid) and evolves with consequence. World rules stay consistent through observation, not exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (whether to trust contradiction and leap) tightens from blue path selection to the bolder refusal to choose. The escalation is internal but clear, tested by a tangible trigger (new scrawl: “You don’t widen perspectives by standing still”). The price is entering uncertainty and rejecting her father’s framework during a fraught time. Stakes remain contained yet credible for the length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme coheres: luck vs. probability reframed via “contradictions as seams,” culminating in a resonant non‑literal answer (responsibility as leap). Recurring images (mica, clover, rain) deepen subtext without feeling gimmicky. A few lines edge toward thesis‑speak (“The answer is in the gap…,” “What if the responsible thing is to leap?”), but they’re dramatized by choice and cost. The ending lingers as a reweighted premise rather than a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature (math/odds lexicon braided with sensuous detail). Rhythm varies and tightens under pressure, and the patterned elision around the dissolve is taught early and pays off. No head‑hopping or stance leakage. Diction remains apt for Lila’s background without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is strong: high information density, purposeful metaphors, and clean syntax that propels. Minor risk of figurative saturation is controlled by clear beats and action. No notable loops or scaffold; the final image is crisp. A slight condensation of thesis‑adjacent lines could lift momentum further.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—probability pedagogy, mica‑splitting lantern, clover‑scented scrawls, and contradiction as traversable seam—feels fresh and integrated. Turns arise from established motifs and a specific worldview rather than a generic twist. The risk of a lyric, accumulative structure pays off with clear closure. It stops short of radical reinvention, but the execution is distinctive.</comment>
