<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and embodied—she means to hush the prophecy by “mapping silence,” using the wing and the brook. Interiority is sensorial and character‑particular (solitude “pressing in like a second skin”). The failure to catch the thread and the choice to accept a partial quiet read as an earned endurance. Contradictory impulses are present but subtle (urgency to “catch it” versus surrender to rest), not deeply dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, beats cohere from stilling the brook to the lattice, the snapped thread, shatter, and reweighted hush. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Resonant Reconfiguration: the prophecy’s “scream” becomes a “sigh,” and she finally sleeps—at a cost (seared hand, lost thread, acceptance of incompletion). Orientation is clean early (summoner, brook, night). The final cadence ties prior images into a new stasis without over‑explaining.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The brook, reeds, moonlit stones, and the origami wing are tactile and integrated with action; the water literally becomes the working surface. The world’s rules stay consistent through observation (reflections, lattice, hush as net). Setting charges the final image (dawn, crane’s flight) and constrains choices (the summoning relies on the water and night). Sensory detail is selective, not touristic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: soothe the prophecy’s unraveling force. Pressure tightens via the attempt (brook stilled, lattice formed), the sudden rupture (“snap,” shattering surface), and the partial outcome that narrows options to acceptance. The felt price (pain, failure to catch the thread) informs the final choice to keep and carry a softened hush. Escalation is primarily textural but unmistakable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Silence versus fear, translation versus surrender, and the ethics of partial victories emerge through event and image rather than moralizing. The wing’s reweighted quiet and her rest create a resonant answer: containment over conquest. The crane’s dawn flight reframes the night’s work as benediction rather than triumph, deepening the theme. Ambiguity lingers without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The lyric voice is controlled and consistent, with rhythmic modulation at turns (“Then—snap.”). Perceptual signature is distinct, grounded in tactile and auditory noticing. No head‑hopping or stance drift; purposeful elisions are legible. A few heightened phrases recur, but they are motif‑coherent rather than redundant.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is strong: varied syntax, high information density, and purposeful motifs. Repetition (“For now”) works as cadence rather than scaffold. Lush metaphors remain coherent to the scene’s physics; purple spill is avoided even in peak beats. Minor risk of excess shimmer is kept in check by clear action lines.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Summoning through “mapping silence” with an origami wing at a brook is a fresh, specific synthesis. The partial, textural victory avoids template triumph and feels inevitable in hindsight. A few familiar lyric moves appear, but the object logic and hush‑as‑craft provide originality and integrity. Risks in diction and structure pay off without muddling.</comment>
