<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—preserve trust and prevent weaponization—drives clean, embodied choices (opening the buckle, leaping, refusing the radio). Fear coexists with duty without tidy resolution, yielding credible Earned Stasis. Internal texture is specific (pattern‑seer, muscle‑memory, fail‑safes) rather than generic bravery. Minor limitation: conflict remains largely internal, offering less friction to reveal deeper contradictions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: pressure coheres from prep → jump → descent → landing, with a final Charged Poise/Earned Stasis in refusing contact. Closure cost lands (chosen isolation; uncredited salvation) and the lens holds. Orientation is clear early; set‑ups (buckle, radio, wind) pay off. Escalation is modest but sufficient for the form and length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and functionally integrated: the arbor’s isolation, wind, and spores shape tactics and charge the ending image. The sky‑borne launch point constrains options and frames the “trust the wind” credo. World‑rules (bioluminescence, curfewed city) are consistent and economical. A touch more environmental interference during the descent could heighten constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear and active: ensure the drop doesn’t fall to the wrong hands. Tightening occurs with the jump and the refusal to answer the radio, which forecloses an easier, safer path. Cost is legible but external opposition is minimal, muting visceral risk despite the conceptual stakes. Still, the cadence intensifies appropriately under the chosen lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Themes of trust, silence, and chosen attention emerge through objects and action (buckle, radio, “trust no one but the wind”). The final image (city spared, spores on the wind) reweights prior motifs without sermonizing. The “watcher’s burden” line edges toward explicitness but is supported by dramatized choices. Resonance lingers via earned restraint.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyrical yet controlled voice with a distinct perceptual signature; imagery (soundless snap, held breath) coheres with the silence motif. POV distance is stable; elisions are purposeful and paid off. Rhythm modulates well between poise and motion. Minor risk of over‑lyricism in clusters, but clarity holds.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High line‑level control: sentences do multiple jobs, momentum is steady, and the final cadence clicks. Figurative language is vivid but mostly disciplined; no notable loops or scaffolding. Diction fits the character’s sensibility and avoids register drift. A few dense metaphors flirt with purple but do not obscure sense.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The arbor‑above‑clouds, bioluminescent spores, and “weaponized silence” frame feel fresh and integrated. The buckle as reliquary and tool is an elegant, specific spine. Risks in tone and imagery pay off without gimmickry. Novelty leans conceptual rather than twist‑driven, sustaining authenticity.</comment>
