<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Veyra’s motive (mentor’s charge to find resilience) is clear and drives concrete, risky choices (banking hard, landing on the arch, reaching into the “mouth”). Interiority is embodied (“breath hitched,” the vibrating arrow tip) though conflict reads more one‑sided passion than contradictory impulses. The moss’s spread creates a credible internal shift with implied cost. The closing renaming of her role (“not just a pilot”) is earned by prior beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural; Closure: Conceptual Repricing with a Charged Poise—she reframes the echoes as instructions and commits to planting the sapling at the core. Orientation is crisp from the outset; the inversion clock structures the scene. Causal seams hold, though the path to the seed is relatively unopposed, softening felt cost. The mentor relic’s dissolution and bodily alteration mark a before/after.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The orchard planet, floating arches, and inversion phenomena are vivid and tactically relevant (landing on the arch before gravity resets). Details are filtered through a pilot’s priorities (navigating by upflow, banking around boulders) and charge the final image (arches humming in chorus, moss shimmering on skin). World rules remain consistent and are learned through action. The setting constrains choices and powers the ending.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (locate the source of resilience) is established and tightened by the hour‑long inversion and the dangerous “mouth.” The key turn—retrieving the pulsing seed—alters options and knowledge. However, resistance is light and costs are mostly conceptual, with few foreclosed options beyond the time window. The ending decision to plant at the core is earned but not hard‑won.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Recurring images (echoes, moss, arches) accrue into a resonant reframing: resilience as creation rather than mere survival. Yet the text explicitly states the thesis (“Resilience wasn’t something you found. It was something you grew.”), blunting subtext near the end. The final chorus image still lands emotionally. The mentor object’s sacrifice and bodily change keep the theme grounded in particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The close third‑person voice is controlled and character‑specific, with rhythmic sentences that modulate under pressure. No head‑hopping or stance leakage; certainty tracks what Veyra can perceive. Lyric diction is consistent with the speculative frame and the pilot’s sensibility. Quoted mentor line integrates smoothly without disrupting focalization.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and economical; most lines do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, pressure, theme) without bloat. Figurative language is frequent but coherent and legible; cadence varies to sustain momentum. Minimal scaffolding; images progress causally. Minor didactic phrasing near the end slightly flattens texture.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The inversion‑hour orchard planet with growth‑accelerant moss and “whirling silence” echoes feels fresh and integrated. The seed‑as‑instruction twist reweights earlier images with inevitability. Risks (lyric tone, concept‑forward closure) pay off without obscuring clarity. Emotional stakes are specific to this voice and world rather than generic SF furniture.</comment>
