<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Clear, embodied motivation (rectify the stolen sound) and tactile interiority (“listened…with the scars on her hands”) make Liora particular and credible. Contradictory impulses—grief versus resolve—coexist on the page and drive her choices. Her bleeding, and the decision to reenter the storm, register as a felt cost. Slight idealization of competence at peak beats trims the ceiling but doesn’t undercut the arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure compounds from mute key to heat‑map activation to the conservatory “singing,” then a charged decision to sail back. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—silence/music equivalence—with cost visible (blood, risk, return to storm). Orientation is clean and single‑scene coherence is maintained. The causal chain is lyric but legible, with one decisive intensification.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The winterglass conservatory, the frozen air, and the piano are not wallpaper; they constrain options and shape tactics (sound can’t travel, so she heat‑maps emotion to “melt” air). Recurring objects (piano, case) charge the final image. Sensory selection is purposeful, widening as pressure turns to release. World rules (frozen sound) remain consistent and are learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible early and tightens: failure at the key, then a risky pivot through the heat‑map that demands bodily price and culminates in a stance—go back into the storm. The on‑page cost (bleeding fingers; choosing danger) is unmistakable. Escalation is protagonist‑driven, not coincidental. Slight gloss over tactical difficulty prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme coheres: silence as language, emotion as frequency, and art as transmutation are enacted, not merely asserted. The final turn reweights prior images into a non‑literal answer (singing winterglass; the world listening). One explicit thesis line (“She was proving… the same thing all along”) edges toward telling, slightly dulling the subtext’s shimmer. Overall resonance endures beyond the scene.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyric third‑person close is controlled and consistent; diction and rhythm intensify with pressure without losing clarity. The perceptual signature (sound/emotion synesthesia) feels character‑bound and distinct. No head‑hopping or stance leakage. A few grand abstractions skim the surface, but cadence and image do the heavy lifting.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Highly polished lines with purposeful repetition and vivid, coherent metaphors (“winterglass,” “warped and wet”). Information density is strong; most lines carry multiple jobs (world, theme, and action). Minor purple tint and one or two paraphrase‑adjacent echoes are present but don’t slow momentum. Mechanics are clean and sequences read clearly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Striking synthesis: a frozen‑sound world, a heat‑mapped tuning fork case, and playing a storm into speech. Risks (world rule, lyric logic) pay off in a fresh, inevitable‑feeling final stance. Recurrences (case, piano, silence) transform rather than decorate. Emotional truth sits under the novelty, not behind it.</comment>
