<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elias’s desire to understand the brownstone is vivid, embodied through touch, sound, and the seal’s heat; his hesitation before signing shows credible contradiction. The relationship with Veyra functions as crucible—status tilts subtly from supplicant to successor. The cost (“you’ll walk away unchanged” as the lie) lands in his transformation. Slight limitation: interiority is elegantly spare, leaving a hair’s breadth less grit under peak pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hybrid lens with causal spine: sugar knock → seal/lessons → blood contract → building speaks → Veyra vanishes → Elias inherits the role. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: knowledge binds; “agreements are tombs.” Costs are on‑page (blood, burn, burden of grief, role shift), and the final knock reframes the opening. Orientation is clean from the first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The rooftop garden and meteor showers are not postcard filler; they time lessons and charge the contract moment, while the wisteria and steam‑letters seed the piece’s logic. The seal functions as an object‑as‑setting constraint, determining how language is enacted. Sensory selection is purposeful (pressure, hum, exhalation). Minor note: the city context stays tasteful but could bear one more constraining detail under peak.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear early (learn the building’s language); escalation tightens at the blood contract and the interrogation of the house’s grief. Agency drives the turn—Elias signs, then demands an answer of the bricks. The felt price (identity shift, tutor’s disappearance, sharper whispers) charges the ending. Slightly softer is the explicit risk calculus before signing; danger is implicit rather than named.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>“Agree to the lies” integrates theme with action and cost; the cycle of mentorship and entombing agreements reframes knowledge as binding. The building’s language as interrogation—not learning—reprices the premise at the climax. The final sugar knock converts hospitality into initiation with a charged doubleness. No moralizing; the resonance lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature (pressure, hums, exhalations, sky writing). Dialogue carries subtext and advances pressure (“you must agree to the lies first”). Patterned elisions (tea that “hadn’t been there”) are taught and consistent with the world‑logic. Rhythm modulates cleanly at the signing and the final beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density with precise images; lines often do double duty (world rule + mood). Figurative language remains coherent to the story’s physics and lexicon; no mixed metaphors muddy peak beats. Minimal scaffold and no evident loops. A touch more sentence‑length variance in the midsection could add propulsion, but momentum holds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The “language of old buildings” taught under meteor showers via a humming seal feels fresh, and the lie‑contract ethos is an elegant risk. The cyclic mentorship turn is familiar but transformed by charged specifics and cost. Final image inevitability reads earned rather than tricked. Strong synthesis without gimmickry.</comment>
