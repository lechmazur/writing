<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lira’s motivation is crisp and embodied: she rejects the doctors’ theft and chooses a risky, self-devised method to reclaim her mind. The quiet sabotage history concretizes “quietly rebellious” rather than merely stating it. Interiority is specific (finger drumming, breath and tremor) with a credible progression from poise to strain. Slight limit: internal contradiction is modest; the piece favors resolve over fraught ambivalence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Hybrid with an accumulative dominant: pressure builds through sonic density until the pattern breaks as she “sings” with her hands to release the memories. Closure lands on the page—her mind becomes her own—and the felt cost is implied in psychic exertion and likely institutional backlash. Orientation is clean early: who/where/what are established by ~120 words. The cost is more conceptual than concrete, but it’s legible at the ending image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The sound wave garden and auric lagoon are not postcard décor; they are instruments that enable the tactic (resonation, drumming on water) and charge the final image. Sensory specificity is vivid and POV-filtered (reeds keen, lagoon froths, stars fracture into the water). The environment constrains what’s possible—she must use this place to untangle the knot. The last reflection of a griefless sky reprises and reweights the setting with earned grace.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reclaiming agency from imposed memories—is clear from the outset. Escalation arrives as her drumming intensifies and the garden trembles, shifting from containment to release; the pattern break is decisive. The cost reads in physical/psychic strain and the foreclosed path with the doctors, though it remains off-stage. One strong tightening suffices at this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Themes of consent, ownership of memory, and the wildness of dreams arise from concrete acts rather than preaching. Recurrent images (breath, drumming, lagoon) accrue meaning and modulate from dirge to lullaby, offering a non-literal answer: healing via relinquishment, not accumulation. A couple of thesis-adjacent lines (“They had tried to breathe life into a dream…”) flirt with overt statement but remain supported by scene pressure. The final inhalation image lands resonantly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The lyric voice is coherent and controlled, with rhythmic variation that tightens under pressure. Diction and image-making feel specific to Lira’s perception; no head-hopping or register drift. Purposeful repetition (humming, drumming, inhaling) is taught early and paid off at closure. No dialogue is needed; the voice carries subtext and momentum.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Line-level craft is lush yet mostly disciplined; images align with the established physics of the piece. Momentum holds—sentences do multiple jobs, and scaffolding is minimal. A high density of figurative language risks purple in lesser hands, but here it remains legible, with only minor proximity to ornament in a few lines. The final image is clear and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis—sonic ecology plus entangled-memory therapy and tactile, percussive release—is fresh and felt. The “guinea pig” trope is transformed through the auric lagoon and sound-reed mechanics, avoiding template beats. Turns arise from established particulars (her drumming habit becomes the liberating method). Boldness is present without gimmickry.</comment>
