<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clear interior contradiction (vow-bound silence vs. the urge to act) culminates in the earned choice to “unsnap” and speak. Embodied emotion is vivid—the welded gauntlet, the shadows spilling—grounding the abstract. Motivation coheres from the siege’s refusal to applaud through to a reclaiming of agency. A slight remove remains; we feel him, but his specific stakes beyond self-liberation could be sharper.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: density builds via threads/patterns to a charged cadence shift at UNSNAP and the spoken “I was there.” Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with cost (breaking the seal; pain “like holy fire”). Orientation is clean early (who/where/when) and pays off when the greenhouse reconfigures into a stage. Causal links are legible and motivated within the lyric logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The alchemical orchard greenhouse is integral, transforming into a stage that constrains and then enables choice; objects (program, gauntlet) are lived-in tools not postcards. Sensory detail is specific across modalities (smell of silverleaf, condensation, hungry air) and filters through the knight’s bias. World rules are taught through action (threads, moth-banners) without exposition. Minor risk of overrich description never muddies space or stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to remain bound by performance or reclaim agency—tightens when threads manacle his wrists, forcing a single tactic: unsnap and speak. The escalation is protagonist-driven; the price is tangible (breaking the welded gauntlet, releasing shadows, ending seven years of silence). Pressure remains coherent and deepens rather than reverses. Slight abstraction of external consequences keeps this just shy of the top band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of allegiance (silence vs. what follows) emerges organically via performance imagery, vows, and manipulated fate, culminating in a reweighted final image (threads as wings). Subtext hums through objects and staging (program, key) without sermonizing. One explicit line (“the allegiance had never been to the silence…”) states the thesis a touch plainly. The emotional aftereffect lingers and invites reread without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A controlled, distinctive lyric voice maintains consistent distance and perceptual signature; the single spoken line lands with blade-like contrast. Diction matches the piece’s mythic register and stays character-plausible in this stylized frame. Patterned elision is taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping or stance drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density with images doing multiple jobs; rhythms vary and propel. Figurative language is rich but mostly coherent, avoiding mixed metaphors even under pressure. Minimal scaffold or loops; lines tend to advance moment, mood, and meaning simultaneously. Occasional lavishness edges toward excess but does not blur action or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: siege-as-performance, greenhouse-as-stage, and “UNSNAP” as ritual act feel surprising yet inevitable in hindsight. The marionette program becoming a key is a memorable, specific turn that reweights prior motifs. Risks in diction and concept cohere and heighten stakes without gimmickry. The piece asserts an authentic, integrated vision.</comment>
