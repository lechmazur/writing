<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Liora’s motives are clear and pressurized: she longs for the charged poise before a decision and must confront whether to speak or relinquish. Embodied interiority (the shard’s sting, breath on water) grounds her contradictions—craving repair while courting erasure. The final choice (letting the letter go) forecloses a path with felt cost. Minor softness: the moon‑healing motif slightly cushions the struggle at the peak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, pressure coheres from humming spirits to condensation‑messages to release, landing a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is clean early (who/where/what), and the pattern of breath→message→dissolve teaches the closure move. Cost is visible in the forfeiture of direct communication as the letter drifts away. A hair more consequence on the sister side would have pushed higher.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The mangrove labyrinth, the water “windows,” and the moonlit shard are tactile and rule‑consistent, and they charge the final image. Environment constrains tactics (breath on water, roots tangling, spirits’ presence) rather than serving as postcard backdrop. Sensory selection is purposeful and filtered through Liora’s vocation. World logic (healing by moonlight) stays consistent and integrated in action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to speak or release—tightens through two decisive attempts at evoked words and culminates in letting the letter go. The spirits’ question crystalizes pressure and forces stance. The cost is present but more conceptual than visceral, keeping the escalation strong but not searing. No coincidence resolves anything; agency drives the turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Themes of silence, forgiveness, and the illusion of healing surface through particulars (condensation messages that vanish, a shard that mends under moonlight). The final image reweights earlier motifs without didactic summary. Two aphoristic lines (“Some letters didn’t need to be sent…”) flirt with overt statement, slightly thinning the mystery. Overall, resonance lingers with honest ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The voice is lyrical yet controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature (“water through lace,” “glass‑smooth water windows”). Distance remains stable; no head‑hopping or unearned omniscience. Rhythm modulates with pressure, especially in the condensation beats. Occasional high‑register aphorisms don’t break the established idiom.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished: images multitask and sentences carry momentum with minimal scaffold. Figurative density is high but coherent and pattern‑taught early, rarely tipping into purple. A couple of near‑summary aphorisms slightly blunt immediacy at the end. Mechanics and syntax are clean with purposeful variation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis—medium who listens for the living, moon‑mending stone, and breath‑written apologies—is fresh and organically interlocked. The condensation device and labyrinthine mangroves feel singular rather than generic. The quiet renunciation lands as non‑obvious yet inevitable. Risk is real but never gimmicky.</comment>
