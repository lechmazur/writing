<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elias’s motives are clear and intensify: a principled archivist pulled into mediumship chooses between bureaucratic erasure and a riskier fidelity to truth. Interiority is concrete (“neutrality was a lie,” “run, or parley”) and embodied through tactile choices (shells, locket, pages in water). The internal contradiction—archiving vs releasing—culminates in a credible renunciation. Minor note: the mediumship’s psychic toll is more implied than felt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hybrid drive with situational pressure dominant: letters → lagoon → Revision Board confrontation → renunciatory release. Closure lands on the page with cost: he surrenders the diary to the lagoon and redefines his practice (“a new ledger… of what had been released”). Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph; single POV and one clean transition. The because/therefore chain holds without unkept set‑ups.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The Eidolon, dunes, and obsidian lagoon are vividly embodied and filtered through Elias’s archivist sensibility. The environment constrains tactics (skiff descent, debris‑code parley) and charges the final image when the diary dissolves into the lagoon. Sensory texture (ozone, old paper, groaning brass) supports tone without stalling movement. World rules stay consistent and enact meaning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve/erase/release truth—tightens when the Revision Board arrives with burn barrels, forcing the parley choice. The debris‑code is a decisive tactic that averts immediate destruction and narrows options to a moral trade‑off. The cost is real though not lethal: loss of the artifact and a redefinition of professional identity. Slightly soft on physical jeopardy, but ethical pressure is strong.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through actions and images: truth as a living current vs institutional erasure, stewardship vs possession. Subtext in “restricted memory” and the ledger motif culminates in a non‑literal answer (release as fidelity). One line edges toward explicit moral (“Some truths weren’t meant to be archived”), trimming mystery. The final quiet cadence earns resonance without sermonizing overall.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A confident, lyrical third‑person closely held to Elias with a distinct perceptual signature (archival lexicon, material attention). Dialogue is spare, charged, and functional; the scarred officer’s line carries subtext. Rhythm modulates under pressure without head‑hopping or register slips. Purposeful elision (visions) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lean, high‑density lines where images do double duty (the brass hull’s groan, ink “shape of screams,” burn barrels as policy). Figurative language is vivid yet coherent; no paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. Momentum holds through description; syntax varies to match scene pressure. A few high‑lyric turns flirt with excess but serve clarity and charge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis—zeppelin library, revisionist state, debris‑code parley, lagoon as mnemonic sink—is fresh and integrated. Turns feel earned from established particulars; the release reconfigures the premise rather than delivering a twist. Risk‑taking in concept and tone heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The piece feels singular, not templated.</comment>
