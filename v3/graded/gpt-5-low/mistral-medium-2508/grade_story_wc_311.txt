<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The reaper’s motive—shaping formless fears by naming them—is clear and character‑specific, rooted in his self‑inflicted hollowness. Micro‑choices under pressure (stepping into dusk light, pressing the fear‑spire into the Leviathan, tucking the atlas into his ribs, choosing not to look back) reveal a consistent value hierarchy. The regret line (“He already did”) adds moral cost without neat absolution. Slight remove and relatively effortless execution of the ritual reduce the felt struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: wax‑recording cues → dusk light mechanism → crystallization → naming → release yields a coherent pattern deepening toward a charged final image. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: he unleashes named monsters and accepts the cost by continuing his road, with the first scream confirming consequences. Orientation is clean early (observatory, recordings, dusk). The causal spine is slender but purposeful, with no late rule cheats.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and functional: the ancient observatory, broken lenses, and scattering dusk directly enable the ritual. The atlas and dome cracks act as micro‑settings/tools that constrain choices and return to charge the final image (atlas in ribs, dome opening to the night). Sensory integration is strong across sight, sound‑as‑vibration, and temperature (“air between his ribs frosted”). World rules stay consistent through action rather than exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—naming fears at the cost of unleashing them—is legible and tightens meaningfully once the Leviathan becomes “seen.” The warning (“You’ll regret this”) and the ensuing release escalate pressure conceptually more than combatively, culminating in the distant scream. Agency drives the turn; he proceeds despite regret. Slight softness remains: the ritual faces minimal on‑page resistance, muting immediate jeopardy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Themes of naming, memory, grief, and sacrifice accrue through concrete images (wax cylinders, echoes, scattered light, crystallized fears) and reprice at the end. “Names were the first step toward sacrifice” reframes the act without moralizing, and the child’s scream seals consequence. The final cadence balances inevitability and indictment without tidy comfort. Subtext about the ethics of making terror legible lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent with a “distant intimacy,” marrying cool observation to charged image. The Leviathan’s single line carries subtext and pressure without expository bloat. Rhythm modulates with the scene’s turns, and focalization remains clean and plausible. No head‑hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished: images earn their keep and often do double duty, with minimal scaffold or redundancy. Figurative density is high but coherent to the world logic (light, ink, echoes, crystalline fear) and rarely muddies sense. A few intensifiers verge on lush, yet momentum holds through sentence variety and precise verbs. Final images land sharply without purple drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis feels fresh: a reaper who names and thereby incarnates fears via scattered light and an atlas of sea monsters is an uncommon, integrated conceit. Turns arise from established rules rather than late gimmicks, and the echo/sacrifice motif gains non‑obvious heft at closure. Risks in lyric mode and mythic logic pay off without obscuring clarity. The piece commits to its moral calculus without hedging.</comment>
