<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Liora’s motives are clear and character‑particular—her dusk‑noticer acuity and research history make the shadow trade feel earned. Interiority is embodied via tactile engagement with the stone (“softly deliberate” resistance) and sensory attention to light. The choice carries cost (a thinned shadow), though contradictory impulses (self‑protection vs. stewardship) could surface one more notch under pressure. Still, the renunciation reads credibly as an extension of her core flaw/gift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: discovery of the stone → archival comparison → recognition → offering the shadow. Closure lands on‑page as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Earned Stasis with cost (“her shadow thin but present”). Orientation is clean and the causal chain is legible without over‑explaining. Minor reliance on summary in the footage section slightly softens immediacy, but doesn’t touch the closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The floating, blooming library is vivid and integrated—books blooming on touch, shelves shifting, clouds parting—and charges the final image (shadow bound to place, not person). The environment functions as sanctuary/constraint, shaping the tactic of binding hope to the library. Sensory detail remains purposeful and POV‑filtered rather than touristic. Strong object‑as‑setting work with the stone amplifies atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving and safely containing an unbound hope—tightens from eerie discovery to a costly exchange. The decisive act is Liora’s: offering her shadow, which forecloses a path and faces possession risk. Pressure escalates coherently through evidence (videos) and the curator’s lie, though an extra beat of urgency could sharpen the squeeze. The price (permanent partial loss) reads on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of custodianship and the endurance of hope emerges through concrete acts rather than sermonizing—the stone, the shadow’s hunger, the binding to place. The final image reweights earlier motifs (“softly deliberate” light, blooming pages) into an answer: hope preserved through shared stewardship and cost. One explicit aphoristic line (“Some hopes were too heavy to carry alone.”) trims a touch of mystery, but the subtext remains strong. Resonance lingers as luminous regret, not tidy moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent with Liora’s perceptual bias; psychic distance is steady. Purposeful elision (archival summaries) fits the mode and pays off in the decision. Brief dialogue is spare and subtextual. Rhythm modulates effectively without head‑hopping or register slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished: strong verbs, selective images, and clean syntax with momentum. Recurring diction (“softly deliberate,” “bloom”) functions as motif rather than padding. Minor repetition and a few near‑parallel lines risk faint echo but do not create loops or figurative muddle. The final cadence is sharp and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Unbound hope as shadow, a river stone as mnemonic vessel, and a cloud‑suspended, light‑blooming library synthesize into a fresh, cohesive vision. The archival footage method and the place‑binding solution feel non‑obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Risks are taken in quiet, lyric mode without obscuring clarity. The emotional calculus is specific and avoids genre templates.</comment>
