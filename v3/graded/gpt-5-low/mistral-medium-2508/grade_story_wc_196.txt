<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elias’s motives are clear and particular—the ache of his own closed file drives a quiet, service-oriented agency. Interiority is textured (the button as “a stubborn insistence on connection”) and actions align with that pain. The internal conflict—professional detachment vs. hunger to salvage stories—registers without grandstanding. Cost is modest but legible in his tremor and the boundary-crossing choice to intervene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: button discovery → research → identification → decision to mail → renewed commitment via new file. Orientation is crisp from the start (who/where/when established), and the single POV/scene flow holds. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he reframes his role from passive archivist to active restorer with a felt price. The stakes are scaled to length and paid off on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The file room is vivid and functional; sensory anchors (sour coffee, dust) are purposeful and POV-filtered. The micro-setting (files, button, desk) guides choices and charges the final image. Occupational detail feels plausible without exposition bloat. The environment doesn’t physically constrain, but it decisively frames the moral and procedural options.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around whether Elias will remain a passive custodian or act to reconnect a severed lineage. The escalation is gentle but real: curiosity to research, then the mail choice that risks overstepping. The visible price is more ethical/emotional than practical, keeping the piece quiet but earned. One meaningful tightening occurs with the research reveal and the irrevocable act of mailing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of salvaging unknown histories emerges through objects and acts rather than lecture; the button’s meaning deepens from trinket to thread. The final note and new file create a resonant, non-literal answer: small acts as continuity against systemic erasure. One line (“small things…how kindness survived”) edges toward telling but remains supported by the scene. Subtext of lineage, luck, and bureaucratic silt lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The voice is steady, observant, and character-specific—controlled lyricism that suits an archivist’s gaze. Diction is consistent and confident; inference stays within what Elias can know. Rhythm modulates well between forensic detail and emotional uptick at the discovery. No head-hopping or stance drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is clean, purposeful, and economical; images (“dust patterns settle like fallen snow”) are apt and not overstacked. Sentences do multiple jobs and maintain propulsion without loops or scaffolding. The closing cadence is precise and earned. No figurative muddle or register slips.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>A foster-care archivist bridging an MIA ancestor through a button is a fresh, human-scaled angle on connection and memory. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight and arise from character rather than gimmick. While not formally radical, the synthesis is memorable and specific. Risk is measured but coherent with the piece’s quiet aims.</comment>
