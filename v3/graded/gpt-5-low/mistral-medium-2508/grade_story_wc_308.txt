<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear, particular interiority anchored in tactile perception (stone thrum, wind/echo reading) and a coherent motive (learn the old way, protect the pulse). The renunciation—becoming an anchor and drawing the Maw—reads as an earned endurance choice. Slight softness: he succeeds with minimal visible struggle, so contradictory impulses (move vs. stillness) feel beautifully framed but lightly contested on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: anomaly → Maw inferred → binding the pulse to stone → charged poise as the Maw passes. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise with conceptual cost (movement as confession; he forecloses motion to survive and restore harmony). Orientation is crisp; the price is present though subtle rather than harrowing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and functional: bone towers and swallowing echoes directly constrain tactics (stillness as survival) and charge the outcome. The arrowhead as micro‑setting/object fuses with place-rules (echo from stone) to shape the final image. Sensory economy is tight and POV‑filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible early (survive/guard the pulse against the Hollow Maw), and escalation coheres: pattern appraisal → anomaly → ritual action that narrows options (he becomes a lure/anchor). The cost is choosing exposure and radical stillness; resolution flows from his agency without coincidence solving the dilemma.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically—listening as power, heritage as practice, stillness reframed as active navigation—and the final reweighting (to be stone/echo) resonates without sermonizing. The “pulse left wandering” returns with altered meaning (“let it wander, then called it home”), deepening the moral calculus of attention vs. intervention. No tidy moral, just charged repose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Consistent, confident lyric voice with a distinct perceptual signature (acoustic/kinesthetic cognition). Rhythm modulates well into the charged ending; diction stays within the world’s idiom. No head‑hopping or stance leakage; purposeful parallelisms work as pattern.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High information density with purposeful repetition; metaphors are coherent to the sound/stone motif. Minor risk of lushness is kept in check by clear causality and momentum (“He was the stone. He was the echo.” lands rather than loops). Clean mechanics and sequencing.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: acoustics-based divination, bone‑architecture ecology, and a predator of “lost pulses” feel singular and necessary. The central tactic (binding a pulse to stone to misdirect hunger) is inventive and inevitable in hindsight. Risks in diction and conceit pay off without obscuring clarity.</comment>
