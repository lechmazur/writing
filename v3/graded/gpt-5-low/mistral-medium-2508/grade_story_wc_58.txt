<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elias’s motive—to render absences legible—drives tactile choices (pressing the thread to his lips, following it, pocketing the locket). Interiority is particular and embodied (salt scents, trembling decrees) rather than generic. Internal contradiction is subtler than ideal (mourner vs. finder), but his renunciation—delaying return of objects and embracing “elsewhere” as an answer—reads earned. The relationship dynamic with the princess is off‑stage yet informs stakes credibly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: motifs and sensory density tighten toward the locket discovery and the decision to reframe the prince’s absence. Closure lands as Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing: Elias commits to telling the princess a non‑binary truth and to boarding the next ship as a “cartographer” of in‑between. Cost is felt but soft (accepting absence, withholding objects briefly); still, the before/after stance is legible. Orientation is clean early; structure holds to one scene.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The garden and harbor are vivid and purpose‑driven: the willow bench yields the locket; autumn’s breath and the bruise‑colored sky charge tone. The thread functions as a tool‑object that constrains choice, effectively acting as compass to the garden’s corner and powering the final image. Detail selection fits Elias’s sensibility and profession. Minor lyricism never slips into postcard excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rendering an absence into direction) is clear; escalation arrives via the thread’s “pull” and the locket discovery. Elias’s agency governs turns (intimate act with the thread; pocketing evidence; resolve to report and to board later). The visible cost is muted—there’s little immediate friction resisting him. Nonetheless, pressure coheres and deepens appropriately for the length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of “explained absences” integrates through objects and choices, culminating in the reweighting: not gone but elsewhere; healing as direction. Some italicized thesis statements (“He left because…”) flirt with overtness, slightly dulling subtext. Recurring images (thread, tide, garden) meaningfully shift at the end. Resonance lingers without neat moral closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice with consistent focalization; sensory choices feel character‑bound and occupationally tuned. Patterned anaphora (“He would…”) is intentional and rhythmic, supporting the closing cadence. No head‑hopping or register slips. The voice modulates from hushed investigation to charged resolve smoothly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentences carry layered work—image, action, and thought—without padding; rhythm varies with purpose. A few aphoristic lines edge toward statement, but most abstractions are grounded by concrete anchors. Figurative language is coherent (thread as compass/heartbeat) and not overstacked in peak moments. No loops or scaffolding artifacts impede momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The premise—obituaries for the living—feels fresh, and the thread/locket apparatus gives the metaphysic tactile stakes. The “cartographer of spaces between” is a surprising, apt reframe that feels earned. Risks in tone and structure pay off without obscuring clarity. Emotional specificity keeps it from becoming a generic elegy.</comment>
