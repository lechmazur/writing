<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The smith’s quiet will and humility read consistently and motivate his descent and barter of the silk. Interiority is shown through tactile choices (inching the silk into the fissure, pressing his palm to stone) rather than explained. However, his internal contradiction is light; he rarely struggles against an opposed impulse on the page. The change lands as sharpened resolve rather than a fraught renunciation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hybrid drive (causal with accumulative lyric pressure) holds: descent → barter → planetary settling → community response. Closure lands with cost: “The silk was gone now,” and the world reconfigures into Earned Stasis/Charged Poise (rebuilding under a new hum). Orientation is clear early (orchards, twin suns, mine shafts), and the throughline remains tight. The single meaningful tightening is sufficient for this length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The orchard planet, twin suns, floating arches, fissure of blue light, and humming silk are vivid and purposeful. Environment and object constrain action (feeding silk into the fissure; arches shudder and realign) and charge the final image (anvil hum). Sensory detail is selective and aligned to the smith’s craft. World rules stay legible through action rather than exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (stabilize/awaken the planet) is clear and escalates coherently through the descent and the act of bartering the silk. The pressure tightens at the fissure with the arches shuddering and the visible cost of surrendering the silk. The resolution derives from his agency and stance (listening, patience). It’s a clean single-turn structure; not many reversals, but the cadence shift is decisive.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: resilience as awakening through listening rather than fixing, with barter replacing conquest. Recurring images (silk, hum, arches, fruit) reweight at the end, inviting reflection on stewardship and humility. One line flirts with platitude/echo (“cracks not as wounds, but as places where the light got in”), slightly softening the edge. Overall resonance is strong without sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The lyric third-person voice is controlled, image-driven, and consistent with a modest, attentive focalizer. Minimal dialogue is natural and charged with subtext (“You don’t mend…you wake”). Rhythm modulates well between tight action and broader atmospheric lines. No head-hopping or stance leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is clean, economical, and musical; images perform multiple jobs (world, mood, theme). Minor purple notes and a familiar aphoristic echo slightly dull peak freshness, but clarity and momentum hold. Sentence variety and paragraph rhythm support propulsion without scaffold. No loops or muddled metaphors interfere with closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—blacksmith bartering enchanted silk to stitch tremors on an orchard planet—feels fresh and specific. The “listening” mechanic and the hum carried into the forge reframe magic with tactile craft. A couple of familiar turns of phrase prevent a leap into the rare tier, but the vision is unified and memorable. Risks in tone and worldbuilding pay off without obscuring coherence.</comment>
