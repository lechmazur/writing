<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motives and contradictions are precise: a sleepless artist steadies himself through ritual, chasing proof that kindness endures. Micro‑choices (hovering over the glyph meaning “to rouse/forgive,” choosing to inscribe the child’s laughter, finally writing “dawn”) reveal values under pressure. Embodied details—lapis, jasmine, the brush’s memory—keep emotion grounded. Slightly insulated from overt jeopardy, but the endurance and relinquishment to sleep feel earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern builds (moon/brush/leaf/script) toward a resonant reconfiguration when he sleeps and the world subtly shifts. Orientation is clean within the opening: who, where, when are clear. Closure carries cost on the page—the leaf is gone, the brush is worn, and sleep breaks the 43‑night vigil. The because/therefore is soft but sufficient under the chosen lens: laughter → inscribing → shimmer → tide of sleep.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The rooftop greenhouse, smog, and waxing moon are tactile and integrated, not decor. Environment and object-as-setting (the brush) constrain and charge choices, especially the “dawn” written where the leaf had been. Sensory range is rich (scent of “rain that would never fall,” jasmine, damp paper), and the world’s rules stay consistent. The final image is inseparable from place and tool.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake is internal/communal: can language and kindness survive exile and smog. Escalation arrives via the child’s laughter and the fig’s response, prompting the key choice to write the laughter and accept sleep. Prices are modest but felt (worn brush, vanished leaf, relinquishing vigil). Pressure is quiet and coherent for the mode, if not harrowing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme—kindness remembered across strangers and languages—emerges through concrete acts and returns without moralizing. The “to rouse/forgive” ambiguity deepens the social and personal stakes. The ending reweights earlier images (moon, brush, fig, strangers) into a communal awakening. Resonance lingers as a concept and a felt scene.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature (ink like twilight, moon as a coin). POV remains steady, inference stays within what he can know, and italics memory is cleanly integrated. Rhythm modulates well at the sleep turn. No head‑hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is elegant and economical; images carry multiple jobs without sludge. Figurative language is frequent but coherent and pattern‑taught, avoiding mixed metaphors. No evident loops or scaffolding; the cadence supports the accumulative push to closure. A few lush lines flirt with excess but never blur sense.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Painting lost language on living leaves with a moon‑tipped brush in a smog‑choked city is a fresh synthesis. The calligrapher’s one‑time kindness and the child’s laughter convert into a tangible world shift, not a platitude. Risks (quiet stakes, lyric structure) pay off with clarity and specificity. The final “dawn” inscription feels inevitable and new.</comment>
