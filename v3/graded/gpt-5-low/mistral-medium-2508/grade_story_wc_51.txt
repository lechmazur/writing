<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elira’s motive (to offload others’ burdens before they dissolve her) is concrete and intensifies under pressure. Embodied interiority is vivid—“weaving their shapes into the hollows of her ribs” and the trembling at the grotto’s pushback. The surrender to being “the loom” reads as a credible renunciation with felt cost. A hair more on her ambivalence before yielding would deepen the contradiction at the peak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: match → orientation → calcifications → grotto’s counterpressure → realization → surrender. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing with cost—she becomes part of the grotto’s hush; the villagers’ shard confirms the price. Beats link cleanly and escalate without outline-y “and then” sequencing. The method’s mechanics (flame aligned to fissures) keep causality legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The bronze grotto and lamp burner function as micro‑settings that constrain tactics (alignment to fissures) and charge the final image. Sensory detail is purposeful across registers—hum, soot, needlework starlight—filtered through Elira’s craft. The environment actively presses back, shaping choice and consequence. Economy and specificity avoid postcard description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: purge burdens without self‑erasure. Tightening arrives when the grotto “wants to give back,” foreclosing the simple purge and forcing a trade (selfhood for release). The lingering child’s fear precedes the larger reversal, layering pressure credibly. Cost is unmistakable though a brief hesitation before surrender could sharpen the crucible.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: burden, memory, and agency reweighted from “weaver” to “loom.” Recurring images (hush, lamp, song) evolve meaningfully; the final hush‑as‑cradle reframes entrapment without moralizing. The villagers’ echo adds resonance and social cost. No platitudes—insight is earned in scene.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is steady and confident; lyric diction remains coherent to Elira’s perceptual signature. Rhythmic control under stress (shorter pulses around calcification, widening cadence at surrender) is deft. Dialogue is minimal and apt, with subtext in the single line to the child’s fear. No head‑hopping or register slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is high‑density yet clean; images feel original and consistent (“shingled hush,” “whalebone harp”) without muddle. Momentum holds—no paraphrase loops or scaffold. Figurative saturation never obscures causality, and sentence rhythm varies to match pressure. A couple of stacked modifiers flirt with purple but stay controlled.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—bronze grotto, lamp orientation, burden‑calcification, loom vs. weaver—feels singular and inevitable in hindsight. Risks in lyric mode and conceptual closure pay off without obscuring clarity. Tropes are transformed through tactile specificity and a non‑obvious moral calculus. Memorable images and turns elevate beyond template.</comment>
