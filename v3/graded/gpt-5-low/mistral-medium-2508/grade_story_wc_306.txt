<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elias’s vocation and flaw (“conscience for hire,” “sincerely insincere”) generate a credible internal bind that drives concrete choices—most powerfully in the tactile unhooking of the cloak’s knots. Interiority is embodied and specific (wind chime lexicon, oil and wicks, the shard’s whispers), and the renunciation of certainty exacts a felt cost. The arrival of the woman reframes his isolation without granting an easy cure. A few explicit self‑summations slightly dull the rawness of the turn.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive holds: shard → chimes → cloak → dawn → revised beam culminates in a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis closure that reconfigures his role. Cost is legible on the page (he stops polishing, lets the beam waver, risks purpose/ships). Orientation is clear early and the design teaches its lyric pattern cleanly. Minor direct statements risk over-explaining the final repricing but do not break closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The lighthouse, wind, chimes, and sea are not postcard décor; they constrain perception, tactics, and the final signal (the beam’s pulse, the shard hung on the rail). Sensory specificity is selective and character‑filtered through occupational habit. World rules stay coherent and charge the last image. A hair of overt symbolism peeks through but remains integrated.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to preserve certainty or embrace uncertainty—tightens through the shard’s indictment and the chimes’ “Change” till he renounces his old function (cloak unraveled, polishing refused). The unhooking serves as a concrete pressure test with visible price. Internal and external stakes briefly braid when he retunes the beam’s purpose. Slight softness in external consequence keeps it just shy of the top band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Images accrue toward a resonant thematic answer—light as learning the dark’s shape rather than banishment; the cloak re‑quilted as weighted questions. Subtext largely carries meaning through action and motif. A few lines verge on thesis statements (“Here, there is room for uncertainty,” “This is how light begins…”), blunting mystery at the edge. Despite that, the repricing feels earned and lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyrical voice with clean focalization; diction and rhythm modulate with pressure. Dialogue is minimal but purposeful, carrying subtext at the end without over‑explanation. One phrase edges into register drift/jargon (“protected vulnerability”), slightly scuffing the otherwise organic idiom. Overall, the voice feels individual and self‑consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Line work is vivid, economical, and often does double duty; metaphors mostly cohere and propel. The motif lattice (chimes/shard/cloak/beam) is handled with restraint and clarity. A late on‑the‑nose lexical choice (“protected vulnerability”) and a couple of direct statements trim the edge off the lyric charge. Rhythm and syntax otherwise carry momentum cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The premise—hiring out a conscience, a hollow mirror that listens, wind‑chime divination—feels fresh and organically synthesized. The reweighting of a lighthouse’s function is non‑obvious yet inevitable in hindsight given the setup. Risks in lyric compression and object‑driven structure pay off. Minor conventional phrasings keep it from the rarest air.</comment>
