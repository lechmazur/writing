<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Veyra’s drive to inquire is specific and embodied, with tactile choices (pressing the cameo to her temple, stepping into the orchard, selecting “neither document nor destroy”). Interiority is crisp and character‑particular (“bathroom—where the acoustics were best for thinking”). The internal contradiction—hunger versus the warned danger—is present but lightly contested; she rarely hesitates. The ending stance (curate via restraint) reads earned, though the felt cost could be sharpened.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Hybrid with an accumulative dominant: images and discoveries intensify toward a conceptual repricing (the orchard as library; the cameo as membership), culminating in a stance crystallization. Beats link coherently (note → bathroom inquiry → mirror warning → orchard visions → “Simply/Complicated” → door → recursive return). Closure lands with the catalog entry and pass‑it‑on note, though cost is more conceptual than visceral. Orientation is clean early and stays stable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The astral orchard and the cameo are vivid, sensorial, and integral; environment and object constrain choices (the orchard as library; petal instructions; door between trees). Details are filtered through Veyra’s priorities, avoiding tourist cataloging. The final images (catalog entry, pistachio shell etched with her face) are charged by setting logic. Minor room remains to show environment imposing a harder tactical limit.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around “to inquire or not, and how,” with a meaningful tightening when the mirror warns and the orchard presents divergent prior curator paths. The blossom‑to‑instruction and “Simply/Complicated” reversals reweight options without gimmickry. The cost is mostly conceptual (choosing a bounded, non‑totalizing engagement) rather than a concrete loss, tempering intensity. Nonetheless, agency drives resolution with a credible renunciation of extremes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: nonlinear inheritance as resonance, the ethics of knowledge (protected vs. forbidden), and curatorship as restraint. The “membership card” insight, the engraved “Simply/Complicated,” and the handoff note embody a complex stance without moralizing. The final catalog line reframes the key as a test of self‑limitation. Ambiguity lingers productively (danger persists; the museum may yet burn), deepening resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A distinct, confident lyric voice with controlled modulation: bright, curious, edged by static and warning. POV remains tight; the mirror “reply” reads as diegetic strangeness rather than head‑hopping. Dialogue snippets carry subtext and pressure. Diction is consistent with a precise, slightly wry curator’s sensibility.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lines are clean, image‑dense, and purposeful with minimal scaffold; rhythm varies well. Figurative language is fresh and coherent (“objects that remembered how to be held”) without muddling sense. No noticeable loops or cadence templates; momentum stays taut. A touch more sentence‑level austerity at the peak might heighten impact, but craft is strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis—astral orchard as library, cameo as resonance key, institutional cataloging recast as ethical curation—is fresh and memorable. Risks (mirror voice, palimpsest graffiti, recursive return) land cleanly and serve closure. While adjacent to genre traditions, this execution feels singular and thematically integrated. The pistachio motif’s return with her face etched clinches specificity.</comment>
