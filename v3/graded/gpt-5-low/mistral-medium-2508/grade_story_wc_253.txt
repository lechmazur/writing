<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lena’s motives are clear and particular: resisting the residual “hush” while relearning honest feeling. Contradictory impulses—habitual stillness vs. desire to release—culminate in the raw scream, with Harkin as foil sharpening her choices. Embodied detail (whittling, bouquet, tin) keeps emotion grounded. The change is modest but felt, foreclosing the path of performative coping.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: turbines, hush, bouquet, and tin build to the eruptive scream and the quiet reconfiguration after. Closure lands on the page via a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis/Charged Poise): she screams, then chooses ongoing practice (teaching whittling) with cost in vulnerability. Orientation is clean from the outset. Persistent constraints (post‑Mandate hush, turbines swallowing sound) shape the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The turbines and farmhouse are vividly realized and character‑filtered; details are purposeful (radio silence, groaning house, rusted tin). Environment charges choices: turbines “swallow” the scream and the overshadowing presence refracts grief. Recurring objects (bouquet, tin) function as micro‑setting that constrain tone and action. The final image is inseparable from place.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reclaiming authentic expression vs. learned stillness—is announced early and tightens through Harkin’s arrival and the scream decision. The scream is a credible escalation, with cost in breaking the communal hush and self‑exposure. Subsequent choices (burning the tin, teaching whittling) lock in the stance. Quiet, but the pressure coheres and deepens rather than loops.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through image and action: imposed joy vs. earned lightness; the danger of “preserving grief” until it loses shape. Subtext in dialogue (“Still breathing?”/“I’m going to scream”) avoids sermonizing; the bouquet’s scentlessness reweights the premise. Final acts reprice the hush as choice, not absence. A single explicit thesis line edges toward direct statement but remains earned by scene work.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyric third‑person with a distinct perceptual signature, modulating cleanly at the peak. Dialogue is spare, natural, and subtextual, marking status and intimacy without exposition. Diction and rhythm suit Lena’s mind and the piece’s restraint. No head‑hopping or stance leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is tight, image‑dense, and mostly indispensable; metaphors (turbines as indifferent gods; silence sliced) cohere and propel mood. Varied sentence rhythm and paragraphing sustain momentum. Minimal scaffolding and no paraphrase loops; the lyricism never muddies causality. A few high‑lyric lines flirt with overrichness but stay controlled.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: a post‑mandate world of enforced happiness meets rural turbines and tactile grief labor. The non‑performed scream is a non‑obvious, truthful turn. Recurring objects are used with specificity rather than tokenism. Risks in quiet design pay off without obscuring clarity.</comment>
