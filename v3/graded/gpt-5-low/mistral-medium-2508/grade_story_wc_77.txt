<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and pressured: reclaiming self by “unbosoming” the double while weaponizing fear. Contradictory impulses land in-scene (“I’m not here to fight” as tactical lie). Emotions are embodied through tactile objects (raven clasp, filmstrip heart), though interior cost remains more conceptual than visceral. Slight mythic competence smooths struggle, but choices track.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: instructions → entry/absorption → confrontation → through‑lunge → extraction → reweighted final image. Closure lands on the page with cost: the double dissolves, the clasp “now held a new kind of hunger,” and the curse persists. Hybrid lens with causal spine and lyric accumulation holds; no orientation debt. The final photo image confirms a before/after without over‑explaining.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Vivid, sense‑charged funhouse that constrains tactics (absorbing mirror, oil‑rippling surface) and evolves (mirrors weeping silver). The opera clasp functions as micro‑setting/prop charging the end. Details (“burnt sugar and copper pennies,” spiral hall of cursed likenesses) are purposeful and POV‑filtered. Environment shapes action and charges the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible early and tightens through a decisive tactic shift (not at but through). Reversal is earned by the dream‑dictionary rule and the lie. Cost is mostly conceptual (lingering curse, hungry clasp) rather than bodily, keeping it high‑level but felt. Pressure remains coherent to the end without coincidence bailout.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fear’s reframing emerges through images (filmstrip heart, false flashlight) and tactics, culminating in the “bed” repricing. A few aphoristic statements (advisor lines) flirt with didacticism but are integrated by action and object work. The final image reweights prior motifs without moralizing. Resonance is strong if slightly declarative at moments.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct, controlled lyric voice with consistent focalization and clean dialogue that carries subtext (“armed with a whisper”). Rhythm shifts aptly under pressure; metaphoric texture is purposeful and character‑bound. No head‑hopping or stance leakage. A few flourishy lines skate close to performative, but cadence remains disciplined.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High information density and image precision with minimal scaffold or loops; verbs do the work. Figurative language is frequent but largely coherent and scene‑bound (“hand that thinks it’s holding the flashlight”). One or two clever lines risk purple (“fear…was the bed itself”), but they’re paid off by action. Momentum stays taut through the climax and charged denouement.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: photographic curse as ontology, filmstrip heart extraction, and funhouse as lunging, silver‑weeping organism. Doppelgänger trope is transformed by tactile cinema logic and a prop‑charged ending. Risks (lyric density, aphoristic advisor) mostly heighten rather than obscure. The final photo/“Next” tag feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
