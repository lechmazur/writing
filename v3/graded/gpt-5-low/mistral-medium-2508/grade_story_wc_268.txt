<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Veythas’s restraint, longevity, and loyalty to Lirien ground a clear motive, and the sacrifice of her name adds precise cost. The three‑centuries delay sets a credible contradiction he finally resolves. Interiority stays character‑specific (“the sound like shifting sand”) rather than generic. Minor limitation: the internal tug between duty and friendship could surface one more beat before the naming.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Clean causal flow: messages → recognition of the rune → required sacrifice → sundered scepter → pretender dislodged. Closure lands on the page with a felt price (speaking Lirien’s name as sacrifice) and a decisive change in world order. The library’s shudder and the scepter’s crack make cost concrete. Lens reads Hybrid with a causal backbone, held through the ending inscription.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The temple library’s time‑folded rules and the basalt scepter constrain choices and charge the final image. Specifics (oculus, constellations pausing, dragonhide, iron gall) are purpose‑driven and filtered through Veythas. Environment evolves with events (shudder, splinter, stars restarting) and materially enables the act. No postcard excess; every detail earns its keep.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (end the lie/pretender) is clear and tightens meaningfully when the act demands Lirien’s name. The sunder is a true narrowing with visible cost; the subsequent encounter with the relieved pretender deepens consequence rather than deflating it. Pressure is coherent though mostly internal; one more on‑page hesitation could have sharpened the squeeze.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Truth versus curated illusion, time’s drift, and the mercy of endings cohere without moralizing. The final inscription reweights prior motifs into a resonant answer (“Here the lie ended. Here the drift was still.”). The pretender’s relief adds subtext about complicity and burden. Slightly on‑the‑nose phrasing in that final couplet is balanced by strong image work.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The voice is assured, tactile, and consistent with a stone‑wrought, time‑weathered perspective. Lyric compression is controlled and legible; no head‑hopping. The single spoken line carries subtext and doesn’t puncture tone. A hair more rhythmic variation at the peak could further heighten stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High information density with vivid, economical figurative choices (“frayed like the hem of a god’s discarded robe”). No paraphrase loops or scaffolding bloat; syntax breathes with the turn. A few stacked images flirt with purple but stay coherent and purposeful. Final lines close with image rather than summary.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The diminutive titan, rune‑drift mechanics, and star‑timed messages synthesize into a fresh, specific mythic frame. The sunder-as-truth act and the pretender’s relief avoid cliché triumph and deliver a graceful, elegiac finish. Risks are measured and integrated; nothing reads like a template reskin. Not radically experimental, but distinctly its own.</comment>
