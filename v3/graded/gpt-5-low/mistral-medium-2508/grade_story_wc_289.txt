<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Liora’s vocation and ambivalence (“It’s not mine to give”) create a credible internal conflict that culminates in surrendering not only a client’s remnant but her own. Interiority is sensorial and particular rather than generic. The cost remains mostly internal and gentle, with limited friction beyond the moment’s lyric consent. Still, the second spiral choice markedly reveals values under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: present‑tense choices accrete toward a Conceptual Repricing at the end (secrets as rejoining rather than hoarding). Orientation is clear, scene-to-shard cohesion is strong, and the dream image reconfigures the premise without breaking logic. Cost (relinquishing private drafts) is legible, if subtle. No causality slips; one meaningful tightening occurs with the second spiral.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The lotus temple, floating walkway, and glass-orb installation are vividly rendered and integrated into action. The environment meaningfully enables and charges the choices (public art as the vehicle for surrender). Sensory specificity (wet wood, crushed petals, rippling pond) sustains atmosphere without excess. The final images (prism/orbs, twig) are spatially and texturally grounded.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes are quiet but coherent: whether to keep or rejoin secrets. Pressure deepens when Liora escalates from offering a client‑linked relic to her own unsent letter, narrowing her option to remain a pure keeper. The price is internal and understated, yet discernible in the relinquishment. No antagonist is needed; agency drives the turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through objects and acts—rejoining secrets via art, writing into the “space between the words,” the thread imagery—rather than abstraction alone. A few direct statements (monk’s line; “some secrets were never meant to be kept”) approach thesis‑speak but are cushioned by concrete images. The final twig and thread realization reweight prior material without neat moralizing. Resonance lingers more as hush than verdict.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The close third’s lyric register remains consistent; diction suits Liora’s sensibility. Dialogue is spare, subtextual, and functions as action. Rhythm modulates well between image and decision, with no head‑hopping or stance drift. The dream sequence reads as an intentional extension of voice rather than a POV slip.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Line craft is clean, image‑driven, and mostly economical; metaphors cohere (prism, thread, ripple) without muddle. Minor overtness in a couple thematic lines and a touch of repetition (“secrets…rejoined”) slightly soften momentum. Syntax varies, paragraphing breathes with the scene. The last images land crisply.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Ghostwriter of love letters + public installation of secrets in a lotus temple is a fresh synthesis executed with integrity. The thrush/spiral/orb motif yields non‑obvious turns and a fitting closure image. Risks are aesthetic rather than structural and mostly pay off. The piece avoids gimmickry while offering a memorable conceptual frame.</comment>
