<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Qishti’s frugal habits and empiricist temperament are dramatized through specific micro‑choices (counting tiles, returning at dusk, tracing lines), not labels. His internal tension (numbers vs. faith) is active at the threshold—“a covenant offered to the unknown”—and he pays a price (surrendering the tile, bearing marks). Interiority is concrete and character‑particular. A touch more embodied fear or physical jeopardy under the overseers would intensify the crucible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, each beat coheres: discovery → decoding → application → descent → altar → reconfiguration on the page. Orientation is clear from the outset, and the closure is a conceptual repricing with a felt cost (relinquishing the tile; accepting a devotional frame). Because/therefore linkages are clean without mechanical over‑explaining. The external regime pressure remains backgrounded, keeping the cost more conceptual than perilous.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The palace’s cracked mosaics, braziers, and ziggurat dawn are vivid and POV‑filtered; the desert’s “breath” and the warm tile sharpen tactility. Setting/tool integration is excellent: the tile and architecture literally constrain and enable choices, and the final image is charged by that environment. World rules stay consistent and are learned through action. Sensory detail is purposeful rather than touristic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding vs. risk/faith—is clear and tightens at the pillar and at the altar. The decisive deepening stems from Qishti’s agency: pressing the tile, stepping into the passage, and placing it on the altar foreclose alternatives. The cost is present but relatively gentle (conceptual shift, loss of the tile, latent danger), as overseer pressure doesn’t test him on the page. A single beat of direct jeopardy could have sharpened escalation further.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Themes of measurement, devotion, and dialogue with the unknown emerge organically from the tile/cipher and the altar’s inscription; the final repricing (“some devotions are too vast for numbers”) resonates with his lifelong methods. Subtext runs through images (stars as living eyes, marks on his hands) rather than mere thesis. One line—“the universe was not a cold machine, but a dialogue”—edges toward explicit statement. Overall, the ending reweights prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third‑person close voice with a distinct perceptual signature (scholar’s precision threaded with awe) holds steady. Diction and rhythm modulate effectively from stealth to revelation without head‑hopping. The prose remains within the character’s plausible lexicon for a timeless‑mythic register. No elision tricks are abused or underpaid.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies with scene needs; lines carry multiple jobs (world, mood, and action). Figurative language is frequent but coherent and purposeful; metaphors (fruit/seed, stars as eyes) reinforce the cosmology without muddling logic. Minimal scaffolding and no paraphrase loops. A hair’s breadth from purple at moments, but clarity and propulsion hold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—Babylonian palace, an astronomer decoding a devotional schematic, and a covenant that redefines empiricism—feels specific and earned. Familiar elements (secret passage, altar) are refreshed by the “measurement as devotion” frame and the final marks on the body. The piece takes quiet risks in committing to a conceptual closure over spectacle. Not utterly unprecedented, but memorable in its integration and restraint.</comment>
