<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation is vivid and consistent: she loves the garden and chooses demonstration over argument, revealing character under pressure. The admission “It was a mended deception” lends flaw and complexity without neat absolution. Micro‑choices (polishing, building the shrine, leading the elders to the center) show a hierarchy of values. Internal contradiction is present but quiet; the emotional cost is more conceptual than visceral.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Situational lens: the elders’ audit creates coherent pressure; her response is to stage a proof that reframes value. Closure is on the page: the elders return “with empty hands and fuller hearts,” a decisive social shift. Cost registers as reputational risk and the visible trampling of shoots, though consequences remain gentle. Orientation is clear early; single scene holds tight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The garden maze and marbles operate as charged environment/objects that shape movement and the final image. Specifics like roses blooming where she wept and ivy spelling her name integrate setting with character. The center of the maze constrains staging and enables the reveal. World rules (luck measurable) are shown through behavior rather than exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (quantification vs wonder; her standing with the elders) is clear and tightens when the audit declares “deficient.” Her strategic choice to show, not argue, creates the meaningful turn. The price is understated; stakes resolve without a sharp wound or trade‑off, moderating intensity. Tension is steady rather than wrenching.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme coheres: immeasurable value, care as resistance to metrics, small victories. The marbles’ reweighted meaning at the end lands. One explicit thesis line (“Some things aren’t meant to be measured”) edges toward moralizing but doesn’t eclipse the images. The piece invites reflection through image more than debate.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Consistent, lyrical close third with a distinct perceptual signature—tactile attention to vines, roots, and glass. Dialogue is minimal, natural, and functions as action. Rhythm and diction modulate well from quiet ritual to soft confrontation. No POV leakage or untaught elision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished: strong verbs, purposeful motifs, and high information density. Refrains (“The garden knew its gardener”) earn their echo. Figurative language is controlled and coherent to the premise. Minimal redundancy; momentum holds through lyric passages.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The measurable‑luck society and the marbles as “stolen luck” reframed into mending feel fresh. The gardener’s quiet tactic offers a non‑obvious turn. While the arc (softening authority via demonstration) is familiar, the synthesis of imagery and ruleset is distinct. Risk is lyrical and thematic rather than structural, and it pays off.</comment>
