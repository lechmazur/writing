<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Liora’s motive—to understand why some houses feel alive—drives concrete micro‑choices (placing the shard, arranging objects, pressing the key, finally leaving the shard). Interiority is sensorial and particular, not generic. The renunciation at the end carries a modest but legible cost. Internal contradiction is light (curiosity vs. restraint) and could be sharper under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure builds through ritualized acts and sensory density to a resonant reconfiguration and renunciation. Orientation is clear early (bay, dock, spring evening) and the closure lands on the page (“She left the shard…” and “She was carrying it with her”). Cost is present and coherent with the premise. Minor note: the causal scaffolding is intentionally soft, but the cadence shift is decisive.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The bay, dock, streetlights, and displaced objects are vivid and purpose‑driven; the environment supplies the very means of the ritual and charges the final image. The teacup’s light and the bay’s “sigh” tie setting to turning points. World rules (hush as substratum) are learned through action. This setting is inseparable from the piece’s effect.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes are focused (seeking the hush’s truth) and escalate via a density increase: arrangement → voice → flicker → door click → renunciation. The choice to leave the shard forecloses a path (keeping power/ownership) and reweights meaning. Pressure is more internal than external, yet it coheres and tightens once. A sharper felt price on the page could elevate.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: silence as a living substratum, houses that “learn to listen,” and the shard as a key to meaning rather than possession. The ending offers a resonant answer—listening over ownership—without sermonizing, though “She understood now” edges toward stated thesis. The final carry (“in the way her steps fell softer”) sustains subtext. Complexity lingers without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third‑person with a distinct perceptual signature; rhythm and diction suit the hush. The single whispered line adds texture without breaking stance. Patterned phrasing (“She had…”) reads intentional and supports tone. No head‑hopping or register slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sentence‑level craft is precise and musical; imagery is fresh and coherent (“cup holds light,” “streetlights daydream”). Figurative density is high but seldom purple or redundant; momentum holds through the ritual. Minor repetition and familiar cadences appear but do not dull the closure. Final lines land cleanly without scaffolding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The “shard of hush” and displaced‑object ritual feel original and integrated, transforming familiar coastal lyricism. The realization—houses alive by learned listening—reframes the world with specificity. Risks are aesthetic rather than structural and pay off in tone and closure. A slightly deeper antagonistic pressure could push it into rarer territory.</comment>
