<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The widow’s motive—to “contain him” through carving—tracks cleanly to the final renunciation of selling and the acceptance of impermanence. Interiority is concrete and embodied (grain, blade, ache), with a credible contradiction between holding on and learning to let go. The choice to keep the mid-leap lion is earned and carries cost (foregone income, surrender of the “containment” illusion). Minor note: she rarely faces a live interpersonal pressure on the page, keeping the crucible mostly internal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive holds: ritual work, market exchange, dream, and morning culminate in the charged decision to keep one carving. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: she reframes the act from containing to letting pass, with the lion kept as lesson. Orientation is clear early (loft, kettle, routine), and the final image pays off seeded motifs (rain, skylight, knife, kettle). The cost is legible in the refusal to sell and the acceptance of what cannot be held.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is tactile and purposeful: ash wood, knife, damp cedar, rain-beaded skylight. The skylight’s light literally “paints” stripes on the final lion, charging the last image and embodying “here and gone.” Tools and environment shape action and tone without postcard excess. Micro-setting details (kettle, ladder, windowsill) consistently guide the beats.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Pressure coheres as a quiet internal contest: contain vs. release. The meaningful tightening arrives with the girl’s question and the dream, which nudge the final choice to keep the mid-leap lion. Stakes (how to live with loss) are felt, with a visible price in the refusal to sell and the relinquishment of containment. It’s subtle rather than sharp, but the cadence shift is decisive for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of impermanence emerges from particulars: carvings that seem to step out of wood, the kettle’s heat and cooling, rain’s brief prisms. Subtext works through image and restraint; the widow’s non-weeping carries weight. A touch of explicitness (“Not as a ghost, but as a lesson…”) edges toward telling but largely resonates due to the concrete final placement on the windowsill. The aftereffect is quiet and haunting without sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Consistent, lyrical third-person close with a distinct perceptual signature (craft, scent, texture). Rhythm modulates effectively from work-cadence to dream to the stillness of the ending. Dialogue (with the girl) is brief, natural, and subtextual, advancing the core question. No head-hopping or stance drift; certainty stays within what the focalizer can know.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is clean, sonorous, and economical; figurative language is controlled and grounded in craft materials and weather. Minimal scaffolding; sentences do multiple jobs (setting, emotion, theme) without redundancy. A few elevated phrases risk purple but remain coherent within the taught lyric mode. The closing image is crisp and uncluttered.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The widow-of-a-lion-tamer carving lions to metabolize grief feels specific and fresh, with the skylight/rain motif elevating. The mid-leap lion and the refusal to sell avoid cliché by tying action to tactile process. The risk is quiet (accumulative structure, near-lyric), and it pays off with an image that reweights the premise. Not radical formally, but distinctly voiced and memorable.</comment>
