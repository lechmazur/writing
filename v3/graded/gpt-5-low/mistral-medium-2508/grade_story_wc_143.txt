<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear, particular motive—bear witness and “outlast” via images—drives every choice, with tactile interiority (the hourglass grain, the breath on the visor). The internal conflict is quiet rather than oppositional; he’s resolute, which trims complexity. Micro-choices (timed canister, when to shoot, not looking back) reveal values with a felt cost. Strong, if a touch low on contradictory impulses under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the pulses, clicks, dawn edge, and growing drone hum accrue toward a charged final stance. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise—he chooses witness over resistance—paid in the acceptance that the crater will be gone. Orientation is immediate; the ticking three-hour window and interval glows give structure and cost. The last image (Earth rising, his shadow) reweights the whole with on-page price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lunar environment is vivid and functional: regolith, silence, oxygen mask, Earth on the horizon—details are selective and POV-filtered. Setting pressures action through time-of-dawn angles, vacuum hush, and the mining schedule; the camera and canister operate as micro-settings that charge the ending. Minor plausibility fuzz around “bioluminescent gas” in vacuum, but it reads as stylized rather than rule-breaking. Atmosphere and place are tightly woven to the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve what machines will erase—tightens via the timed pulses and audible approach of drones. The escalation is quiet but real; dawn’s “knife-edge” and the third glow tie his endurance to a clock, narrowing options to witness or flee. The cost is acceptance rather than confrontation, earned by the design of the canister as a message against inevitability. A strong deepening without a major reversal suits the piece’s chosen lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Time, loss, and witness cohere through the hourglass grain and the canister’s measured pulses; the final “I was here. I saw.” crystallizes the thesis without didacticism. A line or two leans close to statement (“Men of the space age didn’t cry”), but the images do the heavy lifting. The ending reweights the premise—memory vs extraction—with conceptual cost. Resonance lingers in the hourglass motif reprised as era-marker.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Consistent, lyrical close-third voice with a distinct perceptual signature (“ghosts of light,” “universe clearing its throat”). Rhythm modulates with pressure via clipped beats (clicks, pulses) and longer, reflective lines at dawn. No head-hopping or stance wobble; inference stays within what Elias can perceive. Slight recurrence of sentence stems, but it reads intentional and musical here.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Line-level craft is controlled and economical; most sentences carry dual duty (image + theme). A few familiar metaphors surface, yet none blur sense or stall momentum; the prose breathes around the pulse beats. Syntax varies enough to avoid drumbeat monotony, and the closing image is clean. Minor purple edges are reined in by clear sequencing and strong verbs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: a crater inspector staging time-coded luminescent messages to outlast mining reframes the familiar “last witness” trope. The hourglass grain as stolen talisman is a deft, specific thread. While the melancholy moonfarewell is a known register, the execution feels singular and precise. Not radical, but confidently original in detail and closure logic.</comment>
