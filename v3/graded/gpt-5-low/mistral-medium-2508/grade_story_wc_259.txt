<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear motive (purify the past without repeating doom) and a credible inner tension (hunger for knowledge vs. refusal to reenact patterns) drive her choices. Embodied markers—dust, hum, the counterclockwise “unmaking”—anchor emotion without therapy-speak. The recoil at seeing an older self offers a brief, real wobble before recommitment. The arc from seeking answers to seeking “the silence between them” earns the renunciatory ending, though the struggle resolves a touch smoothly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single-scene accumulative build coheres: entering, testing the pagoda, choosing “unmaking,” and accepting dissolution. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing with cost—the pagoda becomes light, the veil fades, the archive seals, and she exits altered. Orientation is clean early and the method taught by the mentor binds tactics to outcome. A small declarative leap (“The civilization had not fallen…”) is justified by the decode moment but trims a hair of on-page inference.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid and integral: the cracked dome, twilight rust, and the humming bronze object guide choice and charge the final image. The pagoda functions as micro-setting/tool, constraining tactics and defining the climax. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered, balancing lyric image with tactile action. The archive’s sealing and the faded veil tether setting to consequence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—engage the archive without repeating the fatal pattern—tightens through the decision to turn counterclockwise and let disorder “spill.” Pressure escalates from hum to scream to dissolution with an internal trade-off (knowing vs. letting go). The price is felt in the relinquishment of the object and the veil’s fading. Stakes trend internal but remain coherent and legible under the textural lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Themes of knowledge as poison/cure and purification through relinquishment accrue through concrete beats and recur in charged images (veil, pagoda, twilight). The italicized aphorisms (“To know is to resist repetition,” “To purify is to let go”) skirt overt statement but are mostly earned by action. The final acceptance—following a scent rather than a proof—reweights meaning without neat moralizing. Slight explicitness tempers the afterglow.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A singular, controlled lyric voice with consistent distance and confident image-making; no head-hopping or register slips. Rhythm modulates well from hush to crescendo to quiet release. Diction (“atoms of nostalgia,” “motion of unmaking”) fits the world and the mind at hand. Purposeful elision remains legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lines carry high information density with minimal scaffold; images do multiple jobs without muddle. Metaphor is largely coherent and purposeful, and sentence rhythm varies with pressure. A few high-register phrases verge on purple but do not blur causality or the closure image. No loops or template cadences dull momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The archive-as-wound and vibration-record premise, paired with a method of “avoiding patterns,” feels freshly synthesized. Familiar forbidden-knowledge tropes are transformed by concrete, idiosyncratic choices (counterclockwise unmaking, veil as psychic armor, the light-crumble). The ending’s conceptual repricing reads inevitable in hindsight. Boldness is high without obscuring clarity.</comment>
