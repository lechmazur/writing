<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias’s obsession, reticence, and tremor‑ridden resolve create a credible arc from isolation to engagement. His micro‑choices—climbing, placing lips to the crystal, privileging silence over words—reveal character under pressure. The cost and contradiction (devotion to dictionaries vs. surrender to listening) are present but could be sharpened. The woman’s arrival tests him without hijacking agency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens is clear: pattern discovery through sound and silence culminates in a conceptual repricing and a chosen step into community. Orientation is clean from the opening (who/where/when). The closure lands on the page with cost—leaving the sanctuary and revaluing his life’s work—though the price remains more conceptual than visceral. Because/therefore beats are coherent within the accumulative design.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The shadowed library, dawn light, and chandelier prism are vividly filtered through a linguist’s gaze and shape tactics (access via ladder; the crystal’s placement dictates approach). The crystal functions as object‑as‑setting that charges the final image. Sensory detail extends beyond visual (sound distortion, hush as presence). World rules (sonic reflection) stay consistent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decoding the hush to reclaim meaning—tightens when the crystal inverts the line and silences reveal the pattern, followed by the woman’s proposition. The decisive move is choosing to leave and join the mapping effort, foreclosing solitary obsession. Pressure escalates via density and cadence shift rather than danger; the cost is present but not punishing. Still, the internal/external threads interlock effectively.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Themes of language, absence, and the ethics of attention cohere without sermonizing; “the pattern wasn’t in the growing. It was in the listening” reweights all prior detail. Recurring images (dawn, fractured gold, the prism, hush) evolve in meaning through the ending. The quiet communal turn resists tidy triumphalism and honors cost (relinquishing a lifetime frame). The resonance lingers beyond the scene.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third‑person close carries a distinct perceptual signature (lexicon and sensory priorities of a linguist). Dialogue is sparse, goal‑driven, and subtextual; the woman’s lines advance plot and stakes. Rhythm modulates with pressure (climb, contact, reversal). No head‑hopping or register drift; elision is purposeful and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is lean yet musical, with images doing double duty; lines like “a hush so profound it hummed” and the sonic prism feel precise. Minimal scaffold and no paraphrase loops; momentum holds through discovery. Occasional elevated phrasing edges toward purple but remains controlled and character‑motivated. The final cadence is clean and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The sonic‑reflective crystal translating silence into growth is a fresh, integrated conceit, and the “no new words” premise is reimagined rather than trendy. The turn from speaking to listening as method and ethic feels inevitable in hindsight. Risks (lyric density, conceptual stakes) pay off without obscuring clarity. The synthesis of linguistics, acoustics, and quiet apocalypse reads singular.</comment>
