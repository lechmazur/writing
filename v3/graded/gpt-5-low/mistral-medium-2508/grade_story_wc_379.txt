<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira’s motives (skeptical of ghosts, devoted to stories) drive clear micro‑choices—prying the locket, opening the mailbox, reframing the event for the courtyard. Interiority is concrete and embodied (“tick‑tick” as heartbeat, dust on fingers). Internal contradiction (skepticism vs. listening faith) is present but gentle, with limited on‑page cost. Secondary pressure from Mrs. Delgado and Old Man Chen functions, though Mira’s change reads more as stance clarification than risky transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: sound motifs build (clang, tick, hum) to a resonant reconfiguration where the courtyard commits to replying. Orientation is clean from line one; the mailbox event tightens focus. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise—choosing listening over solving—with a soft but legible cost (living with the unsolved). Stakes narrow once the mailbox yields and the letter reframes the scene’s purpose.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The courtyard at dawn is vivid (jasmine, cracked tiles, radio static) and action‑integrated. The mailbox and locket operate as charged objects that constrain choices and shape the final image (steady tick). Details are POV‑filtered through a curator’s eye and sonic bias. The environment’s social texture (neighbors present) meaningfully guides the communal outcome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around whether to open and how to respond, escalating via the clang, the initials, and the letter’s contents. The turn from private curiosity to communal ritual is clear, driven by Mira’s facilitation. The cost—accepting ambiguity rather than solving—is felt but modest; no option is dramatically foreclosed beyond interpretive control. Tension is consistent, if more tender than fraught.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Listening as healing emerges through sound motifs and communal response rather than argument; the final cadence reweights the premise. One line edges toward thesis (“some mysteries aren’t meant to be solved—only listened to”), slightly over‑articulating what the images already convey. Subtext in silences and shared breath works, especially the community’s charged stillness. Resonance lingers without neat explanation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The voice is lyrical, sensorial, and controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature grounded in objects and sound. POV is stable and modest, with brief, natural dialogue that carries subtext and pressure. Rhythm modulates well from hush to communal intake without showy intrusion. No head‑hopping or stance leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished: strong verbs, purposeful images, and sonic patterning (“tick‑tick,” “hummed,” “sigh”). Minor familiar phrasings (“as one,” “the air stayed soft”) do not blunt momentum. Sentences carry multiple jobs and avoid loops; cadence supports escalation and release. The final line reprises motif without purple excess.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>A thrift‑shop curator mediating a haunted‑adjacent object and a long‑shut mailbox feels familiar, but the sonic motif and communal epistolary pivot are fresh. The piece risks a quiet, non‑solving resolution and earns it through specificity. Emotional truth eclipses novelty, giving the premise a lived texture. Not radically new, yet confidently, distinctively executed.</comment>
