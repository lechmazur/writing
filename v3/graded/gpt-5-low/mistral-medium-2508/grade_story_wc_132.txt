<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Liora’s controlling impulse versus her curiosity is embodied in tactile micro‑choices—the microscope scene, the apology to roots, and the act of pulling stakes. The emotional turn from recording to surrender reads earned by prior behaviors. Felt cost is present: relinquishing professional habits and customer expectations. Minor safety in certainty around the epiphany keeps it shy of the top band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: storm → cellular “reconstructing” insight → night of surrender → morning reprisal with the customer. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: she redefines storm and her role, handing over a leaf instead of roses. Cost is legible on the page (abandoning control supports and risking her shop’s norms). Orientation is clean and the two‑shard flow (night to morning) coheres.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The nursery in storm—wet earth, mossy trellis, linden roots splitting stone—feels tactile and profession‑filtered. Environment shapes choice (barefoot in mud, stakes removable, trellis sagging) and charges the final image. Weather is not décor but an active medium for transformation. Specificity stays consistent and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Pressure deepens via pattern density: trembling leaves → cellular metamorphosis → storm intensification → decisive act of removing supports. Agency is clear: she chooses to stop managing growth and risks structural collapse and customer expectations. The stakes are internal but tied to a concrete system (the nursery). Slight softness in external jeopardy keeps it below the top tier.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Themes of surrender as growth and learning from the nonhuman emerge organically through images (cells “reconstructing,” trellis collaboration). The final exchange with the customer reweights the premise without over‑explaining. A couple of thesis‑leaning lines (“The storm season wasn’t something to endure. It was an invitation.”) tilt toward statement over subtext. Still, the last image carries genuine resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a lyrical, plant‑attuned diction that remains character‑plausible. Rhythmic control modulates with intensity (storm night versus dawn). Dialogue is minimal but purposeful, and the voice doesn’t overreach into academic register. Minor repetition of rhetorical structures surfaces but does not blur perspective.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lines are vivid, efficient, and layered; images do multiple jobs (beeswax texture, lattice of green and gold). A few near‑echoes and heightened metaphors verge on purple but stay coherent and legible. Momentum holds through paragraphing and syntactic variety. The closure image is clean and unblurred by ornament.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Eco‑lyric surrender isn’t new, but the cellular “reconstructing” and the trellis as collaborator feel fresh. The gift of a single leaf as counter‑commerce is a strong, specific turn. Risks are aesthetic rather than structural and largely pay off. Slight familiarity in the epiphany pattern keeps it below exceptional.</comment>
