<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Liora’s motive—using light to recover lost joy—is clear and consistent, and her choices (pressing the fragment to film, staging the public display) align with it. Interiority is vivid through sensory noticing and craft‑driven micro‑choices. However, there’s little contradictory impulse or on‑page hesitation under pressure; she rarely struggles against a counter‑urge. The cost is felt more conceptually than emotionally internalized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece escalates cleanly from discovery to experiment to communal projection, landing a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is early and firm; causality holds (fragment → film → display → momentary bloom → fade). Closure carries cost on the page (the images will “fade by morning”), and the final stance (“promise”) reweights the world. It’s a quiet arc but well‑structured for this length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The orchard, fog, greenhouse, film, and light vials are tactile and purpose‑driven; environment and tools actively shape tactics (stringing film between dead trees, projecting onto fog). Sensory detail is selective and character‑filtered (peach scent, humming vials). The fog’s return charges the final image and sets the cost of ephemerality. World rules feel consistent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes center on rekindling communal joy, with one decisive tightening at the dusk display. The pressure is gentle, but the move from solitary experiment to public risk is a credible escalation that narrows options. Cost is present via impermanence (the film fading) and the implied risk of failure, though direct resistance is minimal. The absence of an on‑page antagonist keeps tension low but coherent for the chosen lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme—art as retrieval of joy and contested memory—emerges organically through action and image, not thesis. Recurring particulars (fog, peaches, the child, light‑paint) shift meaning at the end, achieving a resonant, unsentimental answer. The final “promise” reconfigures loss without easy triumphalism. Complexity remains, with ephemerality acknowledged rather than hand‑waved.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The voice is lyrical yet precise, with a consistent perceptual signature anchored in craft and sensation. POV is stable; no head‑hopping or unjustified omniscience. Rhythm modulates effectively from intimate discovery to communal bloom. Diction is elevated but character‑plausible for an artist of light.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple loads (world, mood, action) without bloat, and figurative language stays coherent to light, film, and fog. Minimal scaffold; momentum remains. A few lush lines brush the edge of purple but remain controlled and legible. The final cadence lands cleanly without explanatory spill.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Paints‑with‑light, a knowledge network as communal nervous system, and fog as projection surface synthesize into a fresh, memorable premise. The projection onto air and communal reanimation of place feels non‑obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Risks in form (lyric accumulation, quiet closure) heighten resonance without obscuring clarity. The result reads singular rather than templated.</comment>
