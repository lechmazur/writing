<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elias’s motives are clear (reach Port Veyra; make meaning) and his micro-choices under pressure—activating the slide, reconceiving his carving, relinquishing tools—track with his artisan worldview. Interiority is concrete and character-specific (“driftwood… taught you to see the bones of the world”). Internal contradiction is subtle (commerce vs. communal marking), but the piece could press fear or doubt a touch harder. The cost lands in the forfeiture of the slide and the leaving-behind of his work.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: layered images accrete until “the archway wasn’t a door. It was a loom,” prompting a reoriented act that changes options. Closure is on-page with cost: he contributes a hand-carving, loses the slide, and gains a non-digital path home. Orientation is clean from the first lines; magical causality is internally consistent. The decisive reweighting is earned and legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The storm and archway are vivid and tactile (“salt-crusted stone,” “wind howling… like a choir of lost things”). The arch functions as a constraint and engine for choice, literally shaping the final act and image. Objects-as-setting (slide, driftwood, arch) charge the ending. World rules stay coherent through action rather than exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding a way back from being marooned—tightens when GPS dies and the storm escalates, leading to a single meaningful deepening via the loom insight and carving. Agency drives resolution; coincidence doesn’t solve it. Cost is felt (forfeiting the slide; leaving his work behind), though physical peril is kept lyrical more than visceral. A shade more pressure or a clearer foreclosed alternative could raise the voltage.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Themes of legacy, communal time, and craft as alliance emerge organically from particulars (the preserved violets; compass rose; “we were here”). The final image—Elias gifting a tiny boat and walking without tech—reprices what guidance means without moralizing. The loom metaphor integrates form and meaning, inviting reflection beyond plot. No sermonizing; resonance lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third-person close with a distinct perceptual signature (craft-and-weather lexicon) remains consistent. Rhythm modulates with pressure (quiet after the slide flares, then a calmer return). The brief dialogue at the docks is natural and subtextual. Diction stays within character plausibility while allowing elevated poetics.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High information density with images doing double duty; metaphors are apt and largely unmixed (“light… sideways,” “archway… a loom”). Minimal scaffold; momentum carries through the reveal to the resolved walk. A few lush lines flirt with density, but clarity and propulsion hold, including at closure. Syntax varies and punctuation is clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: a driftwood sculptor, a blind cartographer’s timewoven slide, and an archway-as-loom create a non-obvious, coherent mythos. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight once the loom is named. Risk-taking in concept and diction heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The final driftwood token at the docks elegantly extends the system.</comment>
