<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is specific, embodied, and motivated by a hard-earned pedagogy of “subtracting noise.” His micro-choices (placing the rosette, choosing to hum rather than “fix”) reveal grief in tension with care. The four singers register as distinct pressures without stealing focus. A single abstracted line about hatred “unlearning people” skews essayistic but doesn’t break character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the scene accrues presence (arrival → rosette placed → shared hum) to a charged poise closure. The cost—accepting a remnant instead of a restored choir—is on the page and reweights options. Orientation is clean from the first paragraph; the final shimmer reads as a resonant reconfiguration, not a fix. No causality slips or soft resets.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The velvet library and autumn aren’t wallpaper; the traveled stillness actively enables the tactic of “subtracting noise,” and the space’s history charges the ending. The rosette functions as a micro-setting/object that anchors bodies and choice, vibrating in the final beat. Sensory specificity is precise without excess. Environment meaningfully shapes both tone and action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes focus: can presence sustain a decimated choir without erasing fracture. Escalation is a density build (from solitary contemplation to quartet hum), with a clear narrowing to quiet endurance. The price is the renunciation of loudness/repair in favor of fragile continuity. Tension is quiet but coherent and earned under the chosen lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Themes of vanishing arts, listening versus fixing, and communal fracture emerge through image and choice (leaves, rosette, silences notebook). Subtext in gesture and silence carries meaning; dialogue is sparse and purposeful. The line “It wasn’t about fixing…” edges toward statement but lands because action has already dramatized it. The final reweighting (“listening to the cracks”) resonates beyond the scene.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is steady and plausible; diction and rhythm reflect a musician-teacher’s sensibility. Dialogue is minimal but natural, carrying subtext and aligning with status dynamics. Lyrical cadence modulates appropriately and never confuses focalization. Voice remains coherent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line-level craft is tight: images multitask, syntax varies, and momentum never stalls. Figurative language is consistent (silence as music’s negative space) with no mixed-metaphor muddle. Minor lyric intensities stop short of purple. The closing image is crisp and unencumbered by scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>“Subtracting noise” as compositional method plus a relic rosette in a library is a fresh synthesis. The elegiac communal repair avoids cliché through tactile specifics and a non-obvious tactic. Not radically innovative in premise, but execution feels singular and assured. Risk is measured and effective.</comment>
