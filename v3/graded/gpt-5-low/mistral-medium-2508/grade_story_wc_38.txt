<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lira’s motive—decode and decide whether to keep or release—drives clear micro‑choices (rolling the dice, choosing to dance, opening the seals). Interiority is embodied via the dance as cognition, not abstract reflection. The internal conflict (preservation vs. liberation) is present and paid for by sacrificing the journals. A few thematic assertions verge on told insight, but they’re anchored in action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural, with a clean cadence shift when the dice trigger the console and the lab begins to flood. Closure lands on page: she opens the seals, accepts dissolution, surfaces; cost is visible (loss of journals, lab as tomb). Causality is coherent (dice → password demand → dance → LIBERATE → flooding). Orientation is clear from the opening image and maintained.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The sunken lab constrains options (reinforced glass, flooding risk) and charges the final images of dissolution and surfacing. Specifics like greenish glow, corroded metal, and currents “like a spider” are purposive and POV‑filtered. The environment directly shapes the method of entry (dance as password) and the price (loss to the ocean). Vivid without overdetailing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—keep or liberate—tightens decisively at the console’s demand for a danced password. The price (destroying the archive) is not abstract; it’s enacted through flooding. Escalation is driven by her agency, not coincidence, and deepens rather than resets. The final choice forecloses a path with visible cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Themes of vulnerability as strength and liberation over hoarding emerge through the sequence of actions and images, not just statements. The “LIBERATE” prompt risks on‑the‑nose, but the payoff image of loss to the ocean and inked dice on skin reweights it with earned resonance. The closing reprices secrecy vs. release credibly. Ambiguity lingers without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The lyric third‑person voice stays stable and biased to Lira’s sensorium; diction choices fit the character’s contemplative, embodied intelligence. Rhythm tightens under pressure (from dance to flooding) without losing clarity. No head‑hopping or stance leakage. Occasional aphoristic lines are supported by scene pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is precise and economical; images typically do double duty (dance as code, ocean as both threat and eraser). Figurative density remains legible; minimal redundancy and clean sequencing. No visible template cadence or filter‑verb stacks dulling immediacy. A few familiar phrases surface, but momentum holds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: biomechanical dance as cipher, hangman’s dice as trigger, and an underwater lab as a chamber for repricing vulnerability. The liberation choice is both literal and conceptual, with a distinctive final image. Risks in lyric intensity pay off without obscuring stakes. The piece feels singular rather than templated.</comment>
