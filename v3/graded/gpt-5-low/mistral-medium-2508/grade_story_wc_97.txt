<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Lena’s motives are clear and embodied—years of wound clocks and mapped compasses culminate in a bold tactic—but internal contradiction is light; she rarely wavers once the plan begins. The small, flinty exchange (“You’re late.” / “So are you.”) lands character and history efficiently. Micro‑choices (splicing the reel, walking while playing, not looking back) reveal a coherent hierarchy of values. A touch more friction under pressure would deepen complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Hybrid lens with causal dominance: compasses → projector/reel → door → reunion. Closure lands on‑page with a decisive shift from waiting to encounter; the clock’s chime and steady pendulum mark the turn. Cost is felt rather than tallied (years of endurance, the projector’s death, the leave‑behind), which is sufficient but not searing. Structure is clean with one controlled transition and no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The tidal arbor above the clouds isn’t mere backdrop; its currents, groans, and bark‑door constrain and enable choices, culminating in a charged final image suspended “above the rules of endings.” Objects as micro‑setting (piano, clock, compasses, projector) are tactically integrated. Sensory selection (salt‑yellowed ivories, ozone and old paper) is precise and POV‑filtered. World rules are learned through use rather than exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reunion/defying fate before night) tightens through a single meaningful intensification: the film path appears as the compasses lock, and the projector sputters out, forcing now‑or‑never. Escalation is coherent and largely agency‑driven, though resistance is gentle rather than bruising. The “horizon invites night” clock adds subtle pressure. The price is more atmospheric than explicit but registers.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Time, fate, and authorship of one’s encore cohere through recurring objects reweighted at the end (clock, compasses, piano, film). The final choice reframes waiting as craft and refusal to accept endings as given, avoiding moralizing. Subtext in the dialogue compresses apology, blame, and endurance. Resonance lingers without tidy thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a lyrical but controlled register; the perceptual signature favors music/time mechanics and avoids exposition. Diction and rhythm modulate with pressure (calm prep to urgent crossing to spare, ironized reunion). Dialogue is minimal yet subtextual and functional. No leakage or unjustified certainty.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is taut and musical: images carry double duty without purple excess, and sentences vary rhythmically. Figurative language is thematically coherent (time, wind, film/light) with no mixed vehicles. High information density—almost every line advances scene, world, or charge. The closing cadence pays off seeded motifs without redundancy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis—a sky‑arbor, compasses that map invisible tides, and a film reel as a literal pathway—feels singular and inevitable in hindsight. Risks (lyric causality, object‑driven magic) cohere under character agency. The reunion avoids cliché through craft choices (mechanical time artifacts, refusal of gush). Freshness arises from specificity rather than ornament.</comment>
