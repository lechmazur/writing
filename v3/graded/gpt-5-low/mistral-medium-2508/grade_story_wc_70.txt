<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias’s fear that the Last Wonder won’t work pushes a genuine, costly choice: he spends the heirloom to break the city’s rut. The “affliction of truth” informs his interactions (with the girl, the anticipated engineers) and modulates his shame/hope without therapy‑speak. Internal contradiction (duty vs. fear; routine vs. risk) stays embodied in tactile moves—ladder, box, seed. A minor limit: secondary pressure is light, so struggle feels brief once he commits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: blackout → riddle/seed decision → climb → seed in node → drones revive → communal re-seeing; closure lands as a charged repricing (“invitation”) with the on‑page cost of relinquishing the last seed. The drive lens reads Causal with a lyric overlay, held consistently through the final image of anticipatory sunrise. Stakes and consequence feel coherent across beats with no orientation debt. Slight ease in the mechanical success prevents a 9+.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The lightning tower, beehive node, and lacquer box are tactile and tool-like; the environment literally enables the act (he must climb and insert the seed) and charges the ending with aerial light/drone imagery. Sensory work is selective (ozone, copper warmth, humming), filtered through a keeper’s lived familiarity. World rules stay consistent and are learned in action. Strong atmosphere without postcard excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reviving wonder vs. safe routine) is signaled early and tightens at the decision to sacrifice the Last Wonder. The beat of commitment (seed into node) is the meaningful narrowing, with a visible price (heirloom gone; likely disbelief from authorities). Escalation could use one additional resistance or risk vector; success arrives quickly once he acts. Still, internal and external conflicts braid effectively.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: routine starves wonder; uncertainty revives it. The seed, drones, and blackout reweight into a communal recommitment to looking up, and Elias’s “truth” becomes gentler in use. A few lines verge on thesis (“The blackout wasn’t just a failure. It was an invitation.”; “You fed it routine…”) trimming subtlety. The final charged poise avoids sermonizing and leaves a resonant aftertaste.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Consistent, lyrical close-third with a distinct perceptual signature (“raw as honey from a crushed comb”). Diction and rhythm flex with pressure—leaner at the climb, expansive after ignition; dialogue is sparse and apt. No head‑hopping or stance drift; elisions are purposeful. A couple aphoristic sentences edge toward authorial, but voice coherence holds.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished: strong verbs, concrete nouns, and images doing double duty. Minimal scaffolding or loops; cadence varies; figurative language stays in the hive/metal/weather palette with good control. A few declaratives compress complexity into neat binaries (routine vs. wonder), slightly dulling edge in peak beats. Overall, propulsion and clarity are high.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: a toll keeper in a drone‑pollinated city uses a mythical seed to reprice attention; the matchbox riddle and “truth affliction” feel particular rather than templated. The wonder/routine axis is familiar but reanimated through specific objects and a credible civic frame. Risks are measured, not flashy, and land cleanly. One more unforeseen complication or moral wrinkle could have vaulted it higher.</comment>
