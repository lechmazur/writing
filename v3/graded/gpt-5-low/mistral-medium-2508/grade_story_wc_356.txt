<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Liora’s motive (serenity within sway) is precise and embodied through olfactory perception and craft, driving theft, planting, and a public confrontation. Contradictory impulses—ambition vs. trust/community—surface in her risking censure for an internal need. Micro-choices (staying up, stepping closer when Elders recoil, plucking/pressing the petal, hanging the bridge) reveal a hierarchy of values. The cost is somewhat gentle on the page, keeping the arc a shade safer than it could be.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, pressure coheres: theft → planting → bloom → Elders/visions → repricing (mirror) → communal shift (bridge, unlocked vault). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing with a visible social risk and a reweighted final image. Orientation is clean early; the world’s rules are learned through action without dumps. The cost is felt but not severe, which trims peak impact slightly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The treetop village, tide’s thought, and corpse flower are vividly integrated through smell, touch, and motion; selection reflects an herbalist’s priorities. Environment and object charge the ending (a new bridge strung with corpse flower vines) and constrain social dynamics via scent-as-truth. Details evolve causally (bloom → visions → community shift). A hair shy of 9+ only because constraint operates more socially than tactically.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (pursue forbidden wisdom/serenity vs. communal norms) is signaled and tightened by the Elders’ arrival and the flower’s invasive visions. Liora’s agency drives the decisive deepening and reconfiguration, and the communal risk is real if softened. The escalation reads as a single, meaningful intensification consistent with the chosen lens. The price is palpable but not scarring, limiting peak tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme coheres through particulars (scent as truth, doodles-as-language, sway as serenity), turning “wisdom” into mirror/trust in the final cadence. However, the explicit statement “The undercurrent of wisdom…is just another name for trust” lapses into moralizing in the last paragraph, dulling subtext. Prior images already carry the insight (petal pressed, unlocked vault, bridge-vines). The resonance persists despite the slight didactic overstep.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A controlled, sensuous voice with a distinct olfactory signature remains stable and apt; free of head‑hopping with minimal, effective dialogue. Rhythm modulates from hush to pressurized bloom without losing clarity. Diction matches POV and world while sustaining lyrical texture. It’s memorable and assured without slipping into opacity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is dense, purposeful, and propulsive; images like “rotting honey” and “tide’s thought” are vivid and consistent. Occasional lushness risks purple, but coherence holds and momentum doesn’t drag. No notable loops or scaffolding; sentences carry multiple jobs. Closing images resolve cleanly without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—olfactory herbalism, tide‑mind, corpse flower as mirror, doodle‑language—feels singular and grounded in character. Turns arise from established properties rather than late rule swaps, and the final reweighting is earned. It takes tasteful risks in worldbuilding and texture without gimmickry. Slightly conservative cost prevents a leap to the topmost band.</comment>
