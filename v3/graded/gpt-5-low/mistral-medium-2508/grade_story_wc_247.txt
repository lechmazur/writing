<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivations are clear (stealing back what time erased), with embodied, character‑particular action: Elias “maps silence” and Liora uses the camera as shield. The “no/yes/now” beat captures internal contradiction under pressure. Status and relationship dynamics shift when Liora’s quiet charisma hardens into a blade. Slight limitation: interiority remains mostly externalized through gesture, leaving a touch of depth untapped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: patterned silence-work → apparition → flash/net → harbor’s chromatic answer → reweighted end. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost: Liora’s shaking, the camera “heavier… like a heart full of names,” and its “hungry and patient” charge. Orientation is clean by the opening lines and the lens holds through the final image. The decisive intensification (true flash + harbor’s response) reads earned rather than convenient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The harbor is vividly particular and active: its glow dims, then answers in waves of color that shape the outcome. Micro‑setting objects (camera, rigging, docks) are tactile and return in the end to charge the image. The environment constrains and empowers tactics, not just decorates. Sensory balance (light, scent, texture) supports tone without overloading.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reclaiming the forgotten from hunger—is legible early and tightens when the shadow appears. Escalation is coherent: Liora advances into danger; Elias accelerates, weaving a net; the harbor amplifies their tactic. The price is felt rather than enumerated, and the solution emerges from established methods. A minor limitation is the implied cost over explicit sacrifice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Memory, art as theft‑back, and the ethics of remembrance surface through action and image, not thesis. The “we remembered them back” line risks stating the theme, but is supported by the charged camera and harbor’s response. Subtext in sign, silence, and light integrates with the climax and reweights the final world. Complexity lingers in the “hungry and patient” tool they now carry.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third‑person with a distinct perceptual signature—auditory images rendered via silence and color—holds steady under stress. Dialogue is sparse, purposeful, and subtextual; signing is dramatized as action. Rhythm tightens at the peak without losing clarity. No head‑hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing double duty (world rule + emotion: sound as color; silence as net). Figurative language is consistent and legible; repetition is patterned rather than redundant. A few elevated phrasings approach purple but serve the voice and never obscure causality. The closing image is crisp and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—signing to map silence, a film‑less camera that steals light back, a harbor that sings in color—is fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Turns arise from seeded elements rather than late rule changes. Risk‑taking in concept and diction heightens stakes without muddling clarity. The final reweighting (tool as heart full of names yet “hungry”) is memorable.</comment>
