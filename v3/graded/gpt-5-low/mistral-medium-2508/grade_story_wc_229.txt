<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elias’s motive—beckoning boats by “whispers” to prove a gentler frequency—drives every choice, and his embodied costs (aching throat, relinquishing the cork) sharpen him. The relationship with Harkin functions as a crucible; handing over the cork reconfigures status without neat sentiment. His interiority is concrete (scent, vibration, texture) rather than abstract. Minor note: his struggle is more endurance/attention than contested decision, but it reads earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: pattern builds from sensing vibrations to scent‑beckoning to Harkin’s recognition, and closure lands as an earned renunciation. The cost is on‑page—he gives up the cork, expends himself, and forecloses the need for proof—reweighted by the lighthouse’s shift from warning to invitation. Orientation is clean from the outset. The single tightening (boats turning, then Harkin’s softening) is sufficient and coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The cobalt lighthouse at dawn is specific and lived‑in (iron ribs humming, cool lantern glass, harbor choreography), and it functions as medium and constraint for the “vibrations of intent.” Sensory economy is excellent, especially scent and sound. The recurring object (cork) and the lantern/oil frame the final image. Minor restraint: the broader world remains narrow by design, which suits the scope.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (can whispers beckon them back?) is signaled early and tested: boats turn, then the harder test of convincing Harkin culminates in the hand‑off. Escalation is a textural deepening rather than reversals, but the pressure coheres and tightens once. The visible price—voice/effort and surrendering proof—charges the end. A slightly clearer moment of risk before Harkin’s arrival could heighten stakes further.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action and image: inheritance, the ethics of influence, and quiet efficacy (“whispers travel farther”) without moralizing. The garden/scent motif reweights meaning at the end (invitation over warning; tending the new garden). Harkin’s softening provides subtext about masculinity and listening without speechifying. The italicized thesis risks neatness but is earned by the scene.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct, controlled lyric voice with a consistent perceptual signature (scent, vibration, material textures). Dialogue is minimal but natural and subtext‑rich; Harkin’s softened line lands. Rhythm modulates with pressure, and imagery stays within the narrator’s lexicon. A few metaphors press toward purple but remain coherent and voice‑true.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished: varied syntax, high information density, and images that do double duty (“knife screams” as tonal thesis). No paraphrase loops or scaffolding; transitions are clean. Figurative density is high but disciplined; metaphors mostly align with established sensoria. One or two bold images flirt with excess without blurring sense.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lighthouse as resonant body, scent‑beckoning, and a purifying cork fuse into a fresh, inevitable synthesis. Risk‑taking in tone (“screaming tenderness”) and method pays off without obscuring clarity. The final reconfiguration (warning to invitation, proof relinquished) feels both surprising and retrospectively necessary. This is a memorable angle on maritime folklore and inheritance.</comment>
