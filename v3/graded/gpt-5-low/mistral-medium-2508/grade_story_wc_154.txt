<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lena’s interiority is specific and embodied—ribs humming, translator’s instinct mapping fear—and her micro-choices (condensation tracing, interpreting the photo, giving away the coral) reveal values under pressure. The “shrewdly innocent” lens grounds how she hears the unsaid without sliding into diagnosis. The cost is quiet but legible: she accepts the burden of others’ pain, gives up her talisman, and steps toward more hurt. A touch more contradictory impulse on the page would push this higher.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: images and actions accrete toward a charged poise—final embers and the coral’s transfer—without causal whiplash. Orientation is clear early (atrium at dusk; nurse’s cue), and the scene tightens when the boy arrives, converting vocation into immediate choice. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: translating grief becomes material gift; the smudges reweight into speech. Cost is present but soft; one sharper on-page price would elevate.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The misted atrium, ivy like barbed wire, and glass “bruise” are vivid and filtered through Lena’s war-shaped perception. Setting and objects function as micro‑setting: the coral’s ridges “ground” her and then charge the ending when handed off. Weather/light modulate tone and the final image without stalling momentum. While the space doesn’t strongly constrain tactics, it persistently charges choice and cadence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can she translate/graft meaning under fresh pressure—tightens when the boy asks for help, forcing her to act and relinquish the coral. The escalation is quiet but coherent under the chosen lens; her renunciation registers as the visible price. External and internal conflicts braid (body pain, history, present need) without melodrama. A clearer threat of failure or a sharper trade‑off would intensify stakes further.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme coheres through particulars: radio static as sea, coral as the sea’s memory, “unknotting” as a craft that reinterprets hurt, and grief as a dialect. The ending reframes smudges as embers—language recovered—and the coral as the boy’s first “true sentence,” a resonant answer without moralizing. Subtext breathes in gesture and negative space (pressure traces on the photo, condensation). The piece resists tidy closure while delivering a felt repricing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent; imagery arises from Lena’s perceptual signature (war-tuned ear, tactility). Dialogue is spare and purposeful, with clean subtext (“I unknot them”). Rhythm modulates well from lush description to decisive, simple lines at turns. No head‑hopping or register drift undermines the stance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple jobs and sustain momentum; metaphors are apt to the character (static/sea, coral/labyrinth). A high density of figurative language skirts purple but remains coherent and legible. Minimal scaffolding and no looped paraphrase. Final lines pay off motifs cleanly without overstatement.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The translator‑as‑grafter of pain, decrypting a child’s cast, and reweighting static as sea feel fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The coral’s embodied semiotics and the Mindanao trace lend specificity beyond trope. Risk is taken in a quiet, accumulative form and pays off with a charged, non‑literal ending. The originality sits in synthesis rather than novelty for its own sake.</comment>
