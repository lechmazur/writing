<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias’s contradiction—“not a hero,” yet compelled to listen—grounds his choices and escalates credibly. His curiosity drives the scene (adjusting the frequency, touching the glove) and his embodied reactions (“knees hit the stone”) keep emotion concrete. The shift from assuring the living to witnessing the dead reads earned rather than proclaimed. Cost is present but mostly conceptual (sanity, professional credibility), not fully dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Hybrid drive with an accumulative finish: the hearing aid’s pulse → bench → glove → apparition forms a coherent chain, while the mist and echoes build pressure. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: he reframes his vocation to include the dead and is “led” rather than chasing. The “bring her back to the photograph” instruction pays off in the final exchange. The cost is slightly soft on the page, relying on implication more than explicit consequence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The mist‑clad atrium, glass dome, and metallic scent are vivid, selective, and pressure the action (“The mist takes the forgotten”). The hearing aid and bench function as charged micro‑settings that constrain movement and choice. Environmental details evolve with events (mist forms hands; vanishes at climax) and charge the final image (aid flicker). Sensory texture is rich without turning into a static postcard.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (“Find her before the mist does”) is clear, and tension tightens when the glove triggers the mist’s “scream.” Elias’s agency—tuning, touching, addressing the voice—drives the deepening toward the apparition and the photograph’s repricing. Resolution leans a bit on the supernatural’s benevolence, with cost and foreclosed options implied rather than explicit. Still, the mid‑scene intensification and the final stance shift read earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of witnessing versus assuring is embedded in objects and action rather than sermonized, with “Some echoes weren’t meant to stay buried” toeing the edge but backed by scene work. Memory, forgetting, and the ethics of attention cohere through the smudged child → revealed child → inscription “For when you forget.” The final repricing of “listening” to include the dead resonates. Ambiguity remains purposeful without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct, controlled lyric voice with a consistent perceptual signature (“air tasted of iron and old promises”). POV remains tight to Elias, with dialogue used sparingly and effectively for pressure and subtext (“If I find her…what then?”). Rhythm modulates well through escalation without head‑hopping or register slips. The closing cadence aligns voice and thematic turn cleanly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density and clean propulsion; images do multiple jobs (mist as atmosphere, threat, and thematic carrier). Figurative language is lush but mostly precise; minimal redundancy or scaffold. Cadence varies with stress, and the final line lands by image, not explanation. A few near‑purple phrases appear, but they don’t blur causality or the closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The mesh of a public‑health‑like vocation with ghost acoustics and a decades‑old hearing aid feels fresh. The twist that the smudged child is “his” reweights earlier beats without feeling arbitrary. Familiar ghost tropes are individualized by occupational framing and the ethic of listening. Not radical, but confidently singular and emotionally specific.</comment>
