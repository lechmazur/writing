<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and embodied: Lysan commits to preserving the clearing’s subtle wisdom against the prophet’s fervor. Micro-choices (kneeling, palm to metal, recalling silence, “long enough”) align with a steady, disciplined temperament. Internal contradiction is muted; she rarely wavers, limiting tension from competing impulses. Still, the quiet endurance lands credibly with a felt cost (fatigue, temporary reprieve).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure builds through sensory and tonal density as the clearing frays then re‑sharpens. Closure is Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she restores the boundary “long enough,” accepts the unfixable, and departs with cost (“weight in her chest eased just enough”). Orientation is clean early; causality coheres via consecration → song → stabilization. The cost is legible on the page and shapes the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful: dunes, murmuring silk, scents, and the kinetic parapet filter through Lysan’s trained perception. The parapet-as-object functions as micro-setting, constraining action and charging the ending. World rules (clearings fray under prophet, sharpen under consecration) remain consistent and learned through action. The environment’s texture supports tone and theme without museum-tour excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve the clearing’s subtle wisdom) tightens as the clearing blurs and the disembodied voice presses, “You can’t hold it forever.” The turn lands when Lysan refuses total victory and chooses “long enough,” foreclosing permanence and accepting ongoing loss. Costs are internal and situational rather than dramatic, but the single intensification is clear and earned. Tension is quiet yet coherent throughout the consecration beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Themes of endurance, quiet wisdom versus spectacle, and memory over fervor emerge organically from action and image. A few lines verge on thesis (“This was how wisdom survived…”) and the closing sentences tilt toward telling (“The prophet’s followers would never understand”), slightly blunt­ing subtext. Still, the final stance (temporary holding of the clearing at personal cost) resonates. Recurring motifs (mask, whispers, song) consolidate meaning without overworking symbolism.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The lyric voice is controlled and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature (“peripheral awareness,” “like breath through reeds”). Dialogue is sparse, clean, and weighted with implication. Psychic distance and tense stay stable; no head‑hopping or unearned omniscience. Rhythm modulates well from hush to thrum and back to hush.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentences carry multiple loads—world, character, and pressure—with minimal scaffolding. Figurative language is frequent but coherent and voice‑aligned; it rarely muddies action. Minor on‑the‑nose lines slightly flatten the lyric lift, but momentum holds and the closure image is clear. Syntax varies with scene needs, maintaining clarity and cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The kinetic parapet, conjured clearing, and half-mask synthesize into a fresh, tactile mythic frame. The prophet trope gains originality through the emphasis on “peripheral” wisdom and endurance over confrontation. Risks are aesthetic rather than structural, but they pay off in tone and image. Not revolutionary, yet distinctly memorable and well-integrated.</comment>
