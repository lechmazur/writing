<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s motives—curating “doors ajar,” privileging stretch over win—drive every turn, culminating in the renunciation of conventional business for tending and community. Interiority is specific (tactile tea steam, the seed’s “alive-warm”) and decisions align with his ethos. The relationship with Lina adds pressure and reflection, though internal contradiction is light; he rarely hesitates. The cost is accepted with little struggle, trimming the upper band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: the seed’s arrival, display, sprout, planting, business slowdown, and bloom build a pattern that culminates in a charged final image. Orientation is clean from the outset; time elisions are purposeful and legible. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost (foregone business, unsettling bloom embraced). Causal links are coherent even as the design privileges cadence over reversals.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The brook, willows, brass lamp, and nocturnal hush are vivid and filtered through Elias’s sensibility. The environment constrains choice—he plants by the brook, rewrites the final puzzle to “The answer is outside. Listen.”—and charges the ending’s image. Sensory balance (sound, smell, temperature) deepens mood without excess. Setting evolves with events, not as postcard.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: what kind of “space” Elias holds—game mastery vs. receptive tending—tightens as the seed demands patience. The meaningful turn is the redefinition of the final puzzle and the acceptance of business decline to protect the experiment. Pressure is gentle but coherent; the visible price (lost customers, unsettling stink) fuels the final stance. The escalation is more deepening than conflictual, but sufficient for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme—receptivity, patience, and failure as prelude—emerges organically through the seed’s life and the reconfigured “puzzle.” Recurring images (doors ajar, the brook’s voice, stink as test) shift meaning by the end. A touch of explicitness (“The seed had been a question. The answer was this.”) borders on stating the thesis, but the concrete bloom scene anchors it. Resonance lingers in the communal vigil and “Now we see what grows.”</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The voice is lyrical yet controlled, with a consistent perceptual signature and clean focalization through Elias. Dialogue is sparse, natural, and subtextual (“Some doors don’t open until you stop knocking.”; “The answer is outside. Listen.”). Rhythm modulates with pressure—the 3 a.m. split, the vigil, the bloom—without head-hopping. Diction suits the character and tone.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Line-level craft is polished: images carry multiple jobs (“ink that glinted like beetle-shells,” “dried scorpion’s heart”) and syntax varies. Minimal scaffolding; sentences advance mood or action with little redundancy. Figurative density stays legible and coherent, avoiding mixed metaphors; cadence supports the accumulative build. The final lines re-energize earlier motifs without purple overflow.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escape-room ethos braided with a corpse flower’s slow spectacle feels fresh and necessary, not gimmicky. The anonymous seed as catalyst, the pivot from combination locks to listening, and the communal watch synthesize into a distinctive stance. Risks (quiet escalation, accepting business decline as cost) pay off. The piece commits to its premise and earns its ending.</comment>
