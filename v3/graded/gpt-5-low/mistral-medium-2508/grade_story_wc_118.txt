<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elias’s motives are crystal—he collects the stories walls have heard—and his micro-choices (handling the tapestry, coaxing embers, accepting the tug, leaving the silo) align. Interiority is embodied and particular (“fingers tracing the stitches,” “rusted hinge” breath), with no diagnostic labeling. The renunciation at the end (walking away, diaries turned to ash) reads as an Earned Stasis with felt cost. Internal contradiction is present but quiet; he doesn’t resist the pull, so tension remains more elegiac than contested.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: objects and atmospherics build to a Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing—tapestry warming, the world “remembering how to turn.” Orientation is clean within 120 words (who/where/when immediate). Cost is on-page: the diaries become ash and he forecloses the safety of the silo by leaving. The final image reweights prior material without a mechanical tie-up, delivering a clear before/after in meaning.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The silo, shelves, ladder, cracked seal, and fireplace are tactile and shape choices (climbing for the alcove, offerings drifting in, the fireplace as catalyst). The tapestry and fireplace charge the final image and constrain tactics; the metal skin’s “note just shy of sorrow” threads tone into setting. Sensory balance is excellent (smell of damp parchment, heat-ghost, metallic groan). World rules are consistent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (will he engage the fracture and accept the cost of listening) tightens when he feeds the diary to the fire and yields to the tug. The turn is clear: tapestry activates, axis moves, diaries are spent, and he commits by leaving. Stakes remain largely conceptual rather than visceral, but the price is legible and charges the ending. Pressure coheres and increases once in a purposeful cadence shift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of memory as trade and the ethics of custodianship emerges through particulars (diaries, ash, tapestry axis, “We named it the Sundering… a trade”). The final image revalues the premise: a world that forgot to turn might remember through listening—cost paid in burned pages and solitude. No sermonizing; ambiguity remains productive (what is taken/given in the exchange). Recurring images accrue meaning rather than symbol-announce.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, controlled, and character-bound, with rhythmic modulation that matches pressure (“bronze quiet hum,” “note just shy of sorrow”). Free indirect stance is stable; no head-hopping or unearned omniscience. Compression and patterned diction are taught early and pay off at closure. Diction remains within a plausible, literate lexicon for this mind.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line-level craft is tight and musical, with high information density per sentence and minimal scaffolding. Figurative language is frequent but coherent and purposeful; no mixed metaphors or template cadence runs. A few intensifiers cluster, but they do not blur causality or the closing image. The final cadence lands cleanly without paraphrase loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The reclaimed-silo archivist in a post-dream world, the tapestry-as-axis, and the “trade” of dreams/sky synthesize into a fresh, inevitable-feeling conceit. Risks in tone and structure heighten meaning without obscuring clarity. Turns arise from established objects and motive rather than late rule changes. The vision reads singular and committed.</comment>
