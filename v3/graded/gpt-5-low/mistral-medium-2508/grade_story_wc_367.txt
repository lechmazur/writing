<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Liora’s motive—ritual guardianship and bargaining with the storm—is clear and embodied in tactile choices (wick adjustments, steering the beam). Contradictory impulses (weaponized laughter vs. village ambivalence; prophecy she “hadn’t meant to say”) add specificity. The cost is implied rather than deeply felt on the body beyond tired ritual and the wick burning low. Absence of an on‑page counterforce with voice or dialogue limits relational pressure but fits the single‑POV scope.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: pressure builds through ritual intensification (light narrowed, shadows answering, wick burning down) to an Earned Stasis—she holds until false dawn. Orientation is clean early (emerald lighthouse, night, village below). The closure lands with cost signaled (depleted wick, endurance, ongoing bargain) without a decisive turn, but the cadence shift at dawn reads as a meaningful tightening. A concrete test beyond a fraying silhouette would sharpen the felt stakes further.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The lighthouse and its glass/wick function as micro‑setting and tool that constrain tactics; total internal reflection and pane vibration are integrated into action, not postcard description. Sensory specificity (salt‑worn stone, ozone, positions of stars waver) is POV‑filtered and purposeful. The environment meaningfully charges the final image (hands warmed by wick; the climb will repeat). World rules remain consistent and learned through use.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (holding the boundary until dawn) is legible and escalates via the wick’s depletion, the beam’s knife‑like focus, and the shadow’s arrival. The key tightening is the deliberate letting of the flame dip—an endurance choice that forecloses immediate overuse. Costs are more conceptual than visceral; we don’t witness a loss beyond fatigue and reputation, keeping pressure strong but not searing. A clearer on‑page sacrifice or near‑failure would elevate the turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Themes of duty as a perpetual bargain, memory of dawn, and the weaponization of joy emerge through images and choices rather than moralizing; the final cadence reweights the title objects (light, shadows, dawn). “The next sunrise will be the last you recognize” refracts into the ending’s “false dawn,” achieving conceptual repricing without a lecture. Some lines flirt with overt statement (“The work was never done”), but image anchors keep it honest. Ambiguity lingers productively around the village’s watchfulness and the things “between cracks.”</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct, controlled lyric voice with clean single‑POV distance; syntax modulates with pressure (short lines at peaks, longer when steering). Diction coheres with Liora’s cosmology and practice; technical terms (total internal reflection) feel earned in context. No head‑hopping or withheld knowledge artifacts. A few high‑register phrases skate near purple, but rhythm and clarity hold.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lines carry multiple jobs—world, mood, and action—without scaffolding or loops; imagery is vivid and mostly disciplined. Occasional intensifiers and metaphor density (“stars like dice,” “teeth of time”) risk lushness but rarely blur sense. Momentum stays intact through paragraphing and verb choice. The closing sequence compresses elegantly without summary drag.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of ritual lighthouse‑keeping with cosmic boundary work feels fresh, with inventive specifics (inward‑bent color, internal reflection as tactic). The “laughter as weapon” and after‑print world texture the premise beyond trope. Closure honors the risk by refusing a flashy win; the earned stasis reads confident. Not revolutionary, but distinctly imagined and executed with conviction.</comment>
