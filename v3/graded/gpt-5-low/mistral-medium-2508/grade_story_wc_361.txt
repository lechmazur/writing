<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear interior motive (mentor, “Find what hums”) and embodied nerves (“fingers trembled”) ground the courier; his choices (ripping the pendant, stepping onto the bridge, planting the seed, returning to the villages) reveal growth from hoarder of relics to conduit. The woman applies pressure that exposes his flaw (mistaking rarity for magic). Change is earned with a felt cost: surrendering the pendant/role. Interiority skews lyric over granular contradiction at peak beats, but remains credible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural; pressure thickens via hum frequency, aurora unspooling, and seed-to-bridge reweighting. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: he accepts “carry the hum,” plants the seed, and reframes absence as extension with on‑page cost (relinquishing the pendant/identity). Orientation is clean early (ridgeway, pendant, abyss, mentor), and the sequence coheres. Minor hand‑wavey cosmology doesn’t harm causality under the chosen lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The aurora‑lit ridgeway, abyss/fade, and pendant operate as charged environment/objects that constrain and enable choices (crumbling path; pendant burning; living bridge spanning the abyss). Sensory selection is purposeful and POV‑filtered; rules are learned through action. The final images (bridge vibrating, aurora splitting) are setting‑charged, not postcard scenic. World coheres and powers the ending.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—translating longing into action and reconfiguring mentorship—tightens when the woman weaponizes germination and the pendant’s removal triggers the light’s unraveling. The courier’s agency resolves the pressure (rips pendant, steps onto bridge, plants seed, chooses to return), with a visible price (relinquishes talisman and prior identity). Escalation is a clean deepening rather than multiple reversals, fitting the lens. Stakes stay intimate yet consequential (villagers, ridgeway’s survival).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme—wonder lives in motion; absence as extension; mentorship as transmission—not only stated but enacted through seed→bridge→stories and the choice to carry the hum back to the routine. Subtext works in images (shards singing, abyss’s “laughter”), though explicit lines (“The hum was always here.” “Now pass it on.”) tilt toward thesis‑telling, slightly thinning subtlety at the end. Resonance remains strong. The final seed/dragonfly image reweights prior motifs elegantly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyric third‑person free indirect remains steady and character‑specific; dialogue is sparse, pointed, and subtextual (“You’re late.” / “You think wonder’s something you coax?”). Rhythm modulates well at pressure spikes (pendant burns; bridge unfurls). Elevated diction feels voice‑motivated for this fable‑like register. No head‑hopping or stance leaks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lines carry high information density with vivid verbs (“unraveled,” “germinated,” “dissolving”). Occasional intensifier drift and mantra‑like repetition (“The hum was always here.”) flirt with overstatement, but momentum holds and images stay coherent. Syntax varies, punctuation is clean, and final beats land via image rather than explanation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mentor‑as‑hum, pendant‑to‑frequency, seeds that germinate into stories, and the abyss exhaling “laughter” synthesize into a memorable, specific mythopoesis. Risks (lyric accumulation, conceptual cosmology) pay off with a clear reconfiguration at the end. The bridge as living wonder transmitted to routine feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. No gimmickry; choices grow from the established logic.</comment>
