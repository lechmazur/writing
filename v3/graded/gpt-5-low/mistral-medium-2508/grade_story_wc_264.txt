<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Hollow’s motives and micro-choices are clear and embodied: pry open the crate, take the spark, wind the clock, accept stewardship. The “never dreamed” frame sets a credible internal lack that the ending reverses. Internal contradiction is modest (guard vs. caretaker) but present. Emotional texture remains concrete (weightlessness “like holding a breath”) without therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: new tracks, green sand, and a chosen vocation, with the cost of responsibility and the threat of reset. Orientation is clean from the start (who/where/when via train, dunes, cargo). The clock beat and spark insertion tighten coherently toward the charged final cadence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and purposeful: bioluminescent dunes, Möbius track, rusted badge, and humming crate integrate with action. Recurring objects (train, crate, clock) charge the final image and guide choices. World rules—divergent archive and temporal stitchery—are learned via tactile interaction rather than dump. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Hollow’s work-worn perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—carry and protect a nascent future against timeline resets—is legible and escalates when Hollow chooses to place the spark and wind the clock. The train’s loop and clock’s chime deepen pressure without fragmenting causality. Cost is more conceptual than visceral but present (accepting risk and duty, world already “reset too many times”). A clear tightening occurs at the crate/spark/clock sequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Renewal vs. erasure, memory vs. emptiness, and stewardship over salvage unfold through objects and action rather than moralizing. The final green sand and dawn reweight earlier imagery (burned forests, dreamlessness) into a promise with cost. Subtext in the rusted badge brightening and the lullaby-whistle supports the theme. Ambiguity lingers productively without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>POV is stably tethered to Hollow with a confident, lyrical register that modulates under pressure (whistle as “fractured lullaby,” dunes “sighing”). Purposeful elision is taught and paid off through recurring images. No head-hopping or register slips; diction suits the mythic, end-of-world fable tone. Rhythm carries momentum through short, weighted lines and controlled repetition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Line-level craft is polished with high information density; metaphors are fresh and coherent (“glowing dunes in bloom,” “holding a breath”). A few stacked images flirt with purple but largely serve cadence and charge stakes. No notable scaffold or paraphrase loops; syntax varies to match beat intensity. The final sequence is crisp and unsmudged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis feels singular: post‑apocalypse by way of archival time‑gardening, a chess clock as key, and a railman as midwife to possibility. Turns are grounded in earlier seeds; nothing reads like late rule changes. The imaginative risk (lyric temporal mechanics, Möbius tracks) heightens resonance without obscuring clarity. Emotional truth anchors the novelty.</comment>
