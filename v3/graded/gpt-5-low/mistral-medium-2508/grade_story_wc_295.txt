<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elias’s drive to decode the inscriptions and reconcile his sister’s disappearance grounds the piece; his shift from hoarding words to listening feels earned through on‑page sensory contact with the telescope/stars. Interiority is specific and embodied (ink‑stained fingers, breath fogging glass), not label‑speak. The contradiction—chronicler as healer vs. his deafness to the chorus—operates meaningfully. A slight smoothness in the epiphany (minimal resistance once the “voice” speaks) keeps this shy of the very top.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: observations and images intensify toward a reweighting of the premise (temple as loom; burden shared). Closure lands with visible cost: relinquishing the ledger and the telegram crumbling, with a new stance crystallized. Orientation is clear early (observatory, ledger, telegram, sister); the magical escalation (stars answering) is consistent within the taught rules. One scene, one dominant stake, and a decisive cadence shift are cleanly delivered.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The observatory, telescope, and telegram are not décor; the telescope constrains how he engages—through alignment and “witnessing”—and the final daylily charges the last image. Sensory and occupational details are selective and POV‑true (brass gears, variable stars in Morse). The environment evolves with action (stars aligning, dawn’s bleed) and shapes the ending’s charged reconfiguration. World rules stay coherent to the lyric frame.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding the inscriptions/meaning of burden—tightens when the stars’ rhythm becomes directive and the thread physically engages him. The meaningful turn is the move from decoding to joining, with the cost of surrendering his solitary chronicler identity (ledger gone). Pressure is largely internal but coherent and mounting under the chosen lens. A clearer on‑page test of resistance might have intensified the squeeze.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of communalized grief versus solitary record‑keeping is integrated through specific objects and acts (loom/temple, telegram, the verb “witness”). The final image reweights earlier motifs, though some lines state theme outright (“The burden was shared”; “I am not alone”), edging toward over‑articulation. Subtext still works in image (ink as seed, daylily bloom). The resonance lingers without needing a moral, but the explicitness trims the top end.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and confident; the perceptual signature blends technical observation with numinous language credibly for this character. Rhythm modulates well across intensification (groan of the telescope to the thread spooling) without head‑hopping. The brief disembodied voice is framed as received, not a POV leak. A few declaratives flatten the otherwise fine cadence, keeping it just shy of 9+.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished: images carry multiple jobs, and the syntax varies to propel or breathe as needed. Occasional thematic restatements and a handful of near‑synonymous intensifiers slightly reduce density at peaks. Figurative logic remains coherent (loom, thread, seed) and avoids mixed metaphors. No significant scaffolding or cadence templates drag momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of astronomical mechanics with a communal‑grief loom is fresh and feels inevitable by the end. Recurring objects (daylily, ledger, telescope) are used inventively rather than ornamentally. The risk of a quiet, concept‑forward closure pays off cleanly. Only the slight didactic edge in a couple lines tempers full originality impact.</comment>
