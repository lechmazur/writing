<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is specific and embodied (calloused hands, rasping voice) and his micro‑choices under pressure—pressing the plate at forks, touching the Heart Chamber, deciding to walk awake—align with a coherent trait set. Motivation accrues through ruin→repair instincts rather than exposition. Contradictory impulses (sleep’s surrender vs. chosen wakefulness) surface credibly without therapy‑speak. The cost is felt but modest (ache, relinquishing the cradle of sleepwalking) which keeps this short of the top tier.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: the patterned walking/pressing intensifies to the Heart Chamber where the labyrinth reconfigures, and the final repricing (“not a maze; a loom”) lands on the page. Orientation is clear early (who/where/when) and the closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration with cost (leaving the cradle, bearing the ache, accepting agency). The causal chain is lyric but coherent: plate→glow→shift→choice. A slightly soft price keeps it just under the 9‑band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The canyon labyrinth is tactile and sensorial (brine, copper, red dust) and constrains action—the forks, dead ends, Heart Chamber—while charging the final image. The plate functions as a micro‑setting tool, inscribing paths; the environment’s rules (broken precedent) are learned through action. The final walk into dawn is reweighted by the carved walls humming behind him. Spatial choreography remains legible despite lyricism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reweaving ruin into something sacred—tightens at the Heart Chamber when external reality responds, converting wandering into agency. The escalation is a single decisive intensification consistent with the chosen lens. Cost registers conceptually (ending sleepbound safety; bodily ache) but remains gentle. No antagonist is needed; pressure coheres from world and conscience.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars—the loom metaphor, memory stitches, ruin→reverence—culminating in a reweighted answer: naming and making as redemption. Subtext runs in images (“labyrinth as cradle, now a door”), with the mother’s verse echoing without didactic overreach. The quoted line flirts with aphorism but is earned by scene work. Emotional afterglow is contemplative rather than sentimental.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The voice is distinct, lyrical, and controlled, with a consistent perceptual signature (rope, stitch, plate, stone). Psychic distance stays steady in close third, and elisions are purposeful. Rhythm modulates at peaks (Heart Chamber) without opacity. No dialogue needed; diction never breaks register.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished: images pull multiple duties and syntax varies to maintain propulsion. Figurative density is high but coherent and motif‑aligned (weaving, stitching, stone), avoiding mixed metaphors. Minimal scaffolding or loops; a few intensifiers could be trimmed, but momentum holds. Final image is crisp and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Labyrinth‑as‑loom and sleep‑sewing memory via a storybook plate synthesize into a fresh, inevitable‑in‑hindsight turn. Risk‑taking in structure and diction heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The wharf weaver’s craft inflects every choice, preventing template drift. Closure feels singular to this vision.</comment>
