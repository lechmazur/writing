<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority is textured and character‑specific; her silence, sidelong method, and final renunciation of the heirloom reveal value hierarchy under pressure. The contradictory impulse—refusing a neat answer while offering a costly, tactile gift—lands credibly. The fisherman’s presence applies gentler external pressure, but the relational cost is legible. Minor limitation: the crucible between them could tighten a touch more on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the pause → grotto listening → “shape of it” insight → gifting the cicada → dream/damp sleeve creates a resonant reconfiguration with cost. Closure is on the page via the transfer of the cicada and the charged final image. Orientation is clean and the single transition is purposeful. No causality breaks; the price (relinquishing the talisman) frames the after.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The grotto and the cicada act as micro‑settings that constrain action and charge the ending; the environment dictates her method and enables the renunciation. Sensory detail is precise and purposeful (moonlight like spilled ink; pinprick ripple). The setting’s rules (listening in transitions) are taught through use, not exposition. Final dream/sleeve dampness reweights the place/object without contradiction.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to answer grief/fate—tightens through the accumulative method to a concrete price: she gives away the cicada. The meaningful deepening is the “shape of it” moment that reframes options and pushes the renunciation. Stakes are quiet but coherent; cost is visible. Slight softness: the fisherman’s on‑page counterpressure is minimal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of transitions/time’s texture accrues through recurring images and culminates in a non‑literal answer (listen to the in‑between; grief softening). Subtext lives in silence and objects, not sermon. The closing dream reframes the premise with lingering cost. One explicit line of guidance risks neatness but is earned by the relationship beat.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyrically controlled with a distinct perceptual signature; diction and rhythm suit the chronicler’s attention. POV remains stable and modest in its claims; inference reads as inference. Dialogue is sparse, natural, and carries subtext. No head‑hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished: images do double duty and rhythm modulates with pressure. Figurative density is high but coherent to the sea/time motif, avoiding muddle. Minimal redundancy and clean syntax preserve momentum. A few lush turns flirt with purple but don’t impede clarity or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The tidal‑pool chronicler, jade cicada, and “shape of time” synthesis feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The sidelong method and heirloom transfer are non‑obvious, thematically integral turns. Risks in lyric accumulation pay off in a charged, specific final image. Slight constraint: the grief‑guidance frame is familiar but distinctly inflected here.</comment>
