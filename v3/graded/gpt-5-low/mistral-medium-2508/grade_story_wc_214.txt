<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Eli’s motive—staying to listen and tend the stillness—drives every micro‑choice, culminating in defying alarms to welcome the star. Interiority is concrete and tactile (hand on dome, breath on glass), avoiding stock feeling labels. The protocol-versus-yearning conflict is credible and resolved through an earned choice. A few aphoristic lines (“strength wasn’t in armor, but in the courage to be porous”) brush the edge of told insight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of quiet care → meteor visitation → lantern/station transfiguration → departure. Closure lands on the page with a Resonant Reconfiguration: repaired lantern, starlit veins, and a reweighted identity (“witness”) with the cost of defying protocol and leaving. Orientation is clear within the first lines (who/where/when), and the two-shard morning transmission pays off the night’s turn. Cost is present but remains more spiritual than materially constraining.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The station, dome, alarms, and lantern glass are vivid, selective, and POV‑filtered; the environment hums and constrains via the dome and alarm system. The lantern functions as object‑as‑setting and charges the final image (repaired glass, pulsing once). Sensory detail across temperature, sound, and touch deepens atmosphere without cataloging. World rules stay consistent and are learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—risking self/protocol to connect—is signaled early and tightens with the star’s pause and the alarms. The meaningful turn is Eli’s refusal to retreat when warned, choosing permeability; consequence is the station’s transformation and his departure. The price is implied (risk of damage/job abandonment) but could be sharpened on the page. Tension remains coherent and grows through cadence rather than adversarial beats.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of “flourishing stillness” and vulnerability-as-strength emerges organically from action (hand to glass, “I see you,” letting light in) and the lantern’s charged reprise. However, several explicit thesis statements (“The era of overlooking was over,” “The hush…was an invitation”) tilt toward moralizing, diluting subtext in the final stretch. The emotional aftereffect is genuine and earned, if occasionally told. The final images still resonate despite overt statements.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Consistent, lyrical third-person close with a distinct perceptual signature—mechanical hush, star‑tracing, gentle metaphoric register. Dialogue is sparse and purposeful, with clean mechanics and subtext. Rhythm modulates well, tightening at the alarms and loosening into the morning transmission and walk away. No head‑hopping or stance drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Sentences carry good momentum and density; concrete images often do double duty. Minor purple tendencies and aphoristic repetitions surface in the final third, but they do not obscure causality or dull the closure image. Varied syntax prevents drumbeat monotony; filter verbs are limited. Overall clarity and cadence remain strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>“Cosmic janitor” tending stillness via a relic lantern and empathizing with a star is a fresh synthesis. The meteor’s “sigh” and the lantern’s repair avoid genre default beats, and the witness reframe feels earned. Some familiar cosmic lyricism appears, but the specific object work and vocation lift it. Risk-taking stays coherent and pays off.</comment>
