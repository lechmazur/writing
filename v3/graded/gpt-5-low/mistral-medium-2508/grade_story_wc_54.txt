<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lena’s motive and competence are crisply established and her micro-choices (entering an unsafe site, slotting the sextant, repurposing rather than “fixing”) align with her traits. Interiority is concrete (“she didn’t cheer. She calculated.”), and the engineer’s lens stays consistent. Internal contradiction is light; she rarely hesitates, so struggle and felt cost are muted. The renunciation of the spaceport dream for a bridge lands, but the price is more conceptual than viscerally felt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Hybrid lens with an accumulative-textural dominance at the end: a causal chain (find sextant → align → redirect flows → repurpose) builds to a conceptual repricing of “hope.” Orientation is clean from the first lines; single POV, one scene window, and stakes cohere. Closure arrives as an Earned Stasis/CR: she forecloses “restore the spaceport” and revalues hope as redirection, with a visible plan and the vane-to-horizon image. The cost is subtle but legible as opportunity/professional risk and a communal reframing rather than triumph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The terminal is vividly rendered and tactically used: hydroponics, doors triggered by water pressure, salvaged scaffolding, and the observation deck detritus shape choices. The sextant functions as micro-setting/tool that charges the final image. Sensory selection reflects the POV’s priorities (flows, pressure, structure) and avoids tourist cataloging. World rules feel consistent and are learned in action rather than exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reconfigure the terminal from dead monument to useful passage—is clear and tightens through the resurrection beat and the decision to build a bridge. Escalation is primarily knowledge and system-deepening rather than confrontation; pressure is coherent but low on risk. The trade-off (abandon spaceport fantasy; deviate from assigned task) lands but with limited on-page consequence. A single sharper obstacle or cost would heighten the tightening effect.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Themes of redirection, utility vs. spectacle, and hope as engineered flow emerge organically through water systems, carnival residue, and the sextant. The final equation risks explicitness but is earned by the engineer’s mindset and reweights prior images (vane to horizon, clear fountains). Subtext in choices (repurpose over restore) avoids sermonizing and leaves a resonant aftertaste. A hair less declarative phrasing could push it higher.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A confident, specific voice marries lyric image to technical perception; diction fits a pragmatic, imaginative engineer. Psychic distance is steady; brief dialogue is natural and serves action/subtext. Rhythm modulates well between observation and decision. No head-hopping or withholding artifacts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Line-level craft is precise and efficient; images (“sky the color of old bruises,” “hummed with intent”) are vivid without muddling action. Sentences carry multiple jobs and momentum; minimal scaffolding and no loops. Figurative density is high but controlled and pattern-consistent with the voice. Copy is clean; sequence and causality remain clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The fusion of derelict spaceport, carnival siphoning belief, and an engineer reframing hope via redirected flows feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The sextant-as-key and hydroponic resurrection are inventive without gimmickry. The final conceptual turn (horizon over stars) is elegant and specific to this character and world. Minor risk: the explicit equation edges toward stating theme, but the execution largely transcends it.</comment>
