<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lena’s motives are specific and consistent—“capture the texture of a missed opportunity,” not reclaim it—and her choices (testing the dice; refusing the door) arise from that stance. Contradictory impulses are live at the door, and the renunciation carries felt cost (leaving the smooth die, keeping the chip). Interiority is concrete and object‑grounded; the mathematician’s cast of mind reads through action. A touch of aphoristic self‑summation softens the edge but doesn’t undercut credibility.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single‑POV, one scene with one purposeful shard (the café door) lands clear closure: Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing as she refuses to rewrite the past. Causality is clean: dice test → pattern reveal → lateral move → door → renunciation. Cost is on the page (surrendering the “fix,” leaving the smooth die). The hybrid drive leans accumulative at the end and holds without contradiction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The staircase’s material rules (spiral, gray haze, a flaw in recursion) shape tactics and the decisive lateral escape. Sensory cues are selective and purposeful (stone thud, café hum/scent) and evolve with the turn. Objects function as micro‑setting constraints (the dice interacting with stairs). Minor breadth, but high leverage and charge at closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake is coherent: whether to escape or honor the missed moment. Escalation tightens via discovery and an actionable exploit (throwing the chipped die, running sideways), culminating in a moral trade‑off at the door. The price—refusal of an apparent remedy and leaving a talisman behind—is legible. Tension is largely internal yet active on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme coheres through recurring particulars (dice, recursion, the staircase) and culminates in a reweighting of “perpetual motion” as agency rather than entrapment. The missed opportunity gains texture and cost instead of being erased, which resonates. The explicit statement “Perpetual motion wasn’t a failure. It was a choice.” edges toward moralizing, slightly flattening the otherwise earned subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The voice is controlled, precise, and character‑true, with a mathematician’s clarity braided into lyric brevity. Rhythm modulates well at turns (the stutter, the sideways leap, the door). Occasional aphoristic lines risk over‑statement but remain grounded by concrete images. POV distance is stable and plausible throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is clean, with strong verbs and purposeful repetition that advances momentum. Images do double duty (dice as metronome/tool; gray haze as constraint) and prose avoids loops or filler. A few abstract formulations skim close to thesis‑statement territory, but clarity and propulsion hold. No technical glitches or muddled metaphors.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Recursive staircase pieces are familiar, but the chipped/smooth dice and “texture of a missed opportunity” give the concept fresh specificity. The lateral exploit and chosen confinement reframe the trope with integrity. Turns feel earned from seeded logic rather than convenience. It’s inventive without gimmickry.</comment>
