<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias’s history as a relic keeper, his shame at “failure,” and his shift from sealing to following create a credible internal conflict with concrete micro-choices (uncasing, playing to widen, stepping through). Emotions are embodied via cold, hush, and tactile markers rather than labels. A couple of abstractions (“harvest insights from failure”) skim the surface, but the final renunciation reads earned. The cost—abandoning the guardian posture and name—lands.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Beats link cleanly: note as “question” → shadow/marker response → child’s lure → choice to widen, not seal → crossing and leaving the flute. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration with cost: he relinquishes guarding to enter the weave, leaving tools and identity behind. Orientation is clear early; the hush and objects persist to shape the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The Thunder‑Echo Range, fissure, frost, and hush are integrated through action; the flute and driftwood operate as micro‑settings that constrain choice and charge the finale. Weather/quiet alters tactics (listening, subtle signals), and the mountains’ “breath held” recurs to frame closure. The final image—flute uncased, markers repointed—reweights the space itself. World rules are implied coherently without exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—seal vs. see/follow—tightens as the child’s laughter returns and he chooses to widen the breach. The escalation is an internal deepening under pressure rather than a reversal, but the narrowing of options is clear and paid for by renunciation. A hair more concrete hazard could heighten cost, yet the hush-as-pressure keeps tension credible. The ending choice is protagonist-driven.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from action: wall vs. loom, fear of roar vs. danger in hush, keeping out vs. navigating. The reprise “some doors were meant to open” edges toward declarative but is earned by the concrete choice to widen and cross. Subtext in the child’s non-accusation and the mountains “remembering” resists moralizing. The final image answers the central question without a tidy moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A controlled, lyric third-person with a distinct perceptual signature; rhythm modulates between stillness and intent. Dialogue is minimal but charged with subtext (“You let me in”). No head‑hopping; elision is purposeful and paid off by the final cadence. Diction aligns with Elias’s interiority and the mythic register.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with minimal scaffold; images carry multiple jobs (flute as tool, accusation, and farewell). Figurative language is consistent and legible; repetitions (“The guardianship had…”) are purposeful rather than looped. A few abstract nouns appear, but they don’t drag momentum. The closing sentence lands cleanly without purple overstretch.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The guardian/fissure trope is re‑inflected through a quiet, invitational ethic and object-led tactics (question-note, driftwood markers). The refusal to seal, choosing to follow, feels specific and inevitable by the end. Not radically new, but confidently synthesized with memorable images. Risk-taking in the hush-forward design pays off.</comment>
