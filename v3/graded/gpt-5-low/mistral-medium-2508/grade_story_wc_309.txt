<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Marlin’s motive (penance reframed as a hunt for the sacred in the simple) is clear and consistent, with embodied tells like numb fingers and the candle’s whisper anchoring interiority. His refusal of “mastery” and leaving the keystone registers as a credible renunciation with social cost. Internal contradiction (unremarkable/student failure vs stubborn devotion to imperfection) is present though a touch tidy in the epiphanic beats. The keeper adds pressure without stealing agency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hybrid but dominant Accumulative/Textural drive: the density of “lingering luminance” images builds to a CR/Earned Stasis ending where he leaves the keystone and walks out. Orientation is immediate; the arc (climb → garden shift → return and renunciation) is coherent and causally legible. The cost is on-page (rejecting acclaim and institutional mastery) and charges the final image against the automated hymn. A hair shy of 9+ only because danger and constraint briefly soften (mist-walking deflates the climb’s pressure).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The ice spire, pocket-summer garden, and city of automated hymns are vivid and selectively filtered through Marlin’s eye. Recurring objects (candle, keystone) function as micro-setting that charge the final image. Environmental constraint is strong at the start but partially waived by the “mist walking” reveal, which slightly reduces hard pressure. Still, tone and world rules feel consistent and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—handmade sacred vs automation/institution—tightens through the garden reveal and the dean confrontation. The meaningful turn is Marlin’s refusal: leaving the keystone and exiting with the unruly flame. Pressure is primarily conceptual rather than peril-driven; the treacherous climb is quickly neutralized. Even so, the social/moral cost is legible and earned under the chosen lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically via particulars: the “stub of wax,” the crack in the teacup, and the hollow hymn. The final image (candle roaring “Louder” against automation) offers a resonant answer without stating a moral. One explicit line (“Some things aren’t for explaining.”) edges toward thesis but doesn’t smother subtext. Thematic coherence binds character, world, and action tightly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent; imagery feels owned by this POV (“edges smudged like a sketch”). Dialogue carries subtext and status cleanly (keeper’s dry authority, deans’ mechanistic demand). Rhythm modulates well from climb to garden to Conservatory, with no head-hopping. Diction stays apt, avoiding register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High information density with controlled lyricism; most metaphors are precise and reinforcing. No scaffold loops or cadence templates; sentences vary and propel. A couple of heightened lines risk neatness but don’t blur sense or stall momentum. The final cadence lands cleanly and recharges earlier motifs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>While the “failed student/hidden keeper/keystone” frame is familiar, the synthesis with automation-era art and “lingering luminance” feels fresh. The pocket-garden and the candle’s stubborn sanctity reframe the quest with non-obvious specificity. Risks are taken in tone and concept without obscuring clarity. It stops short of startling invention, but the integration is elegant and memorable.</comment>
