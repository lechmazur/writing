<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Liora’s motives are clear and driven by professional pride, skepticism turned defiance, and a cautious need to prove agency. Interiority is textured and embodied (“pressure in her skull,” “fingers that remembered every notch”). The push-pull between caution and audacity is dramatized in the 48-hour calibration and the risky transmission. The felt cost is modest (job jeopardy and physical strain) but credible at this length.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: signal shifts → Liora infers provocation → she transmits → campus mood alters → the signal “laughs” → she refines → the pattern reconfigures. Orientation is anchored quickly, and the story holds a Hybrid leaning Causal lens to closure. Closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration: the alien stance moves from predatory to curious, reweighting the campus fractures. The cost is present but understated, mostly conceptual and bodily rather than materially escalated.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The old university radio station, headphones, dial, and charts are tactile and purpose‑driven, shaping tactics. The micro‑setting constrains options (locked out of astronomy; basement gear enables her interference) and charges the final image as she reaches for the dial again. Sensory detail is selective and aligned with her expertise without museum‑tour excess. Atmosphere supports the liminal tone of clandestine science and campus unrest.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes—reclaiming agency from an intervening cosmic pattern that’s exacerbating campus schisms—are legible early. Escalation occurs via on‑page tests: her first pulse alters human behavior, the signal retaliates, she recalibrates tighter, and the pattern shifts. The tightening is real though the price feels low; still, the narrowing of options (she must engage, not report or retreat) reads. The final stance is earned by her choices rather than luck.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</rade><comment>Agency vs manipulation, observation vs participation, and scars vs wounds emerge organically from events and images, not moralizing. The reweighted signal—from predatory to curious—mirrors a reframing of institutional conflict as survivable rather than terminal. “Tell them… I was just fixing the radio” carries subtext about power, credit, and quiet resistance. The ending invites reflection without didactic closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The voice blends technical precision with lyric inflection (“nest of angry stars”) in a consistent, character‑bound register. Free‑indirect texture stays tight to Liora’s perception; no head‑hopping. Sparse dialogue lands naturally with subtext and does not break tone. Rhythm modulates with pressure, maintaining clarity through the climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lines carry dual duty—world, pressure, and mood—without scaffold or redundancy. Figurative language is vivid but largely controlled; a few star/static metaphors recur without muddle. Syntax varies and propels action; minor intensifiers never swamp clarity. The final image is clean and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: a clandestine basement broadcast as countermeasure to a meddling cosmic pattern intertwined with campus politics. The subsonic gambit and the signal’s “laughter” feel specific, not generic SF garnish. The reconfiguration to curiosity resists tidy victory while reframing the human fracture. It’s inventive without gimmickry.</comment>
