<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lien’s motive—to mend the sealed dimension through stubborn, compassionate craft—is unwavering and dramatized through embodied micro‑choices (exhale after failure, “pick up the needle,” push on “Now”). Interiority is specific (fear of light, not dark) and tied to tactile acts (needle, breath‑thread). The visible cost—losing the Eulogy and letting her stitches unravel—earns the change from “last human” to “first.” Slightly lyric distance keeps contradiction (dread vs. hope) just shy of maximal bite.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive is clear: repeated stitching attempts deepen pressure until the decisive push opens the tear. Closure lands on‑page with cost: the ship is gone, identity reconfigured, tear seals. Orientation is crisp early (Eulogy, observation deck, birth log), and all set‑ups (photo, Kwan Yin’s tear, gravity flicker) pay off at climax. The causal throughline (try/fail/try/push) reads inevitable within the lyric frame.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The Eulogy’s bone‑ship, gravity flickers, and the photograph function as micro‑settings that constrain tactics and charge the ending. Environmental details evolve with action (ship groans, bones sing; gravity falters during stitching). The world’s rules are shown through use rather than dump. The final image (“She stayed”) is explicitly reweighted by the setting’s loss.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—opening the locked dimension—tightens through a credible failure (thread snaps) and a final, costed push. Agency drives escalation: she chooses to try again, widens the tear, and acts on the AI’s “Now.” The price (sacrifice of the ship and self‑unraveling risk) is legible and reconfigures options. Tension operates at beat and line levels without relying on coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of grief‑work as mending—turning sorrow into passage—emerges through concrete actions (stitching with breath through Kwan Yin’s tear). The “last” becoming the “first” conceptually reprices the premise without moralizing. Recurring images (needle, thread, photo, gravity) return with new weight at the end (“She stayed”). Emotional aftereffect is earned, not asserted.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice sustains ghostly resolve while remaining legible under pressure. POV is stable and modest; the AI’s few lines add texture without head‑hopping. Diction and rhythm modulate with the climax (“Now,” “She pushed”) for clean emphasis. No helpful‑narrator drift or register slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sentences carry multiple jobs with minimal scaffold; images are precise and non‑redundant. Figurative density is high but coherent (“ship of bones,” “ladder of light”) and advances sense. Rhythm varies and accelerates toward climax without muddle. One or two near‑echoes are present but do not slow momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis—bone ship bolted with prayers, Kwan Yin’s encoded compassion, breath‑thread through a tear in a photograph—feels singular and inevitable in hindsight. The stitching act as cosmic engineering is both fresh and character‑true. The risk of lyric abstraction is avoided by tactile specificity and cost. The last‑to‑first reframing lands as a bold, coherent risk.</comment>
