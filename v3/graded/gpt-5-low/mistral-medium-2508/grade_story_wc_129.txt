<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Reed’s motive (to complete the arbor and catalyze belonging) is clear and her actions align, especially the choice to organize the search against elders’ caution. Interiority is embodied through tactile, craft‑specific perceptions (reeds, obsidian, paint). Internal contradiction is modest; risk and doubt could surface more viscerally at the decision point. The visible cost is social vulnerability rather than a sharp loss, but it reads credible at this length.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Hybrid lens leaning causal: seeing the tag → organizing the search → finding Syl → communal dedication → reweighted final image. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: belonging becomes an enacted current, not a place, with cost shown in risk and Syl’s departure. Orientation is crisp early; the single scene proceeds cleanly from dusk to dawn. Escalation is gentle but coherent and sufficient for the scale.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The crystalline orchard, obsidian arbor, and Shimmer Crater are vivid and character‑filtered; their properties (reflective light, humming languages, dangerous beauty) shape movement and meaning. The arbor constrains the dedication act and charges the final image with communal handprints. World rules remain consistent and learned through action. Minor note: the environment’s physical stakes are felt more atmospherically than perilously.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (forging kinship/completing dedication) stays in focus and tightens when Reed defies elders and chooses a communal search. The encounter with Syl reweights the goal from finding to making together; the reversal (Syl at the lip, not the heart) is effective. Cost is primarily reputational/emotional rather than material, but it meaningfully narrows the path (accepting Syl’s elusiveness). Tension is quiet yet sustained.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Themes of kinship as active practice and language as invitation are earned through images (reeds bending, tags shifting from “I” to “We,” handprints constellation). Subtext in the exchange—Reed’s “But we did”—carries the piece’s ethic without sermonizing. One sentence edges toward thesis (“belonging was not a place, but a current”), but it’s supported by enacted beats. The closing reprices the crater’s “lost languages” into a communal call.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyric third‑person with a sculptor’s sensory bias feels distinct and controlled; diction stays consistent with the world’s logic. Dialogue is spare and subtextual, doing work without over‑explaining. Rhythm modulates well from searching hush to dawn clarity. No head‑hopping or stance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is tight: images carry double duty, and sentences avoid scaffolding and redundancy. Figurative density is high but coherent; motifs (reeds, light, language) recur with precision. Pacing is efficient, with paragraphs earning their keep and the last image cleanly landing. No notable mechanical or cadence artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—lyric fabulism, street tagging as kinship ritual, crystalline orchard and language‑humming crater—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The “I/We” tag shift as ritual dedication is an elegant pivot. Risks are aesthetic rather than structural and they pay off without obscuring clarity. Emotional truth matches the novelty of the world.</comment>
