<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lena’s motive—building maps to navigate loss—flows cleanly from the lighthouse failure and her nightly labor, and her micro‑choices (translating riddles, phoning the woman, placing the censer on the sketch) reveal a steady endurance over magical thinking. Interiority is specific and embodied (“ache in her ribs,” listening to the censer). Internal contradiction is present but quiet (skepticism vs. ritualized belief), keeping the piece more stoic than combative. The earned refusal at the end (“And she would build”) feels true to her limits and cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the patterned calls, lunar modulation, and censer reprises build toward a Charged Poise closure: Lena recommits to her practice with a lighter chest. Orientation is crisp from the first lines (who/where/when clear). The cost—ongoing grief and endurance—lands in the final image, with the censer “listening” and the fresh sheet feeding forward. Escalation is subtle but coherent, tightening through the live call where she says, “Start walking.”</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The signal station, antennas, and sea air are vivid and purposeful, shaping the means (radio/phone) and mood of the work. The censer functions as a charged micro‑setting object, returning in the final image to reweight meaning. Sensory detail is selective and POV‑driven (salt wind, rust, relay clicks) without museum‑tour excess. The environment frames and pressures her choices while tonally mirroring the interior weather.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (can she make a way back for the lost and herself) is signaled early and tightens at the mid‑story phone exchanges. Escalation remains mostly tonal and procedural, with one clear agency beat: calling the woman and instructing “Start walking.” The price is an ongoing acceptance of grief in lieu of rescue; the narrative forecloses the fantasy of literal salvation. Still, conflict stays muted, prioritized as endurance over confrontation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Reverse migration, maps as anchors, and the censer’s “listening” braid into a resonant meditation on grief-work and making meaning. Subtext operates through riddle‑coordinates and tidal cycles rather than stated morals. The last cadence reweights prior images into “raw solace,” eschewing neat healing. Ambiguity is purposeful—are callers ghosts, fishermen, or aspects of self—without muddying the core inquiry.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The voice is steady, lyrical, and controlled, with imagery that feels native to the character’s sensibility. Dialogue is spare and charged, carrying subtext and action (“The way back”). POV distance stays consistent, with no head‑hopping or unearned omniscience. Rhythm modulates well between description and moment-to-moment beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is tight: high information density, clean syntax, and purposeful metaphors that stay within the maritime/signal lexicon. No looped scaffolding or template cadence; sentences work double duty for mood and action. The figurative texture is rich without purple drift or muddle. Final lines land crisply with image rather than explanation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis—signal station mediumship, lunar‑phased calls, a salvaged censer as listener, “reverse migration” maps—feels distinct and inevitable in hindsight. The piece takes a risk on quiet, accumulative pressure and earns its ending without gimmickry. Emotional truth is particular and avoids generic grief tropes. The final reconfiguration is both surprising and right.</comment>
