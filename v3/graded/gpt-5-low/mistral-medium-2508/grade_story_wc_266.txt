<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Clear, embodied interiority with a credible contradiction: a lifelong crosser who discovers the courage of staying. Small, specific actions (pressing the star into her palm; not retrieving the punch) reveal values under pressure. Motivation is consistent and intensifies toward renunciation. Minor safety in the communal validation line (“Now you’re one of us.”) slightly softens the edge of her solitude.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterns of light, water, and the star stamp densify until the renunciation lands. Closure is Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she lets the punch go and forecloses the path of ferrying with an on‑page cost (loss of role/tool). Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph and the beat sequence is coherent. The decisive beat is legible: the tool arcs away; she chooses not to retrieve it.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The ridgeway, mist, fires, and water are sensorially vivid and filtered through Liora’s vocation. The ticket punch operates as micro‑setting/object that charges the final image. The environment (threshold space where land hesitates) mirrors and constrains choices, making staying legible as a viable act. Tactile and auditory details (damp wool, creaking wood, lullaby) deepen atmosphere without drag.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around a single stake: cross again or remain. Escalation is a measured tightening—imprint of the star, raised punch, and the refusal to retrieve it—appropriate to the chosen lens. The cost is felt and alters options going forward. The wind nudge slightly externalizes the peak but her non‑action is an intentional, costly choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Themes of witness, earned pause, and the value of non‑crossings emerge organically through image and act. The star stamp’s reweighting (from marking others to marking herself) carries genuine resonance. However, “the most important crossings are the ones you don’t make” states the thesis too directly in the final movement, dulling subtext. Otherwise, ambiguity around dawn and vigil sustains afterglow.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct, lyrical perceptual signature with disciplined cadence and apt metaphors (“where the land hesitated before becoming water”). POV remains stable and modest; dialogue is spare, subtextual, and advances the central pressure. Rhythm modulates well toward the closing hush. No head‑hopping or register slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High information density with minimal scaffolding; images do multiple jobs. Figurative language is controlled and mostly fresh; repetition patterns feel intentional. A few overt formulations edge toward proclamation, but they don’t muddy the closure image. Syntax and paragraphing support momentum and the final settle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The ferry guide mythos with a ticket punch and vigil‑keepers is a fresh inflection on psychopomp/threshold lore. The renunciation twist (courage as staying) is not novel in concept but is executed with specificity and felt cost. Recurring objects and sensory motifs cohere into a singular vision. Risk is quiet but confident, avoiding gimmickry.</comment>
