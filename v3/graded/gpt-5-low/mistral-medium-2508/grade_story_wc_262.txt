<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—recovering the “goodbye letters” embedded in film—is precise and drives every micro‑choice, culminating in the renunciation implied by turning off the projector. Interiority is embodied (“hunting for the place where unused love went to die”; “thief of echoes”) and character‑specific. The contradiction between theft and release lands at the end without tidy self‑explanation. Minor risk of lyric self‑mythologizing, but it stays in character and under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: tactile actions with the reel, crystal, and projector escalate a pattern that reweights the stake. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis/Charged Poise): she accepts the goodbye and forecloses the search by letting the dark have its say. Cost is legible on the page in the final refusal and interior shift. Orientation is clear early; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The projection booth, storm, reels, and crystal are sensorially vivid and functionally constraining—she must use the booth’s tools to access the letters. The environment charges the final image (projector off, darkness accepted). Details stay POV‑filtered (ozone, old paper, cracked lenses) and integrate with action. World rules (psychometry via film) are taught through use, not exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake is early and coherent: retrieve or reframe the “unused love.” Pressure deepens through a pattern break (letters are absence between frames; the “place” is a when), and the storm’s crest coincides with the internal tilt. The earned renunciation (turning off the projector) carries a clear price: ending the chase and accepting goodbye. Escalation is subtle but decisive under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme arises from particulars: light that “is always hungry,” love stored as absence, and a goodbye heard in silence rather than words. The final image reweights the premise—unused love as waiting for “the right hands” to turn the reel—without moralizing. Subtext hums in the choice to shut off the projector. No sermonizing; resonance lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a strong perceptual signature; cadence flexes with pressure (storm break, stuttering images, quiet ending). The quoted lines function as hauntings rather than expository dialogue. Diction is controlled and character‑coherent. No head‑hopping or stance drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is lush yet purposeful; metaphors (“thief of echoes,” “light…hungry”) remain coherent and support action. Minimal scaffolding and no noticeable loops; sentences pull forward with varied rhythm. Slight risk of purple in concentration, but clarity and momentum hold through the peak and closure. Final line lands cleanly without over‑explaining.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—crystal gazer psychometry + film reels as repositories for unsent love—is fresh and organically executed. The revaluation (letters as absence, place as a “when”) feels inevitable in hindsight. Bold, non‑gimmicky risk pays off in form and image. Memorable voice and concept integrity elevate beyond trope.</comment>
