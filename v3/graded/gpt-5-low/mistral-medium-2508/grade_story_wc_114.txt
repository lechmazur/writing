<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Liora’s interior contradictions are vivid: “fault‑tolerant oracle” who trembles at the barometer and lives in the margins. Her ambivalence about warning versus silence feels rooted in character, not plot convenience. The final renunciation (stepping into the storm) is earned by the accumulated tactile tells (ozone, blood, ravens, hygrometer). A minor opacity remains around why she withholds the radio warning beyond theme, shaving some force from motive clarity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single‑scene pressure coheres under a Situational lens; the storm’s immediacy forces a stance and forecloses the “warn them” path. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she chooses silence and exposure; the cost is legible (vanishing footprints, ledgers recording inevitability). Orientation is clear from the outset (mountain station, oracle, radio). A slight ellipsis around consequences for the valley keeps it from absolute maximality but does not undercut closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The station, instruments, and weather function as lived constraints (barometer dips, radio crackles, ice shears) that shape choice and charge the ending image. Sensory specificity across smell (ozone, wet stone), sound (groaning ribs), and touch (frost-laced window) is purposeful and POV‑filtered. The final choreography (footprints erased, lightning under aurora) converts setting into consequence. No tourist cataloguing; every detail earns its keep.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (“warn or accept/renounce”) is posed early and tightens when the wind shifts and she realizes the storm breaks now. The barometer’s decisive dip and her movement to the door crystallize cost, collapsing options into a charged refusal. Internal and external pressures interweave cleanly without false antagonists. Slight distance remains regarding what, beyond self‑cost, is lost by not broadcasting, keeping it just shy of peak intensity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: living in margins, the price of truth, and the instability of certainty are dramatized through instruments, ravens, and the smudged aconitum. The illustration reweights as “wings” at the end, reframing poison/medicine into release/erasure. No moral is stated; the final images make the conceptual cost undeniable. The auroral sorrow and swallowed truth cohere into a resonant, non‑literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third‑close voice with a distinct perceptual signature (technics + omen reading) sustains pressure without slipping register. Diction modulates under stress (“The wind carried her name away”) while staying within plausible lexicon for this character. Elisions are purposeful and paid off at closure. No head‑hopping or stance wobble.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density and clean rhythm; images do more than one job (e.g., hygrometer stutter as truth‑meter). Lyricism is lush but disciplined; metaphors align with world and do not tangle. Minimal scaffold or loops; repetition (“margins”) is motif, not padding. A hair’s breadth from purple in a couple lines, but clarity holds at the peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Weather‑oracle in a mountain station, truth as burden, and the aconitum smudge synthesize into a fresh angle on forecast and fate. The refusal to warn as the decisive act is non‑obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Risks in lyric compression and motif stacking enhance rather than obscure stakes. The final reconfiguration (wings/aurora/erasure) feels singular and memorable.</comment>
