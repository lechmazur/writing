<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elias’s restraint, ritual, and gradual surrender to connection read specific and earned (“He wasn’t superstitious, but the glass felt like a promise”). Contradictory impulses surface credibly (burning letters vs. climbing, pocketing the glass vs. returning it). Micro‑choices under pressure—lighting the candle, keeping the glass, writing back—align with his need for safety/meaning. The final renunciation (letting the skiff rot) carries felt cost and closes a path.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive holds: recurring bottles, stones, and glass reweight the central stake until “Stay” crystallizes choice. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: he refuses departure, commits to the tower, with the visible price named on‑page (“The skiff would rot at the dock”). Orientation is clear from the start and the pattern taught early pays off at the ending image. No causality breaks; each step coheres as a motivated intensification.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The lighthouse and lantern room are tactile and operative: rust, wax, mist, and the stacked stones shape action and ritual. The sea glass functions as a charged micro‑setting object that constrains choices (keep or return) and powers the final image. Environmental rules stay consistent and the space breathes with the character’s interior weather. The setting’s pressure directly informs tactics (climb, build a spiral/door).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—remain isolated or accept the tower’s communal “haunting”—tightens through the letters escalating from cryptic to imperative (“Stay”). The key tightening is Elias opting to keep the glass and write back, culminating in abandoning the skiff; this forecloses a life‑line with a concrete cost. Pressure is quiet but coherent under the chosen lens, with the stone spiral’s growth as escalation. Slightly soft on external jeopardy, but internal stakes carry convincingly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: safety as a communal relay (“the hands that passed the light between them”) rather than storm absence. Recurring images (glass, breath, held note) shift meaning by the end, avoiding moralizing. The final lines reprice the premise—the lamp is dead; the light persists through human continuity—without stating a thesis. Ambiguity is purposeful; sentiment is earned through particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A controlled, lyric third‑limited voice with a distinct perceptual signature—maritime tactility, ritualized noticing—never wavers. Rhythm modulates with pressure; syntax tightens at choices and breathes in reflection. No head‑hopping or register drift; inference stays within plausible knowledge. The prose pattern is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is clean, economical, and musical; most sentences carry dual duty (image and motive). Refrains (“held breath/note”) verge on recurrence but feel patterned rather than purple. No scaffold or synonym loops; momentum holds through accumulation. Minor risk of motif overuse is controlled and does not fog the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Ghosts that “leave things” and stone‑stacking as a safety lock feel fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The bottle‑letters and humming spiral innovate within a lighthouse frame without gimmickry. The conceptual pivot—community as the living light—lands with originality and emotional integrity. Risks in lyric accumulation heighten stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
