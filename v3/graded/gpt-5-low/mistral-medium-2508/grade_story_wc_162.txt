<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clear, escalating motivation (find/protect Liora) evolves into a risked acceptance of her autonomy. Interiority is embodied and specific—wood grain as arrow, crows gone quiet—revealing contradictory impulses (rescue vs. respect). The final choice to hand her the logbook and not extract her feels earned with visible cost. Minor convenience in his symbolic leaps (grain reading) keeps it shy of flawless.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hybrid drive (causal clues within a textural build) holds: logbook → terrace grain → note → sinkhole → exchange. Closure lands as a charged poise/earned stasis: he renounces control and chooses to join/learn, with cost implied in not “saving” her. No orientation debt; pressure coheres and tightens to a meaningful reconfiguration. A hair shy of 9+ due to slight reliance on intuitive leaps rather than concrete impediments.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and functional: maze design, terrace shimmer, sinkhole, and chair‑leg ladder constrain and direct choices. Sensory specificity (kerosene/salt, “poorly aimed scissors,” “fractured hush”) supports tone and tactics. The environment charges the final image (fireflies, wind rising, story refolding) and guides action. World rules remain consistent within its numinous logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find Liora vs. honor the threshold) is signaled early and deepened when “The center isn’t the middle” reframes the search. The key tightening forces a trade‑off: extract the child or accept her crossing; he chooses the latter at a cost. Tension operates across beats without an antagonist, coherently under the chosen lens. Slight softness in concrete risk keeps it just below elite.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Themes of thresholds, sacred attention, and “necessary distances” emerge through concrete actions and reprises (maze logic → sinkhole center → refusal to pull her out). The final image reweights prior material without didactic summary. One near‑thesis line (“Some thresholds need to be crossed alone”) edges toward explicitness, modestly reducing subtlety. Overall resonance is strong and lingering.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third‑person closely tracks Elias’s perceptions with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic modulation. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful and character‑specific. No head‑hopping or stance drift; elision is taught and paid off. Elevated diction remains voice‑motivated, with only minor risk of over‑poeticization under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density with images doing multiple jobs; minimal scaffold and no loops. Metaphor is fresh and largely disciplined, with varied rhythm and clean mechanics. A few stacked figuratives flirt with purple but do not blur causality or dull the closure. Final line cadence lands cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: a maze architect father, a pilot’s logbook, a sinkhole‑center, and chair‑leg ladder reframe a missing‑child search into a numinous rite. Turns feel earned by seeded particulars (“The center isn’t the middle,” BFE‑7, terrace grain). Risks in tone and imagery heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. The vision feels singular and memorable.</comment>
