<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s motive—revision over revenge—is clear, character‑specific, and drives his tactics; his choice to risk and then spend the shard for proof aligns with that core hunger. Interiority is textured (“he did not fear fragments. He collected them.”), and the small status clash with Taelis sharpens him. The cost lands in character terms: he loses the shard and forecloses further attempts for the sake of one charged demonstration. Slightly limited internal contradiction keeps it just shy of the top band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Hybrid leaning Accumulative lens holds: preparation → storm → ritual → refracted reassembly → loss, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing (“It isn’t history…It’s poetry.”). Closure is on‑page with cost (the shard becomes dust; the mirrors remain covered; the archaeologists’ stance is reweighted). Orientation is immediate and clean; single scene coherence never wavers. The persistent constraint of the environment (storm/time‑threads) shapes options and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid, cathedral, storm, and time‑threads are not just vivid; they constrain choice and enable the ritual, charging the final image (“did not mind the sight of time”). Details are POV‑filtered through an architect‑poet’s sensibility, avoiding tourist catalog. The storm’s charged particles and covered mirrors function as micro‑setting tools with consequences. Spatial and rule consistency stay tight across the vision beat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—wresting the Republic’s legacy from reductive archaeology—is clear and tightens as Elias escalates from theory to risky demonstration. The vision’s three‑breath restoration is a decisive intensification, and the price (sacrificed shard) is unmistakable. Pressure is protagonist‑driven; Taelis’s arrival adds direct external heat. Slightly soft moral calculus (the dispute ends quickly) keeps it just under the top.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme arises from action: reframing history as lived texture rather than extractive data, embodied in the ritual and final acceptance of time’s beauty. The line “It isn’t history…It’s poetry” risks explicitness but is earned by the specific demonstration and Elias’s identity. The ending’s quiet reweighting lingers, neither tidy nor sermonized. Ambiguity about the archaeologists’ future stance deepens resonance rather than blurring it.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third‑person closely tracks Elias’s perceptual signature—architect’s tangibility and poet’s metaphor—without head‑hopping. Diction and rhythm modulate with pressure, and dialogue is minimal yet effective, carrying status and subtext. No register slips; the cadence supports both ritual and confrontation. The voice remains singular through the climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density with purposeful imagery; lines do multiple jobs without scaffolding. Figurative language is rich but coherent and taught early; no mixed metaphors dull the peak beats. Minor lushness remains under control and never obscures action or cost. Final image is crisp and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Time as visible strands, a refractive relic, storm‑splintered mirrors, and a revolutionary‑poet reframing archaeology feel fresh and organically fused. The central turn—poetry as a mode of proof—surprises yet feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk‑taking in concept and tone heightens stakes without confusing rules. The synthesis reads singular rather than stitched from genre templates.</comment>
