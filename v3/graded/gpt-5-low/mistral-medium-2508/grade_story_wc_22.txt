<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and particular—he aims to coax life back into a scarred place—and his actions align (seed‑work, mapping hums). Interiority is embodied through tactile choices (breaking pods, salt, listening), but we get little contradictory impulse or live doubt. The renunciation of credit/markers reads as cost, though it’s quiet. A stronger on‑page friction testing his resolve would lift this.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: image density builds from jetty ritual → nocturnal planning → years‑later repricing of the site. Closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration: the garden’s persistence and sweeter water reweight the coachman’s quiet labor with a felt cost (anonymity, mortality). Orientation is clean early; the single time jump pays off. The cost is implicit rather than dramatized in-scene, but it’s legible in the ending image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful: the jetty’s slick stones, dead reef, tide, and bones guide tactics (where he sows, when he trusts the tide). Environment charges the final image—the glowing jetty and “sweeter” water—and the salt constraint frames the feat. Sensory detail is rich across senses (taste of iron/salt, sound of birds, textures). World rules feel consistent within a subtle magic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes are singular (land’s reclamation) and pressure coheres through a textural tightening: pockets empty, refusal to witness, trust over proof. The main turn is a cadence shift into renunciation and deferred payoff. On‑page price is modest but present (choosing trust and anonymity; returning tomorrow with darker seeds). A more acute present-tense test would sharpen escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Themes of regeneration, memory, and non‑human concord accrue through concrete acts (bird‑guided sowing, seeds humming, bones as soil) without moralizing. The ending reweights earlier images—the jetty, reef, salt—into a quiet, earned repricing (sweetness where there was sorrow). “Slow, green vengeance” is memorable and complex, avoiding tidy binaries. Subtext hums in the refusal of markers and the birds as witnesses.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is controlled, lyrical, and coherent to the coachman’s perceptual bias (wind, birds, soil textures). Rhythm modulates well between incantatory sentences and taut actions; no head‑hopping. Occasional elevated diction fits the mythic register and remains legible. The lyric distance never breaks plausibility for what this POV can infer.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Line craft is taut and image‑dense with few redundancies; metaphors are coherent and grounded in the sea/soil lexicon. Variation in sentence length supports momentum and hush. A hint of purple risk is managed by tethering images to action (“He did not pray… but whispered the old words”). No loops or scaffold dull the closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: a coachman as coastal hortomancer, seeds that hum, birds as cartographers of grief, a jetty healed to sweetness. The years‑later repricing avoids cliché and feels inevitable in hindsight. Risks (lyric mythos, quiet plot) heighten coherence rather than obscure it. The piece commits fully to its singular vision.</comment>
