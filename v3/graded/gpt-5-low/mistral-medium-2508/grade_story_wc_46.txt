<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Liora’s motives and worldview are precise and embodied—her refusal of flame and devotion to “kept” light drive every choice. The grief thread (Elias, the grandmother’s “pearl of stillness”) deepens her stance without melodrama. The on‑page renunciation—giving the sea glass to the child—reveals values under pressure. Internal contradiction is subtle (solitude vs. transmission) but present and credible for this length.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the scene densifies until the arrival of the child reframes stake from private ritual to lineage transfer. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: Liora passes the glass and forecloses the solitary keeper path with a felt conceptual cost. Orientation is clean early (grotto, night, vocation). The cost is quiet but legible in the renunciation and the friction with village norms.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The grotto and mist are tactile, recurring, and character‑filtered; quartz veins like constellations create an atmospheric mirror to the theme. Setting actively charges the final image and shelters the ritual, giving the transfer a sanctum distinct from village torches. Object-as-setting (sea glass) interlocks with place. Minor repetition (“serpentine”) doesn’t dull the effect.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes clarify early (how to keep light without fire) and tighten with the girl’s request, forcing Liora to choose between solitary guardianship and transmission. The renunciation (giving the sea glass) carries a tangible price and reconfigures roles. Pressure is primarily internal and situational, appropriate for the lens, though the external counterpressure (villagers) stays offstage. The escalation is quiet but decisive.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme coheres through particulars: polishing as praxis, “pearl of stillness,” fire vs. kept light, and the village’s torches. The closing “They would call it a miracle. Liora would call it Tuesday.” reweights the miraculous against practiced devotion with wry restraint. The “become light” line risks didacticism but is earned by lineage and action. Subtext hums in the contrast between consumption (fire) and endurance (keeping).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice—sea‑bound, patient, tactile—stays consistent and character‑plausible. Dialogue is minimal but natural and subtextual, advancing the turn (“Not how to make fire. How to keep it.”). Psychic distance modulates smoothly from image to thought. No head‑hopping or stance leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High line‑level craft with strong image economy; most sentences pull double duty for mood and meaning. Lyric density edges purple in places (stacked serpent/mist metaphors), but rhythm and clarity hold. Repetition serves motif more than padding, and endings of paragraphs land with force. No noticeable loops or scaffolding that sap momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The keeper-of-light premise feels renewed through sea glass craft, the grotto’s breath, and the “pearl of stillness” ethic. The transfer scene avoids sentimentality and lands with specific ritual texture. While fire vs. gentler light is a familiar polarity, it’s executed with freshness and restraint. The “Tuesday” tag is a crisp, memorable risk that pays off.</comment>
