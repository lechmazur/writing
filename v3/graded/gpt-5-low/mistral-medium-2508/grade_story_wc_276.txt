<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>His cool-headed endurance and grief are embodied through tactile choices—pressing a palm to soil, “voicing silence,” releasing the shard—rather than declared. The internal conflict (longing for his daughter versus refusing the counterfeit echo) sharpens under pressure and culminates in a costly renunciation. Micro-choices track his hierarchy of values cleanly (digging where the soil “refused to hum,” letting the shard bleed into the garden). A slight remove from visceral destabilization under peak stress keeps this just shy of perfect.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, beats escalate coherently: restless garden → false name → mouth in the earth → command of silence → costed release. Closure is an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise hybrid: he restores pattern and chooses the lasting silence over the seductive echo, with visible price (blackened stems, “daughter’s voice finally stopped calling”). Orientation is crisp from the outset; no lens ambiguity at the end. The net, rail spike, and stars reprise to bind causality without explaining away mystery.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The sound wave garden is not decor; its rules guide tactics (reading the hums, digging where silence is) and exact cost (stems blacken). Objects-as-setting—rail spike, net, teeth—charge the final image and constrain choices. World rules are learned through action (constellations “sleepwalking,” the mouth’s echo-teeth) with sensory breadth (subsonic pulses, reeds, warmth, damp). Tone and atmosphere are unified and purposeful without slipping into postcard description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—refusing the counterfeit voice to restore pattern—is clear and tightens decisively when the pebbles spell his daughter’s name and the mouth opens. He escalates by commanding silence, then paying the price to purge the shard and accept loss. The stars snapping back evidences consequence tied to his choice. A single contained deepening rather than multiple turns fits length; the only limit is a slight cushion around the final aftermath.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: grief, temptation by echo, and the ethics of silence over simulacrum. Recurring images (sleepwalking constellations, the rail spike, the net, reeds) shift meaning at the end to articulate a stance without moralizing. “For the silence after” and “his daughter’s voice finally stopped calling” deliver a resonant, non-literal answer with felt cost. The ambiguity of the last smile sustains reflection without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The lyric third-person close carries a distinct perceptual signature—acoustic metaphors and disciplined restraint consistent with the fisher’s craft and temperament. Psychic distance modulates under pressure yet remains stable; no head-hopping or register drift. Patterned elision (voicing silence, echo-teeth) is taught and paid off. The prose’s cadence tightens at turns (command, release) with controlled certainty befitting the POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line-to-line craft is precise, image-dense, and largely multipurposed; the rhythm breathes with the scene. Figurative textures stay coherent to the acoustic/echo lexicon, avoiding mixed metaphors. Minor redundancy (“He would melt it down tomorrow. Or he would use it to dig.”) reads as purposeful poise rather than fluff. A touch of lushness in places keeps it shy of immaculate minimalism, but clarity and propulsion hold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of a “sound wave garden,” voicing silence as method, and a mouth made of echo-teeth feels singular and inevitable in hindsight. Familiar grief tropes are transformed by specific, rule-bound strangeness and disciplined stance. The rail spike/net craft details ground the surreal, and the stars’ sleepwalking offers a fresh cosmological pressure. Risk-taking is high yet coherent, with no gimmickry.</comment>
