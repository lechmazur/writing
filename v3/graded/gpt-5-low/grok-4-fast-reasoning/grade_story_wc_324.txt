<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s motives and methods are clear and consistent, and her agency drives each turn. Interiority is evocative but light on contradiction; she faces little internal friction when stakes rise. Her “contact tracer for hearts” identity reads specific and embodied, especially in the tool use. The ending choice is credible but carries limited on-page cost or renunciation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Causal throughline is clean: tip → investigation → discovery → realization → confrontation. Orientation is strong and the closure lands with a tangible decision that preserves the atrium. Cost is underplayed—Mira’s acceptance is too smooth—softening the impact of the final turn. Still, the locket/photo/hearing-aid chain pays off coherently.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The sanatorium atrium and mist are vividly rendered and integrated with action (pedestal, hidden compartment, skylight light). The hearing aid functions as a tool-shaped micro-setting that constrains search tactics and charges the final image. Sensory selection tracks Elara’s profession and moment-to-moment goals. The environment’s pressure is more tonal than obstructive, but it meaningfully guides choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stakes are clear—preserve the voices/atrium—but escalation is gentle: pulses spike, urgency rises, then quick persuasion. There’s no credible loss, pushback, or trade-off on the page; Mira’s compliance reduces pressure at the climax. The tightening is present but not testing. The result reads earned yet low-friction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Memory, stewardship, and “voices that endure” cohere without overt moralizing. The closing image reweights caretaking as lineage, and “incidental heroism” fits Elara’s modest stance. Subtext hums in the object chain (photo/locket/aid) rather than being declared. Thematic complexity is solid if not deeply ambivalent.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The voice is lyrical with a consistent perceptual signature (“reeling hush,” damp velvet) and stable close-third focalization. Diction suits Elara’s attentional habits and profession. Dialogue is minimal but functional. Rhythm modulates well without head-hopping or stance drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Line-level craft is polished, with vivid images and purposeful syntax; most sentences carry multiple jobs. A few purple flashes and clusters of metaphor risk saturation but don’t compromise clarity. Minimal scaffolding or loops; information flows cleanly. The final lines land crisp without expository drag.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>“Contact tracing for hearts” and the hearing-aid pulse-mapping feel fresh and organically fused to plot. The sanatorium’s emotional residue conceit is handled with specificity rather than genre shorthand. The resolution is conventional in its persuasion beat, slightly muting overall ingenuity. Still, the core synthesis reads memorable.</comment>
