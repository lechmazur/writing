<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elias’s goal is clear and embodied through tactile choices (carrying the tuning fork case through the wreck; initiating the scan despite trauma). His interiority leans summary-lyric rather than conflicted beat-by-beat struggle, but the bodily cues (frostbite, sweat under the scan) ground it. The relationship with Lira adds gentle pressure and enables a cooperative arc. The resolution tilts tidy—his transformation faces little friction—but it reads earned within the piece’s scale.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Orientation is crisp by the second paragraph (who/where/constraint) and causality is clean: scan → translation → communal resonance. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Elias reframes survival into purpose, with the conservatory transformed into an instrument. The persistent constraint (no noise) shapes tactics to the end. The cost is felt more than dramatized; the trauma-to-amber shift risks smoothness but still carries weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The winterglass dome, bioluminescent flora, and heat-map orbs are vivid and functional, not postcard décor. The silence rule and subsonic speakers concretely constrain action and make the tactic plausible. Recurring objects (tuning forks, orbs) charge the final image as plants “sway” in synchronized light. The setting and tools feel lived-in and essential to the outcome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes are focused (rectify silence/trauma into music that heals), and pressure coheres as the scan visualizes jagged reds that soften through tuned vibration. Escalation is present—solo attempt to duet to ensemble—but resistance is light and largely internal. The decisive turns come from Elias’s agency, yet choices rarely foreclose options or exact a concrete price. The piece privileges deepening over friction, which keeps intensity modest.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Themes of transmuting catastrophe into communal resonance are integrated through images (tuning forks, heat-maps, bioluminescence syncing). The final lines verge on thesis-stating (“silence… canvas,” “alchemy”) but remain supported by enacted beats. Subtext in gesture and shared glances works; the “unshaken marvels” motif reweights the world without sermonizing. A hair more ambiguity or cost would lift the resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>A controlled close third maintains a consistent lyric register suited to the concept; no head-hopping, no stance slippage. Diction (“winterglass,” “emotion heat-mappers”) feels owned by this world and focalizer. Modulation under pressure (shorter, tactile beats around the scan and sweat) is apt. Occasionally elevated phrasing risks purple but stays coherent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is lush and image-dense, with generally clean syntax and purposeful cadence. Minor repetition (“silently expressive,” “unshaken marvels”) and a few abstract nouns (“motivation,” “harmony”) flirt with overstatement. Most lines do multiple jobs; momentum holds through the central action. No significant loops or figurative muddle blunt the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The premise—post-seismic silence with emotion heat-mapping translated via subsonics—is fresh and integrated with character history (musician, tuning forks). The conservatory as instrument and plants syncing light to vibration feel inventively inevitable. Risks are aesthetic rather than structural, and they pay off. The ease of the healing arc tempers the overall audacity slightly.</comment>
