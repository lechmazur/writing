<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s drive to quantify feeling coheres with her soul-borrowing habit and the letterpress craft, and her backfire-induced disorientation reveals a credible contradiction: hunger for order vs. lived chaos. The channeling of the astronomer’s melancholy is dramatized, not labeled, and affects her on-page choices. The final repricing—accepting pattern-as-flow rather than arithmetic—feels earned. The cost is felt in her loss of control and relinquishing the neat “equation” she sought.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: preparation → printing → backfire → realization, all in one continuous window with a clean final cadence shift. Orientation is early and stable, and the halo fragment’s role links beats coherently. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing with on-page cost (disorientation, a foreclosed path to tidy math). Tight focus avoids outline-y “and then” sequencing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The topaz workshop, polluted sky, and halo fragment are vividly integrated and filtered through her craft-trained perception. The environment and tool charge the final image (stars’ last flicker; halo-as-mirror), shaping meaning rather than serving as postcard. Sensory selection (oil, heated topaz, press thump) feels purposeful. World rules are consistent and learned via action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—impose math on emotion—tightens when the press/halo turns her method against her. The backfire is the key deepening; tearing the broadsheet and recalibrating stance forecloses the “pure equation” path. The price is more interior than external, but it’s legible and charges the ending. A slightly clearer trade-off or external constraint would heighten pressure further.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme arises from particulars: letterpress as imprint, halo fragment as refractor, borrowing selves as a flawed bridge to connection. The ending offers a resonant answer—pattern as turbulent flow and shared feeling—without moralizing. Ambiguity is purposeful, not muddy, and the broadsheet’s design mirrors the story’s conceptual move. No pseudo-profundity; the insight is earned through the backfire.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>A consistent close-third lyric voice with controlled cadence; diction (“lucid turbulence,” “transposed empathy”) fits the speculative-artisanal milieu. Rhythm modulates with pressure, and focalization stays tight to Elara. A few rich phrasings flirt with purple but don’t breach clarity. No dialogue needed; interior texture carries subtext.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lines pull multiple duties (world-building, emotion, concept) with clean syntax and momentum. Minor lushness and recurrence of key coinages risk saturation but remain purposeful. No scaffold loops or filter-verb stacks; images are coherent and sensorially grounded. The final line recharges motifs without overexplaining.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Letterpress + celestial shard + empathy-as-variable is a fresh synthesis executed through concrete craft action. The backfire pivot and halo-as-mirror avoid template beats and feel inevitable in hindsight. Risks in diction and concept pay off without obscuring clarity. The piece commits to its premise rather than hedging.</comment>
