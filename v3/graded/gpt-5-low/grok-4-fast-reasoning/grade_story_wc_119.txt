<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear motive (to “transpose” his life) drives concrete choices (using microdots, distributing cookies, handing one to Maris). Interiority is specific and embodied (salt, fog, chill), with a flicker of contradictory impulse when the prophetic echo chills him. Relationship pressure with Maris is light but functional. The cost is mostly anticipatory rather than felt, limiting depth at the final turn.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Single continuous arc with clean anchors (pub → lighthouse → encounter with Maris) and a coherent throughline. Closure lands as a charged poise: the island’s before/after is legible as visitors will be summoned and secrecy reweighted. Causality holds; coincidence (Maris’s dream) complicates rather than resolves. Cost at closure is conceptual more than dramatized, keeping it short of the highest band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vivid, selective atmosphere (stale ale, salt spray, fog, beam) filtered through Elias’s priorities. The lighthouse, beam, and fog recur and charge the final image, tying environment to meaning. Tools and objects (stairs, lens, microdot) are tactile and used. While setting shapes tone more than hard constraints, it meaningfully frames choice and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether Elias’s orchestration will alter his and the island’s stasis—is clear. The prophetic echo and fog deepen pressure, and his choice to proceed narrows moral options. However, escalation is gentle; no option is visibly foreclosed on-page, and the price remains mostly implied. Tension operates but never bites hard.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Themes of agency vs fate and “open secrets” emerge organically through the cookie/microdot conceit and island dynamics. The final exchange (“After last orders, truths come out”) and beam piercing fog reweight prior images without moralizing. Resonance is earned, if quiet. Slight neatness in the last beats trims the lingering ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a crisp, slightly lyrical cadence suited to the material; diction matches setting and character. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful and subtextual. No head-hopping or stance drift. Occasional heightened phrasing skirts purple but generally remains controlled.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Strong line-level control with varied syntax and purposeful detail; most sentences do multiple jobs. A few ornamented phrases and near-reiterations (“open secrets” recurrences, layered metaphors) push toward lush but don’t muddle clarity. Momentum holds through descriptive passages. Clean mechanics and precise verbing overall.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The microdot–fortune-cookie–lighthouse synthesis feels fresh and specific; “accidentally prophetic” adds a non-obvious torque. The orchestration-by-cookie tactic is memorable and integrated. Emotional truth is quieter than the premise’s ingenuity, keeping the piece just shy of truly singular. Still, the vision coheres as its own.</comment>
