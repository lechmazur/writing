<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear, specific motivation (to rewrite his inheritance; “chasing hush”) drives tactile choices (rowing out, reading scuffs, entering, confessing). Interiority is textured and embodied, though contradictory impulses (loyalty vs repudiation of the father) are more implied than staged. The cost is felt but quiet—no decisive external test—keeping the arc credible but modest. The door “swinging wider” signals earned lightening, not an unearned epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The accumulative/textural lens is taught early and held: the journey inward, confessional act, and charged lattice build to a resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands on-page as Elias threads his story into the place and departs lighter; the cost is conceptual/emotional and legible. Causality is soft but coherent, with no orientation debts. The “before they find the bodies” clock adds atmosphere more than plot torque.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The lighthouse prison, reef, and copperlight are vivid, selective, and integrated with action (the climb, the confessional, the reef as legacy-cost). The lattice and door act as micro-settings that shape access and charge the final image. Environmental logic stays consistent and the tone is borne by setting rather than imposed. Minor constraint rather than hard limitation keeps it below the 9-band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (identity vs inherited falsehood) is signaled and coheres; the meaningful tightening is the discovery of the scuffed map leading to the confessional and confession. Escalation is primarily internal and textural, culminating in the lattice warming and door widening—credible but gentle. The clock and rumor of bodies do not materially heighten pressure. The price is an acceptance of loss rather than a sharp trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme arises organically: belief, truth, and inherited myth transformed into a personal narrative that can “repose in truth.” Recurring images (lattice, hush, reef, copperlight) reweight at the end without sermonizing; one line edges close to moral (“not to silence the past...”) but is anchored in action. Subtext—loneliness as the source of the father’s lies—lands through image rather than exposition. Resonance lingers in the final hush and tamed “wolf.”</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Consistent, confident close-third voice with a distinct sensory and metaphorical palette; rhythm modulates well. Purposeful elision is taught and paid off; no head-hopping. The brief line of dialogue is spare and charged, fitting the register. Elevated diction suits the lyric mode without drifting into incoherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong: dense without bloat, images do double duty, and syntax varies. A few motifs recur heavily (“copperlight,” “hover,” “hush”), approaching purple but mostly disciplined by purpose. No scaffold loops or filter stacks; momentum holds through the ritual cadence. The final image is clean and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: a lineage from “boy who cried wolf” recast into a lighthouse-prison confessional with a salvaged lattice and a quest for hush. The scuffed door as a map, and the lattice absorbing his story, feel fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking is purposeful and coherent. The piece avoids template beats and carries emotional specificity.</comment>
