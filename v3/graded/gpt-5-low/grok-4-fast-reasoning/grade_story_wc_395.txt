<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is clear and propulsive, and her two lies under pressure reveal character through action. Interiority is present but could push further into contradiction beyond “brightly attentive” and quickened heartbeats. The final Earned Stasis—choosing concealment with ethical cost—feels credible and character-rooted. More embodied stress or friction in the lying beats would heighten complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The causal chain is tight: anomaly → lie for access → discovery → conceptual repricing → concealment. Orientation is clean early, and the corporate lockdown creates clear procedural pressure. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise with a palpable, if subdued, cost. A sharper on-page consequence would push this higher.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The social archive and “echo of forgotten songs” create a vivid, purposeful atmosphere filtered through Elara’s professional gaze. Corporate protocols and sealed files materially shape choices. Specifics like holographic interfaces and humming server halls serve tone and action. The setting charges the final image though tactile, constraint-driven detail could be even denser.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes are focused: truth versus corporate surveillance and ethical risk. Escalation tightens through sealed files and the need to lie twice, culminating in a costly refusal to expose. The price is felt conceptually more than viscerally; no counterforce directly presses back on the final beat. Still, the narrowing of options reads cleanly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Memory, erasure, and corporate control accrue through motifs (“ghosts,” “echoes”) and culminate in a reweighting: deletion as migration and stewardship as quiet resistance. The mission patch functions thematically as a reclaimed relic. The line “absence was never truly final” edges toward statement but is supported by scene-earned images. Subtext about complicity versus guardianship lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited remains steady and confident, with a distinct tech-lyric timbre suited to the piece. Diction is largely controlled, avoiding register slips despite occasional elevated phrasing. Minimal dialogue avoids artifice and a brief spoken line threads goal and mask. Rhythm modulates well across discovery and decision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The prose is clear, paced, and largely economical, with recurring images working as a pattern rather than purple excess. Occasional echoing (“echo of forgotten songs,” “ghosts”) is intentional and not scaffolding. Sentences do multi-task, moving plot and tone together. A touch more syntactic variety at peak beats could add propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The corporate memory-keeper tracking a cold case through social residue and watermark numbers feels fresh and integrated. The shadow-server repricing and quiet custodianship ending add a non-obvious angle. A few genre-familiar moves (sealed files, conspiracy cover-up) keep it shy of truly singular. Still, the synthesis reads coherent and alive.</comment>
