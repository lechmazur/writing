<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—to armor empathy through renaming—reads consistent and specific, and her micro-choices (kneeling, tracing, intoning) align under pressure. The internal contradiction (gentle radicalism vs. steel) is present, though sometimes stated rather than dramatized. The cost (“trapping her deeper yet freeing something vital”) is felt but could be embodied more viscerally. Secondary pressure via other characters is late and light.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive holds: the stone cues vision → decoded ritual → renaming → plaza’s response → gathered survivors. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing and resonant reconfiguration; the price is her deeper entanglement with retrocognition. Orientation is clear early and the single-scene arc is coherent. Slight softness in causal tightening keeps it shy of the very top.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The plaza, shattered sky, and the tessera integrate with action and directly charge the final image (vines cradling hearths, the tile warming). Setting details are purposeful and POV-filtered, not a tourist catalog. The environment constrains and enables the ritual choice, functioning as micro-setting and object-as-setting. Consistent world-rules are learned through observation, not exposition dumps.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible (transform the plaza to protect fragile empathy) and escalates through the discovery and execution of the ritual. The deepening—seeing the fire’s origin and choosing forgiveness—reweights cost and consequence. Pressure remains mostly internal and conceptual; trade-offs are present but not sharply foreclosing alternative tactics. Still, the renaming is a clear agency-driven turn with on-page effects.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Themes of naming as healing, mercy with edges, and preserving scars are woven through image and action rather than sermonized. The “aberrant mercy” motif accrues and re-reads the fire in the climax without false equivalence. Final images (tile mending, vines purposeful) offer a resonant answer to the central question. Occasional abstract phrasing slightly dulls subtextual subtlety.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lyric third-person with a distinct perceptual signature is consistent and confident. Diction and rhythm modulate well at the ritual peak; the single quoted line lands cleanly. No head-hopping or stance drift, and certainty stays within POV knowledge. A touch of elevated abstraction persists but remains voice-coherent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sentences carry momentum with varied cadence; imagery is lush yet generally precise. Recurrent phrases (“warm coldness,” “aberrant mercy”) recur purposefully rather than looping. Minor purple notes and density flirt with over-saturation but do not obscure causality. Information density is high with few redundancies.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—retrocognition decoding a chipped tessera to rename a ruin into sanctuary—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The forgiveness reframing of the arsonists is a non-obvious, earned turn. Risks (lyric compression, ritualized renaming as central act) heighten stakes without gimmickry. A hair more concrete cost would push it higher.</comment>
