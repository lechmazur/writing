<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elowen’s motive evolves credibly from retreat to stewardship, with the unsnapping of the clasp as a concrete surrender of isolation. Interiority is textured through tactile engagement with tools (program, fruit) and embodied sensation (“shivering bliss”). Some emotional beats state outcomes a touch directly (“guardian not of solitude”), slightly smoothing contradiction. Still, micro-choices under pressure read clear and earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: discovery of the program → pattern-tracing → unsnap → cascade of stabilization forms a coherent because/therefore chain. Closure lands on-page with cost: he renounces isolation and accepts a binding allegiance. Orientation (who/where/when) is crisp early and maintained. Stakes narrow in time as reality blurs, bringing a satisfying reconfiguration at the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The greenhouse and “endless night” are not mere backdrop: they supply resources (fruits) and constraints (warping reality) that dictate tactics (aligning program to fruit). Sensory specificity is purposeful and POV-filtered through an alchemical lexicon. The environment charges the final image (open breastplate amid living night). Minor lushness aside, integration is strong and consequential.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—stabilize/capture possibility before it’s erased—tightens as reality buckles; the decisive act (unsnapping the clasp within the pattern) bears cost. Pressure rises coherently; external flux and internal renunciation interlock. The danger could feel sharper or riskier, but escalation remains meaningful and protagonist-driven. The final allegiance forecloses the prior path credibly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Themes of allegiance, agency, and transformation from withdrawal to creation are embedded via marionette imagery and string/fate motifs that shift meaning at closure. The program-as-key reframes art as governance of possibility, a resonant answer to solitude. Occasional explicitness (“guardian not of solitude, but of boundless potential”) trims ambiguity slightly. Overall, resonance lingers without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The lyric third-person voice is stable, sensuous, and suitably elevated for the fable-like mode; focalization stays tight to Elowen. Diction and rhythm modulate with pressure, peaking cleanly at the clasp unsnapping. Repetition of charged terms is mostly purposeful, with minimal register drift. No dialogue needed or missed.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Line-level craft is vivid and propulsive, with images doing multiple jobs (strings/patterns as both tool and theme). Minor redundancy and a few abstract phrases soften edge in peak beats. Figurative density stays just shy of purple and does not muddle causality. Syntax varies enough to carry momentum through the climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Alchemical orchard + marionette program + “unsnap” as ritual lever is a fresh, specific synthesis. The method and images feel necessary rather than quirky and pay off in a distinctive reconfiguration. Emotional truth (renouncing solace for stewardship) grounds the strangeness. Risks are taken without obscuring clarity.</comment>
