<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear single-POV motivation (reclaiming light) with concrete, profession-specific behavior grounds Elias. A credible internal flicker—his doubt causing the chip to quiver—creates a small but present contradiction under pressure. Micro-choices (aligning frequencies, refusing to break the covenant, banishing doubt via love of “the world’s melody”) are coherent. The struggle resolves quickly, keeping the emotional cost modest.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Causal with lyric inflection: chip → tether → doubt quiver → recommitment → restoration. Orientation is crisp early (who/where/when) and the ending delivers an on-page Decisive Change. The cost is primarily conceptual/emotional rather than materially felt, but the honesty constraint shapes tactics. The sequence is smooth, perhaps too smooth, with only one brief tightening beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The resonance chamber, silver-filigreed walls, moonlight tweezers, and the corroded orb are vivid, selective, and tool-centered. Setting is not postcard: it amplifies intent and enables the alignment/tether tactic, charging the final image. World rules around resonance and truth-infused alchemy are taught via action. Sensory texture supports tone without crowding clarity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early and the pressure coheres around the tether. The main tightening is the chip’s near-wilt under doubt, which tests commitment and forces an internal recommitment to truth. However, the resolution involves minimal trade-off and no meaningful loss; the path never seriously narrows beyond that wobble. Tension operates but peaks gently.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme integrates through particulars: mending over breaking, truth as restorative force, and a covenant rebalanced rather than destroyed. The stone’s aversion to dishonesty concretizes a moral axis without sermonizing. The final image (rust sloughing to gold, dawn returning) offers a resonant answer consistent with earlier images. Complexity remains modest but coherent.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The lyric-technical voice (“tinkersong,” “moonlight alloy,” frequency alignment) is consistent and character-apt. Distance control stays steady; no head-hopping or register slips. A few lush flourishes flirt with purple but remain legible and purposeful. The single spoken line lands as vow-like and suits the register.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lines carry high information density with few redundancies; rhythm varies and supports momentum. Imagery is mostly clean and congruent with the established physics of the piece. Minor repetition of key terms serves motif rather than padding. No evident scaffold loops or filter-verb stacks during peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The synthesis—music box repairman, covenant of rust, truth-sensitive philosopher’s chip, and resonance-mediated mending—feels fresh and integrated. The tether-as-method and “mend what isn’t torn” stance provide a non-obvious solution. The risk lies in choosing subtle repair over spectacle, which coheres. Slight ease in resolution trims the sense of daring cost.</comment>
