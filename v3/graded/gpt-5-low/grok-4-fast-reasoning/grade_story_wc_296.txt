<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elowen’s guarded nature versus her compulsion to unearth “what mirrors don’t show” creates a credible internal tension, and her hesitation before handling the seed is a clear micro-choice. Interiority is grounded in sensory detail (numbing feet, breath catching), not therapy-speak. The emotional cost is present but modest, with risk contained smoothly rather than testing her limits. A touch more resistance or consequence would sharpen her arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: failed trick → discovery of seed → deliberate unbend via expanding circles → lake’s reconfiguration and visions → collected seed/earned stasis. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing with the lake and her heart “straightening.” Cost is implied (danger of the seed/lake, moral weight of truth) but not deeply exacted on the page. The single-scene structure is clear and coherent under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The cursed lake-orchard is vividly tactile and actively shapes choices (vortex pull, chill, whipping branches). Setting evolves with action (concentric ripples altering the orchard’s spin), charging the final image of calm vigil. Detail selection is purposeful and POV-filtered. A superb integration, though the cost it imposes could be more materially felt.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes are clear early—truth beyond mirrors vs. bodily and moral peril—and tighten as the unbend radiates, risking destabilization. The decisive tactic (expanding circles) deepens pressure and shifts the lake’s rhythm. Costs are more atmospheric than exacted, with little loss or wound to alter later tactics. Still, escalation is protagonist-driven and coherent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mirrors versus “unmirrored truths,” guilt as a warp in reality, and the guarded heart “unbending” converge elegantly in the closing image. Thematic lines are mostly earned through action and image. One sentence edges toward explicit thesis (“This was the hidden fracture mirrors obscured”), slightly reducing subtlety. The final cadence resonates without sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>A confident, lyrical third-person close POV sustains a distinct texture (“warlike serenity,” “frozen confession”) without head-hopping. Rhythm modulates well from tension to calm; diction remains coherent with the mode. No dialogue needed; perception remains character-bound. Minor loftiness is well-controlled.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is lush yet largely precise, with images doing multiple jobs (apples as warriors, ice as confession). No significant loops or template cadences; momentum holds. A high metaphor density occasionally risks purple edges but avoids muddle and maintains clarity of action. Final image lands cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The orchard vortex, “unbend” as action, and a flesh-eating seed reframed as a binder of confession feel distinctive. The expanding-circles method elegantly entwines form and content. The turn from devouring to binding is fresh and thematically apt. Emotional risk could cut deeper, but the synthesis is memorable and coherent.</comment>
