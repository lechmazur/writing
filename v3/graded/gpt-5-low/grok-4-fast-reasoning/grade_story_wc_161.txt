<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elias’s motives—guarding the echoes of lost songs while fearing betrayal—are concrete and consistent, expressed through tactile rituals (dust-mote mapping, the meteorite as counterweight). Internal contradiction is active: he forges paper selves yet craves authenticity. The choice to share true songs with Mira is earned and carries visible risk. Minor limitation: emotions are mostly mediated by objects, with few visceral bodily beats under peak pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural design holds: meteorite discovery → ritualized balancing → test flight → Mira’s arrival → shared messages. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the talisman is jointly claimed and pigeons carry real connections, with vulnerability as cost. Causality is soft but coherent, with each beat deepening options rather than resetting. The ending’s before/after is legible without over-explaining.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The attic and skylight are integral tools, not wallpaper: the skylight’s beam enables the dust-mote mapping; the attic houses pigeons and frames isolation/return. The meteorite under the skylight charges the final image. Sensory specificity is consistently filtered through Elias’s priorities. Setting subtly shapes choice and cadence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—risking trust after betrayal—is signaled early and tightens meaningfully when Mira ascends the stairs. Elias’s decision to reveal true songs and send real messages narrows options with emotional cost. Escalation is modest but clean under an accumulative lens. A single charged turn (Mira’s arrival) carries most of the pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of authenticity versus fabrication accrues through recurring particulars (paper trails vs. meteorite’s “unyielding reality,” dust-mote charts becoming musical staffs). The final shared talisman reweights prior images without moralizing. Subtext in objects and rituals avoids sermonizing and lingers. Slight neatness in the renewal arc keeps it just shy of exceptional complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A distinct, lyrical third-person close maintains stable distance and a cohesive perceptual signature. Rhythm modulates well, with patterned diction that matches Elias’s meticulous mind. Dialogue is minimal but functional, avoiding exposition dumps. No head-hopping or stance drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Line-level craft is polished, with high information density and purposeful figurative texture. A few recurrent metaphoric pairs (bloom/withering) flirt with overinsistence but remain controlled and motif-driven. Syntax varies and sentences carry multiple jobs. Momentum is maintained without scaffold loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis—war pigeons, forged paper lives, a Mars chip as ballast, and dust-mote cartography—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risks in structure and imagery cohere around a human, grounded need. Turns arise from established motifs rather than late devices. Distinctiveness persists without gimmickry.</comment>
