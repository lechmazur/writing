<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—repair the eclipsed covenant by finding the intersection of dreams—is clear and acts through concrete choices (using the clipping, linking via scars). Interiority is vivid and embodied (scars, sap, strain), though internal contradiction is light; she rarely wavers. The final endurance carries some cost (the wilted clipping, tingling scars) but feels relatively unopposed. Strong coherence, modest ambiguity under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: dusk → rift → linking via scars → vision-guided reconnection → eclipse lifts. Orientation is clean from the opening; causality is consistent (wind call, clipping, scars as conduit). Closure lands on-page with a felt change (covenant restored, eclipse lifts) and a small, tangible price (clipping spent). Stakes resolve without a hard reversal, but the cadence tightening reads earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The cobalt glade, dusk light, and rift are sensually specific and integral; environment and the recurring object (clipping) constrain tactic and charge the final image. World rules are learned through action (linking through scars) without expository drag. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through Elara’s arboreal body. Strong atmosphere that shapes choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore balance before the glow fades) is clear, and pressure coheres through one meaningful tightening (the linking act guided by the maze). Agency drives resolution, but opposition is largely environmental and internalized; there’s little friction or setback once the method starts. Cost is present but modest, keeping escalation short of peak intensity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of mending through wounds—bridging scars to restore shared dreaming—emerges organically from particulars (scar-linking, maze guidance). The final image reweights the premise (convergence over chaos) without moralizing. At times the abstract lexicon (“eclipsed covenant,” “collective truth”) risks generality, but the concrete images keep resonance grounded. Quiet, coherent aftereffect.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>A distinct, lyrical third-person close voice with arboreal perception stays consistent and apt. Rhythm modulates well through the ritual act; diction is purposeful and unified. No head-hopping or stance drift; compression is legible. Minor repetition (“anxious elation”) slightly flattens variation but not clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lines are mostly clean, vivid, and multi-tasking; syntax varies, and images track. Some purple density and echoing phrases (“anxious elation,” layered abstractions) create mild overload. No significant scaffold loops or muddled metaphors; action order remains clear. Final image lands crisply despite minor excess.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Rooted tree-protagonist mediating time-rift via scars and a maze clipping is fresh and well-synthesized. The covenant/time-eclipse concept feels specific to this world and character. The turn (healing through wounds) is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. High originality without gimmickry, though conflict remains gentle.</comment>
