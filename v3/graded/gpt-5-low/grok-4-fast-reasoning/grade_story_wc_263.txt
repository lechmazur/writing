<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is clear and particular: to free a long-stalled creative core, tied to her history and the astrolabe. The internal contradiction (forcing versus surrendering) lands credibly at the pivot into rest. Embodied beats—trembling fingers, moss, cool stone—ground the lyric interiority. The change is earned but the felt cost is gentle rather than pressing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: tracing meteors → intensifying unspoken words → conceptual shift to surrender → RR closure. Orientation is clean from the outset (who/where/when). Closure is on-page via the act of rest and the charged rise, though the cost remains mostly conceptual. The set-ups (aurora, astrolabe, falling stars) pay off coherently.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The aurora-lit archway and astrolabe are vividly rendered and used in action, not mere backdrop. The setting constrains and enables tactics (star-tracing under auroras; resting against the stone pillar) and charges the final image. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through Elara’s artistic/stargazer bias. Slight over-lushness prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake (unlock creativity) is signaled early and deepens through the shift from effort to surrender. Escalation reads as a density increase—cosmic voices grow, tracing intensifies, then a decisive tactic change to rest. The price is subtle (relinquishing control/time) rather than a sharp trade-off, so the tightening is felt but soft. No antagonist, but internal and external motifs interweave effectively.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme coheres: creation as remembered stardust, freedom via surrender instead of force. The concept is dramatized through concrete acts (tracing, rest) and returns in the closing image. Some lines verge on overt thesis (“You are us, scattered but whole”), blunting ambiguity. Still, the final stance resonates without a stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>A consistent close third with a controlled lyric register and a distinct perceptual signature. Rhythm modulates well from tension to repose. No head-hopping or stance slippage; diction fits the character’s cosmically-leaning sensibility. Slight purple edges remain but serve the piece’s texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clean syntax, varied sentences, and strong verbs; images carry multiple jobs. However, figurative density is high with some repetition of cosmic motifs that risks over-saturation. Minimal scaffold or loops; momentum generally holds. Lushness slightly dulls peak precision and cost clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The “rest as decisive act” framed through an astrolabe under auroras feels fresh within familiar cosmic-lyric territory. The remembered stardust conceit integrates with tactic and identity rather than floating as mere ornament. Risks are aesthetic rather than structural and mostly pay off. Not groundbreaking, but confidently singular.</comment>
