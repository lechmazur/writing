<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Clear, specific interiority with credible contradictory impulses (envy vs. release) and concrete micro-choices (rising, choosing birch bark, writing). The motive—to metabolize dream-chaos—feels character-rooted and drives action. The cost is mostly emotional and quiet, but legible. Slight safety in the resolution (peace comes smoothly) keeps it below top tier.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural design holds: waking shock → writing ritual → on-page reconfiguration (“jealousy eased into understanding”). Orientation is clean early, and closure lands as a resonant repricing with cost. Stakes remain internal but cohesive; no causality breaks. Minor softness in how “earned” the peace feels is the only limiter.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cabin, wind, frost panes, and the birch bark scroll are vivid, tactile, and filtered through Elias’s priorities. The scroll functions as micro-setting/tool and charges the ending as a talisman. Environment supports mood and tactic choice without becoming mere postcard. It stops short of actively constraining options at the peak, hence not in the 9-band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: capture and contain the destabilizing dream before it “devours” him. Escalation is a deepening rather than a reversal—writing the dream reconfigures the threat into a bearable arc. The price (renouncing pure envy, accepting interwoven selves) is felt if quiet. Slightly low-heat pressure keeps it from higher.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Mortality, memory, and art-as-transmutation cohere through recurring images (grave, roots, wings, scroll). The final cadence reweights past envy into continuity without sermonizing, though the line “turning graves into gateways, jealousy into flight” edges toward thematic telling. Subtext mostly rides image and action. Strong resonance, modest didactic tint.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable close third with a distinct lyrical texture (“jaded wonder,” resin scent, frost panes). Rhythm and diction match psyche under pressure and modulate toward calm at dawn. No head-hopping or register slips; elision is purposeful. A few repeated constructions prevent an even higher mark.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Polished and sensory-rich with good sentence variety and momentum; most lines do double duty. Occasional repetition (“jaded wonder,” “soar”) and abstract phrasing lightly dilute density. Figurative language stays coherent and apt; no major loops or scaffolding. Clean mechanics and a strong closing image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh inflections—birch bark as medium, “jealousy of past selves” as fuel—lift a familiar “writer orders chaos” premise. The dream-to-script alchemy feels specific to this character and place. The arc is not radically new, but the synthesis reads authentic and memorable. Risk is measured rather than bold, hence high but not peak.</comment>
