<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s reluctance vs. inherited duty is specific and embodied (clumsy, practical, stubborn), and her micro-choices under pressure (using leaves, rolling nuts) align with that contradiction. Motivation is clean—save the travelers before frost—and the acceptance at the end reads as an earned shift. Minor ding: her instant decoding of the blueprint skirts effort, but the aunt’s lore and tactile etchings partially ground it.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal drive holds: find seed-core → infer blueprint → assemble no-touch pattern → birds redirect → travelers saved → self-repricing of role. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost (she loosens her refusal and accepts the guardian’s stance). The time pressure and environment constrain tactics, avoiding coincidence. The meta-textual “word count” intrusions are a seam but don’t break causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The cliffside labyrinth, frost clock, and mechanical birds aren’t mere backdrop; they shape tactics and the final image. Details are selective and purposeful (wind catching leaf arcs, scent trails, brass wings). World rules (no touch to avoid alerting birds) stay consistent and learned through action. A slight tendency toward lyric flourish never overwhelms spatial clarity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear (save the family before frost) and escalates via the ticking clock and the delicate assembly constraint. The meaningful tightening arrives when the blueprint demands precise, no-touch placement across dangerous paths. Resolution flows from Elara’s agency, with a felt price in her renewed bond to the orchard. Stakes remain personal-scaled but consequential.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme coheres around reluctant stewardship, transforming predation into guidance—predators turned shepherds is a strong image-level answer. “Graceless beauty” refrains through action and the final frost-kissed image, if a bit declared in spots. The piece avoids moralizing, letting choice and cost carry the resonance. The curse loosening “just a fraction” gives it earned, unsentimental lift.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Voice is lyrically precise with a distinct perceptual signature (“offhandedly exact,” clumsy grace), and psychic distance remains steady. The diction mostly matches Elara’s internal texture under stress. However, the meta “count recalibrations” at the end puncture the spell and disrupt stance. Aside from that seam, modulation under pressure is controlled.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Line-level craft is generally vivid and efficient, integrating image with action; the no-touch mechanics are clearly conveyed. Some purple density skirts excess but remains coherent. The late meta-text about word counts is a glaring artifact in the final beats, dulling the closure image and rhythm. Minor repetition is motif-driven rather than filler, but the artifact warrants a significant deduction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Mechanical birds + blueprint-seed + no-touch assembly in a cursed orchard is a fresh synthesis, with the predator-to-shepherd turn feeling earned. The guardian trope is revitalized through specific tactics and environmental constraints. Risk is taken in the lyric-technical blend without gimmickry. A slight convenience in blueprint decoding keeps it from the very top band.</comment>
