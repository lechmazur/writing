<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elowen’s motive—coaxing resilience from rubble—is clear and coherently enacted through his descent and ritual. Interiority is present but leans on reiterated labels (“meek,” “quietly determined”) rather than contradictory impulses under pressure. A flicker of doubt (“had he truly bartered enough”) adds texture but doesn’t materially complicate his course. Relationship pressure is absent, keeping the crucible narrow.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: arch decay → choice of deepest shaft → silk-anchored hammer-ritual → crystalline vines stabilize arches. The closure is on-page with a felt cost (frayed silk, prolonged vigil) and a clear before/after (planet stabilizes). Orientation is strong early, and the drive lens (causal with lyric accumulation) holds. Stakes resolve without deus ex machina or rule-breaking.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The orchard planet with floating arches and crystalline fruit is vividly realized, with tactile use of tools (silk, hammer) and the mine shafts shaping action. Environment constrains choices—the underbelly network enables the upward spread of magic and anchoring of arches. Sensory specificity and POV-filtered detail are consistent. The final image is charged by setting logic (azure skies, stabilized arches).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible and Elowen’s agency drives the turn; the vigil in the shaft provides one meaningful tightening. However, opposition is light: no concrete setback or counterforce tests his resolve on the page. Cost exists but reads modest for the declared planetary stakes. The escalation is steady rather than harrowing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Resilience-from-ruin and barter-as-awakening emerge organically from image and action, not thesis statements. The silk’s final fray and the planet’s “breath” lend earned resonance without sentimentality. “Azure defiance” is a coherent tonal throughline, if slightly over-insisted. The ending reweights prior images into a quiet, satisfying repricing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>A controlled, lush lyric voice with consistent distance fits a solitary, ritual-driven piece. Diction and rhythm are purposeful, though some lexis repeats (“azure,” “defiance,” “deliberate”), risking mild sameness. POV modesty is appropriate; no head-hopping or stance slippage. Compression is clean and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is polished with strong imagery, but there’s occasional purple tilt and repetition that could be pared (“defiance” and “azure” recur). Momentum holds, yet some lines restate stakes or mood without adding pressure. Syntax varies adequately and copy is clean. Density is good; a touch of pruning would sharpen peaks.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Floating rock arches, crystalline orchards, and silk-bound blacksmithing converge into a fresh synthesis. The mine-as-root network and rubble-to-vines metamorphosis feel inventive and earned by prior setup. The arc itself (meek artisan saves world) is familiar, but the particulars and object logic elevate it. Risks are aesthetic rather than structural and largely pay off.</comment>
