<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—mapping grief through alchemy—is clear, embodied, and drives each micro-choice (arranging refuse, igniting flash paper, sealing the plate). Interiority is specific to her vocation and loss without therapy-speak. Internal contradiction is modest: she endures rather than wavers, so tension stems more from patience under cold than from competing impulses. The ending reflects earned endurance with a felt physical cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: the ritual escalates (patterning → ignition → starlight → seal) to a resonant reconfiguration when the plate transforms and she carries the map within. Orientation (who/where/when) is swift and stable; set-ups (starlight, plate, discarded items) pay off causally. The closure carries cost (vigil, cold, grief) and changes options—she now has a living map. Slightly low jeopardy keeps it shy of the very top.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The subarctic crater orchard and refuse supply concrete resources and constraints: cold taxes stamina; scavenged items become the method. Tools (plate, flash paper, vials) and environment charge the final image. Sensory specificity is rich and POV-filtered; world rules feel consistent. It’s vivid without museum-catalogue bloat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around whether she can convert grief into a navigable map; escalation is the ritual’s density increase and the “seal” as a narrowing move. Cost is primarily endurance and the risk of failure at the symbolic heart, not a hard trade-off against a live alternative. The final act is protagonist-driven and earns the transformation. A sharper foreclosed option would push this higher.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of translating loss into guidance emerges through particulars: starlight as safekept memory, refuse into meridians, heartbeat-drops as cartography. The final image reweights prior motifs without moralizing. Subtext of communal grief (“crater’s ghosts”) broadens the personal without flattening it. Slight uniformity of tone limits added complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The voice is lyrically controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature (alchemy-as-cartography, light-as-memory) and stable close third. Rhythm modulates enough to carry ritual cadence, and diction fits the world. A few lush flourishes flirt with purple but don’t break legibility.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple jobs, imagery is mostly coherent, and momentum persists through lyric density. There’s some repetition of “moving stillness” textures and stacked modifiers that slightly thicken the middle. Clarity survives the peak beat; no scaffold loops. Trimming a handful of intensifiers would sharpen impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—flash-paper alchemy, safekept starlight, crater-orchard refuse as map—feels fresh and integral. Risks (lyric ritual, conceptual closure) are coherent and pay off cleanly. Turns arise from established method rather than late cheats. It’s memorable without gimmickry.</comment>
