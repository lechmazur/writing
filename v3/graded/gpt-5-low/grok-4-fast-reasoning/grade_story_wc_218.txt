<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elias’s motive—leaving an interspecies legacy before death—is clear and action-driving, and his competence and ritual care feel specific. Interiority is present but largely single-note “brazen calm,” with little contradictory impulse under pressure. Micro-choices (tree selection, wire spirals, diary-guided adjustments) reveal values. The resolution earns endurance but skirts visible sacrifice beyond labor and illness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Orientation is crisp from the outset (isle caretaker, diagnosis, orchard/pillars), and the accumulative build (work → hum → chamber → web) coheres. Closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration: the orchard awakened, pact imagery discovered, and a life extension that reweights the stake. Some cost is summarized rather than dramatized, especially at the end, but the lens holds. The “months later” tag risks softening immediacy yet preserves the before/after.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The orchard and living stone pillars are vividly rendered and functionally implicated (quartz veins, humming stone, hidden chamber). Setting details emerge through goal-directed action rather than static catalog. Environment constrains tactics (wire mimicking fissures, buried conduits) and charges the final image (resonating pillars, bioluminescent rites). A touch more grounded physical constraint would elevate to the top band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (legacy before death) is clear, with a meaningful deepening at the hidden chamber reveal. Pressure accrues through time and physical exertion rather than active opposition; the piece favors reverent transformation over conflict. The cost is mostly implied (illness, stamina) and not sharply tested. Still, the build toward a charged, reweighted end holds.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Thematic throughline—reciprocity between human craft and sentient wilds—emerges via particulars (wire as conduit, murals of pact) rather than thesis statement. The final image reweights prior material (respect becomes literal energy exchange). Slight sentimentality creeps in with the near-miraculous healing, flattening complexity. More friction or counter-pressure would deepen the ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The third-person close voice is steady, textured, and lexically coherent with Elias’s craft. Diction and rhythm carry a patient, ritual cadence without head-hopping. Refrains (“brazen calm,” “gently systematic”) risk minor redundancy but feel motif-driven. Modulation at discoveries is controlled and apt.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lines are clean, image-forward, and largely free of scaffolding; information density is strong. Occasional purple tilts (“as if the stone itself breathed”) are supported by established world-logic. Minor repetition of constructs does not stall momentum. The final cadence lands with clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The synthesis—temple orchard, copper-wire bio-architecture, living stone with bioluminescent rites—feels fresh and coherent. The healing coda edges toward a familiar trope but is reframed by the pact imagery and conduit logic. Specific craft choices (spirals mimicking fissures) elevate beyond template. A sharper cost or risk beat would push ingenuity into the top tier.</comment>
