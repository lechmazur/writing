<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias’s motive—recapturing a missed chance—drives concrete micro-choices (rolling dice, choosing precision over plunge, anchoring the lemma with the dice). The internal contradiction (grim optimism vs. fear of reckless risk) is dramatized rather than told. Emotions are embodied through tactile images (the chipped die, dust-caked step). Slight safety-hedging at the end (victory without visible harm) softens the felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Clear causal chain: ritual → recollection → mathematical modeling → placing the dice → rupture → reweighted final roll. Closure lands on-page via the rupture and the reconfiguration of the staircase’s logic (DC with CR overtones). The price is mostly conceptual (risk of eternal fall, shattering reality), not paid materially, trimming impact. Orientation is firm from the start; the hybrid causal/conceptual lens holds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The infinite staircase is vividly particular and actively constrains choices (endless ascent, Möbius logic, rupture in stone). The dice function as micro-setting tools charging the final image. Sensory detail and tone are integrated without touristic cataloging. A touch more non-visual texture at peak might have deepened tactility.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear (break the loop/recapture the missed texture) and escalates through the proof and rupture. Agency drives the turn; coincidence (dice) seeds tactics rather than solving. The cost is implied rather than exacted, so the tightening feels slightly cushioned. Still, the cadence shift at rupture reads earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Chance versus control, regret transmuted through method, and the perilous seduction of perpetual motion cohere in images rather than platitudes. The dice and gears recur with reweighted meaning at the end. The piece resists moralizing and leaves purposeful ambiguity about what’s lost in the break. A hair more friction between want and need on the page could have amplified the aftertaste.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The lyric third-person voice is steady, with disciplined elevated diction that suits the conceptual frame. Rhythm varies well and tightens at the proof/rupture sequence. Occasional repeated coinages (“balancedly daring,” “texture”) edge toward self-consciousness but don’t break distance control. No head-hopping or stance wobble.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Sentences carry multiple jobs with good propulsion; imagery is mostly precise. Minor redundancy (reiterated “perpetual motion,” “texture”) and a few purple-leaning flourishes slightly thicken the surface. Syntax and paragraphing breathe with the scene’s needs. The final image is clean and not dulled by figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: metaphysical staircase meets rigorous math as tactic, with dice mediating chance and proof. The Möbius reframe and logic-led rupture feel inevitable in hindsight. Risks in conceit and diction heighten coherence without obscuring clarity. Slightly soft cost keeps it short of transformational.</comment>
