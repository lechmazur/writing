<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—piercing numbness through vibration—is clear and embodied in tactile choices (repairing the phonograph, playing the cylinder in reverse). Interiority is specific (callused hands, stone-borne tremors) and avoids diagnostic language. The shift from detachment to tears reads earned, though the resolution trends a touch tidy. Lack of an on-page foil limits relational pressure but fits the single-POV design.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive holds: the discovery → repair → reverse-playback cadence tightens cleanly to an emotional break. Closure lands on-page as a resonant reconfiguration, with visible cost in grief surfacing. Orientation is crisp from the first line (who/where/when). Minor reliance on lyric repetition doesn’t disturb causality or the closing beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The drum maker’s cavern, the beeswax, and the phonograph/needle function as tool-and-chamber constraints that shape tactics and the final image. Sensory selection is POV-true (vibration, tremor, pulse) and the environment’s resonance materially enables the attempt. Details evolve with action (crate found, horn, cylinder choice). Tone and place fuse to charge the ending.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant internal stake is clear and escalates via density and cadence (the reverse song’s vibrations intensify to crack numbness). Agency is present in concrete steps, and the cost—opening to grief—is legible. Pressure is primarily internal, but it coheres and tightens appropriately for the chosen lens. A small ceiling comes from minimal external constraint beyond the environment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Silence, reversal, and grief braid into a coherent theme without moralizing; “filament of hush” develops from concept to operating principle. The final image reweights prior material (muted world → “quiet fire”) with earned emotion. Subtext in backward-play as grief inversion is elegant. Slight motif insistence keeps it just shy of exceptional subtlety.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The lyric third-person is stable, textural, and sensuously aligned with a deaf focalizer’s perceptual signature. Rhythm modulates with pressure, especially during the reverse-playback run. No head-hopping or stance slippage. A few repeated phrasings lightly flatten the acoustic of the line but not the voice’s integrity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Sentences carry momentum with multi-function density; images rarely idle. Some recurrence (“filament of hush,” “audibly muted”) skirts over-insistence but remains purposeful. Figurative logic holds; no mixed metaphors at the peak. Minor redundancy is the only notable drag on otherwise clean, rhythmic prose.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Deaf music teacher + broken needle + reverse cylinder in a resonant cavern is a fresh synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. The method is not gimmickry; it grows from character logic and setting resources. Emotional truth grounds the novelty. Risk-taking in concept and tone pays off without obscuring clarity.</comment>
