<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s motive (to prove objects absorb emotions) is clear and enacted through specific, tactile choices. The sister reveal exposes a credible contradiction—projection vs. avoidance—and her apology and final placement of the prism register a felt shift. Emotions are embodied (breath fog, warming prism) rather than labeled. A touch of convenience in the frost-face apparition keeps it just shy of exceptional.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Single-scene accumulative structure coheres: the prism-frost method → trance → “shifted hush” → repriced belief. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with on-page cost (confronting estrangement, tears, renunciation of isolation). Orientation is clean and the lens holds. The brief meta tail (“Wait, that’s over…”) scuffs the landing but doesn’t break closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Quartz arbor, mist, frost, and prism are vividly rendered and functionally integrated; the environment and tools shape the attempt and charge the final image. The frost window becomes a micro-setting that constrains the communion. Sensory detail is purposeful and POV-filtered. A few overt symbolic notes (“arbor wept”) flirt with excess but remain legible.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—validation that forces self-reckoning—tightens with the “shifted hush” and the sister’s face. Agency is quiet but decisive: sustained attention, apology, and the closing act of returning the prism. Cost is internal yet felt, foreclosing the comfort of projection. Escalation is textural rather than reversal-driven but clear.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme (objects as mirrors rather than vaults) emerges from particulars and reweights earlier material effectively. The final realization answers the central question without needing a tidy moral. However, the explicit summation (“She had proven it—not just to skeptics…”) and meta coda nudge toward didacticism and dilute subtext. The piece remains resonant, if slightly over-articulated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The lyric third-person voice is steady, sensory, and character-specific in its noticing. Modulation under pressure is controlled, and diction fits the mystic’s interiority. The late meta commentary jars the established stance. Otherwise, distance control and focalization are clean.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Line work is generally strong—precise verbs, layered images, and efficient scene-weaving. Occasional purple-leaning metaphors and repetition (“final validation…” mini-loop) slow momentum near the end. The cadence mostly breathes with the scene, but the closing meta riffs read like scaffold. Proofreading and syntax are clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Communing via frost patterns and a quartz arbor with a “shifted hush” as catalytic silence feels fresh and coherent. The prism’s color-casting into ice is a striking, specific device. The ending’s self-aware tweak takes a risk but doesn’t fully earn its meta register. Overall, the synthesis is memorable and mostly organic.</comment>
