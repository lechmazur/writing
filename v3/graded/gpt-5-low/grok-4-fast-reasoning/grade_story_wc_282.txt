<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s goal is clear and particular to her craft, and her micro-choices (buoyancy, retrieval, merging with the fossil, public narration) align with that drive. Interiority is present but light on contradiction; she rarely hesitates or reveals competing impulses. The transition from guardian to herald reads motivated, though the cost of shouldering that role is mostly conceptual. Strong specificity of vocation stands in for deeper internal struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Single-scene accumulative structure holds: exploration → hotspot → fossil → amplified mapping → redefined role. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: she assumes the herald stance with future-facing consequence. Causality is clean, though the price of the shift is mostly inferred rather than dramatized. Orientation is solid early and the lens remains consistent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The coastal caves, bioluminescence, magnetized boots, and tidal lagoon are vivid and tactically relevant (necessitating buoyancy and shaping movement). The fossil functions as an object-as-setting, charging the final image. Sensory specificity feels filtered through a professional eye without museum-tour excess. World rules are consistent within the piece’s SF-lyric frame.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Stakes are articulated (avoiding a void for the waking billions) but remain largely abstract in-scene. The key tightening is the discovery and use of the fossil, which deepens options rather than foreclosing them. There’s little visible cost or risk; environmental pressure complicates but never squeezes. Resolution is earned but not hard-won.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme coheres around stewardship, memory, and transitional objects bridging epochs. The fossil’s reweighting of her role creates resonance without didactic moralizing, though a few lines verge on thesis. The closing herald stance offers a non-literal answer that lingers. Subtext arises through image and vocation more than dialogue.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The voice blends precise, quasi-scientific diction with lyric texture in a stable close third. Register fits the character’s technical-professional lens; expository moments mostly serve immediacy. Rhythm is varied and controlled; no head-hopping or stance slips. The shift to a ceremonial tone at the end feels earned.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Clean, propulsive lines with purposeful detail; minimal scaffolding. A few explanatory phrases and stacked modifiers risk mild purple, but clarity holds and momentum persists. Information density is good; sentences do multiple jobs. Final image lands without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>“Heat-mapping emotions” and a fossil with quantum echoes produce a fresh synthesis; the transitional-object frame is an elegant, non-obvious angle. The cave ecology and toolset feel particular, not generic. The ending move (guardian to herald via an ancient leaf) reads inevitable in hindsight. Risk is taken in blending lyric and SF registers without losing coherence.</comment>
