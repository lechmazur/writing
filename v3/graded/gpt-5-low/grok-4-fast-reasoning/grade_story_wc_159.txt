<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elowen’s motive—preserving forgotten names—is clear and embodied through tactile, expert actions. The gently systematic trait informs her choices (song-based mending, lighting the bead), and her regret vs. duty tension reads as an earned endurance. However, contradictory impulses don’t escalate much beyond a steady ache, limiting dynamism. The final stance (persist despite loss) is credible and paid for but not deeply contested on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Clean single-scene arc: discovery of the cracked tube → choice to mend via song → ignition of the bead → resonant chime with names. Causality holds, and closure lands as a charged poise/earned stasis with a felt cost (“a fragile victory” against vast loss). Orientation is immediate and consistent. Stakes remain intimate rather than pressured, but the cadence shift at the end is clear and earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The opal library, cloudlight, glass orchids, and sonic garden are vividly integrated and character-filtered. Environment and objects function as tools: skylight and bead light, breeze for the chime, orchids responding to prisms. World rules are learned in action (mending by song, bead ignition) without clunky exposition. Slightly ornamental flourishes remain, but the final image is charged by place and object.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—saving names—tightens through the discovery-mend-ignite sequence. The meaningful turn is the ignition that reanimates the chime to speak names, deepening the emotional cost. Pressure is more textural than coercive; no hard trade-off is forced beyond endurance. Still, the small victory against a vast deficit reads with consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Themes of memory, extinction of feelings, and the ethics of caretaking emerge organically through object-work and process. The lullaby-as-repair and foxglove-tinted regret reconfigure the final image without moralizing. A few lines verge on thesis (“names carried the weight of extinct feelings”), but scene pressure largely carries the resonance. The ending offers a quiet, earned refusal to yield to oblivion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person is stable, with a distinct perceptual signature tied to craft and place. Rhythm modulates well from methodical care to the hush around the chime’s revival. Diction is elevated but consistent with the mythic register; no head-hopping. Some image density presses toward purple but remains controlled.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is lush yet mostly precise; objects and actions carry multiple jobs (world, theme, and plot). Minor repetition and high metaphor density flirt with overwriting, but cadence and clarity hold. Information moves forward in nearly every sentence. The final line resolves by image and tone without syntactic clutter.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The premise—an opal library and a museum of extinct feelings—feels fresh, with mending by song and light as a specific, memorable synthesis. The sonic garden and name-essence device are imaginative without gimmickry. The quiet closure is non-obvious and coherent with the risks of a lyrical, accumulative design. Emotional truth (small salvations amid systemic loss) lands.</comment>
