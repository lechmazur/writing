<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear, consistent motivation and a credible inner drive; his micro-choices (setting the timer, hiding/retrieving the envelope, deciding to descend) align with his aim. Interiority is specific to a poet’s sensibility, though occasionally abstracted into aphorism. Contradictory impulses (fear vs. resolve) are present but mostly harmonized, lowering friction. The final choice feels earned with a modest, legible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive is taught early (timer, storm, concealment) and pays off when the bell triggers his decisive move. Orientation is crisp from the outset; the single-scene window holds. Closure lands as a charged poise/decisive turn: he leaves safety to deliver censored work, reconfiguring options under risk. Cost is felt conceptually and situationally, if not dramatized with external resistance on the stairs.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The observatory, storm, and timer are tactile and recur with purpose; weather and altitude meaningfully shape his isolation and the descent choice. Detail selection is purposeful and POV-filtered, avoiding tourist catalog. The timer’s glow and the storm’s pressure charge the final image. Strong atmosphere without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (get the poem out) is clear, with a meaningful tightening when the timer chimes and he commits to the descent. Pressure is mostly internal and accumulative; the external stakes remain inferred rather than actively testing him on-page. The agency at closure is protagonist-driven with a visible trade-off (safety vs. risk). One decisive intensification suffices for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Motifs (scars/maps, storm/lightning, timer) cohere into a resonant argument about repression refining—and scarring—voice. The final images reweight prior material, though the quoted line “Scars are the stars we navigate by” tilts toward thesis-stating. Subtext largely rides image and action rather than sermonizing. Emotional aftereffect is contemplative and earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>A distinct, confident lyric third-person with a poet’s perceptual signature; diction is controlled and consistent. Psychic distance modulation matches pressure and never leaks beyond POV knowledge. No dialogue to test, but rhythm and syntax support the accumulative design. Occasional grand abstractions slightly smooth the edge of urgency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Line-level craft is vivid and mostly economical; images often do double duty (timer as metronome and clock). Minor purple flares and motif reiterations risk redundancy but stay purposeful. No major loops or filter-verb stacks; momentum is maintained. The aphoristic line near the end softens sharpness but doesn’t blur closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The stormlit observatory, darkroom timer as metronome, and bus-timetable dead drop feel fresh in combination. The censored-poet premise is familiar but personalized through charged objects and a clean closure image. Risks are aesthetic rather than structural and largely pay off. A touch more unpredictability in the turn would elevate originality further.</comment>
