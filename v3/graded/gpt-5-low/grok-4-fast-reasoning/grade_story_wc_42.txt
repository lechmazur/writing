<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elias’s motive—“to harness the ephemeral”—is clear, embodied in his craft and choices under pressure. His decisive, character-specific solution (listening to the leaf, altering the escapement) feels earned. Internal contradiction is lighter (yearning vs. practical urgency) but present. Emotional texture is specific and not therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Clean causal spine: broken chronometer threatens launch window; quake tightens pressure; leaf insight leads to restructuring; launch succeeds; conceptual reweighting lands. Closure is on-page (Decisive Change plus a quiet CR). Cost is more conceptual/emotional than material, keeping it just short of top-tier. Orientation is clear from the outset.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vivid, purposeful environment—frosted windows, bioluminescent panels, atrium, quakes—shapes tactics and images. The observatory’s micro-ecosystem enables the leaf solution, charging the final image. Minor plausibility friction (“lunar” observatory above clouds; inaccurate escape velocity) nicks credibility. Still, details are selective and filtered through a working mind.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (meet the launch window) is signaled early and escalates via tremors and the malfunctioning timepiece. A meaningful tightening occurs when the spinning hand corrupts sync arrays, forcing an inventive fix. Resolution arises from Elias’s agency rather than coincidence. The felt price is understated but the pressure arc is coherent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Leaf-as-gentleness reframes force versus release, and the ending recasts “escape velocity” as poise rather than brute speed. However, the final aphoristic line (“greatest escapes began…”) tips into stated thesis, softening subtext. Resonance remains, but moralizing trims the afterglow. Earlier images carry theme more deftly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Consistent, lyrical third-person close focus with a distinct perceptual signature (tools, star-charts, tactile craft). Rhythm modulates with pressure; diction suits a meticulous, world-worn technician-poet. No head-hopping or stance slips. Slight purple lean is controlled by action beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Line-level craft is lush yet mostly purposeful; sentences carry multiple jobs and momentum rarely stalls. A couple of factual slips (32 km/s for Earth escape; “lunar” vs. high-atmosphere perch) introduce credibility noise. Figurative density stays coherent, but occasional intensifiers verge on ornamental. Closing beats remain clear despite these nicks.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The fusion of precision craft with a nature cue (the leaf’s sound informing mechanical timing) feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The “escape velocity via gentleness” reframing adds conceptual originality. Risks (lyric high register, quiet solution) largely pay off. Minor world-logic blemishes prevent a higher band.</comment>
