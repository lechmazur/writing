<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elias’s creed of isolation conflicts with his compulsion to decode the stranger, yielding concrete micro-choices (taking the boutonnière, using his gift, pinning it to his lapel). Embodied detail (trembling fingers, salt-stiffened hair) grounds interiority. The final renunciation—accepting a shared “witnessed isolation”—is earned. The only softness: his deduction that the man sailed away comes a touch neat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the beats cohere: sighting the boutonnière → investigation via memory gaps → reweighted understanding → charged final pinning. Orientation is clean from the first lines, and closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with a modest but legible cost. The memory rule is introduced and paid off on the page. Slightly low jeopardy keeps it below the top band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The opal dock, mist, and lighthouse create a vivid, lived-in atmosphere filtered through Elias’s sensibility. The environment meaningfully textures choice (isolation, fog cover, no ships) and charges the final image. The Edelweiss as a recurring object acts like a micro-setting that carries pressure into the ending. While evocative, the environment rarely constrains tactics directly, holding this just shy of 9-band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—decoding the stranger’s gesture—tightens through the act of investigation and culminates in a meaningful stance shift. Pressure is internal, coherently escalating from curiosity to compulsion to repricing isolation. The cost is felt but muted; there’s little jeopardy or loss beyond a chosen burden. Still, one decisive deepening occurs and reads earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Themes of isolation-as-shared witness, memory as bridge, and release accrue through object and hour, not lecture. The boutonnière’s shifting meaning elegantly reweights the premise. One line veers toward thesis-stating (“decoding to this: in isolation…”) which slightly blunts subtext. The ending’s image restores resonance without tidy moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>A consistent close third with a briny, lyric texture matches Elias’s eccentricity and the coastal vigil. Rhythm modulates with pressure; the diction is purposeful and character-filtered. No head-hopping or stance slips, and elisions are taught and paid off. At moments the register nears purple, but control largely holds.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Line-level craft is lush with strong image economy; many sentences do double duty for mood and motive. Figurative density is high (“bruised indigo,” “lover’s regret”) but coherent and not muddled. Minimal scaffolding or loops; momentum sustains. Slight overwriting and repeated modifiers keep it out of the top band.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis—lighthouse keeper who reads “gaps” in memories via a dried Edelweiss to reconceive isolation—is fresh and memorable. The twist that the stranger sailed instead of leapt feels earned by the method. Risks in style and concept cohere without gimmickry. It’s distinctive, if not wholly unprecedented.</comment>
