<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s motive (mapping healing via living obituaries) is clear and embodied in tactile choices (pulling the thread, staying to write). The internal contradiction—seeking connection while choosing solitude—registers, though pressure on that conflict stays low. Interiority is specific and object-linked rather than generic. The endurance/renunciation (missing the ship) carries credible cost even if the choice is largely pre-scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive is steady: observations → object-handling → act of writing → realization. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: he accepts isolation as the cost of his method, reweighting the premise. Orientation is clean early; causality is soft but coherent. The cost is legible on the page (missed ship; chosen solitude) even if the inciting choice occurs off-stage.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The garden and crumbling palace are vividly specific and filtered through Elias’s sensibility; the thread functions as a charged micro-setting object. Tone and detail support the theme without museum-touring. While the environment doesn’t strongly constrain tactics, it does charge the final image and his choices. Sensory economy is generally strong with purposeful selections (moss paths, faded carpet).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake is internal (how to transform absence into presence); the tightening comes from choosing the garden over escape and committing to write. Escalation is modest and largely textural rather than conflictual; little on-page resistance tests the goal. The visible price is present but not contested in-scene, keeping tension muted. Still, the final stance is earned by sustained agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The weft-thread motif reframes “explained absences” into a persuasive ethics of care; the thematic line culminates in the charged acceptance of solitude as the method’s cost. A few thesis-forward lines (“He understood then…”) risk overstatement but don’t collapse resonance. Subtext rides images (thread as vein; garden tending). The ending lingers with a durable, non-tidy aftertaste.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person close is stable, lyrical, and controlled; diction matches Elias’s reflective vocation. Rhythm varies and supports the meditative cadence. No head-hopping or stance drift; the perceptual signature (object-attentive, elegiac) holds. Slight purplish edges appear but remain within voice logic.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is lush with strong image density; most lines carry multiple jobs (setting, theme, character). Occasional saturation of metaphor (“lonesome splendor,” “cartographer of scars”) edges toward excess but doesn’t muddle sense. Minimal redundancy and clean syntax keep momentum for a lyric piece. The final image is crisp and not overwritten.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>“Obituaries for the living” plus the carpet-weft as method and metaphor feels fresh and coherently exploited. The risk is a quiet, internal arc; the piece commits and makes it feel particular rather than generic. Closure synthesis (presence projected; absences revalued) lands as non-obvious yet inevitable. High originality comes from integration rather than novelty for its own sake.</comment>
