<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s guilt-driven caution and desire to transmute error into peace read consistently and motivate his key choices (the pause at midpoint, handing Tomas the drawer pull). His interiority is concrete (the talisman, the remembered fiasco) without therapy-speak. The relationship pressure with Lira and Tomas is legible, though Elias’s internal contradiction remains muted rather than sharply torn. Lira functions cleanly as pressure, if somewhat spare.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Single-scene causality is clear: prior botch → apology → tightly timed exchange under moon protocol → handoff with a symbolic cost. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Elias trades a high-value spy and relinquishes the talisman, earning tentative peace and a reframed self. Cost is on-page (loss of leverage/intel; surrender of the heirloom), and the lens holds situationally. Orientation is anchored early with parapet, moon phase, and roles.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The parapet, mist, wind, surf, and moon are vivid and POV-filtered, shaping cadence and tone. The neutral midpoint on the parapet and the moon-timed protocol subtly guide choreography and options. The final image (wind easing, stars pricking, descent of stairs) is charged by the environment-object weave. Occasional overt symbolism skims the surface but doesn’t blunt specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—peace versus personal and strategic cost—stays coherent, with tightening at the midpoint pause and the synchronized handoff. The price is credible (forfeiting strategic intel and the talisman), and agency drives resolution. Escalation is quiet rather than crucible-hot; there’s no hard reversal, but pressure coheres under the situational lens. A slightly sharper on-page risk beat could have heightened stakes further.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Themes of apology→forgiveness and recycling error into wisdom develop through recurring images (drawer pull, moon phases, untethering). Subtext in Lira’s “words are wind” and the mist lifting enriches the moral shift. A couple of lines edge toward thesis-stating (“recycled more than mistakes”), but the ending mostly earns its resonance via image. The familial note with Tomas grounds the abstract in personal cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The close third maintains a steady, lyrical register suited to Elias’s temperament; diction is controlled and specific. Dialogue is spare, purposeful, and status-aware (“words are wind”). Rhythm modulates with pressure (midpoint pause versus release). Voice stays consistent without head-hopping or register slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Line-level craft is polished: strong verbs, tactile nouns, and imagery that mostly earns its keep. A few phrases flirt with purple or redundancy (mist/wind motifs recur), but momentum and clarity hold. Syntax varies and the final cadence lands cleanly. No loops or scaffolded paraphrase undercut the peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The moon-phase protocol and the antique drawer pull as a moral tool freshen a familiar exchange scenario. The neutral-ground midpoint crossing is used with tact, and the “recycling mistakes” frame feels character-rooted. Not radical, but the synthesis reads specific and cohesive. A bolder complication or less overt symbolism could push distinctiveness higher.</comment>
