<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s motive—prove the garden knows him—remains clear and coherent, and his rituals (selecting/polishing marbles) reveal character through action. Interiority is mostly summary and steady-state, with limited contradictory impulses under pressure. The closing shift (“renewed vigor” and repriced faith over luck) lands but with modest felt cost. Relationship crucibles are absent, so pressure stays primarily internal and thematic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the pattern of daily ritual accrues until the Luckometer spike and the found marble catalyze a Conceptual Repricing of luck vs care. Orientation is crisp, and the closure image (garden returning his token) is on-page. However, the key turn leans on coincidence (spike/discovery) rather than a pressure-fed choice, and cost remains gentle. Still, the before/after in belief is legible and earned by the motif groundwork.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The maze, hedges, resin, gravel, and withering/blooming textures are vivid and filtered through a gardener’s eye. The recurring objects (marbles, Luckometer) and the environment charge the final image of the marble mended by the vine. World rules (Luckometer era, Deception Plague) feel consistent and integrated rather than dumped. Setting shapes approach (venturing deeper, alcoves) even if it rarely constrains hard choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (faith vs measurement) is present, but escalation is soft; the spike prompts exploration and discovery, not a contested decision with a visible price. The key action (polishing) is ceremonial rather than fraught, and luck complicates then effectively resolves. We get one meaningful deepening, but options aren’t visibly foreclosed. Tension is aesthetic and thematic more than dramatic.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Themes of mended deception, earned intimacy with place, and the insufficiency of quantified luck emerge from concrete motifs and the closing image. The marble’s journey reframes prior rituals, creating resonance without heavy moralizing, though “unquantifiable truth” edges toward explicit statement. Subtext in the garden’s reciprocal responses carries the weight. The ending lingers conceptually despite low on-page cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The voice is lyrical, confident, and consistent with an aged, tactile sensibility; the diction fits the quasi-fable SF tone. Psychic distance and tense are stable; there is no head-hopping. Modulation under peak moments is controlled, if more rhapsodic than pressurized. No dialogue to test idiom, but the narrative cadence remains distinct.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Line-level craft is polished with selective, high-information images and few redundancies. Some metaphor density and repeated flourish (blooming/withering, promises, truths) risks purple edges but remains coherent. Syntax varies and propulsion holds through the lyric mode. The final image reads cleanly without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The Luckometer against a tactile gardener’s rite, plus the Deception Plague and resin-mended marbles, feels fresh and organically fused. The found marble mended by the vine is an elegant turn grounded in prior specifics. While conflict remains gentle, the conceptual synthesis is non-obvious and memorable. Risk is taken in a quiet, accumulative design that largely pays off.</comment>
