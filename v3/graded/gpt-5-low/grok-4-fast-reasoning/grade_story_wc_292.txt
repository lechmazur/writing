<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s drive to redeem Thorne is clear, embodied, and present in micro-choices (locking the door, working through the night, sending the encrypted query). The “nervously confident” contradiction reads on the page and informs behavior. A stronger felt cost at the peak (beyond emotional risk) would have elevated the arc. Still, actions align with motive and culminate in a credible, earned stance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The causal chain is legible: journals + nail → decoded proof → query → reversal → final image. Closure lands with a Decisive Change and a resonant image (nailing the copper to the map). The washed-ashore crate is a fortunate arrival that edges toward convenience, softening the pressure-cost balance. Orientation is clean and the single-scene structure holds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The weather station is vividly tactile and constrains choices (failing generators, storm pressure, server reliance), while the copper nail functions as micro-setting and charges the final image. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through Elara’s priorities. World rules (guilds, jet stream shift) feel consistent and integrated rather than dumped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (posthumous reversal) is clear, and pressure coheres as the storm intensifies and time compresses during decoding and transmission. The crate’s coincidence undercuts escalation slightly, and the institutional reply arrives without a hard trade-off on the page. Agency remains central, but the price paid feels mostly emotional rather than materially constraining.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Legacy versus denial, and the irony of “reversible exile,” are embodied through object and action rather than stated. The final act conceptually reprices the past: the nail becomes a talisman and a public claim. The swift institutional affirmation trims ambiguity; a touch more friction would deepen resonance. Still, the thematic weave is coherent and earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The voice is steady, lyric without losing legibility, and tightly bound to Elara’s perceptual biases. Diction and rhythm modulate with pressure, maintaining coherence. No head-hopping or stance slippage; purposeful compression reads clean. A few lush metaphors flirt with excess but remain within control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lines carry multiple jobs (world, mood, motive) with few scaffolds, and syntax varies to keep momentum. Occasional repetition (“spongey dread,” “nervously confident”) and stacked modifiers approach purple but don’t obscure action or sense. Information density is high and punctuation clean. The final image lands crisply.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis—map librarian, coffin nail cipher, guild-run exile, climate-shift station—feels fresh and specific. The decoding mechanic is inventive and thematically apt. The serendipitous crate blunts some ingenuity by easing the hardest step. Overall, the design risks lyrically and largely pays off.</comment>
