<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear, consistent motivation (grief-driven empathy) informs each choice, from the archival cross-referencing to opening the latch. Interiority is specific to his craft and loss, though internal contradiction is limited (resolve rarely wavers). Embodied emotion lands in the projector sequence and at the threshold. The final crossing feels earned but the cost is mostly emotional and understated.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Causal throughline is clean: footage comparison ⇒ pattern recognized ⇒ on-site verification ⇒ latch opened. Two-shard structure (vault to henge) is legible and momentum holds. Closure lands on-page with a Decisive Change (door opens) that reconfigures options and honors the drive lens. Cost is present but light; still, the chain of causes is satisfying.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid and purposeful: rain-scoured vault, frescoed walls, windswept moors, and the henge shape attention and tactics (projector analysis; latch discovery). Sensory selection reflects the protagonist’s professional eye. The environment charges the final image of crossing into the chapel. Strong integration without over-touring.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (personal reopening of the past) is clear and tightens via the footage pattern and the concealed latch. Escalation is primarily investigative rather than adversarial, but turns narrow options credibly. The final act is protagonist-driven and resolves the immediate pressure. A sharper on-page price would raise the band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Silence, inheritance, and “shielded openness” cohere through objects and images rather than exposition. The father-son echo via twin reels deepens the theme with earned resonance. One line leans explanatory (“no mere academic pursuit”), but the final crossing reweights earlier motifs without moralizing. The quiet conceptual answer—listening to what silence holds—lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent with a meticulous observer. The projector scene’s diction matches the POV’s attentional lens. However, the late meta intrusion about word count breaks stance and contaminates the established register. Absent that aside, this would sit higher.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Line-level craft is generally strong with purposeful images and momentum. Some phrasing repetition (“methodically curious,” “shielded openness”) and mild purple hues appear but remain legible. The meta bracketed aside in the final lines is a significant artifact that disrupts cadence and dulls the closure image. This late-stage disruption disallows top-band scores.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh inflections—map framer craft, twin silent reels, and the “whispered chapel” premise—lift familiar archaeological mystery terrain. The comparison of decades-apart footage is a distinctive investigative method. The ending avoids twistiness in favor of earned quiet. Not groundbreaking, but coherent and memorable.</comment>
