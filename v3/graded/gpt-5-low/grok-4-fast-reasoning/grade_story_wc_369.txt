<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elias’s obsession with what the trees witness grounds his choices and leads to the sextant’s reconstruction and the balcony reveal. Interiority is specific (maintenance routines, dream-mapping habit), though internal contradiction and on-page cost are light. Actions align with motive and reveal competence without strain. The change at the end feels earned but not hard-won.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: motifs and images build to a Conceptual Repricing where the sextant reveals the tower’s geometry and the trees’ witness. Orientation is clear early, and the pin’s echo delivers the tightening beat that leads to the balcony. Closure lands on the page, but the cost is mostly conceptual/emotional rather than materially felt. Causality is lyrical but coherent across beats.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The stormlit tower, moonlight, and labyrinth are vividly drawn and filtered through Elias’s workman’s gaze. The environment charges the final image and enables the healing via moonlight, though it rarely constrains tactics beyond that. Object-as-setting (the sextant) integrates well with place. Sensory detail is lush and purposeful, if slightly weighted to the visual.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes center on unlocking the trees’ witness; pressure coheres via the pin’s echo and the storm’s hush. The meaningful tightening occurs when the echo crystallizes his insight, leading to the overlay and healing. Escalation is primarily internal and textural; the solution arrives smoothly once the pattern clicks, with minimal resistance. The felt price is modest, limiting intensity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>“Quantified sorrow” threads through the sextant’s fractures, dream maps, and final vision into resilience; the theme emerges from action and image rather than moralizing. The last tableau reweights prior details with a quiet, resonant answer. At times diction nudges toward explicitness, but it stays earned by the particulars. Subtext and motif work in concert without checklisting.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person close is steady and credible for a contemplative, craft-minded focalizer; the lyric register feels consistent with his solitary, ritualistic work. Rhythm modulates well across storm hush, insight, and reveal. No head-hopping or stance leakage. A slight loftiness in diction occasionally risks distance but remains controlled.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is polished, image-rich, and mostly efficient; sentences often do double duty. Metaphor density is high but coherent to the governing motifs (moonlight, measurement, sorrow). A few lines flirt with purple (“quantified sorrow,” “spilled mercury”), yet clarity and momentum hold. No notable loops or scaffolding artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Original synthesis: a labyrinth maintenance worker repairing a broken sextant through dream-mapping to read trees’ witness is fresh and memorable. The pin’s echo as catalyst and moonlight healing add distinctive texture without gimmickry. The ending feels inevitable under the established logic. Only the low-cost resolution keeps it shy of the top band.</comment>
