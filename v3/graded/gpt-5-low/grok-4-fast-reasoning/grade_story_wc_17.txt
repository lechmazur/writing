<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elara’s motive (to hear “what walls dream”) is specific and consistent, and her micro-choices—following the hum, kneeling to extract diaries, reading, then pocketing the negative—align with that drive. The internal turn from curiosity to accepting atonement reads earned via Harlan’s diaries. Emotional texture is embodied (“damp air clinging… like regret”) rather than labeled. The cost is quieter—taking on legacy’s burden—but present and credible at this length.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: discovery layers (hum → room → diaries → negative) reweight meaning. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: her goal reframes from mapping echoes to mapping repair, with on-page evidence (“the weight settled on her”). Orientation is clean early (who/where/when). Causal links are modest but intact and sufficient for this mode.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The manor’s ivy-choked ruin, mist-floodplain, and breathing-hum atmosphere are vivid and POV-filtered. Details are purposeful (fireplace → half-burned diaries) and integrated with action. Environment slightly constrains path (ivy veil, collapsed doorways) and charges the final image, though it rarely forces tactic-level tradeoffs. Strong tonal coherence throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Pressure is primarily internal; escalation comes through discovery density rather than opposition. The decisive tightening is the reveal of Harlan’s plea and the negative’s hopeful inversion, which forces a stance shift. External stakes remain soft (no immediate danger), keeping cost felt but subtle. Still, the narrowing of options—accept the legacy’s task or flee—reads clearly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of legacy’s burden evolving into atonement emerges from particulars (soot-dusted hearth, charred diaries, industrial sins) rather than lecture. The final whisper of shared hope across time offers a resonant answer to the premise. One sentence edges toward moral statement (“demanded atonement… map of repair”), slightly reducing ambiguity. Overall, subtext carries more than assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct, lyrical third-person close tracks Elara’s perceptual signature—sound-as-cartography, tactile dampness, echo lexicon—without drift. Rhythm varies and tightens during discovery, with controlled imagery. No head-hopping or stance slippage; distance modulation is purposeful. Prose confidence matches what the POV can plausibly infer.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sentences are lean yet textured; images do multiple jobs (ivy as “veins of green memory” both world and theme). Minimal scaffold and no evident loops; momentum carries through the scene. Figurative language is coherent and not over-stacked; no register drift. Final line closes with an image rather than an explanation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The “corridor echo cartographer” conceit and walls dreaming via light/echoes feel fresh and integrated. The negative as a medium for trapped histories is inventive and thematically apt. Quiet risks (lyric mode, concept-driven closure) pay off without obscuring clarity. The conflict’s gentleness keeps it shy of the most daring heights, but the synthesis is memorable.</comment>
