<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elar’s motivation to preserve the echo is clear and drives concrete actions (summoning clearings, performing the consecration). His “strangely honest” admission of fear adds texture, though internal contradiction is mild and stakes feel emotionally cushioned. Micro-choices are present and aligned with vocation, but cost remains largely conceptual. The final stance is earned yet conservative in scale.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterned ritual actions (clearings, parapet’s hum) build to a resonant rite that changes the pavilion’s state. Closure lands on-page—the echo is anchored and the pavilion’s timbre reweighted—though the cost is quiet rather than biting. Orientation is clean early and maintained. The causal chain is coherent within the poemic logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The murmuring pavilion, dunes, and kinetic parapet are vividly realized and integrated into tactics (clearings fed by buried energy). Setting is not postcarded; it actively enables/constrains the rite and charges the final image (the pavilion’s “new timbre”). Sensory selection matches the calm, periphery-focused craft. World rules are consistent and learned via action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible early: prevent the echo from fraying. Pressure deepens through the clearing around the echo and the parapet’s intensified hum, culminating in the consecration; however, escalation is smooth rather than testing, with no hard reversal or visible sacrifice. The resolution is earned but cost-light. Tension operates more in cadence than jeopardy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Themes of boundary, memory, and ethical custodianship emerge organically from images and ritual action. The final charged poise—wisdom preserved for “wanderers yet unborn”—reweights prior material without a sermon, though one or two lines skate close to stated significance. Subtext coheres through the half-mask/partial seeing motif. The resonance lingers, if gently.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The lyric third-person close is controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature built around peripheral awareness and hush. Rhythm and diction are consistent and suited to mood; the single spoken line lands without breaking register. No head-hopping or stance leakage. Modulation under pressure is subtle but deliberate.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is polished and image-dense with good momentum for a ritual scene. Occasional purple risk and near-redundancies (“murmurs,” “clearings”) slightly over-enrich but don’t blur causality. Syntax varies and sentences multi-task efficiently. Final image is clean and not muddled by metaphor.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The mythic toolkit (peripheral conjurings, kinetic parapet, half-mask honesty) feels freshly synthesized and internally coherent. The ending’s quiet reconfiguration fits the invented logic. Emotional truth is present, though risk remains aesthetic rather than moral. The piece commits to its singular mood and world without retreat.</comment>
