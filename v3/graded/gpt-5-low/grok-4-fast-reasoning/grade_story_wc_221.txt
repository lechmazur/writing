<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elara’s motives—grief, isolation, and compulsion to explore—are clear and drive concrete choices (returning, activating the console, refocusing the viewport). Fear and longing coexist credibly (the flicker frightens yet draws her), and embodied details (pressing the compass to her chest, sketching with trembling fingers) anchor emotion. The final shift—from solitary remembrance to active reconciliation and readiness to delve deeper—reads earned. The cost is mostly emotional and could be sharper, but it registers.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Single scene with strong because/therefore flow: glimpse → console activation → hidden coordinates → refocus → apparition → revised sketch. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the ritual becomes a map to family, not just memory, with felt emotional price. Orientation is clean from the start; the deck’s rules stay consistent. Stakes remain intimate but coherent through the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The observation deck and dilation field are vivid and rule-bound, shaping perception and enabling the echo of the mother. The compass rose functions as a charged object-as-setting, guiding gaze and data. Spatial and sensory choices (viewport curve, hum of the field, dim lights) are purposeful and filtered through grief. Environment materially affects options and the closing image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Pressure coheres and rises: a subtle sighting becomes a pursuit that demands action and interpretation, culminating in the apparition and reweighted ritual. The dominant stake (connection through memory/physics) tightens once meaningfully with the console/coordinates reveal. Costs remain primarily internal; no visible foreclosed path beyond solitude softening. Still, agency drives escalation rather than coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>“True north” and the compass recur as motifs that deepen into a non-literal answer: orientation in warped time equates to familial reconciliation. Symbolic elements are mostly earned through action (the chip, the refocusing, the merge of past/present sketches). One line leans on overt statement (“True north wasn’t just a point on a map”), softening subtlety. The final image lingers without tidy moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The lyrical third-person close holds steady, with a distinct perceptual signature tuned to temporal sensitivity. Rhythm modulates well between hush and urgency. Elevated diction fits the character’s sensibility and setting. Minor recurrence of set phrases doesn’t break control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Sentences carry atmosphere and action with good density, though a few verge on purple and repeat constructs (“echoed silence,” stacked modifiers). Clarity never collapses, and transitions are clean. The prose could tighten by trimming echoes and a couple of explanatory lines. Final image lands cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Time-dilation as a vessel for familial ritual and navigation feels fresh, especially the compass-chip tie to sketches over anniversaries. The mother’s echo as a preserved field artifact is a compelling, specific turn. While the “true north” metaphor is familiar, it’s integrated with enough specificity to avoid cliché. The synthesis reads purposeful rather than ornamental.</comment>
