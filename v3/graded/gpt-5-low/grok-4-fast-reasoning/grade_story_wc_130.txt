<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elowen’s motivation—quantifying grief born of ambiguous loss—is clear and consistently drives her gentle, coaxing approach to magic. Interiority is specific (her tactile attention to bark, stone, and eyes) and reveals a credible, tender temperament. The change at the end (reframing loss as an integral term rather than subtraction) feels earned by the ritual. Slight limitation: contradictions under pressure are soft; she rarely strains against herself beyond elegiac restraint.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single-scene accumulative structure holds: ritual intensifies from placement to visible threads to repricing of loss. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when) and the closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with cost (acceptance without recovery of the lover). The drive lens stays textural; density and pattern reweight the stake at the end. Minor softness: stakes never face a concrete external test, relying wholly on the ritual’s interior cadence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The cavern orchard, dripping stalactites, luminous fruit, and the mosaic stone are vividly tactile and integrated with action. Tools/objects (glass eyes, chipped patterns) charge the final image and govern method. Sensory selection fits POV biases (math/geometry inflected noticing) without feeling like a tourist catalog. World rules remain consistent and are learned through use, not exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (making peace with ambiguous loss through quantification) is signaled early, and pressure deepens as the ritual renders emotions into visible numerals. The cadence shift at dawn provides a subtle clock and a narrowing choice to close the working. Cost is internal—acceptance that loss becomes integral, not cured—credible but quiet. Absence of a harder turn or pushback keeps escalation contained to lyric intensification.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme coheres: dovetailing grief into life’s structure via mathematics and gentled magic, culminating in a hope that is not erasure. Recurring images (stone fractures, glass eyes, dripping “tears”) gain new weight at the end. One line edges toward thesis-stating (“perhaps loss was not erasure...”), slightly reducing subtext. Overall resonance lingers and avoids platitude.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited with a distinct, lyrical perceptual signature—geometry and craft infuse diction. Rhythm modulates well from hushed setup to glowing mid-scene to quiet release. No head-hopping or register drift; certainty matches what Elowen can infer. The lushness is consistent and voice-motivated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sentences carry high information density with purposeful imagery; few redundancies. Lushness skirts purple but remains coherent; metaphors align (math/woodwork/dovetail) without mixing. Momentum holds despite reflection, aided by concrete handling of objects. Minor trims could sharpen a couple of near-restatements.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis—cavern orchard ecology, taxidermist glass eyes as emotion quantifiers, dovetail geometry as spellcraft—is fresh and organically tied to character. Risks are aesthetic and conceptual and they pay off in the final repricing. The piece commits fully to its premise without resorting to trope shortcuts. Memorable specificity elevates it beyond surface novelty.</comment>
