<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s drive—to locate the origin of stories—is clear and coherently enacted through specific micro-choices (selecting a slate, incising, choosing the moonlight). Emotional stakes surface via “quantifying absence,” especially her orphaned beginnings and lost voices. Contradictory impulses are subtler than ideal; she rarely wavers or risks stopping. Still, the final renunciation (spending the moonlight) reads earned and character-rooted.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: counting voids → incisions → environmental response → hidden alcove forms a clean because/therefore pattern within a lyric design. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/CR: she releases the moonlight and discovers the pristine void with a felt conceptual cost (spent resource, exposed lack). Orientation is strong from the opening. Stakes tighten once meaningfully at the second/third incision without breaking the mode.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The glass orchard atop cloud-sea is vivid and specific, and its rules emerge through action (leaves tinkle, branches tremble, alcove appears). The environment responds to her method, charging the final image. Object-and-setting interplay (slate, crystal, moonlight) feels tactile within the lyric. Detail selection generally serves pressure rather than touring the world.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find the origin place) is clear early and deepens via the ritual: tallying absences and incising escalate pressure. The visible cost is the depletion of the bottled moonlight and the exposure of personal voids. No antagonist, but the accumulative tightening reads. The reveal is earned by her agency rather than coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Themes of erasure, renewal, and absence-as-foundation are embodied in concrete acts (counting voids, carving sigils) rather than stated morals. “Glimmering parole” refracts as release from history, culminating in a reweighted origin-image. The ending resists neat moralizing while offering a resonant answer to the central question. A few concept labels verge on explicitness but stay integrated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Consistent close-third lyric voice with a distinct perceptual bias toward crystalline, vaporous textures. Rhythm varies with pressure; diction is controlled and intentioned. No head-hopping or stance slippage. Slight loftiness occasionally risks abstraction but remains anchored in image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Line-level craft is polished with purposeful imagery and minimal scaffold. A few dense metaphor chains (“sharp as regret,” “glimmering parole”) flirt with purple but maintain coherence and momentum. Sentence variety and paragraph rhythm support the accumulative build. Clarity at the peak is preserved.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The premise and imagery feel fresh—an orchard library, petrified fog, quantified absence—executed with conviction. The ritual logic synthesizes novelty with emotional truth. While faintly echoing Borges/Calvino, it asserts its own stance via method-driven discovery. Risk-taking heightens meaning without obscuring closure.</comment>
