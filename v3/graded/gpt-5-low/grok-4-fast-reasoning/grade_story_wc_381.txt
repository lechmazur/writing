<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Clear motive and steady interior resolve give Elar coherence, but internal contradiction is minimal and the ritual succeeds with limited visible cost. Interiority leans lyric-general rather than character-particular under pressure. The serene competence smooths away friction that could deepen character. Sweat and focused patience gesture at strain but don’t force a live trade-off.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: the ritual tightens through “mapping silence,” culminating in the wing sealing the hush. Closure lands on the page, though the price is light. The late meta line (“Wait, error…710 words”) breaks immersion and dulls the cadence of the ending. Orientation is clean and single-scene coherence is strong.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The brook, night, and “terrestrially cosmic” thinning of the veil integrate with action—flow is literally harnessed and charges the final image. Sensory specificity is consistent and POV-filtered. The origami wing as object-as-setting element works well. Slight over-ornamentation at times, but environment shapes tactic rather than serving as postcard.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early, and the mapping/flow sequence provides a single meaningful tightening. However, escalation remains primarily procedural and internal, with minimal felt risk or cost on the page. The world-scale stakes remain abstract, muting pressure at the climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Patterns of flow and silence embody a theme of peace-as-discipline rather than mere absence, and the origami wing reweights that at the end. Subtext arises from image rather than moralizing. The meta sentence punctures resonance and reduces afterglow. Ambiguity is purposeful but safe, with limited ethical friction or cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>A consistent, lyrical third-person close with a distinctive cadence suits the ritual mode. Diction is largely controlled, and the perceptual signature is steady. The closing meta interruption jars the stance and undermines confidence. Occasional purple edges flatten modulation under peak pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Lines often carry multiple jobs and rhythm varies, but figurative density and repetitive intensifiers creep toward purple. The final meta line is a clear artifact that dulls the closure image. Minor paraphrase-redundancies (“whispered secrets,” “coded”) recur. Overall clarity holds, yet momentum is softened by ornamental phrasing.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>“Mapping silence” as a concrete ritual tactic and the origami wing as talisman feel fresh within summoning fantasy. The terrestrially cosmic frame and coded-prophecy twist are engaging syntheses. Safety in conflict and the meta slip keep it short of exceptional. Still, the concept commits and pays off in image-driven closure.</comment>
