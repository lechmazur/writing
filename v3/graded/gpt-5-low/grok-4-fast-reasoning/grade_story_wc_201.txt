<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and character-particular: a survivor seeking the “mathematics of mercy.” Embodied interiority is strong (bark as Braille, UV as penance), and he takes micro-choices under pressure (wrapping the strap, bracing, triggering memories). Contradictory impulses—self-inflicted pain vs. avoidance—are present but could be sharpened. A quiet, earned endurance/renunciation lands at the end.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single-scene accumulative structure coheres: wake → brace → memory surges → conceptual reframing → resolve to walk. Closure functions as a Charged Poise/RR: the decision to proceed along the path after paying pain-cost is legible. Orientation is clean early (who/where/why) and the lens holds. Stakes are tightened through one main deepening rather than multiple turns, appropriate to length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The ultraviolet forest is vivid and operative: radiation punishes, sweat evaporates, bark texture guides touch. The setting constrains behavior and charges the final image (path revealed in UV veils). Detail is selective and POV-filtered, avoiding tourist cataloging. Rules feel consistent and discovered through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant internal stake (forgiveness via pain) is signaled early and escalates when he deliberately triggers trauma with the strap. The cost is palpable in the memory surges and physical strain, culminating in a stance crystallization to continue. External antagonism is off-stage, but the coherent pressure of environment + body keeps tension live. One meaningful tightening suffices though a sharper foreclosed alternative could raise stakes further.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme—mercy as patterned rather than random—emerges through tactile struggle and image systems (roots, light, maps) more than pronouncement, though a few lines edge toward stated thesis. The “mathematics of mercy” motif is made concrete via pain thresholds and cartographic past. The ending reweights prior images without a tidy moral. Subtext rides the object and environment rather than overt sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a distinct perceptual signature (proprioception-driven noticing, technical but embodied diction). Rhythm modulates with pressure; lyric intensity stays legible. No head-hopping or stance drift. Elevated register fits the character’s history and present altered state.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense but controlled; metaphors align (light/pain/maps/roots) without mixing. Minimal scaffold or repetition; sentences carry multiple jobs. A few lines flirt with purple abstraction, but momentum and clarity hold through the peak. Final image is crisp and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The fusion of proprioceptive enhancement, UV penance ecology, and “mathematics of mercy” feels fresh and integral. Turns grow from established constraints rather than gimmicks. Boldness is thematic and imagistic rather than plot-twisty, and it coheres. Slight risk of abstraction is managed by tactile anchoring.</comment>
