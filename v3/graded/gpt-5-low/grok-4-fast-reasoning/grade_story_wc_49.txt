<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elowen’s goal is clear and consistent, and her craft choices on the loom track directly to that motivation. Interiority has a few grounded touches (mother’s chant, nights tinkering) but little live contradiction or cost. The villagers and elder add light relational pressure without true friction. The ending endurance/renunciation cost is minimal, keeping the arc emotionally tidy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: the ritual sequence coheres toward a clear on-page reconfiguration (practices rekindled, land responds). Orientation is strong from the opening and the pattern is taught and kept. Closure lands but the felt price is soft, with success arriving without a meaningful obstacle or trade-off. The “alignment” clock provides structure but little narrowing beyond timing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The verdant arbor, dawn light, and the vine-loom are vividly integrated and shape tactics (timed alignment; tool from arbor heartwood). Recurring objects (tendril, loom, tapestry) charge the final image and aren’t postcard décor. Sensory detail is purposeful and POV-colored. World rules stay consistent within the fable-lyric frame.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore practices to save the harvest) is present, and the alignment window offers a mild tightening. However, escalation is frictionless: no setback or trade-off tests commitment, and success feels guaranteed once the song begins. Cost remains largely declared (sleepless tinkering) rather than paid within the scene.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Tradition restored through an inventive blend of nature and craft gives a coherent thematic arc. The final image reaffirms communal memory without moralizing, though it trends tidy and celebratory. Subtext around community complicity and forgetting is hinted but not pressed. Resonance is pleasing more than piercing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The lyric third-person voice is consistent, confident, and well-modulated to the piece’s ritual cadence. Diction and rhythm fit Elowen’s whimsical, craft-focused gaze. No head-hopping or stance slippage; elision serves tone. A slight uniform elevation limits dynamic range under peak beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Line-level is generally clear and musical, with strong image-work (threads of light, silver/gold kiss). Some over-richness and near-repetitions (hush, golden, alignment) risk purple drift and dilute propulsion. Syntax patterns recur but do not obscure causality. Momentum holds, yet density could be trimmed for sharper escalation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The vine-tendril loom that spins songs into literal golden stories is a fresh, specific conceit. Ritual-restoration is familiar, but the tech-nature synthesis feels distinctive. Turns arise organically from established elements without late rule changes. The risk profile is aesthetic rather than structural, yielding elegance over surprise.</comment>
