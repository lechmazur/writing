<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and consistent—Elias’s vigil to preserve wonder—and his seasonal muteness provides a credible constraint. Interiority is restrained; we get scars, anticipation, and a nod, but few contradictory impulses under pressure. His main micro-choice (to ignite the mechanism) aligns with his calling but doesn’t force a difficult trade-off. Emotional embodiment skews lyrical rather than character-particular at peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens reads clean: wind rises, mechanism engages, listeners transform, dusk descends; closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with lingering symphonies etched into memory. Orientation is strong from the opening (who/where/when). Cost is present but subtle (his muteness and the slow fade as the piece winds down). Causality is coherent within the lyric mode, with no broken setups.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The bluff, wind, and altitude are integral—environment powers the sculpture and shapes the audience’s access (cloud’s fringe) and cadence. Object specificity (iceberg fragment, storm-tempered bronze, silken wires) is vivid and purpose-driven. The setting charges the final image as dusk and fading glisten reweight the stake. Sensory detail reflects Elias’s profession and the world’s post-verbal rules.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake (preserve wonder) is clear and pressure coheres as the symphony intensifies and reaches listeners. Escalation is felt through density and cadence, not reversals; the skeptic’s transformation is the main tightening. Cost remains mostly conceptual/emotional with limited on-page trade-offs. Agency is present but gentle—he initiates and endures more than he chooses under duress.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars (post-verbal world, bells, ice) rather than moralizing, culminating in a quiet, resonant cadence. Some lines verge on declarative abstraction (“melodies that peeled back illusions”), but the imagery mostly carries the load. The final slowing and lingering truths provide a non-literal answer that reweights the premise. Ambiguity is purposeful without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A consistent, lyrical third-person with a distinct sensory lexicon fits the world and Elias’s craft. Rhythm modulates well with the accumulating harmony, avoiding head-hopping. No dialogue is needed in a post-verbal milieu; the voice stays confident and apt. Diction remains coherent across turns.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Line-level craft is polished, with strong verb choices and layered images; repetition of “glisten/symphonies” edges toward purple but mostly sustains effect. Sentences vary and propel rather than stall. Minimal scaffold or loops and clean mechanics. A touch more restraint at peak lyric claims would heighten impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—post-verbal culture, bell-tuning craft, an iceberg’s glisten amplifying truths on a wind-swept bluff—feels fresh and internally coherent. The concept is pursued with commitment and image-driven logic. Transformation arises from established elements rather than late rules. Risk-taking is evident without obscuring clarity.</comment>
