<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elara’s motive and method are clear and consistent, and her actions (arranging candles, aligning to the windows, touching the globe) align with her values. Interiority is present but largely assured; we don’t feel a live contradiction or risk that complicates her choices. The “weaves truth carefully” trait constrains her pacing but doesn’t force a difficult trade-off. The final renunciation is more conceptual than felt, so the cost lands lightly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural structure is coherent: windows → cameos → pattern recognition → exposure → release. Closure lands on-page as a resonant reconfiguration with the snow globe’s single flake and warming shrine. Causal pressure is soft but consistent under the chosen lens, with no orientation debt. The cost is largely conceptual (repricing purity), keeping it just shy of the highest band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The glacier shrine, ice windows, auroral light, and the snow globe are vivid, purposeful, and POV-filtered. The environment meaningfully enables the method (refracting dreams) and charges the final image. Sensory selection is controlled and contributes to tone without turning into a catalog. Spatial logic and world rules feel consistent within the lyric frame.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes are legible (expose truth to free ghosts; salvage purity) and there’s one meaningful deepening when the midshipman apparition reframes the expedition’s bonds. Pressure remains gentle; obstacles and prices aren’t dramatized beyond process care. The surge of “borrowed starlight” functions as escalation, but without a difficult trade-off. Resolution arises from her steady method rather than tested commitment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The theme—purity found in human bonds and the cost of suppressed affections—emerges via images (cameos, parlor, fire stories) and the final flake. However, the line “the expedition’s downfall stemmed from suppressed affections” tips into told thesis, reducing subtext. The ending still resonates conceptually through object reweighting and release. Ambiguity exists but is not richly contested.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The voice is assured, lyrical, and consistent in distance; no head-hopping or register slips. Diction supports atmosphere without breaking POV plausibility given her vocation and ritual practice. Rhythm modulates well toward the closure image. Dialogue absence is appropriate and not missed.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Line-level craft is polished, with high information density and largely controlled metaphor. A few phrases edge toward purple (“silvered melancholy,” “borrowed starlight”), but coherence holds and no loops blunt momentum. Syntax varies and sequencing remains clear. The final image is clean and recharged by prior motifs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Combining Franklin lore, a dream-refracting ice shrine, and a reforming snow globe feels fresh and specific. The conceptual move from treasure to tenderness is earned through pattern rather than twist. Risks are aesthetic rather than structural, yet they cohere and pay off. It’s memorable without gimmickry.</comment>
