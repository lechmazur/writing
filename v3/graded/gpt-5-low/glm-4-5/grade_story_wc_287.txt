<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Mara’s motive (to bring light into darkness) is clear, grounded in her temperament and legacy, and expressed through tangible micro‑choices (packing the bag, choosing the alcove, methodically reflecting light). Interiority is specific and embodied, avoiding generic labels. The coincidence of meeting Jim is convenient, but it reframes rather than resolves the pressure and reveals lineage credibly. The final stance crystallization (accepting purpose) feels earned, though the on‑page cost is modest.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural; the piece layers images and echoes (rose petal, harbor, tool) toward a Charged Poise at dawn. Orientation is clean and the progression (impulse → journey → alcove → legacy reveal → reflective labor → dawn) holds causally. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—Mara accepts a role—with cost implied in endurance and a shift of self. The elder’s appearance is a mild convenience but complicates and deepens rather than solving the scene.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The harbor, moonlight, alcove, and the tool are vividly rendered and integrated with action; the moonlight is a necessary resource that shapes tactics. Sensory detail is economical and directed by Mara’s priorities, maintaining mood without postcard excess. The environment constrains the method (reflection angle, oil nearly gone) and charges the final image. Specificity remains consistent and plausible at this scope.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—bringing light to darkness—tightens when the lantern is dying and when Jim reframes the act through legacy. Escalation is quiet but real: travel → discovery → responsibility → labor to dawn. The cost reads as time, effort, and acceptance of a duty rather than a hard trade‑off, so pressure feels gentle. Still, the encounter credibly forces stance crystallization under the chosen lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Legacy, care, and light amid darkness emerge organically through the tool’s use and the harbor’s transformation. Thematic lines are carried by event and image, with subtext in “protected vulnerability” and commerce made ethereal at night. A single explicit maxim via Jim about “what we need” brushes didacticism but stays character‑grounded. The ending’s glow reweights the opening’s loss (rose petal) without stating a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The close third voice is steady, lyrical, and character‑filtered; diction suits Mara’s sensibility. Dialogue is sparse but natural, carrying subtext and function (naming legacy, testing motive). Rhythm modulates well between observation and action. No head‑hopping or stance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is clean, paced, and largely free of loops; images (“liquid mercury,” “quivering hush”) are coherent and not overstacked. Sentences carry multiple jobs without bloat, and transitions are smooth. A few recurring phrases verge on echo but maintain momentum. The final image lands clearly without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The lockmaster’s bitting gauge repurposed as a light‑reflector is a fresh, specific pivot that elevates a familiar “bring light” premise. Harbor‑by‑moon and fire‑escape gardening gain distinctiveness through lineage and lived detail. The coincidence of Jim is conventional but redeemed by the lineage twist and gentle strangeness. The synthesis feels authentic and memorable rather than templated.</comment>
