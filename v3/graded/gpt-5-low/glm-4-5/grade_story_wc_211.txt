<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s motives evolve persuasively from archivist to “archaeologist of human emotion,” and the prophecy credibly compels a new duty. Embodied moments (wax against temple, orchard air) ground interiority. The internal conflict—duty vs. apprehension—registers but doesn’t bite deeply enough to show a painful trade‑off. Still, the final renunciation of mere oath‑scribing reads earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal—immersion → prophecy → decision. Orientation is clear early (orchard atop skyscraper, foghorn silence, archives) and held. Closure lands as Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing: he redefines his task with a felt cost (burden and impending fall). The cost is conceptual more than enacted, but present in the final image’s pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The rooftop orchard, obsidian slab, and wax cylinder are vivid, sensory, and consistently filtered through Elias’s vocation. The environment charges tone and the final image (candle, silence, orchard over the city). While it doesn’t pin a tactical constraint, it meaningfully frames his choices and stakes. Details feel specific rather than touristic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake clarifies after the prophecy: preserve the city’s emotional patterns before collapse. Escalation is a single deepening—the immersion triggers a future‑facing vision that forces a stance. The price is mostly deferred (burden, urgency), lacking a sharper on‑page trade‑off. Still, the pivot from recording oaths to city‑scale preservation is a credible tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Memory, language, and medium (wax) interweave to explore how emotions outlast words and become duty. The “velvet disquiet” and silent foghorn resonate thematically without moralizing. The ending reweights the premise: the medium becomes oracle, and archiving becomes an ethical imperative. Ambiguity lingers productively around fate vs. agency.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third‑person close maintains distance and texture suited to a venerable scribe. Diction is consistent with the character’s sensibility; rhythm modulates well across beats. No dialogue, but the interior cadence bears pressure without over‑explaining. The voice remains coherent through the memory transition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is elegant with high information density; images often do double duty. Occasional lushness approaches purple but rarely muddies sense. Minimal scaffolding and few loops; syntax varies to sustain momentum. The final line cleanly reprises motifs without overstatement.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The fusion of a rooftop orchard, oath‑scribe lineage, wax media, and an accidental prophecy via museum memory feels fresh and integrated. The emotional‑pattern archivist angle distinguishes it from standard prophecy tropes. Turns arise from established particulars rather than late rule changes. Risk‑taking is measured, coherent, and thematically aligned.</comment>
