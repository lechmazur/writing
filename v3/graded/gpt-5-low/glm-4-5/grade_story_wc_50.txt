<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—restoring communal memory—drives steady, competent choices, and her locksmith lens grounds the method. Interiority is particular (peripheral vision, mapping light), though internal contradiction is mild; she rarely wavers or pays an on‑page personal price beyond time and focus. Actions align with traits and escalate plausibly from observation to calibration to reactivation. The endurance/renunciation cost is subtle rather than felt as sacrifice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: pattern‑gathering builds to the mechanism’s awakening, which reconfigures options (the harvest resumes). Orientation is clean early (who/where/season), and the through‑line holds. Closure lands on the page with the cavern thrumming and echoes returning; cost is implied (weeks of labor, season’s wound) rather than dramatized at the end. The beat sequence is coherent but low on decisive jeopardy.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The marble cavern and reflective surfaces constrain tactics and enable the solution; the environment is inseparable from method and closure image. Sensory specificity (veined marble, shifting light) is integrated with action rather than postcarded. World rules (light angles, prisms) stay consistent and are learned through doing. Strong charge at the end as reflections swirl into preserved echoes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore the echo‑harvest—tightens via accumulating observations into calibrated reconstruction and the awakening thrum. Pressure remains internal and methodical; opposition is mainly time and uncertainty, with little on‑page risk or trade‑off. The turn (from mapping to activation) is earned and narrows options, but the price is soft. Tension is quiet yet steady.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme—how wonder endures when given structure—emerges through locksmith craft, reflection geometry, and the final charged image. The “cellar of reason” articulation skirts didactic but is grounded by process. The ending reweights prior images (light, marble, prisms) into communal continuity without a tidy moral. Ambiguity around the “wounded season” adds resonance without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and filtered through a craft‑minded, reflective voice; diction fits the character’s contemplative focus. Rhythm modulates from observational calm to a subtle quickening at activation. No head‑hopping or stance slips; inference remains within what she can plausibly know. Occasional elevated phrasing is consistent with the lyric mode established early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is clean and lyrical, with purposeful repetition (“wounded season,” reflections) and varied syntax. Minor abstraction and motif reiteration risk slight purple hue, but clarity holds and momentum accrues. Information density is good; lines often do double duty (world + method). No significant loops or muddled metaphors in the final beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The fusion of locksmithing with time‑echo harvesting via marble reflections feels fresh and internally coherent. The accumulative repair ritual leading to sonic memory revival is an elegant angle on preservation. Risk is modest but confident; the piece commits to its quiet stakes. A stronger on‑page cost or sharper reversal could push it higher.</comment>
