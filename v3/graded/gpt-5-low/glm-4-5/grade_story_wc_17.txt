<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elara’s vocation and desire are clear, and her choices (enter side passage, preserve diaries, develop film, accept legacy) align with motive. However, interior conflict is minimal and largely summary-driven; there’s little contradictory impulse or embodied cost under pressure. The “legacy’s burden” acceptance feels more declared than dramatized, dulling the felt change. A stronger moment of risk or renunciation would deepen character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: discovery → diaries → film development → conceptual shift. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing and pledge to continue Thorne’s work, but the cost is mostly conceptual, not concretely paid on the page. Orientation is solid, and the two-shard transition to the lab is clean. Escalation is coherent, if soft.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The ivy-veiled corridor, rain-softened canopy, and preserved fireplace create a vivid, lived-in ruin that suits the premise. The environment contributes causally (ivy hides the passage; fireplace protects diaries), and the film’s pristine corridor image charges the final resonance. Some sensory range beyond visual would further heighten atmosphere. Still, specificity and selective detail are strong.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Stakes remain largely abstract (understanding/preservation) with limited on-page pressure; conflict is discovery rather than opposition. The meaningful tightening arrives with the film’s reveal, deepening knowledge but not foreclosing options or exacting a visible price. Agency is present but untested. A concrete risk, loss, or moral trade-off would amplify stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Resonance exists in the idea of walls carrying accumulated human consciousness, and the film/echo bridge is thematically apt. However, the theme is explicitly stated (“what walls dream about is...”), edging into moralizing summary in the final stretch and reducing subtext. More image-led implication at the end would strengthen the afterglow. The legacy motif works but could be earned through action over assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a measured, lyrical cadence that suits a sensory profession. Diction is mostly controlled, though generic formulations (“sensitively perceptive,” “legacy’s burden”) flatten texture at peaks. The perceptual signature (sound-mapping bias) shows, especially in early passages. No head-hopping or stance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose is clear and fluent, with good economy and occasional striking images; the ruin’s textures read crisply. Minor issues—redundant abstractions, a visible typo “(15]”, and some tell-leaning lines—dull momentum slightly. Rhythm varies but leans to explanatory in the final third. Cutting summary phrasing in favor of image/action would lift charge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The “echo cartographer” angle and sonic/visual archive bridge feel fresh and thoughtfully fused with setting. The film negative as a time-bridge is a smart turn, though the ending’s insight is familiar when stated outright. Conceptual ingenuity outpaces dramatized risk. Strong originality of premise; execution is solid but not yet electric.</comment>
