<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear motive (postpartum dislocation driving the quest) and a credible renunciation at closure; the ritual choices (tracing, unfastening, finishing the rite) align with her traits. Interiority is specific enough (awe/dread; the saucer as childhood remnant) but leans toward abstract labels (“choking beauty”) rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The cost—relinquishing control—lands, though the struggle feels gently resolved. A fuller embodiment of simultaneous impulses in the peak beat would raise it.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive holds: ritual density builds to a Conceptual Repricing/Earned Stasis—time cannot be controlled, only inhabited. Orientation is clean from the outset; the saucer and cards pay off in the shimmer/wind/dissolution turn and the epilogue reweights earlier images. On‑page cost is the foreclosed path of “fixing” time, legible in the final vow. The structure is tidy but cohesive, with one meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The midnight glade above clouds is vivid and functional: moonlight‑drinking onyx ink, wind that scatters the cards, and dissolution of the glade shape action and cadence. Objects-as-setting (saucer, cards) are integrated and charge the final image. While the environment doesn’t hard‑constraint tactics beyond the ritual, it consistently mirrors and pressures the moment. Economy of detail serves tone and intent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake is internal (control vs presence) and is signaled early. Escalation arrives via the ritual deepening (shimmering memories, sudden wind, dissolving glade) and culminates in her accepting limitation. The price is conceptual/emotional rather than visceral; options narrow, but gently. A sharper on‑page tradeoff or visible loss would intensify pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The thematic arc coheres—presence over control—and the recurring objects reweight meaning (saucer/kintsugi, hand‑tracing). However, several lines state the thesis too overtly (“time could not be rushed or controlled,” “where lost time accumulates is… the present moment”), tipping into moralizing in the final third. The resonance is real but partially told rather than earned solely through image and action. Subtext would lift if more was left unsaid.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>A consistent close third with a distinct lyric texture; diction and rhythm feel controlled and apt for the fable‑like mode. Refrains (“willingly perplexed,” “choking beauty”) create patterning without breaking distance control, though they edge toward mannerism. No head‑hopping or stance drift; elision is purposeful. Modest modulation under pressure keeps legibility intact.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lines are mostly clean and propulsive, with concrete images doing double duty. Some repetition and abstract phrasing slightly dilute density in the final third, but clarity remains. Figurative language is consistent; no muddled metaphors or cadence templates dominate. Minor redundancy aside, the prose supports momentum and tone.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: onyx‑ink cartomancy, the birthday‑cloth hand‑tracing ritual, cloudbound repentance, and the kintsugi saucer create a memorable, coherent world. The final repricing feels inevitable in hindsight, with specific images carrying the insight. Risk is taken without obscuring clarity. Slight overstatement of theme is the chief limiter.</comment>
