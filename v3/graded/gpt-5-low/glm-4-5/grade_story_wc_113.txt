<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elias’s motive (artistic pull/kinship with the ghost) is clear and drives tactile choices (lifting the program, deciding to play). Interiority is specific to a musician’s sensibility, though internal contradiction is minimal and risk tolerance feels assumed rather than tested. The final renunciation—the program dissolving as price—lands, but his emotional struggle under pressure stays relatively smooth. Strong, but not fully crucible‑tested.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the piece coherently builds from discovery to performance to apparition to dissolution. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the hush transforms from oppressive to peaceful as the code is “played,” with the program’s loss as cost. Orientation is clean from the first sentence; cause‑felt linkages (find → interpret → play → dissolve) hold. The cost is present but understated, keeping it shy of the highest tier.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The flooded opera house and lantern light are vivid and integrated (wading water, floating debris, reflective “stars”). The environment charges the final image and slightly constrains action (care with the soggy program, ankle‑deep movement), though it doesn’t decisively alter tactics. The piano’s improbable preservation is accepted by the story’s logic and supports the sacred/ruined tone. Rich atmosphere with purposeful recurrence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (complete the lost aria to free or reach the ghost) is signaled early. The meaningful tightening is Elias’s decision to “disrupt the silence” and commit to playing; the apparition and dissolution deepen pressure rather than reverse it. Costs are primarily conceptual/emotional; concrete jeopardy is limited, keeping escalation gentle. Still, agency drives the climax cleanly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Liminality (“in between” spaces) and music as a bridge between worlds are earned through image and act, not stated morals. The final hush reweights prior silence from oppression to completion—an effective thematic turn. Recurring motifs (water/notation/light) harmonize without over‑signaling. Resonant and coherent, if more elegiac than complexly ambivalent.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>A consistent close third with a musician’s perceptual bias; diction and rhythm suit the lyric mode. No head‑hopping; certainty stays within what Elias can sense. Occasional purple inflections skirt excess but remain controlled and purposeful. The voice modulates into a brighter cadence at the climax without breaking tone.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished with strong image density and clean syntax; many sentences do double duty. Some metaphor stacking (“stars in a midnight sky,” “pearls in the deep”) edges toward lushness that slightly blunts pressure. No major loops or scaffolding; momentum holds through the play sequence. Final image is clear and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The haunted theater is familiar, but the water‑damaged program forming a playable score feels fresh and well exploited. The quiet, code‑through‑music solution avoids gimmickry and integrates with character and setting. Emotional truth lands, though the scenario’s macro‑tropes keep it shy of truly singular. Solid, thoughtful synthesis.</comment>
