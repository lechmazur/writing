<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Maris’s resolve and the collective “we” create a steady interior lens with clear motivation, but internal contradiction and cost are muted. The line “courage we seek is not the kind that battles monsters” skews declarative, reducing lived tension. Micro-choices (pushing off, stamping, entering the waterfall) align with motive. The final acceptance of dragons reframes their role but doesn’t reveal a personal flaw or sacrifice beyond duty.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive is clean: ticket-stamp → heating pull → waterfall portal → dragon chamber → return with reweighted purpose. Orientation is strong from the opening; the pattern is taught and held. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing (they become ferry guides of courage), though the on-page cost is gentle rather than acute. No causality breaks; the sequence is coherent and purposeful.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful: mist-locked passages, veiled ridgeway, and the star-stamp tool all shape action and the final image. The environment constrains tactics (indirect routes; breath thresholds) and the ticket punch opens the cavern. Sensory specifics recur in a controlled palette that supports tone. World rules feel consistent and learned through movement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Pressure deepens via the heating punch and portal reveal, culminating in accepting the burden of invisible dragons. The dominant stake (locating unused courage) remains coherent; the turn in the cavern reweights purpose. Costs are implied (endless vigil, carrying courage) rather than dramatized as a trade-off in-scene. Escalation is steady but largely contemplative.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Themes of quiet, patient courage and earned stewardship emerge organically from action and objects, with strong recurring images reweighted at the end. A minor on-the-nose line (“not the kind that battles monsters”) flattens subtext slightly. The final image of invisible dragons as “living star-stamps” resonates without a moral. Reflection is earned and not sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The collective-third with Maris focalization is consistent and sonically distinct, with rhythmic control that fits the lyric mode. Diction stays within the piece’s idiom; no head-hopping or stance wobble. The modulation from shore to cavern to dawn reads confident. A touch of declarative thematics trims peak subtlety but not coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Line-level craft is elegant and mostly economical; images do multiple jobs (ticket punch as tool, talisman, and portal key). No visible loops or template cadence; metaphors are coherent and controlled. Occasional heightened phrasing edges toward purple but remains legible and purposeful. The final cadence is clean and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: ferry guides as psychopomps of courage; star-stamped tickets becoming heart-marks; courage as sleeping cat-sized dragons is fresh. The indirect-routes cosmology feels integral rather than quirky. The twist is a conceptual repricing grounded in prior particulars. Risk is disciplined and lands clearly.</comment>
