<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and consistent—her debunker ethos drives the investigation and the closing decision—but internal contradiction (skeptic vs. believer/keeper) is stated more than dramatized. We get some embodied detail (raw fingers, warmth from the diamond) yet few pressured micro‑choices on the page. The pivot from debunking to guardianship lands but lacks a felt price beyond asserted danger. Emotional texture tends toward declarative resolution rather than conflicted simultaneity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Single POV and orientation are clean; the causal chain (search → letters → realization → decision) holds. Closure functions as a Charged Poise decision to conceal and resist, with cost implied (corporate threat) rather than enacted. The dust storm and orchard’s response provide a timely tightening, but escalation remains modest and largely summarized. Lens reads Hybrid leaning Situational at the end, coherent if not piercing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Vivid, selective worldbuilding: glowing soil, trees leaning, radioactive dust storms, and the pedestal with the flawed diamond. Setting integrates with action—storm pressure, orchard barrier, and the object’s placement charge the final image. The environment nudges choice more than it constrains it, but it’s memorable and purposeful. World rules stay consistent and are learned through observation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible (protect or expose the stillpoint), and the storm approaches to tighten the window. However, opposition is abstract; no concrete on‑page test forces a trade‑off beyond her internal vow. The final decision is sensible but low‑friction; cost is thematic rather than felt in scene. Tension is present but doesn’t crest into a true squeeze.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Themes of truth vs. control, transformation of poison into life, and the ethics of secrecy cohere through images (flawed diamond, stillpoint, orchard thriving). Subtext arises in the reweighting of her debunker role into keeper/resistance, but the ending leans into overt moralizing (“Hope was the one thing…”) that blunts resonance. The conceptual repricing lands, if a bit declared. A slightly quieter, image‑led last beat would elevate.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and confident, with a consistent perceptual bias toward pattern and material detail. Diction is controlled, occasionally slogan‑like in the final lines. Compression works but sometimes explains what images already imply. No head‑hopping or register slips that break frame.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Clean sentences, good image economy, and a few strong tactile beats (“fingers growing raw”). Some redundancy and summary scaffolding flatten momentum, especially in explanatory stretches and the aphoristic close. Figurative language is restrained; no major muddle. Rhythm could vary more at pressure points to amplify urgency.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The irradiated orchard + flawed diamond as dimensional conduit offers a fresh synthesis within familiar dystopian/corporate control tropes. The stillpoint concept meaningfully reframes the world and her role. The piece plays it safe structurally, limiting surprise at the turn, but the central object’s revaluation is satisfying. More risk in dramatized confrontation or a non‑obvious cost would push this higher.</comment>
