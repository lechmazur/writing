<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara’s motive is clear and character‑specific—an analytic medium seeking the “physics of letting go.” Interiority feels embodied (tablet playback, tracing letters, tears) rather than labeled, and the shift from analysis to personal grief reads earned. The contradiction between methodical observation and vulnerable emotion lands. The cost is soft but present in the final acceptance and melancholy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural; Closure: Conceptual Repricing via “home” as frequency and the snow globe’s altered final image. Orientation is clean from the outset and the pattern of images coheres. The cost is legible (a reweighted understanding that alters her purpose and entails letting go). The supernatural cue (plane vanishing) is consistent with the established metaphysical frame.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The sunken ship library is vivid and thematically charged—pressure outside mirrors the “pressure” of death and preservation. Details (oak table, reinforced windows, water as barrier) are filtered through Elara’s priorities and inform the finale. The snow globe functions as micro‑setting and charges the closing image. Economy is strong; no museum‑tour drift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake is internal—deciphering the last transmission to reframe grief—and it tightens through patterned attention to the globe and audio until the “home” turn. Escalation is a deepening rather than reversal, appropriate to the chosen lens. The price is acceptance and a new stance, not grand but credible at this length. Tension remains quiet but coherent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Thematic throughline—frequency/pressure/letting go—emerges organically via object and setting, culminating in the reweighted “home.” However, explicit statements (“death wasn’t an ending but a frequency shift”) verge on telling, dulling subtext. The final image still resonates, but some moralizing trims altitude. The best moments are imagistic (water as barrier, plane’s disappearance).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and close, with a controlled lyric register that suits a medium‑historian’s mind. Diction is coherent and modulates with pressure (from clinical noting to tender realization). No head‑hopping or unearned omniscience occurs. A few abstract lines flirt with generality but do not break voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and mostly high‑density; images carry multiple jobs. Minor purple notes (“first name basis with death”) and a few declarative theme lines slightly slow momentum. No looped scaffolding or mixed metaphors; final image lands crisply. Overall polished and readable without mechanical clutter.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis—underwater library, Earhart’s last words as frequency, a snow globe as conduit—is fresh and coherent. The closure feels earned in hindsight via seeded motifs. Risks are tasteful rather than flashy, with a strong conceptual frame. Slight thematic over‑statement keeps it short of exceptional.</comment>
