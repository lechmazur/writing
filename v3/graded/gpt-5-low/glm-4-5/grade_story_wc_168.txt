<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and character‑specific: a firefighter driven to “translate pain into a universal language” through the cracked box. Embodied details (ache in bones, calloused fingers, cool porcelain) ground interiority. The internal contradiction—“hard softness,” courage vs. guilt—operates in scene. The closing renunciation (from accusation to companion) is earned with a felt cost: accepting marked survival.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single‑scene accumulative design holds: ridge ascent → handling the box → reframing its meaning. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: the box shifts from failure to companion, foreclosing his prior self‑accusation. Orientation is clean early; no causality breaks. The cost—living with scars and relinquishing salvational heroism—is legible in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid and purposeful: moonlight, gravel crunch, ancient pines, star‑wheel cadence. The porcelain box functions as a charged micro‑setting, constraining gesture and attention and anchoring the final image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through a firefighter’s body and fatigue. The ridge’s vastness meaningfully contrasts the intimate object, fueling the reweighting at the end.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around a single stake: reframing guilt into a survivable stance. Escalation is a deepening rather than a reversal, culminating when the fracture reads as “a deliberate stroke.” The price is continuing with markedness, not absolution. Slight softness remains from a largely internal conflict without a sharper mid‑scene pinch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Themes of survival’s marks and traded innocence emerge through recurring images (crack, scars, stars) and reweight at the end. Occasional direct statements (“survival leaves marks”) verge on telling yet are mostly earned by concrete particulars. The final image resists tidy moralizing, offering a resonant acceptance. Subtext in “companion” vs. “accusation” carries depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV and distance are steady, with a controlled lyric register fitting the character’s reflective state. Diction and rhythm vary and sharpen at turns (“less like damage, more like a deliberate stroke”). No head‑hopping or unearned certainty. Elevated language is consistent with the piece’s chosen mode.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lines carry multiple jobs with generally clean momentum; images are clear and tactile. Minor purple edges and repetition (celestial indifference invoked twice) don’t blunt closure. Syntax and paragraphing breathe with the scene. The final cadence is precise and recharged without scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The reflective fire‑rescue survivor frame is familiar, but the porcelain “bargained innocence” angle and “hard softness” tonal integrity feel specific. The object‑driven repricing lands cleanly. Risk is moderate and controlled rather than daring. Freshness arises from synthesis more than novelty.</comment>
