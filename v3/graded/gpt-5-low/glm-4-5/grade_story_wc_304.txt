<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—redemption through preservation after failing her sister—is clear and coherently drives every action. Interiority is steady and character‑particular, but there’s little on‑page contradiction or struggle; competence goes largely untested. Micro‑choices (placing the stone, attending to scents, deciding completion) are thoughtful yet low‑pressure. The endurance ending (continuing the work) lands but with limited felt cost in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The piece reads as Accumulative/Textural: density and ritual deepen until a cadence shift at completion and shelving. Orientation is clean early; the throughline (capture → infuse → preserve) is coherent. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as she completes one soul and resets to guard the threshold, though the cost is more conceptual than felt. No causal missteps, but pressure remains modest.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The skyborne grotto and aurora are vivid, sensorially balanced, and filtered through Elara’s professional attention. The aurora’s intensification and crystalline refraction subtly enable and charge the ritual without feeling like a postcard. The emerald and vial shelf function as micro‑setting objects that return in the final image. While the environment aids rather than constrains, it meaningfully charges the ending.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve the essence before oblivion) is clear, but resistance is minimal and the process unfolds without a contested beat. The escalation is a density/rhythm lift (aurora strengthens, pattern clarifies) rather than a narrowing with cost. Completion feels inevitable rather than won. The personal wound is invoked but not tested on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Themes of memory, ritual care, and redemption accrue organically through objects and action, with the “threshold of stillness” refracted rather than preached. The final image (adding the vial, watching for the next pattern) reweights the vocation’s burden and grace. Some lines lean toward direct statement of purpose, muting ambiguity. Still, the emotional afterimage is coherent and tender.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>A consistent, lyrical third‑person close governs perception with confidence; diction suits the character’s ritual craft. Rhythm modulates gently as the aurora intensifies and the pattern resolves. No head‑hopping or stance drift; elisions are legible. At times the lyric register risks uniformity, but it remains controlled.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Clean, luminous sentences with purposeful imagery and minimal syntactic clutter; strong verbs and specific nouns carry weight. Some repetition (“threshold,” “aurora,” “static”) edges toward lushness saturation, and a few paraphrase moves could be trimmed. Momentum is preserved despite lyric pace. The final cadence lands clearly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The beautician‑mortician under an aurora, preserving memory via an heirloom emerald and pattern‑in‑static method, offers a fresh synthesis. The ritual specificity and tonal restraint avoid cliché. Risk is moderate (quiet, low‑conflict design) but coherent. A sharper cost or unforeseen turn could elevate ingenuity further.</comment>
