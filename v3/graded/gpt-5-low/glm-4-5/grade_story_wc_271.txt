<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Maya’s interiority is grounded in embodied cues (jaw, breath) and micro-choices (stopping work, hands in earth, breath work), culminating in the costly release of the photograph. The contradiction between clinging and letting go is credible and present on the page. The “somatic markers” register edges toward clinical diction but remains dramatized through action. Overall, a coherent, specific portrait under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: ritual details accrue toward the anniversary scene, where she releases the photo. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration/Earned Stasis with visible cost—she relinquishes the talisman and stands in charged poise on the cliff. Orientation is clear early; single POV and scope are tight. The beats cohere without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The arboretum, cliff, and dark lighthouse infuse mood and shape the final image—the wind and sea charge the release. Details are selective and POV-filtered (salt air, oyster shell), avoiding tourist cataloging. Setting functions as more than backdrop by participating in the ending’s image. Strong economy and integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether she can hold love and loss without being capsized—tightens on the anniversary. The surfacing markers escalate pressure; her choice to let feelings wash over her and to release the photo forecloses a path. The price is clear: surrendering a physical anchor to grief. Quiet but earned escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of “anchoring optimism in realism” arises through ritual, teaching children, and the pearl metaphor that reweights the ending. A few sentences state the thesis outright, softening subtext (“not despite… but because of it”). Still, the final image carries resonance without didactic wrap-up. The oyster/pearl motif is coherent and transformed by the end.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The voice is steady, lyrical, and controlled, with consistent psychic distance. Diction and rhythm fit the contemplative mode; quoted lines are sparse and purposeful. Occasional clinical terms are balanced by tactile action. No head-hopping or stance drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Clean, rhythmic prose with good sentence variety and high information density; images often do double duty. Minimal scaffold and few redundancies; repeated phrases act as motif rather than loop. A whiff of abstraction near the end nudges toward summary but does not dull the closure image. Figurative control remains clear at peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis—drone-strike survivor as cliffside gardener teaching somatic stillness through an oyster/pearl metaphor—feels fresh and specific. The photograph release is familiar but recontextualized by the accumulative method and setting. Risks are quiet and aesthetic rather than structural, but they cohere. Memorable particulars elevate beyond template grief narratives.</comment>
