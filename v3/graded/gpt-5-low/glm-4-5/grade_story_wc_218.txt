<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and sustained—diagnosis to mission—but interior conflict is minimal, with “brazen calm” smoothing over contradictory impulses. Physical costs (arthritis, waning strength) are embodied and credible. Micro‑choices (learning the wire patterns, finishing the final circuit) align with values, though we rarely see doubt or misgiving. The earned renunciation at death lands, but the emotional pathway there feels mostly untroubled.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Hybrid with an accumulative/textural dominant: the month‑by‑month build tightens toward a charged final image. Orientation is crisp early and causality holds (diagnosis → diary → remodel → awakening → death). Closure lands on the page with cost through the orchard’s activation synced to his final breath. A single deepening rather than multiple turns, but sufficient at this length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The temple orchard and living stone pillars are vivid, specific, and charged; the copper‑constellation method is inseparable from place. Environment constrains choices (oak branches, pillar network) and decisively charges the ending’s light‑and‑breath image. Sensory selection matches urgency, with tactile copper and seasonal shifts. World rules stay consistent and are learned through action rather than dump.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (build the bridge before death) is signaled early and escalates via time pressure and physical decline. The meaningful tightening occurs at the final circuit, where stamina and precision undercut options. Resistance is primarily entropic (time/body), not antagonistic, which keeps tension lower but coherent. The price—his life—registers cleanly at closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Themes of mortality-as-deadline, stewardship, and interspecies respect emerge through the copper “language” and the orchard’s awakening. Occasional direct statements (“His motivation crystallized...”) blunt subtlety, but the final symphony of light and breath reframes death as continuity without sermonizing. The diary’s legacy and the pillars’ shared wisdom support a resonant, non‑literal answer. Quiet but lasting aftereffect.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Controlled third‑person with a calm, lucid lyricism that modulates gently as pressure mounts. Diction is consistent with Elias’s perceptual priorities (botanical and structural attention). No head‑hopping or stance slips. A few repeated constructions (“architectural secrets”) nibble at freshness but not clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Sentences carry clean momentum with purposeful compression across months; images do more than one job. Minor repetition and summary cadences appear, but they don’t stall the final beat. Figurative choices (“metal singing,” breathing stone) are coherent and restrained. No major scaffolding or muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis—ancient plant intelligence, copper constellations, living stone—feels fresh and specific. The caretaker trope is elevated by methodical, materially grounded ritual and a legacy frame via the diary. The final reconfiguration (the orchard as ongoing language) is earned and non‑obvious. Risk‑taking is measured and coherent rather than flashy.</comment>
