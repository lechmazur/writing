<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Marcus’s motivations (obsessive vertical awareness, ghosts, and the 4:17 window) are clear and consistent, and his final decision to engage tracks with his setup. Interiority is particular (dust patterns, ceiling focus) but contradiction is light; he faces little internal ambivalence in the moment of choice. Embodied detail (smells, flicker, dust behavior) does some emotional work. The change from burden to calling lands, though the felt cost is modest.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation is strong early, and the scene holds a clear because/therefore chain to the timed silence and engagement. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he uses the device to bridge and accept his role. The cost is more conceptual than visceral, softening impact. Still, the structural tightening around 4:17 functions cleanly under a mostly causal/accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The abandoned circus ticket office is vivid and filtered through Marcus’s occupational bias; fluorescent buzz and dust patterns are purposeful. The setting supplies resources (collapsed counter revealing the mainspring) and constraints (timed lights, ceiling focus) that shape tactics. The mainspring’s ticking charges the final image. World rules feel coherent and learned through observation rather than dump.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around the time window and the room’s thinning barrier; the spirits’ appearance raises stakes. The meaningful turn is his choice to engage rather than fear, using the mainspring. However, the price of that choice is implied rather than dramatized (no hard trade-off or visible loss), softening escalation. Tension is steady, not razor-tight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Recurring images (ceilings, dust, buzz, cracks) braid into a theme of perception and acceptance; “weightless burden” reframes to calling at the end. The final image (ticking bridging worlds) offers a non-literal answer about connection through craft. A touch of thesis-y assertion (“confirming what… he had always believed”) blunts subtext. Overall resonance is earned more by image than by moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>POV is steady, with a distinct perceptual signature rooted in technical observation and upward attention. Diction fits the character’s mindset and balances mechanic and spectral registers. Rhythm is controlled with effective modulation at the 4:17 beat. No head‑hopping or stance drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is clean and imagistic with good sensory layering; the “like X” similes mostly serve clarity. Some redundancy and purple edges (“weightless burden” repeated, multiple metaphoric likenings) slightly slow momentum. Line-level transitions are clear and purposeful. The final sentence cadence lands cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elevator tech + ghost-seeing + horology mainspring as interdimensional sensor is a fresh synthesis, and dust analysis as method feels distinctive. The timed fluorescent buzz as a veil-thinning mechanism is inventive and integrated. Emotional calculus is quieter than the conceptual novelty, but the reweighting of burden → vocation gives human texture. Risks are coherent and pay off without gimmickry.</comment>
