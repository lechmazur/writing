<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear, character‑particular interiority and a credible motive shift from cosmic research to humble observation. Micro‑choices (collecting dust, daily documentation) align with values, but internal contradiction is low and pressure remains gentle. The colleagues’ incomprehension hints at cost but isn’t tested. The final renunciation feels earned though relatively low‑risk on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterned observation builds to a conceptual repricing where the final butterfly emergence reweights her life’s aim. Orientation is crisp early; the closure lands as a quiet, resonant reconfiguration with a lightly felt price. The scene lacks a decisive turn, but density and motif reprise provide closure. Cost is implied rather than dramatized, keeping this below the highest band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The storm‑damaged greenhouse is vivid, sensorial, and POV‑filtered (broken glass, damp soil, water‑stained walls). The environment repeatedly frames choices and images, and charges the ending’s small miracles. While it doesn’t physically constrain tactics, it strongly inflects meaning. The recurring objects (terracotta pot, butterfly dust) are well integrated.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stakes are internal—refusing drama for humble attention—and escalation is mostly a steady accrual rather than a tightening. There’s no strong on‑page foreclosing choice under pressure, only a consolidation of stance. The colleagues’ disapproval is gestured at but doesn’t create a live squeeze. The final image deepens rather than narrows options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Decay/renewal vs. cosmic scale emerges cleanly through particulars (dust patterns mirroring galaxies). However, several lines articulate the thesis too directly (“not in distant stars, but in the gradual change…”), softening subtext. The ending image of the new butterfly is resonant if slightly programmatic. The piece avoids false equivalence and earns its quiet emotional aftereffect.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a controlled, observant lyricism suited to a scientist’s sensibility. Diction stays coherent and the perceptual signature—pattern‑seeking—feels specific. Some phrasing leans declarative at thematic peaks, but the voice remains steady. No head‑hopping or stance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Clean sentences with solid rhythm and purposeful detail; a few paraphrase‑like reiterations and thesis statements slow momentum. Figurative threads (spiral galaxies/dust) are coherent and not over‑stacked. Minor redundancy in stating the transformation keeps it out of high band. Mechanics are sound.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: an astrophysicist reading a flooded greenhouse’s dust as a galaxy analogue is memorable. The risk is modest but coherent, and the final reweighting feels inevitable in hindsight. Some moves are familiar (nature’s resilience, stripping drama) yet executed with specificity. Not groundbreaking, but distinctly voiced.</comment>
