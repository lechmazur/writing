<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and consistent—an ex‑preservationist turned secret custodian aiming to be “visible” to those in need. Interiority is specific (catalog numbers, tactile engagement with pipes and tape), though internal contradiction is muted and risk‑averse. The key choice—help indirectly without revealing the self—reads as an earned endurance/renunciation, but the felt cost stays mostly conceptual. A sharper moment of jeopardy or self‑conflict under pressure would deepen character change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the pattern of clandestine routines intensifies until the tape fragment reframes the mission, culminating in a Charged Poise—planning an indirect reveal. Orientation is solid early (crawl space under the library, pre‑dawn outage), and beats track cleanly from find → recognition → plan. Closure lands as a stance crystallization with conceptual cost (visibility vs. concealment), though the price remains implied rather than tested on the page. The causal thread (fragment contains schematics that could fix the failure) is convincing but lightly dramatized.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The library’s infrastructure—crawl spaces, pipe chases, copper pipes—feels tactile and guides action and access. Sensory specificity (“sapphire hush,” cool pipes, catalog etchings) is selective and character‑filtered by technical expertise. The power outage meaningfully shapes tactics and mood. Setting charges the final image, though a single constraint bite (e.g., physical risk) would push this higher.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake: preserve and surface essential knowledge without exposure. The meaningful tightening arrives with the discovery that the fragment contains original schematics tied to the current outage, which reweights the protagonist’s mission. Escalation remains quiet; tension is philosophical more than peril‑driven, and the cost of the final decision is more thematic than visceral. A visible trade‑off under time pressure would heighten stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme coheres: guardianship of knowledge, invisibility versus service, and the ethics of preservation under institutional neglect. Recurring images (pipes, tape, darkness/sapphire hush) accrue toward an ending that reweights visibility as a sacrificial, indirect act. The last paragraph edges toward summary (“They were the library’s secret keeper...”), slightly flattening subtext into statement. Still, the charged final plan provides genuine resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and credible, with a distinct perceptual signature shaped by archival practice and building literacy. Diction and rhythm are controlled and consistent; lyric touches feel voice‑motivated. No head‑hopping or register slips; the narrative modulates calmly with the piece’s hush. A touch more compression at peaks could sharpen cadence without losing texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is clean, with purposeful detail and good information density; the catalog number moment is precise and evocative. Minor redundancy (reiterations of “kindly methodical,” visibility mission) and occasional abstract summary in the close soften momentum. Figurative language (“sapphire hush,” tape humming with residual energy) stays coherent and legible. Line‑level craft supports mood but could cut a few explanatory pivots for tighter propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The crawl‑space archivist as invisible curator is a fresh, specific angle, and the ferromagnetic fragment grounds the piece in concrete, uncommon detail. The moral calculus—help without exposure—feels organically tied to vocation and space. Risks are quiet but unified; the piece commits to its subdued register without gimmickry. A bolder on‑page price or complication could elevate ingenuity into the top band.</comment>
