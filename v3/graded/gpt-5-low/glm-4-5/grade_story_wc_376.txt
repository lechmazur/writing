<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s motives are vivid and consistent—truth as sustenance and liability—and the “wilting near dishonesty” trait personalizes her costs. Her interiority is specific (leaf‑gilding, spoken truths curing) and her decision to depart at dawn earns a credible renunciation. Internal contradiction (need for connection vs. intolerance for false peace) is present, though some realizations verge on tidy declaration. A bit more embodied struggle in the final choice would push this higher.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Hybrid drive (situational + causal): the map discovery and the postal plate alignment produce a clear “therefore” that culminates in the decision to go. Orientation is clean; props and rules set early return with function. Closure lands as Charged Poise: she commits to a dangerous, honesty‑only path, with conceptual and social cost legible. Stakes remain mostly anticipatory rather than directly tested on the page, trimming the ceiling.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The greenhouse city and toxic sky aren’t just window dressing; failed filtration systems and poison districts constrain route and method. Micro‑setting objects (postal plate, map) and environmental rules (candor‑safe passages) directly inform tactics and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful. A minor lift in tactile engagement under pressure would make it stellar.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: reach the Repository to reclaim lost conversations and personal closure. Escalation tightens with the floorboard discovery and the lock‑and‑key realization, narrowing options toward a high‑risk, no‑deception path. The cost is stated (danger, social renunciation) but not stress‑tested in scene. One concrete on‑page obstacle or loss would deepen the felt price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Themes of truth, preservation, and the moral calculus of candor are integrated through specific images (curing gold scripts, candor‑safe routes). The ending offers a resonant stance—authenticity as the only viable method—yet edges into explicit moralizing (“She finally understood...”), reducing subtext. The lost‑conversation aim and departed love lend poignancy without sentimentality. A touch more implication over statement would heighten resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>POV is steady and character‑filtered; diction fits a lyrical, craft‑attuned mind. Rhythm varies, and the single spoken line lands naturally. Occasional expository declaratives flatten the otherwise textured voice. Overall, the perceptual signature (craft, sincerity, atmosphere) holds.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose is clear and image‑rich, with strong nouns and purposeful objects; momentum is generally maintained. Some lines summarize theme or repeat information, modestly damping propulsion. Figurative choices stay coherent and avoid purple overload. Syntax varies enough to keep the ear engaged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: a calligrapher who gilds truth, postal plate as lock, candor‑charted safe paths, and toxicity as both literal and moral atmosphere. The lock‑and‑key glow moment is memorable and earned. Risks are thematic rather than structural, but they cohere. A more surprising on‑page complication would lift ingenuity into the exceptional band.</comment>
