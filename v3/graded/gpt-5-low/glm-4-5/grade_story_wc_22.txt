<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and steady—he aims to heal a poisoned battlefield—and his actions align (journeying, seeding, following bird guidance). Interiority is evocative but light on contradiction; he rarely wavers or reveals competing impulses. The “dead languages” detail personalizes his method and worldview. Emotional cost registers mainly as exhaustion and depletion of seeds, not deep internal struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece builds through iterative acts—journey, seeding, song, tactical pivot—toward a charged dawn and a years-later payoff. Causality holds: the bird-call pivot (“The western hollow first”) meaningfully redirects tactics, and depletion of pods tightens options. Closure lands with a reconfigured world—recovery of garden/reef—though the price is modest and partially offloaded to summary. Orientation is clean from the outset (coachman, jetty, twilight; post-reef timeline).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The blooming jetty, barren battlefield, and dead reef are vividly rendered and filtered through his practical mission (seed placement, soil status via birds). Environment shapes choices (jetty as staging; “western hollow” as micro-geometry for action). Sensory balance and world logic are consistent, with setting details integrated into movement. The recurrent jetty frames the ending image effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes are coherent (restore concord by making the battlefield bloom), but antagonistic pressure is gentle and largely environmental. One meaningful tightening occurs when the bird refocuses him to the western hollow and as pods dwindle by dawn. Costs are present but light (exhaustion, scarcity), with little resistance beyond terrain and time. Resolution is earned but low-tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Restoration, interspecies concord, and language as covenant emerge organically through acts and images (songs to soil, birds as guides). However, the explicit moralizing phrase “narrow vastness—the idea that even the smallest actions...” blunts subtext. The final image (war to wildflowers; hunger to abundance) resonates, but complexity is trimmed by the neat, summary epilogue. The theme is moving yet slightly didactic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>A consistent, lyrical third-person with a distinct perceptual signature (languages, birds, soil) sustains tone without head-hopping. Rhythm and diction suit a meditative, fablelike frame. Minor register and mechanical slips (e.g., “ttk duelersi”) nick polish. Dialogue, when present, is minimal but purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Lines are generally clear and economical, with effective images (“sound of seeds hitting earth... a soft language of hope”). Some purple leaning and small redundancies dampen propulsion; the stray glitch “ttk duelersi” disrupts flow. The years-later summary compresses well but edges toward sentimental phrasing. Overall clean but not elite-precise.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—coachman, dead languages, bird calls, ecological rewilding, and a “submerged concord”—feels fresh and coherent. Tactics grounded in language and avian cues give the premise specificity. The structure is conventional but the texture is distinctive. It risks lyric myth-making without losing clarity.</comment>
