<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s reticence and observational acuity feel specific and embodied, and his choices (repairing the light, honoring the chain, returning the sea glass) align with that character. The internal conflict is quiet—loneliness versus duty—and resolves credibly through a chosen commitment. The cost is emotional rather than dramatic, but it reads: he accepts responsibility for preserving a secret lineage. A slightly sharper moment of hesitation under pressure would elevate the arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Clean orientation and a coherent accumulative structure: lamp fails → search → discovery → tradition → recommitment. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—he joins and vows to protect the chain—reweighting the lighthouse’s purpose. Cost is present as an embraced duty and guarded secrecy, though the external ship‑safety threat defuses quickly. The lens holds without contradiction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The lighthouse and lantern room are tactile and lived-in: salt, oil, “pause between thunderclaps,” spiral stairs, loose floorboard. Setting drives choices (lamp failure prompts the search; physical space hides the letters and stones) and charges the final image. Objects (sea glass, stones, lens) function as micro‑settings that constrain action and meaning. Vivid without tourist cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes are coherent (light’s reliability and the keeper fellowship), with one meaningful tightening when the lamp dies and forces investigation that uncovers the chain. Escalation is primarily internal/deepening rather than adversarial; the external hazard resolves swiftly after repair. The ending choice—to protect the lineage—carries a felt price in secrecy and duty. A touch more friction during the outage would sharpen pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: silence as fellowship, lineage as shelter, objects as vows. The final acts (stone added, letter written, sea glass returned) provide a non‑literal answer about belonging and guardianship. Occasional near‑moralizing (“a beacon for ships and souls alike”) brushes the on‑the‑nose, but the closing reprices the premise with earned resonance. The ache of loneliness converted to kinship lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a measured, briny lyricism suited to a taciturn mariner. Diction and rhythm are controlled; sensory choices reflect a professional eye. No dialogue is needed; silence functions as action. The voice sustains under stress without register slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is clean and purposeful, with strong image economy (“pause between thunderclaps,” “white tower…promise”). Minor intensifier echoes (“luminescent ache,” “beacon for ships and souls alike”) tilt toward sentiment but do not stall momentum. Syntax varies and prose carries multiple jobs per line. No significant scaffold or loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The stone‑stack code and anonymous letter chain offer a fresh inflection on the haunted lighthouse trope. The sea glass marker is a precise, memorable device that reconfigures meaning. The turn from maintenance to inheritance feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk is measured but confident; the originality rests in specific, cohesive details rather than gimmick.</comment>
