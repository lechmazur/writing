<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Eli’s motive (redeeming the ancestor) is specific and consistent, and the “nervous confidence” shows in embodied choices (trembling, pressing the nail) under pressure. The internal conflict between duty and dread is legible without melodrama. However, emotion is sometimes summarized (“spongey dread”) rather than newly dramatized, limiting texture. Relationship pressure from Dr. Aris is present but light.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Clear causal chain: decoding stanzas → nail as key → hidden controls → initiation. Orientation is crisp from the start; the lens remains Causal through closure. The ending lands as a Decisive Change/Charged Poise with implied cost (activating dormant tech, challenging consensus), though that cost could be more concretely priced. No broken set‑ups or convenience resolutions.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The station, damp concrete, and storm‑scoured coast are purposeful and consistent; the copper nail functions as a tool that constrains action and charges the final image. Technical environment (hidden panel, blue lights) is integrated into choice. While sensory breadth could be wider, specificity serves pressure rather than cataloguing. World rules feel coherent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (activate a risky, legacy system) is signaled early and tightens as decoding turns into action. The decisive press and initiation narrow options and test commitment. The cost is more conceptual than visceral on the page, so escalation feels measured rather than bracing. A single, clean tightening occurs but doesn’t foreclose a clearly named alternative with pain.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>“Reversible exile” resonates across reputation, climate, and the hidden system, with the nail as moral conduit. The final act reframes the ancestor’s disgrace into purpose, offering a thematic answer without a moral lecture. A few lines state theme directly (“might be reversible with the right knowledge and courage”), slightly blunting subtext. Still, image and action carry much of the weight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>POV is steady and plausibly limited; diction balances technical and personal registers without leakage. Dialogue is minimal but functional, carrying status and skepticism. Some repeated phrasing and explanatory sentences flatten rhythm mildly. Overall, the voice feels coherent and suited to a meticulous, anxious protagonist.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose is clean and mostly propulsive, with effective image choices (“damp chill,” “blue light across panels”). There’s minor redundancy and telling (“spongey dread” recurs; several lines restate motive), which slows momentum. Syntax varies enough to avoid monotony, and information density is decent. No figurative muddle at the peak, but a touch more compression would sharpen the close.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The coffin nail as key, map librarian decoding shipwrecked verse, and “reversible exile” synthesis feel fresh and specific. The tech/poetry interface is an inventive bridge between archive and apparatus. Risks are taken without gimmickry, though the consequences remain implied rather than singularly surprising. The combination reads memorable and internally justified.</comment>
