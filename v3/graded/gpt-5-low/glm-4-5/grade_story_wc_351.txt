<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Clear motive and embodied stakes (trembling fingers, tears) give the engineer specificity, but contradictory impulses are faint; there’s little dramatized resistance beyond awe and tremor. Competence remains largely unchallenged, so struggle reads interior and smooth. The identity‑blur cost arrives, but we don’t see a hard choice negotiated on the page. Still, the particular “helix‑mind” filter offers a distinct interiority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: preparation → activation → deepening → reconfiguration, culminating in a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis blend (“permanently changed,” quaking reverie now a state). Orientation is clean early (who/where/when). Closure lands with conceptual and emotional cost tied to the device and mind. The causal thread is light but coherent for a lyric design.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The moonlit canyon and broken mirror are vividly integrated, with selective sensory detail (silvers, blues, carved patterns) and a charged final reprise. The environment mirrors inner state without feeling like a postcard. While it doesn’t strongly constrain choices, the object‑as‑setting (mirror) meaningfully charges closure. Professional detail is plausibly filtered through the POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear (access and transformation), and escalation follows activation to identity blur, but there’s no decisive on‑page trade‑off or foreclosed option beyond acceptance. Pressure coheres and deepens texturally rather than via turns. The cost is felt, yet conflict remains largely internal and unopposed. One meaningful tightening occurs, but without a hard reversal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Resonant motifs (broken mirror, spirals, archaeology of dreams) align with a theme of purpose found in imperfection and communal memory. However, several lines tip into thesis‑statement territory (“modified the very relationship between abandonment and rediscovery”), blunting subtext. The final image conceptually reprices the mirror and purpose. Thematic complexity is present but somewhat over‑articulated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Consistent single‑POV lyric voice with a distinct perceptual signature (“helix‑mind,” “chaotically precise”). Rhythm and diction support the trance‑like pressure. Minor abstraction and repetition creep in, but no head‑hopping or stance slips. Dialogue is sparse and functional.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Line craft is mostly clean with evocative images; sentences carry multiple jobs. There’s some purple density and motif repetition (“quaking reverie,” “synaptic plasticity”) that could be trimmed for momentum. No major metaphor muddle, and action order remains clear. The cadence supports a lyric, accumulative build without severe loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—broken periscope as consciousness lens, helix‑minded engineer as archaeologist of dreams—feels fresh and coherent. Risks are taken in concept and tone without losing clarity. The arc is familiar in structure (activation → transformation), but the particulars and object logic distinguish it. Emotional truth is present though the path is a touch smooth.</comment>
