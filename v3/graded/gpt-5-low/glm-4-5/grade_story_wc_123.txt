<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear motive (integrity vs. fear) and embodied choices (lateral movement, trembling fingers) read specific and credible. Internal conflict is present but tidy, with the “nurture integrity in solitude” refrain edging toward abstraction. Competence and caution blend well with risk, though the cost of the final act remains mostly implied. The occupational lens (storm recorder) genuinely informs perception and tactics.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Orientation is crisp early (courtyard at dusk; surveillance threat), and a Causal/Situational drive holds: find tube → verify conspiracy → choose to broadcast. Closure lands with the released pigeon (Charged Poise toward Decisive Change), though the on‑page cost is largely conceptual. The beats connect cleanly without teleports or resets. One scene coherence is strong.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The courtyard materially shapes tactics: lateral perimeter path, fountain masking sound, windows as threat vectors. The message tube and silver pigeon charge the final image. Details feel filtered through a recorder’s eye, avoiding tourist catalog. Environmental logic remains consistent and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (expose regime) is clear, with a meaningful tightening when Elias co-opts the inner circle pigeon. Pressure is coherent but largely internal; no on‑page counterforce intervenes at the peak, softening felt cost. Still, the decision forecloses safer paths (silence, delay) in a legible way. The “watchers retreated” clock works as a light squeeze.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Integrity versus manipulation is embodied in the ironic use of the regime’s own courier; tranquility as cover versus complicity resonates. A few declarative lines (“authorities were manipulating weather systems…”) tip toward thesis. The final image reweights earlier motifs without sermonizing. The moral calculus (truth via infiltration) is clear and thematically integrated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and selective, with a measured, observant diction befitting a “recorder.” Rhythm varies enough, though some list-like structures and repeated phrasing show seams. No head‑hopping or unearned omniscience. Voice holds under pressure with controlled elevation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is clean and purposeful with good sensory economy; the fountain and brass tube lines do double duty. Minor redundancy (“nurture integrity in solitude” repeats) and a couple of expository compressions slow momentum. No figurative muddle or copy errors. Information density is solid without purple drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Storm manipulation plus a rogue quarantine zone is familiar, but the carrier pigeon system and lateral tactics add freshness. The silver-feathered inner-circle bird is a sharp, specific twist that feels inevitable in hindsight. Risks are thoughtful rather than flashy, and the synthesis coheres. Some conspiracy exposition leans conventional.</comment>
