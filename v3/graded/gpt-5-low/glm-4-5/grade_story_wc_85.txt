<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Martin’s guilt, profession, and bodily stressors are concrete and consistent, and his micro‑choices (returning to the shore, handling the watch hand, distinguishing his own carvings) align with his motives. The discovery of the grandfather’s carving credibly reconfigures his self‑story and prompts a costly decision to close his business. Internal contradiction (profiting from erasure while yearning for truth) runs through the scene. The epiphany leans tidy but is earned by specific evidence on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the scene builds via repeated returns to the carvings and watch hand until the grandfather’s piece appears, delivering a clear Conceptual Repricing with cost. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when) and the single scene coheres. The closure image—pairing the two watch hands and the decision to shut the business—lands on the page with felt consequence. Causality is simple but intact; no unkept setups.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The shore, driftwood carvings, and cobalt terrace provide a vivid, tactile world filtered through Martin’s obsessions. The environment and recurring object (watch hand/carvings) charge the final image rather than serve as postcard detail. Professional eye shaping what he notices (sanding patterns, signatures) grounds specificity. Weather and light subtly track mood without cliché overload.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Pressure is primarily internal but coherent and tightening: the nightly sifting culminates in the grandfather’s carving, deepening stakes from guilt to irrevocable recognition. The price is a renunciation—closing the lucrative business—which forecloses a path. Escalation is quiet yet legible under the accumulative lens. A more direct external test could have pushed the cost higher.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Themes of memory, erasure, and earned truth are integrated through the watch hand/carving motif and Martin’s trade. Subtext rises from action and object reweighting more than speech. However, the final moralizing line (“sometimes the most valuable inheritance…”) states the theme outright, softening the resonance. Without that explicitness, the charged image of paired watch hands would suffice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The close third‑person voice is steady, lyrical, and plausibly educated for this character; perception is filtered through his craft and guilt. Rhythm modulates with pressure, and focalization never leaks. No dialogue is needed; interiority carries action. Occasional elevated diction skirts purple but largely serves tone.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is clean with purposeful images and strong verbs; information density is good. Some repetition (“sieved hush” and parallel constructions) and tonal luxuriance edge toward overwriting. A few near‑duplicates could be trimmed for momentum. The final third remains clear and image‑driven.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The black‑market genealogist premise and driftwood‑carving method feel fresh, and the watch‑hand reweighting is an elegant turn. Emotional truth emerges specifically from his trade, not generic guilt. The piece takes a tasteful risk in its quiet, object‑driven closure. It stops short of truly startling invention but is notably above template.</comment>
