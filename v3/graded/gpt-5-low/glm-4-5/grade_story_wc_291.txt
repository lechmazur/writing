<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elena’s motivation (solve the cold case to awaken empathy) is clear and consistent, and her prosopagnosia gives her a specific perceptual signature. Her methodical choices (measuring, cross-referencing, calling for schematics) align with her traits. However, internal contradiction is minimal, and she encounters little resistance; competence dominates struggle. The ending claims emotional stakes but shows little on‑page cost or conflicted choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Under a causal lens, the ribbon → mask design → custom order → assistant chain is coherent, if telescoped. Orientation is strong and the scene holds a single throughline with one tightening (documents arrival leading to the focused deduction). Closure lands via the stated confession, but it occurs off‑page, muting cost and diminishing the decisive turn’s felt impact. The drive stays legible, though the payoff is partly summarized.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The quarry’s mist, granite face, and “furrowed hush” create tactile atmosphere and a visual logic for anonymity. The environment modestly constrains inference (ribbon wedged in the northeastern corner suggesting struggle; light angles considered). Details are filtered through Elena’s tactile, shape-driven gaze, reinforcing POV. While strong, the setting rarely forces a hard choice, tempering top-band eligibility.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stakes are clear (break an “unsolvable” case), and pressure increases when Reyes brings documents and the suspect pool narrows. Yet obstacles are low: access is immediate, deductions proceed smoothly, and no option is visibly foreclosed at cost. The climax is declarative rather than contested. Tension exists more as intellectual narrowing than lived jeopardy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Themes of memory, seeing versus knowing, and communal amnesia are embedded in images (mask, mist) and Elena’s condition. However, the closing moral (“empathy never truly disappears”) states the thesis rather than letting images carry it, flattening subtext. The “unifying opposites” motif is told more than dramatized. Resonance is present but over‑articulated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The voice is controlled and lyrical with a distinct tactile bias suited to a face-blind artist. Dialogue is sparse but functional; POV remains stable. Elevated diction mostly fits the character, though occasional grandness edges toward abstraction. Rhythm varies well enough to sustain momentum.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Line-level craft is generally clean with purposeful imagery (“gold-and-silver threading,” “furrowed hush”) and efficient beats. Minor overwriting and repetition (the recurring “furrowed hush,” aphoristic final lines) slightly blunt impact. Information density is solid; few scaffold lines linger. Clarity holds throughout.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The face-blind portrait artist solving a masquerade murder via a ribbon is a fresh, coherent synthesis. The quarry setting and tactile method enrich the premise. The off-page confession and smooth path prevent the piece from feeling daring at the end. Still, the angle on perception and memory offers genuine distinctiveness.</comment>
