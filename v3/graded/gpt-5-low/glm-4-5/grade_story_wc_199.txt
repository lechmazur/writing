<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation (decoding the leaves) is clear and her competence reads specific and embodied; the moonstone moment reveals values without grandstanding. However, pressure rarely fractures her composure, yielding little contradictory impulse under stress. The transformation confers advantage without visible price beyond a tingle. The role remains compelling but not yet tested.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the speck’s arrival tightens focus, enabling the decode and culminating in the warning and placed monument. Orientation is clean; single-scene containment holds. Closure lands as a quiet resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive turn, with only a light cost implied. The because/therefore chain is modest but coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The skyborne arbor, hush, bone tool, and trays are vivid, POV-filtered, and consistently used; the setting’s rules (the hush, arbor-born minerals) feel learned through action. The environment charges the final image (the monument as beacon) even if it seldom constrains tactics. Sensory specificity is strong without museum touring.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake (read the leaves to warn the dwellers) is present and the moonstone deepens urgency, but on-page resistance is mild and largely procedural. Escalation occurs as a pattern break rather than live opposition, with little foreclosed path or paid price. The decode arrives smoothly, limiting tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Memory, stewardship, and cyclical becoming accrue through seeds, monuments, and the hush; the final beacon image reweights prior motifs without sermonizing. A line like “served a greater purpose” edges toward explicitness but doesn’t overwhelm the scene. Resonance lingers, though moral complexity and cost remain gentle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The lyrical third-person close holds steady with a distinct perceptual signature (botanical lexicon, ritual cadence). Rhythm modulates around the discovery and decode without head-hopping or stance slips. A minor repetition glitch (“always emerges transformed always”) nicks polish but not control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lines are generally clean, image-rich, and purposeful; verbs carry work and information density is decent. Occasional purple edging and a small redundancy (“always… always”) and some stacked modifiers slow momentum slightly. Still, clarity and cadence keep the scene moving.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The vocation (seed sorting as divination), tiny monuments as living oracle, and moonstone dust speck are fresh syntheses that feel organic to this world. The risks are aesthetic rather than structural, but the world’s textures and tactics cohere. The arc is understated, limiting the sense of singular inevitability.</comment>
