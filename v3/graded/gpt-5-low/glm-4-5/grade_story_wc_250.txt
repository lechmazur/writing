<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The guardian’s motive (to “teach darkness the value of stars”) is clear and embodied through precise, ritualized action; the visitor’s burden is legible in posture and hesitation. Interiority is minimal and largely projected through behavior, limiting contradiction and micro‑choice texture. The silent exchange at the end earns a small endurance/renunciation cost (secret remains unspoken). Strong presence, modest depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Single continuous scene with clear anchors and a coherent accumulative/textural drive culminating in a charged final image. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the secret remains unspoken but reweighted, the visitor’s burden eased, and the final star pattern seals the exchange. Cost is conceptual and quiet but present (withholding/change without declaration; dawn as a soft clock). The progression from first patterns to spiral to final star reads intentional and cohesive.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The cobalt dock, wet shutters, canal stillness, and the dental mirror form a highly specific ecosystem that enables and constrains the light‑weaving. Environment is not postcard; it’s functional—wet surfaces and shutters make the method possible and charge the final image. Recurring object (dental mirror) and place condition the tactics and closure. Vivid sensory economy, mostly visual with tactile wetness supporting tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Pressure coheres via the visitor’s unsaid secret, the intensifying pattern‑making, and the approach of dawn. Escalation is a density/scale increase (constellations → spiral galaxy → final star) rather than a reversal; stakes remain intimate and internal. The visible price is a chosen silence/endurance, which reads but is modest. The nod at the end crystallizes stance without venting tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Themes of empathy beyond language and light’s meaning through shadow emerge organically through action and image. Occasional explicit restatements (“teach darkness the value of stars”) flirt with on‑the‑nose, but the final cadence reweights them rather than moralizes. The unspoken secret as shared charge delivers a resonant, non‑literal answer. Ambiguity invites reflection without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>A consistent, lyrical third‑person distance maintains control and a distinct perceptual signature (craft‑focused noticing). Diction and rhythm support the stillwater mood and tighten as dawn nears. Purposeful elision (no stated secret) reads earned rather than coy. No head‑hopping or stance leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is polished and musical with strong image economy; recurring motifs are cleanly threaded. Some repetition edges toward ornamental (the thesis line recurs) and a few sentences double the same idea, lightly slowing momentum. Figurative logic remains consistent, avoiding mixed metaphors. The final line lands with clarity and charge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The light‑weaving via shutters and a dental mirror is striking and fresh, elevating a familiar “unsaid secret” dynamic. The guardian archetype is reimagined through tactile, optical craft. The closure’s quiet transfer of understanding feels earned within this unique system. Bold but coherent without gimmickry.</comment>
