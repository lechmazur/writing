<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation is clear (to learn the “rhythm of repair”) and actions align with it; embodied emotion appears in trembling fingers and breath-clouds. However, internal contradiction is minimal and the path feels largely frictionless, softening the felt cost of the final choice. The legacy tie to the grandfather adds specificity without generating real pressure. The earned realization (“not to claim something new, but to restore”) lands but reads a touch tidy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Single scene with clean orientation, causal beats (find pedestal → open box → repair heart) under a hybrid lens with an accumulative, lyric cadence at the end. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the repaired heart awakens the library and reweights Elias’s quest into belonging. Cost is conceptual (renunciation of treasure/claim-mindset for service), not deeply painful but present. No causality breaks or teleporting setups.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The frozen library, hall of mirrors, and tools are vividly rendered with consistent world logic; sensory detail is purposeful and POV‑filtered through a craftsman’s eye. The environment lightly constrains navigation (mirror labyrinth) and charges the ending as ice melts and knowledge flows. While evocative, the setting rarely forces tactical adaptation beyond mood and wayfinding. Strong atmosphere without a hard constraint keeps it just shy of the top band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stakes are coherent (will he find and restore what matters), and there’s a clear tightening at the pedestal and the delicate lockwork. Yet obstacles are modest and largely aesthetic; he encounters no meaningful setback or tradeoff during the opening/repair. The price feels mostly conceptual, so tension never fully peaks. Escalation is present but mild.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Themes of restoration over acquisition, empathy as method, and lineage/belonging accrue naturally via recurring images (mirrors, heart, tools). The final images (ancestors in reflections, synchronized heartbeat) resonate. A line explicitly states the moral (“not to claim something new, but to restore”), which blunts subtext. Still, the closing reweights the premise with gentle grace.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third‑person close is stable; the prose has a distinct, lyrical texture consistent with a reverent craftsman’s gaze. Patterned diction (“hauntingly bright,” “driftwood nostalgia”) is controlled, if occasionally repetitive. Dialogue is minimal but functional. No head‑hopping or stance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lines are polished and imagistic, with varied rhythm and mostly strong verbs. Some repetition and purple shading (“hauntingly bright” and motif echoes) plus one odd lexical glitch (“精密 tools”) distract at the line level. A few paraphrase echoes (“Through scraps of prophecy…”) slow momentum. Clarity remains good, but leaner cuts could heighten propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes familiar elements (mythic library, clockwork heart) with fresh inflections (lunar‑eclipse locksmith, empathy‑based unlocking). The awakening library via repaired heart is pleasing and thematically apt, if not surprising. Risk profile is moderate; execution is elegant rather than daring. Memorable images, but the conflict path stays safe.</comment>
