<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The ghost bride’s motive is clear and consistent—repay a debt and move on—and her key micro‑choice (retrieving the vial and releasing the seeds) aligns with it. Interiority is present but mostly externalized through image rather than contradictory impulses in scene. The relationship with Thomas is moving yet largely summarized. The felt cost at the end (her dissipation) reads earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Orientation is immediate and the accumulative/casual chain is clean: midnight alignment → bead pulses → embodiment strengthens → she chooses the seeds → bead crumbles → bloom appears. Closure lands on the page with cost as the bead disintegrates and she fades, repaid debt achieved. No causality breaks or teleports; the greenhouse’s binding constraint persists through the end. The brief epilogue with the groundskeeper consolidates consequences without over‑explaining.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The greenhouse and winter‑cracked fields are vivid and specific, with bioluminescent blossoms, frost patterns, and the endless night. Setting is not postcard: it binds the ghost, conducts the bead’s energy, and channels the seeds to the shoot; the spiral motif in the final bloom charges the closing image. World rules (alchemical resonance) are consistent and learned in action. Detail is selective and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes are singular and clear (repay the debt/transition), with a meaningful tightening at midnight that forces action before she fades. The bead’s impending crumble creates a tacit clock; her choice carries an on‑page price. Escalation is elegant rather than tense; a bit more friction in execution could intensify pressure. Still, the agency at the peak beat is unmistakable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Themes of love as both preservative and poisonous, debt, and transformation recur through concrete particulars (spores, seeds, spiral). The final bloom reweights the narrative with a resonant image of union. However, the last paragraph’s declarative moral (“stood as testimony…”) edges toward on‑the‑nose. Subtext otherwise operates well in image and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>A consistent lyrical third‑person voice sustains mood without head‑hopping, and diction suits the alchemical‑gothic frame. Rhythm modulates effectively around the midnight beat. No dialogue, but the narrative stance remains controlled and confident. Occasional repeated phrasing (“lovingly venomous”) feels patterned, not lazy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and mostly efficient; sentences carry multiple jobs (atmosphere, world‑logic, action). Minor lushness and a touch of summary in backstory slightly slow momentum but don’t blur sense. No significant scaffold loops or mixed metaphors; the closing image is clear. Overall, strong line control with mild purple edges.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Ghost‑bride and alchemical greenhouse could be familiar, yet the “lovingly venomous” ecology and spiral bead/bloom reconfiguration feel fresh. The causal use of resonance and seasonal inversion adds ingenuity. The ending’s bloom as paid‑off symbol reads inevitable in hindsight. Not radical, but confidently distinctive.</comment>
