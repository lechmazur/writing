<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Maya’s paradox (arsonist’s daughter turned firefighter) anchors motive and yields credible micro‑choices, especially her move toward the garden after the evacuation order. Interiority is concrete through the coin, black sand, and grafts rather than therapy‑speak. The internal conflict leans tidy as the mantra “Scars can sing” recurs without much resistance. Still, her embodied care under pressure reads specific and earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: pressure accrues from the advancing fire to embers landing, then releases as the cloud migration passes. Orientation is clear and the two shards (garden action → lagoon reflection → station) remain coherent. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—garden saved, legacy repurposed—though the on‑page cost is soft. Causal links are present but secondary to cadence and motif.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful: the cloud migration, obsidian lagoon, dunes, and botanical specifics filter through a firefighter’s and gardener’s eye. Weather materially affects tactics; the garden’s layout and tools (wax, fire blanket) guide action. Recurring objects (black sand, coin) charge the final image and bind past to present. Sensory detail is selective and lived‑in without museum‑tour excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (save the grafted roses) is clear; the meaningful tightening arrives when embers land and she shields the plants. Her agency drives protection rather than retreat, lightly defying the evacuation order. However, reversals and visible costs are minimal and success comes without a hard trade‑off. Tension operates but never truly bites.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Themes of transformation, inheritance, and the beauty of scars emerge organically via grafting and the repurposed black sand. The coin and lagoon help subtextualize legacy and chosen identity. Repetition of “Scars can sing” veers into thesis articulation, reducing subtlety in the final stretch. Despite that, the closing image reweights prior particulars with honest feeling.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>A consistent, lyrical third‑person lens with a distinct perceptual signature—professional, tactile, and image‑forward. Voice modulates from urgency to kelp‑drift calm without head‑hopping. Minimal dialogue is functional and in character. Occasional patterning echoes (cloud migration) flirt with redundancy but don’t disrupt control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is clean and rhythmic, with strong verb choices and purposeful images tied to action. Some lines loop conceptually (coin/black sand/cloud migration restatements), and a few metaphors trend ornate. Momentum mostly holds through the high‑pressure beat with the embers. Minor purple glints soften edge rather than obscuring sense.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—arsonist’s daughter firefighter rescuing grafted roses with volcanic black sand under migrating clouds—is fresh and coherent. The craft avoids template moves and commits to a specific symbolic economy. A touch of on‑the‑nose thematics tempers the sense of risk. Still, the vision feels singular and memorable.</comment>
