<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and sustained (the drive to find and mine the library), with embodied trepidation versus hunger shaping small choices (raising the watch, selecting the manuscript, rushing to document). Interiority is vivid but largely untested by a hard dilemma; the cost remains conceptual rather than forcing a painful trade. The anonymous “veiled dreamer” voice is consistent yet keeps the character at an archetypal distance. The final shift—keeping the knowledge as an unspoken secret—lands but doesn’t expose a deeper flaw or contradiction under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: images and rules accrue (watch cycles, fog threshold, living stacks) to a resonant reconfiguration at exit. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: the power of the unsaid and a transformed stance, with the watch’s change and fading library charging the final image. Causality is coherent beat-to-beat, though the price is soft (urgency more than loss). Orientation is clean early, and the single-scene window holds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The mist-library and the watch function as environment-tools that gate access, dictate timing, and shape movement (walls part, fog density, cycles). Sensory specificity (hovering pages, soft luminescence, cracked crystal) supports tone without stalling momentum. World rules are learned through action, not exposition. The final image (walls fading, watch normal) is charged by prior environmental constraints.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>One dominant stake—enter, learn, and record before disappearance—is signaled early and tightened by the watch’s accelerating reversal. The meaningful turn is the entrance and the later acceleration that forces triage to document. The cost is light (time pressure and the library’s receding) rather than a concrete forfeiture or moral trade. Tension is steady but rarely sharpens into a difficult sacrifice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Themes of silence’s power and the ethics of unspoken truths arise organically from the setting and the watch’s reverse logic. However, explicit thesis lines (“teaching that some words gain power only in the absence of their speaking”) undercut subtext in the final third. The ending’s “secret to keep” offers a resonant answer, though it leans declarative over image-driven complexity. Overall, strong coherence with minor moralizing drag.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a lucid, lyrical cadence that suits the dreamlike premise; the singular “they” remains stable. Rhythm modulates with pressure (urgency rises as the watch vibrates). Diction fits the mythic register without major register drift. No head-hopping or stance breaks, and elision is purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is polished, image-rich, and generally economical; recurring objects do double duty (watch as time, lens, cipher key). Occasional abstraction and thematic telling slightly dilute density in peak beats. Minimal redundancy; syntax varies well. The final lines are clean and musically resolved.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Libraries-as-liminal spaces are familiar, but the “unspoken words” archive, reverse-cycling watch, and propagation-delay cipher provide fresh inflections. Beats arise from the established logic rather than late conveniences. Imagery feels singular and cohesive. The risk profile is moderate—artful and specific rather than boldly subversive.</comment>
