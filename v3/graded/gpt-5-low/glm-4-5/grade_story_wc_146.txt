<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Silas’s motive is clean and consistent, and his methodical micro‑choices (placing feet, striking the fork) align with his craft. However, interior conflict is minimal; he encounters little psychological resistance beyond stamina. The “infinitely patient” trait is shown but not tested against a contrary impulse. The change at the end reads as earned endurance rather than a risked choice with visible personal cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive is clear: step-strike cycles progressively restore the town, culminating in the sustained final chord. Orientation is crisp from the outset (who/where/what/why) and the single-scene structure is coherent. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with town-wide response, though the cost is largely time and focus rather than a sharpened sacrifice. No unkept setups or causality leaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and integrated—archway, cobblestones, bell tower—filtering through a tuner’s sensory priorities. Environment and objects (fork, stones) are not postcard decor; they are the medium of action and charge the final image. Sensory economy and motif recurrence keep the atmosphere immersive without clutter. The rules of this slightly numinous world are learned via action, not exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes (revival vs. collapse) are legible and deepen through density and reach (window fusing, beam lifting, town-wide chord). Pressure accrues rather than reverses; there’s no hard turn that forecloses options, and antagonism is ambient. Agency is steady and effective, with minimal resistance beyond scale and time. The final strike is earned but comes without a palpable price spike.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Harmony, balance, and the ethics of patience emerge organically from the craft and closing chord. The “wild hush” evolves from emptiness to charged peace, offering a non‑literal answer to the town’s malaise. No sermonizing; resonance arises from repeated concrete acts. Slight tidiness and lack of counter-pressure temper the afterglow.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third‑person voice matches the meditative, craft‑driven action. Diction is precise and sensorially biased toward sound and vibration, consistent with the tuner’s perception. Rhythm modulates well across beats; no head‑hopping or stance drift. Minor heightened phrasing occasionally skirts purple but remains purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Line‑level texture is strong—tight images doing double duty (e.g., “a resonant bell without a clapper”). A few intensifiers and mirrored phrases edge toward flourish repetition, but momentum holds. Syntax and paragraphing vary appropriately; information density is high with little scaffold. No figurative muddle or mechanical slips at the close.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The premise—restoration via sonic calibration and footsteps—is fresh and coherently exploited. Recurrent objects and actions (fork, arch, cadence) synthesize into a distinct vision. Risk is aesthetic (quiet, accumulative) rather than structural, and it pays off in a memorable final image. Slight safety in conflict keeps it from the topmost band.</comment>
