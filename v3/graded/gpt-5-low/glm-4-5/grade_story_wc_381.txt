<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and steady—he aims to hush the coded prophecy—and his actions align with that goal through concrete micro‑choices (mapping silence, positioning the wing, final release). However, interior contradiction is minimal; he rarely wavers or faces a destabilizing impulse, which flattens pressure. Embodied emotion is present (trembling hands, breath aligned with water) but remains uniformly serene-competent. The earned change is credible yet costs him little beyond effort and focus.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the piece coheres: density and patterned imagery build toward the wing absorbing the prophecy and the crane’s release. Orientation (who/where/when) is established early and holds. Closure lands on the page (prophecy contained and dispersed), but the felt cost is light and the outcome never seems in doubt. The single-scene structure stays clean with one decisive cadence shift near the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The nocturnal haven and brook are vivid and purposeful; the water’s current literally carries the reconfigured prophecy away. Details are filtered through the summoner’s ritual focus, maintaining tonal unity and specificity (stars reflecting in the brook, smooth stones). The environment shapes action and final image rather than serving as postcard backdrop. World logic remains consistent with no gratuitous exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stakes (hush the prophecy before dawn) are clear, and pressure accumulates through ritual intensification (wing glowing, coded words visible). Yet escalation stays largely internal and assured, with minimal narrowing of options or jeopardy. The “before dawn” clock appears but never bites, and there’s no reversal that tests commitment. Resolution feels earned but low-cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Themes of containment versus contagion, and peace as active transformation, emerge through action (mapping silence, transmuting code). The final image of the crane drifting into dissolution offers a resonant, non‑literal answer without moralizing. Some phrasing edges toward overt symbolism (“terrestrially cosmic accomplishment”), but subtext mostly rides image and ritual logic. The recurrence of silence and water accrues meaning credibly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The lyric third‑person voice is consistent, with controlled focalization and no head‑hopping. Rhythmic cadence supports the meditative mode, modulating slightly at the climax. Some diction repetition (“whispered secrets,” “terrestrially cosmic”) dulls the edge and risks sameness. Still, the perceptual signature (mapping silence, attention to breath/water) feels specific.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Vivid lines abound, but repetition and synonym loops (“quiet brook,” “whispered secrets,” “terrestrially cosmic”) create mild drag. Figurative density is mostly coherent, though stacked modifiers occasionally verge on purple and flatten momentum. Syntax and paragraphing remain clear, with clean sequencing through the ritual’s stages. Tighter pruning would heighten propulsion at peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Origami as a vessel for prophecy and the method of “mapping silence” feel fresh and integrated. The release via brook reframes containment as dissolution with a pleasing inevitability. While the arc’s success is predictable, the synthesis of tactile ritual and conceptual hush is memorable. Risks are aesthetic rather than structural, and they mostly pay off.</comment>
