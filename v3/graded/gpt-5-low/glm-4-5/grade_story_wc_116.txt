<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and consistent—an observer compelled to chronicle—and the temptation of the regenerative silence gives a credible internal counterforce. The key micro‑choices (deploying the swan, entering, resisting stasis, returning) align with that motive. However, the embodied emotional cost is more stated than felt; the “anchor” line is strong but the struggle isn’t dramatized beyond it. Depth of contradiction is present but remains understated.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the anomaly’s stillness prompts a tactical choice (origami portal) leading to a preserved bubble and a return that reweights meaning. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: the keeper refuses absorption and inscribes a symbol, carrying the cost as a secret. Orientation is clean and the sequence holds causally. The cost is quiet rather than sharp, but legible on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful: the obsidian refuge, river, and catacomb library are sensorially rich and filtered through the keeper’s priorities. Environment and objects constrain/charge choices—the silence bubble changes what is possible and the refuge’s roar frames the final contrast. Rules are learned through action (the swan, the bubble’s effect). Selectivity and tone are well calibrated to the piece’s aims.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—observer ethos versus the lure of stasis—is clear and tightens when the regenerative silence actively preserves and heals. The escalation is a single, meaningful deepening rather than multiple turns, appropriate to length. The refusal to remain functions as the decisive pressure point, though the on‑page price is more conceptual than visceral. Tension is sustained through image and cadence rather than overt antagonism.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Entropy versus preservation and the ethics of witnessing emerge organically through particulars (river, catacombs, origami, silence). The ending reweights prior images without moralizing, landing a resonant answer: choose change and record over sedative stasis. Subtext—temptation and duty—operates in image and implication. The insight is earned, if subdued.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The lyrical third‑person voice is consistent with a precise perceptual signature (water, stone, dust, folds). Diction is elevated but coherent for the mythic register; modulation at the anomaly is controlled. No dialogue to test, and the psychic distance remains steady. Occasional density skirts purple but maintains clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is lush and mostly efficient, with strong cadence and layered imagery; the origami/silence passages carry multiple jobs. There is minor redundancy and a visible duplication artifact early that slightly dents momentum. Metaphor stack stays coherent, though intensity is consistently high. Mechanics are clean and the final image is sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The origami‑fold method, regenerative silence, and the chronicle‑keeper ethos synthesize into a fresh, memorable lens on archive versus decay. Risks are taken without obscuring clarity; the object‑as‑tool is elegant and specific. Some elements (ancient library, river refuge) are familiar, but the execution and final reconfiguration feel distinct. The ingenuity is conceptual rather than plot‑twisty, which suits the piece.</comment>
