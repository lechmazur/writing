<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elena’s motive (assuring the living, honoring her grandmother) is clear and her agency drives the save. Interiority is present but not deeply conflicted; she pivots quickly from curiosity to certainty with minimal contradictory impulses. Her professionalism and tenderness with the child feel specific. The resolution shows an earned shift (from closure‑giver to protector) but the personal cost remains light.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: pulse → garden → child → predator link → security → calm device → photo repriced. Closure lands as a hybrid Decisive Change/Conceptual Repricing: the child is saved and the photograph’s meaning is reframed. The price is mostly conceptual/emotional (the grandmother’s failed warning finally answered), not materially taxing. Orientation is solid early; single scene coherence holds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The mist‑clad atrium and twilight ambiance are vivid and sustained through action, not just postcard description. The hearing aid functions as a charged micro‑setting/object that shapes choices and the final image. Spatial choreography (atrium → archways → garden → bench) tracks cleanly. The environment sets tone more than constrains tactics, keeping it just shy of top tier.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (protect the child) emerges and tightens via the hearing aid’s escalating pulse and the predator’s approach. Elena’s call to security is a clear, agency‑driven turn. Costs and tradeoffs are modest; danger remains mostly implied. Tension operates effectively at beat and story scales without requiring multiple reversals.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Themes of intergenerational warning, closure, and the dead aiding the living are integrated through object recurrence (photo, hearing aid). The final reframing of the photograph delivers resonance without overexplaining. Occasional on‑the‑nose lines (“The dead call for reasons”) flatten subtext slightly. Overall, the piece invites reflection more than it dictates a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV is steady, diction controlled, and the perceptual bias (attunement to emotional residue) reads consistent. Dialogue is sparse but functional, with the child’s voice credibly simple. Some repeated phrasings and declarative sentences reduce rhythmic distinctiveness. No head‑hopping or stance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is clean and economical, with strong image economy (mist, blue light, flicker like a heartbeat). Minor repetition (“persistently curious,” “reeling hush”) and a few summarizing sentences dampen propulsion slightly. Syntax varies enough to keep flow. No figurative muddle or artifact loops undermine the climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The hearing‑aid‑as‑soul‑tracer is a fresh inflection; the predator plot is more familiar but well integrated. The final conceptual repricing of the photograph adds ingenuity. Risks are measured rather than bold; the piece favors clarity over surprise. The synthesis feels coherent and memorable without reaching singular originality.</comment>
