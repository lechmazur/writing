<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Arion’s motivation is clear and consistent, but interior conflict is minimal and the epiphany arrives largely from an external vision rather than contested choice. Competence dominates; we get little contradiction or cost under pressure. Embodied emotion appears (“brace,” dread/wonder), yet remains surface-level. The final shift reads earned but easy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation is clean and the causal chain holds: Hour of Inversion → water-road navigation → First Arch → echoes → realization. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing (understanding the arrow/seed) but the on-page cost is soft. The single-scene structure stays coherent with one tightening at the First Arch. No major teleports or rule breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The world is vividly realized: rivers as aerial roads, latticed shadows, crystalline arches, and inversion mechanics integrated into action. The environment constrains tactics (following water; threading arches) and charges the ending as gravity resets. Detail is selective and filtered through an orchard pilot’s priorities. Consistency of rules supports immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Stakes are signaled early (discover the source) and the hour-clock frames pressure, but opposition is light. The meaningful tightening comes at the First Arch, yet no hard trade-off or loss is demanded. The arrow’s reveal solves the mission without friction. Tension simmers more than compounds.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Resilience/adaptation is thematically coherent and binds planet mechanics, occupation, and object. However, the piece leans on declarative insight (“They whispered secrets…”) instead of letting subtext do the heaviest lift. The final resonance is hopeful but tidy. Complexity and moral charge remain mild.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The third-person focalization is steady and confident with a consistent lexicon. Rhythm varies and supports movement through inversion. Voice is competent but not uniquely idiosyncratic; only one brief spoken line. No head-hopping or stance slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Prose is clear and often pictorial (“silver serpents,” “rocks singing”), with good momentum. Occasional purple or repeated phrasing (“whirling silence,” generalized intensifiers) slightly blunts edge. Minimal scaffolding; sentences mostly do multiple jobs. Mechanics are clean and readable.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The inversion rivers as navigation lanes and the orchard pilot frame feel fresh, and the arrow-as-seed twist is a satisfying synthesis. The execution remains within a familiar discovery vignette, with limited complication or subversion. Still, the concept coalesces organically at the First Arch. Risk is moderate; coherence is strong.</comment>
