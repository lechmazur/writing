<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara’s motive (“preserve the shape of hope”) is clear and coherently drives her watchfulness, with embodied moments (stone in pocket, tightened grip) grounding the interiority. Agency is mostly attentional and archival rather than decisional, but it suits the accumulative design. The recognition of the shadow’s identity reconfigures her mission with a real emotional cost. Minor limitation: internal conflict is more stated than dramatized in moment-to-moment micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterned observation → anomaly documented → approach → recognition → transformation. Orientation is clean from the outset (who/where/role), and the closure lands on the page with cost (luminous regret and altered understanding). The river stone and moonbeam focus the final cadence into a resonant reconfiguration. Slight reliance on summary across nights trims causal tension but doesn’t harm closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The “blooming library above the clouds” is vivid and recurrent, with the crystal dome and moonbeam materially charging the ending image. Details are selectively filtered through Elara’s professional noticing (shadows’ behavior, shelves, blossoms). The river stone works as micro-setting/object that evolves function. Occasional phrase repetition edges toward decorative, but the environment remains integral.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understand the unbound shadow to safeguard hope—is signaled early and tightens when the anomaly approaches her station under the full moon. Escalation is a density shift rather than a reversal, appropriate to the chosen lens. The price—regret and the foreclosed possibility of reunion—reads clearly. Agency is more endurance/attention than choice, keeping the ceiling just below top-band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Themes of love’s persistence, grief, and the ethics of witnessing emerge through image (shadow to light, charged stone) rather than plot machination. The final repricing (not an anomaly but a reunion attempt) resonates. However, several explicit thematic lines (“not an anomaly to fear, but love’s persistence…”) nudge toward moralizing and reduce subtextual power. The piece still leaves a reflective aftertaste anchored in particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The lyric third-person close is consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature (professional attention to dusk and shadow). Rhythm is controlled and modulates at the climax without head-hopping. Occasional elevated diction fits the fable-like tone. Minor repetition is voice-aligned rather than accidental.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lines are generally clean, image-dense, and purposeful, with strong nouns and charged verbs (“metamorphosed,” “unbound”). Some paraphrase loops and repeated formulations (“blooming library above the clouds”) slightly slow momentum and flirt with purple. Figurative control mostly holds at the peak; clarity never collapses. A light trim would sharpen propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The fusion of post–Sharing Revolution dream culture, a cloud library, and a sentient unbound shadow feels fresh and cohesive. The final reveal (lost friend) is earned by prior patterning and reweights earlier images. Risks are aesthetic rather than structural and largely pay off. A touch of familiar elegiac sentiment keeps it just shy of startlingly original.</comment>
