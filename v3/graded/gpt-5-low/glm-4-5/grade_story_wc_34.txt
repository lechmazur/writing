<question>1</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is clear and specific (childhood silence → empathy), but most of her action is summarized rather than dramatized through pressured micro‑choices. Her “driftingly alert” perception enables her role; we rarely see contradictory impulses tested on the page. The relationship with the ghost functions but lacks on‑scene friction. The ending offers endurance and connection but little visible personal cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Structure reads as accumulative/textural: the pattern of storms, graffiti, and the plate coheres toward a quiet RR (charged poise) ending. Orientation is firm early (who/where/when are legible), and the motif web lands in the final image. Closure is a steady-state harmony rather than a decisive change, with conceptual cost (loneliness alleviated) more implied than felt. Causal steps are mostly told rather than turned in scene.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The misty courtyard above the clouds and the lightning‑thunder interval create a vivid, rule‑bound space. The graffiti walls and storms meaningfully frame access and method, not just backdrop. The flower press plate as a tool bridges analog/digital and charges images with specificity. While richly atmospheric, the environment rarely forces hard choices beyond timing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (achieving communication/connection) is clear, but pressure scarcely tightens; most beats are explanatory rather than escalatory. There’s no meaningful reversal or trade‑off—success arrives through discovered means without tested risk. The storm window hints at urgency but never bites. Resolution feels earned conceptually, not through on‑page cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Themes of translation, loneliness, and cross‑realm empathy emerge organically from particulars (graffiti as code, plate as conduit). The final harmonized “silent song” offers a resonant, non‑literal answer without sermonizing. Some beats state rather than subtext (e.g., childhood backstory laid out), slightly reducing complexity. Overall, the imagery carries the thematic weight well.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a lyrical, confident register; diction matches the mythic‑tech frame. Rhythm is controlled, with patterned phrasing that supports the wonder tone. No head‑hopping or stance slippage. Compression favors telling in places, but voice remains steady and precise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Clean, fluent sentences with good image economy; minimal scaffolding or loops. Occasional purple lean and abstract formulations, but clarity holds and momentum doesn’t stall. Information density is strong; many lines do dual work (world + theme). Final cadence is well‑tuned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—ghost in code speaking via graffiti, answered by a flower‑press plate in a storm‑suspended courtyard—is striking and memorable. The specific tool choice and storm‑window rule feel fresh rather than gimmicky. The arc is more tableau than engine, limiting peak ingenuity. Still, the conceptual weave shows authentic vision.</comment>
