<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation—decoding thresholds and finding “home”—is clear and sustained, with tangible micro-choices (reading grain, trusting intuition, touching the oak). Interiority is specific to her upbringing (maze architect’s child) and method. However, internal contradiction is minimal; the epiphany comes smoothly, with little on‑page friction. The reunion read as earned but emotionally tidy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is quick and coherent (Elara, prism terrace, post‑“butterfly effect”), and the patterning of thresholds, logbook, and wood grain densifies to a cadence shift. Closure lands via a charged crossing (RR/CR) when “Home” appears and she steps through to her father. The cost is mostly conceptual/emotional rather than dramatized, but it’s legible through the long liminal wandering it forecloses.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The drifting prism terrace, thresholds, and oak doorway are vivid and POV‑filtered, with the logbook and wood grain functioning as object‑as‑setting that charges the final image. World rules (thinned thresholds, prismatic light) stay consistent and inform tactics. The environment constrains choice by making sacred doorways rare and legible only via her method. Detail is selective and purposeful, not a tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding/recognizing a sacred threshold that leads to home) is present early and tightens as the hush deepens and the oak pattern matches the logbook. The decisive deepening occurs when she abandons logic for intuition and commits to the doorway. Price is implied (risk of the unknown; relinquishing the liminal search) but not strongly tested or opposed on the page. Tension is mostly inner and atmospheric rather than contested.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Recurring images (thresholds, grain, logbook, distances) evolve toward a meaning about transformation and return. However, the piece states its thesis explicitly (“they were portals of transformation,” “return to love”), reducing subtext and inviting sentiment. The final image still resonates because of particulars (corn rustle, prism tears), but moralizing trims ambiguity. The thematic arc is coherent but not subtle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a distinct lyric diction (“featherly determination,” “fractured hush”) and controlled modulation toward the climax. Dialogue is minimal but functional, carrying emotional weight without breaking voice. No head‑hopping or stance leakage; elision patterns are taught and kept legible. Occasional phrasing edges toward purple but remains coherent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong rhythmic control and image density propel the piece, with purposeful repetitions. Some overwriting and echoing (“featherly determination,” “necessary distances”) verge on redundancy, and a few abstract assertions flatten pressure near the end. Still, sentences generally carry multiple jobs and stay clear. Mechanics are clean and the final cadence lands.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of corn‑maze lineage, prism thresholds, and wood‑grain divination feels fresh and particular. The “butterfly effect” tag is familiar, and a few thematic lines lean generic, but core images and methods are distinctive. Turns grow from seeded specifics (grain pattern ↔ logbook symbol ↔ doorway). Authentic vision outweighs minor conventional notes.</comment>
