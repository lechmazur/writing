<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara’s drive to restore music is clear, embodied in tactile choices (kneeling, tracing cracks, strumming) and culminates in renewed resolve. Interiority is specific (tears, tremors, remembered instruction) rather than generic. However, there’s little contradictory impulse or on‑page struggle; competence remains largely untested. The final stance (beginning the work anew) feels earned but low-cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: sensation → memory‑music → resolve, ending in a Charged Poise image (insulator humming, tools raised). Orientation is clean early (who/where/when) and the throughline is coherent. Closure lands with a felt emotional cost and a credible next action, though the turn is gentle rather than decisive. No causality breaks or teleports.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The grove, the alder‑swallowed statue, and the porcelain insulator are precise, lived‑in, and filtered through her craft. The tool and environment shape tactics (strumming stress cracks of living wood) and charge the final image. Sensory selection (vibration through hands, faint rainbows) supports tone without overloading. World rules feel consistent and discovered through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recovering music) is signaled and deepens as Elara extracts emotions from the wood. Escalation arrives via density—sorrow to joy to a flood of feelings—rather than narrowing options. The cost is primarily emotional (tears, absorption of grief) and the tightening is modest. No reversal or external pressure tests her commitment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Themes of memory, loss, and art as empathy arise from particulars (stress‑crack “notation,” the First Singer legend, Master Kaelen’s gift) without sermonizing. “Empathy in motion” is dramatized rather than declared. The end reframes silence as a medium that can be translated, not an absence. Complexity is present but not sharply contested by counter‑pressure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The close third‑person voice is steady, lyrical, and craftsman‑specific, with controlled diction and rhythm. Perceptual signature (vibration, grain, resonance) feels consistent to Elara’s mind. No head‑hopping or stance slippage; elisions are purposeful. A few lush lines flirt with purple but do not disrupt legibility.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is polished, image‑rich, and largely propulsive; lines often do multiple jobs (world + action + mood). Occasional density and echo (“silence,” “music,” “resonance”) verge on redundancy but remain controlled. Syntax varies and cadence supports a quiet rise. Minor overwriting keeps it below top tier.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The tree‑song sculptor premise, using a porcelain insulator to read a living wood sculpture’s stress‑crack music, is fresh and integrated. The fusion of post‑Silence worldbuilding with luthier‑like tactics feels original and purposeful. Ending image recharges earlier motifs without gimmickry. Risk is tasteful rather than bold‑disruptive.</comment>
