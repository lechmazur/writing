<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The archivist’s motive—quietly mentoring resilience while living with exile—is clear and embodied in choices (backward pacing, demonstrating rather than confessing). His “combative tenderness” appears in the correction “Not enter exactly,” balancing authority with doubt. Prisha’s micro‑arc (from trembling to steady under the door’s creak) credibly reflects his influence. Emotional cost is present but muted; interior contradiction could press harder under stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: motifs (shadow, shards, tea geometry) accrue toward a charged poise where Prisha stands firm and the archivist accepts purpose without return. Orientation is clean and the single‑scene flow coherent. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost—remaining exiled yet fulfilled through teaching. Escalation is gentle, but the cadence shift around the shadow’s activation and the door’s test provide enough tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The forgotten library is specific and lived‑in (Case of Slumbering Histories, Wall of Whispering Shadows), with light, aisles, and objects shaping attention. The “shadow caught in glass” meaningfully charges the environment and final image. Tools (shard, porcelain dish, tea) integrate with space and method rather than postcard description. While the setting rarely constrains movement, it consistently charges choices and tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—proving/teaching resilience—tightens when the shadow activates the leaves and when the door creaks, testing Prisha’s steadiness. Agency is shown through endurance and attention rather than decisive external acts; her refusal to flinch functions as earned stasis. Costs are conceptual (accepting exile; risking error) rather than visceral, keeping pressure low. One clear deepening arrives via the “reversible exile” technique, but the conflict never truly bites.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Resilience, exile/return, and the persistence of shadow interlock through image and action; the archivist’s line “exile and return are the same movement” reframes the craft and mentorship. The shadow motif reweights meaning at the end as both endurance and cost. Occasional explicitness (“Like resilience, it endures…”) reduces subtlety but the closing promise (“how exile preserves what it removes”) resonates. The piece invites reflection without sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third‑person focalization stays tight to the archivist’s perceptual biases (peripheral vision, backward pacing) with clean, purposeful diction. Dialogue rings natural and carries subtext (authority vs uncertainty) while advancing the scene. Rhythm modulates well between lyric observation and instructive precision. Minor lyric flourishes never break plausibility or stance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is controlled and evocative; images do double duty (swing hush as time pressure; shadow as theme engine). Sentences vary in length and function, avoiding scaffold and loops. Figurative density is present but coherent to the world’s logic. No mechanical errors or muddled metaphors intrude on the closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The shard‑mirror archivist, reversible exile, and tea‑geometry annotation feel fresh and organically fused. The shadow detaching to interact with the leaves is an inventive, memorable turn. The risk is stylistic rather than structural, but it pays off in a distinctive, coherent aesthetic. Stakes remain intimate, keeping the piece shy of the most arresting originality tier.</comment>
