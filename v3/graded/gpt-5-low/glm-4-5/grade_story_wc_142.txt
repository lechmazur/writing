<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maya’s motives (bridge tradition and survival) are clear and drive concrete actions (decoding, mapping, instructing, planting coded counterproposals). The internal contradiction (dual allegiance) is present and resolves credibly in the end with the returned stone and anonymity. Some beats compress struggle into summary (“For three nights, Maya barely slept”) rather than dramatizing stress under pressure. Emotional embodiment is solid but could show more moment-to-moment cost during the council pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal hybrid leaning causal—discovering the code therefore reorganizing tactics therefore swaying terms; closure lands with the posted notice and Maya’s symbolic renunciation. Orientation is immediate (Neptunia, carnival, corporate emissaries), and the throughline holds. Several key developments occur offstage or in summary, slightly diluting on-page pressure, but the Decisive Change plus resonant final act is legible. Cost is present (sleeplessness, risk, anonymity, relinquishing the stone), if modestly rendered.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Neptunia’s sensory world is vivid (salt, funnel cakes, neon fish constellations) and POV-filtered through a pattern-seeking eye. The raft-carnival setting constrains and enables tactics (flash mobs on floats, graffiti across rafts) and charges the final lantern-on-water image. World rules stay consistent with the translator earpiece and raft city history. Strong, purposeful detail with environment shaping choice earns high marks.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve culture amid privatization—is clear and coheres. Escalation tightens from discovery to organized responses to the posted terms, with one meaningful deepening (recognizing murals as encoded survival knowledge). Resolution flows from Maya’s agency; however, conflict remains largely procedural and offstage, with limited felt jeopardy in-scene. Still, the narrowing of options and timely tactics read earned under the chosen lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of communal resilience through hidden systems of meaning arises organically from graffiti-as-archive and the bridging of generations. The stone’s return and earpiece removal reweight belonging without overt moralizing. A few lines edge toward thesis statements (“The water remembers what land forgets”), but they’re embedded in scene and motif. The final spiral-in-circle image delivers a resonant non-literal answer: continuity via adaptive art.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a clean, slightly lyrical cadence; diction suits a pattern-oriented mind without academic drift. Brief dialogue lines carry subtext and world texture. Voice holds under summary passages, though those compressions blunt immediacy a touch. No head-hopping or stance slips; the final cadence is controlled.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is generally crisp, image-rich, and purposeful; sensory choices are apt and multi-sensory. Minor issues: a typo (“blossomig”), occasional abstract phrasing, and some summary that flattens momentum. Sentence rhythm varies well and final images land cleanly. No figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Graffiti as intergenerational cipher to counter privatization on a raft carnival is fresh and coherently exploited. The “culture shock absorber” device and the foundation chip provide distinctive texture and ceremonial closure. The outcome isn’t a twist, but the synthesis feels earned and specific. Strong originality without gimmickry.</comment>
