<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The vendor’s motive (to find where stories begin) is clear and specific, and their micro‑choices (selecting shards, performing the opening ritual) align with parole constraints. Interiority is textured and character‑particular, with a credible contradiction between creative impulse and fear of harming completed tales. However, pressure on the self is relatively gentle, so the change lands more as a contemplative repricing than a hard, costly turn. The felt cost of the parole is present but not truly tested in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: the scene builds through ritual preparation to a conceptual repricing—stories begin in the unsaid—paired with the door’s creation and the first customer’s arrival. Orientation is clean from the outset, and the world rules are internally consistent. The closure is legible and on‑page, but the cost is conceptual rather than acute, softening its impact. Still, the parole constraint shapes tactics and the final beat reads earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The glass orchard library, bottles, birds, and cloud‑sea are vivid, selective, and filtered through the vendor’s priorities. Setting is not mere postcard: the cloud‑bound sanctuary admits only those who’ve lost something, and the library trembles at attempted entry. Bottled moonlight and memory shards function as lived tools that charge the final image. Slightly less direct constraint in spatial choreography keeps it from 9+.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: open the shop under parole while seeking the origin of stories. Escalation is a single decisive tightening—the gathering of regret, longing, and hope to incise the symbol and form the door. The pressure remains coherent but low‑temperature; the price (no harming completed stories; limited parole) is noted more than felt. The customer’s arrival resolves without a hard trade‑off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Themes of absence, beginnings in silence, and ethical creation are integrated through bottled moonlight, shards, and parole. The final insight coheres with prior images, but it is stated directly (“stories began not in some mythical place…”) which blunts subtext. The door as a reconfigured threshold offers resonance beyond the summary statement. Overall strong, if slightly told.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third‑person maintains stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature anchored in objects and ritual. Diction and rhythm fit the surreal milieu without register drift or head‑hopping. Modulation toward the closing cadence is confident. Lack of dialogue is appropriate to the solitary lull.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is rich and generally precise, with purposeful images doing multiple jobs. Figurative density is high but mostly coherent; occasional purple edging is contained. A truncation artifact in the last word (“Sh”) jars the landing and signals copy issues. Momentum holds despite a few near‑redundant descriptive beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Bottled moonlight harvested by quantifying absence, a glass orchard library, and parole‑bound creation feel fresh and synthesized rather than decorative. The ritual action to open a door from shards is a specific, memorable turn. Emotional truth is quieter, but the conceptual risk pays off. Minor conventional phrasing around the final realization tempers the wow factor.</comment>
