<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Clear, consistent motive (“to share light without using fire”) and a steady internal stance, but few embodied micro-choices or contradictory impulses under pressure. The being largely executes a plan without visible struggle or cost beyond reflective yearning. Emotional texture leans abstract, with limited sensory embodiment of feeling. The brief hesitation implied by the gear slowing is promising but underdeveloped as a genuine crucible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: prepare → transit → deliver → return, with a quiet RR/CR landing as the being carries hope that patterns might break. Orientation is clean early (nebula garden, gear, sonar) and closure is on-page. Cost is conceptual—eternity with yearning—rather than dramatized sacrifice. The arc lacks a tough turn or narrowing that would heighten consequence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vivid, selective atmosphere: “nebula garden,” “falling petals,” “liquid light,” and the gear as a charged object recur effectively. World rules feel consistent and are taught via action (sonar mapping, transit tunnel patterns). Setting mostly frames rather than constrains choices, limiting top-band eligibility. Still, the environment meaningfully colors the final image upon return.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (deliver light without fire) is signaled and pursued, but pressure seldom tightens; success arrives without credible resistance. The sonar’s intensification and “gear slowing” hint at a pinch but never force a trade-off. No on-page reversal or credible price beyond reflective melancholy. The piece reads as assured completion rather than tested commitment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motifs (gear approximating infinity, generational spirals, petals) cohere around non-destructive illumination and cultural cycles. The ending reweights the premise via hope of breaking patterns—resonant if gentle. Some thematic statements are told rather than earned (“Some had flourished… others had recoiled”), softening subtext. Nonetheless, the conceptual spine is consistent and evocative.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Consistent lyrical third-person with a distinct perceptual texture; diction suits the otherworldly POV. Rhythm modulates moderately with transit and delivery. No head-hopping or register drift, though repeated phrases verge on incantatory sameness. The voice remains controlled and legible throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Clean sentences with coherent flow and few mechanical issues; information density is decent. Refrains (“approximating infinity,” “across the quiet sigh of falling petals”) work but flirt with redundancy. Occasional purple lean does not blur sense, yet momentum dips with repeated abstractions. More concrete, consequential beats would sharpen propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The fusion of cosmic sentimentality, a mechanical relic, and non-destructive enlightenment feels fresh and unified. Risks are aesthetic rather than structural; they mostly pay off in tone and image. The lack of a hard price or surprising turn tempers ingenuity’s impact. Still, the cosmology’s specific textures (sonar, fractal transit, gear-recorded outcomes) distinguish it.</comment>
