<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent (to “salvage something pure”), and her choice to reveal truth gently rather than accuse shows a credible value hierarchy. However, interiority is mostly summarized rather than embodied under pressure, with few on‑page micro‑choices. The trait “weaves truth carefully” manifests in her tactic (dream visitations), which is strong. Still, the emotional cost on her is lightly sketched rather than lived in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens fits: the piece builds through patterned dream fragments toward a reweighted ending where the captain is released and the truth is public. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—stasis earned by exposure without accusation and the captain’s peace—though cost is primarily conceptual/emotional rather than dramatized. Orientation is clean and the two-shard structure (dive → shrine/dream-work) holds. Much of the plot unfolds in summary, which softens the felt price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful: frigid wreck, candle-lit glacier shrine, and the “melted snow globe” function as charged, recurring anchors. The shrine materially enables the method (dream conduit) and the snow globe decisively charges the final image (now glowing, windows open). Sensory selection supports tone without turning into a tourist catalog. A few symbolic notes (“altar of frozen tears”) flirt with overtness but remain effective.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth/justice vs. harm to living) is clear, but escalation is largely reported; the pressure seldom tightens on the page. The meaningful turn is Elara’s tactic to seed dreams in descendants, which leads to exposure by consensus; the cost is gentle and distributed. Lack of in-scene resistance or risk keeps tension moderate. The ending’s resolution feels earned but low-friction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Themes of truth, repair, and intergenerational reckoning emerge coherently through the conduit motif and the captain’s release. The snow globe’s reweighted meaning works as thematic engine. However, several lines state the thesis (“the most powerful truths...”), shading into moralizing and reducing subtext. The resonance remains, but some subtlety is traded for articulation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The voice is steady, lyrical, and sure of its register, with recurring diction (“borrowed starlight,” “windows of connection”) forming a controlled pattern. POV remains single and consistent; no head-hopping or unjustified certainty leakage. Compression is purposeful and legible. Minor repetition reads as motif rather than scaffold.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lines are generally clean and propulsive for a lyric summary mode, with strong noun-verb choices and a firm image spine. Some phrases verge on purple or abstract (“altar of frozen tears,” “quiet dignity”), and a bit of paraphrase looping appears across adjacent sentences. Still, information density is decent and the final image lands crisply. No significant grammar or cadence artifacts impede clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—wreck-diving plus dream-mediated justice via a melted snow globe in a glacier shrine—feels fresh and cohesive. The two-way “windows of connection” concept gives a non-obvious path to exposure. While sabotage-for-insurance is familiar, the method and tone reframe it with originality. The piece takes tasteful risks in form (accumulative summary) without losing clarity.</comment>
