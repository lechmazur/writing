<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear, embodied interiority (nerve tingles, warmth in stone) grounds a credible shift from resignation to agency. The push-pull between sanctuary safety and risking the world’s discord reads as a live internal conflict. Small, tactile micro-choices (examining discoloration, pulling the bolt, tracing melody) reveal values under pressure. A faint overstatement of insight trims edge (“safety wasn’t the absence of danger”).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: discoloration → bolt → etchings → realization of the fortress’s price → choice to sing. Closure lands on-page as a decisive act, with a conceptual cost (endangering protection) legible in the reconfigured stakes. The accumulative-textural hum-light-snow motif tightens coherently to the final image. The cost remains more implied than tested in consequence, keeping it just short of exceptional.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid and purposeful; the cobalt fortress, snow, and spiral staircase are not postcard décor but functional conduits to discovery and transformation. The bolt and the walls literally respond, charging the final image. Sensory detail balances visual, tactile, and auditory in character-specific ways. World rules are learned via action (humming walls, etched names) without dump.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—keep sanctuary safety or return music—arrives early and coheres. Pressure escalates from a small anomaly to a moral choice, with the meaningful turn at the moment of singing. The felt price is present but largely conceptual; no concrete retaliation or breach manifests yet. Still, the narrowing of options and the endured risk are clear.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Silence vs. music and safety vs. isolation resonate through recurring images and culminate in a reweighted final image. Subtext—sacrifice, community bound in walls—mostly works through discovery and action. However, explicit theme statements (“safety wasn’t the absence of danger”) blunt subtlety in the climax. The piece invites reflection but leans a little declarative in the last third.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Consistent close POV with a distinct perceptual signature: tactile neurology, acoustics, and blue light filter experience. Rhythm modulates well from measured observation to incantatory lift at the end. Diction is controlled and apt; no head-hopping or stance slips. Minor elevated lines remain within voice plausibility.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lines are clean, image-dense, and largely dual-purpose; momentum is maintained through action-integrated description. Figurative language is vivid without sliding into muddle; repeated motifs (snow, cobalt, hum) accrue meaning. Minimal scaffolding; a few declarative theme sentences gently flatten the edge. Syntax variety supports the scene’s pressure and release.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The “silent-choir bellhop” and the fortress built from sacrificed music feel freshly synthesized. The piano bench bolt as portal to lineage is specific and memorable. The turn from sanctuary to restoration is earned and non-obvious. Slight reliance on familiar aphorism about safety tempers the peak novelty.</comment>
