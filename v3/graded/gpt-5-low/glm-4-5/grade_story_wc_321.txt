<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and specific (childhood split) and aligns with on‑page choices (radioing Althea, triggering the sequence). Interiority is steady but low in contradiction—his “resilient positivity” rarely meets a counter‑impulse, so pressure on character is light. Embodied details (patterns glowing, hourglass handled) help, yet the arc lands without visible struggle. The final “permanent transient” identity feels earned conceptually more than emotionally.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: ferry vanishes at dusk → spectral grotto → radio coordination → convergence sequence → merged vessel. Closure lands (Decisive Change/Resonant Reconfiguration) with the hourglass filling and the ferries becoming one. Cost is present but conceptual; success faces little on‑page resistance, muting consequence. Orientation is crisp from the first lines and maintained.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The spectral grotto, translucent hull, and “liquid starlight” are vivid and integrated with action (only there can convergence occur). World rules are taught through use, not exposition, and the hourglass/moons charge the final image. Sensory selection matches the mythic tone without swamping clarity. Setting shapes tactics (must reach the grotto at a specific cosmic condition).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Stakes are signaled early (merge timelines to heal fractures), but pressure scarcely tightens; the plan proceeds without meaningful opposition or trade‑off. The “Are you certain?” beat gestures at risk but doesn’t materially escalate options or cost. The decisive act (signal sequence) is agentive yet largely uncontested. Consequences are implied more than felt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Themes of wholeness, fate, and chosen liminality cohere through recurring images (hourglass, moons, vanishing ferry) and the final “permanent transient” stance. Some lines overstate (“live more authentic lives”), blunting subtext. Still, the ending reweights prior images with a resonant conceptual answer: identity as union through costed liminality. The motifs integrate rather than checklist.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV remains stably centered on Liam with a controlled, mildly elevated diction that suits the fable‑SF mode. Dialogue is sparse but functional and distinct enough (Althea’s uncertainty vs. Liam’s assurance). Rhythm varies and supports the build without head‑hopping or unjustified omniscience. A few lyrical reaches verge on purple but stay legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Line craft is mostly clean with good image economy; “interconnected patterns” and the hourglass recur purposefully. Occasional repetition and intensifiers (“resiliently positive”) and stacked abstractions (“destiny’s true intention”) add a touch of purple. Momentum holds across paragraphs with minimal scaffold. Final image is clear and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The ferry‑as‑psychopomp across timelines, the spectral grotto, and the hourglass synthesis feel fresh in combination and specific to this piece. The merge scene’s imagery is memorable, though the conflict path is safe. Conceptual integrity holds; rules are followed through consequence. Bolder risk in on‑page cost would elevate.</comment>
