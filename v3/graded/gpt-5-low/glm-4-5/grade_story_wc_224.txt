<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Clear, consistent motivation (“to understand the shape of home”) and a coherent inner lens, but limited contradiction or struggle under pressure. Maven accepts her powers quickly and rarely faces a live trade‑off. Interiority is evocative yet generalized at peak beats. The change is credible, though the felt cost is light.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive holds: stone → feather → nightly seeding → thunder → nexus reveal. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing (home as connection), but the on‑page cost is soft. Orientation is clear, and the pattern is taught and paid off. The causal braid is gentle but coherent for this mode.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The mountain‑bookstore is vividly rendered and functionally used; corridors reconfigure and the environment becomes the nexus. Recurring objects (stone, feather, mercury glass) charge the final image. Constraint is present via navigation, though material stakes tied to place remain low. World rules stay consistent through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible, with one meaningful deepening (hidden thunder intensifies toward the full‑moon reveal). Pressure, however, seldom forecloses options; opposition is minimal and cost largely implied. Escalation reads as density rather than narrowing. Resolution is earned but comfortable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Themes of belonging and perception emerge through images (mercury glass, feather, thunder) and culminate in a reweighted final vista. However, the explicit articulation (“home wasn’t a place at all”) flirts with moralizing and reduces subtext. Resonance remains, but complexity is smoothed. The afterimage is warm more than unsettling.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Consistent, lyrical third‑person with a distinct perceptual signature (scented paper, humming stone, textured feather). Rhythm modulates well, and focalization stays tight to Maven. Minor abstraction creeps in during epiphanic lines, but overall control holds. No head‑hopping or stance drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Fluid sentences with strong sensory economy and recurring motifs; diction suits the mythic tone. Occasional purple tilt and summary patches soften momentum. Minimal scaffolding and clean mechanics. The final cadence is clear and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The bookstore‑mountain and feather‑texture method feel fresh; the nexus-as-all-homes is an elegant frame. The “home within” insight is familiar, tempering the novelty. Integration across objects and setting is cohesive rather than gimmicky. Risks are taken in imagery and structure without losing clarity.</comment>
