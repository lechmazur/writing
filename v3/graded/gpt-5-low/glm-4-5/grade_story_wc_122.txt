<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Motivation is explicit and steady—she seeks to defeat numbness—and her actions align (picking up the broken needle, experimenting, teaching). Interiority is embodied through tactile perception (“vibrations flowed through her body”) rather than abstract labels. However, internal contradiction is minimal; success comes relatively smoothly with little on‑page resistance. The final renunciation of despair reads earned but low‑cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: discovery → experimentation → communal teaching coheres to a resonant reconfiguration at the end. Closure lands in the final image of her teaching with the backward record and “filament of hush” binding the group—a before/after is legible. Causality is clean (needle → reverse play → felt hush → instruments → students), though costs remain largely conceptual. Orientation is clear from the outset (who/where/when) and held consistently.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The drum maker’s cavern and stone floor function as more than backdrop; they enable and focus the vibration‑based experience. Tools and environment (turntable, records, stone) shape tactics and charge the final image. Seasonal/weather touches (autumn to winter, snow) reinforce tone without clutter. Specificity is economical and POV‑filtered through touch and vibration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—defeating numbness—is clear and advances via a meaningful deepening when the reverse spin yields the “filament of hush.” Pressure escalates modestly through broader stakes (teaching students) but faces little counter‑pressure or risk. The felt price is subtle: endurance of deafness and vulnerability in public demonstration. A tighter on‑page test or friction would heighten stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme—music as felt presence and the revaluation of silence—emerges organically through action and image. The recurring “filament of hush” shifts from private solace to communal language, reweighting the premise at the end. Some lines lapse into on‑the‑nose moralizing (“had found her voice again”), blunting subtext. Overall resonance lingers, if a touch tidy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV is steady and apt; diction centers tactility and restraint, matching Eleanor’s sensory world. The voice modulates with calm intensification as experiments succeed and audience arrives. Occasional declarative summaries (“Her motivation was simple yet desperate”) flatten the otherwise textured register. No dialogue, but narrative confidence holds without head‑hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose is clean and rhythmic, with effective tactile imagery. Some repetition and scaffolded statements recur (“The deaf music teacher had found her voice again”), edging toward telling. Figurative language is mostly coherent, though motifs are reiterated a bit too explicitly near the end. Momentum holds without syntactic monotony.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The reverse‑record “filament of hush” as tactile music is an original, memorable angle, and the cavern craft setting enriches it. The synthesis of broken technology, vibration, and pedagogy feels specific rather than templated. Risk is taken in a quiet, accumulative design that earns its final image. Slight safety lies in the tidy communal validation but does not undercut freshness.</comment>
