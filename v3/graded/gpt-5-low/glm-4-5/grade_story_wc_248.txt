<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maya’s guilt‑driven motivation is clear and specific, and her arsonist past credibly informs how she reads damage and restoration. Interiority is concrete (trembling fingers; the bridge between destruction and renewal) and choices track her values. The internal conflict is present but resolves a bit tidily once the hidden message is found. The price—self‑exile underground and sustained repair—reads, though the struggle is mostly summarized rather than dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Hybrid drive with an accumulative end: a causal trail (artworks → message → restoration) culminates in a resonant reconfiguration (choosing preservation over erasure). Orientation is solid and the closure lands on page with cost implied (“She never returned to the world above ground”). However, multiple time jumps and montage compress the middle, softening moment‑to‑moment pressure. Still, setup pays off coherently without teleports or rule breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The Archive of Aeridor and the woven‑memory tapestry are specific, tactile, and POV‑filtered; the setting supplies both constraints (decoding through art) and resources (sanctuary). The environment charges the final image (underground library, entrance tapestry) and shapes tactics throughout. Sensory detail leans visual but remains purposeful. World rules (art as memory) are consistent and dramatized, not dumped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—redemption via preserving stories—is legible early and tightens through the restoration task and the self‑recognition in the portrait. Escalation is more deepening than reversal; the decisive turn is choosing to rebuild and remain below. The emotional cost (renunciation of the world above; years of labor) is clear but mostly told, which mutes intensity. No coincidences resolve the arc; agency drives the outcome.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Destruction vs. preservation threads organically through objects and acts (arsonist restores art; tapestry as memory), and the ending offers a resonant non‑literal answer by action. Some heavy‑handed statements (“Fire destroys, but art preserves”; “Like all great stories…”) blunt subtext and edge toward moralizing. The “volcanic tenderness” motif evolves convincingly to a softened resolve. Overall theme is coherent and earned, if a shade explicit.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stable close third with a lyrical, confident cadence that fits Maya’s sensibility; diction stays consistent and avoids head‑hopping. Quoted lines are spare and purposeful. The perceptual signature favors tactile, art‑inflected noticing, supporting tone. Minor repetition is motif‑driven rather than a tic.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clean, rhythmic prose with strong nouns and purposeful images; most lines carry dual duty (world and psyche). Some summary stretches and repeated phrasing slightly reduce momentum, and a few abstractions could be sharpened in peak beats. No figurative muddle or copy errors. Final images land clearly without purple drag.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The synthesis—an arsonist decoding a vanished culture’s woven memories to restore a vandalized self‑portrait that reflects her future self—is fresh and character‑anchored. The archive and tapestry conceit feel distinctive, and the method (art as breadcrumb) coheres. The self‑portrait reveal edges toward a familiar trope but is thematically integrated. Risk is thoughtful, not gimmicky.</comment>
