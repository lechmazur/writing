<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s control‑driven identity and sincere, data‑bound obsession are clear, and her shift to release is credibly motivated by observed outcomes and loss. Interiority is concrete (compass, ruler, pinned leaf) and her final choice bears cost and aligns with her arc. Some beats lean toward summary over embodied contradiction, softening micro‑choices under pressure. Marco’s presence hints at relational pressure but remains light.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Hybrid leaning causal: storms → anomalous leaf → failed controls → decisive release; the chain reads cleanly. Closure lands on-page with cost (“destruction in some areas”) and a reweighted stance. Time jumps (“weeks passed”) compress but don’t undermine coherence at this length. Orientation is strong from the outset and the throughline holds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The mossy trellis after rain recurs and materially shapes discovery and the charged final posture. Storm weather isn’t decorative; it affects plant behavior and Elara’s choices. Detail is selective and filtered through her professional eye. Vivid without over-description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (method vs vitality) tightens to a decisive test: she removes protections before a storm. Cost is visible in partial destruction; benefit is not cleanly free, keeping stakes honest. Escalation is coherent, though mostly internal and observational until the late decisive act.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of control vs partnership emerges through particulars and the trellis/leaf motif; the final image reweights prior material. However, explicit statements (“She finally understood…”, and the advisory line to others) edge into moralizing, blunting subtext. Still, the earned cost preserves resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Consistent close third with measured, professional diction that matches Elara’s mindset. Dialogue is minimal but natural and functions as pressure. Rhythm is steady and modulates around turns; no POV leakage. A few summary lines flatten texture slightly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Crisp, uncluttered sentences with purposeful detail; momentum is maintained. Minor redundancy and summary scaffolding in the mid‑section prevent a higher score. Figurative language is restrained and coherent. Final lines land cleanly without purple drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Letting‑go narratives are familiar, but the linden anomaly and trellis‑born shoots offer a fresh inflection and grounded, plausible wonder. The “reconstruct by releasing control” turn is an elegant synthesis. Not a radical reimagining, but executed with integrity and specificity.</comment>
