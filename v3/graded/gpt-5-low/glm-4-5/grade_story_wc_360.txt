<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s motive is crisp and consistent, and her micro‑choices (inviting Thomas, activating the transfer, dismissing him) align with her research drive. However, her interior conflict is muted; she rationalizes ethics rather than wrestling with them on the page. Thomas’s panic provides contrast but remains secondary. The cost is conceptual and relational rather than felt by Elara in body or consequence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Single‑scene coherence holds: knock → induction → transfer → data → dismissal. Closure lands as a charged poise/CR: she accepts ethical cost and doubles down as another star vanishes. Orientation is strong early, and cause/effect is clean. The price is legible (Thomas’s distress, her chosen isolation), though not crushing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The topaz workshop and halo fragment are vivid and purposeful; the fragment materially enables the core action and charges the final image. The skylight and vanishing stars create a palpable atmosphere that mirrors her counting and control. Details are filtered through Elara’s precision and craft. Setting integrates with stakes rather than posing as backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around extracting data by disorienting Thomas, escalating from ambiguity to panic to transfer completion. The ethical stake is clear but largely one‑sided—Elara faces little resistance beyond Thomas’s brief panic. The meaningful tightening is the activation of empathy and his fracturing calm. Costs register but remain mostly externalized.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Themes of quantifying emotion vs. ethical trespass emerge through image (halo, stars) and action (borrowing personality). Some lines tip into didactic assertion (“feeling was merely information”), softening subtext. The final image reweights the premise but also states a thesis too plainly. Resonance lingers, if a touch over‑explained.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The voice is lucid and controlled with lyrical texture, and dialogue carries intention and subtext. Brief access to Thomas’s disorientation skirts POV leakage but can be read as filtered through Elara’s empathy. Rhythm modulates well across beats. No significant register clashes.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and mostly economical; images like the halo refracting geometry and topaz walls are strong. Occasional abstract or repetitive statements (“mathematics of emotion,” thesis‑like lines) slow momentum slightly. Syntax varies and maintains clarity under pressure. No major figurative muddle or scaffold loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Letterpress craft fused with a halo artifact and personality transfer feels fresh and organically integrated. The vanishing‑star clock and deliberate ambiguity tactic add ingenuity without gimmickry. Stakes arise from this unique synthesis rather than borrowed templates. The conceptual risk lands with a distinctive final cadence.</comment>
