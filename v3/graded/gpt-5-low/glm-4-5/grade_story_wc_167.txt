<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mara’s vocation and perceptual habits are specific and credible, and her micro‑choices (leaving the workshop, casting the stone, resolving to reframe her craft) align with her sensibility. However, internal contradiction is minimal and the epiphany risks tidiness (“value in the mundane,” “truly seeing”), muting felt cost. Emotions are mostly conveyed via lyrical abstraction rather than embodied tension. Strong character texture, light conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation is clean from the outset and the accumulative/textural lens holds: dawn routine → prism draw → pond‑reading → resolve. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing/Charged Poise (she reframes purpose and returns to work), but the on‑page cost is soft. The scene’s progression is coherent and singular, with one meaningful cadence shift at the pond. Crisp, if low‑pressure, structural integrity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Pearl Bay at dawn, tools, mist, spiderwebs, and the pond are vivid and filtered through a glazier’s eye; light behavior is rendered with persuasive specificity. The environment meaningfully charges the final image (light, reflections, “prism atriums”), though it doesn’t strictly constrain a choice. Sensory economy favors sight but suits the theme. Strong atmosphere in service of meaning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake is internal clarity before the day’s “shift,” and the pressure coheres but remains gentle. The tightening occurs at the stone‑cast and pattern reading, yet no option is clearly foreclosed and price is largely conceptual. Without an antagonist or harder trade‑off, tension stays low. Earned, but subdued, escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Imagery (light, glass, ripples) carries theme, but the prose often states the thesis directly (“It had always been about seeing—truly seeing,” “value wasn’t found only in the extraordinary”), edging into sermonizing. The resonance is present yet over‑explained, curbing subtext. The ending answers the question but with a moralized gloss rather than a purely image‑led reweighting. Thoughtful, if didactic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV is steady, close third with a clear perceptual signature rooted in craft; diction and rhythm are controlled. Occasional abstraction (“noctilucent reckonings,” “illuminate value”) nudges toward elevated generality but stays coherent with the lyric mode. No head‑hopping or stance slips. Voice is polished but not riskily distinctive.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lines are largely clean with consistent rhythm and image focus; several sentences do double duty. Some paraphrase loops and thematic restatements create mild drag in the final third, and a few purple inflections blur precision. Momentum holds, but pruning repeated moralizing would sharpen impact. Solid craft with minor overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The harbor glazier POV and pond‑rings divination feel fresh; the craft‑specific lens on light is distinctive. The enlightenment‑through‑the‑mundane arc is familiar and handled gracefully but not radically reimagined. The final reweighting is apt rather than surprising. Originality lives in texture more than in turn.</comment>
