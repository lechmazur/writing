<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—grasping the “texture of time”—is clear and consistent, culminating in her choice to activate the fragment. Interiority is present but leans abstract; we get more declarative insight than embodied contradiction under pressure. The key choice at the end feels motivated, with a visible cost (loss of body/self). Earlier beats could show more micro‑choices rather than summaries of learning.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: discovery → first rupture → obsession → return → activation → merger. Closure lands on the page with cost as she begins to disintegrate, a resonant reconfiguration that reweights her pursuit. Causality is coherent and prop‑driven (halo fragment + geometry), though some mid‑story learning is summarized rather than dramatized. The final convergence moment reads earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The living bridge garden is vivid, tactile, and rule‑charged, consistently interacting with Elara (breathing bridges, shifting architecture). The environment constrains and responds to choices, culminating in the final merger image. Details are selective and purposeful, with the garden’s transformations tracking her state. Strong integration without postcard excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: understanding time versus dissolution of self. Pressure escalates credibly from curiosity to compulsion to bodily risk; the return of the fragment and the activation are meaningful tightenings. The cost is unmistakable at the end. A mid‑scene concrete obstacle could have intensified stakes even more.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Resonance emerges through images (fading photographs, breathing bridges) and the final merger reweights her quest. However, explicit theme statements (“time wasn't linear but a complex tapestry”) reduce subtext. The aftereffect is conceptual more than gut‑level, though the closing image carries charge. Strong coherence, slightly blunted by on‑the‑nose lines.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Consistent close third with lyrical texture; diction fits the visionary premise. Rhythm modulates with pressure, especially in the ending pull into the garden. Minor repetition of key phrases slightly flattens peaks, but POV control remains clean. No head‑hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose is generally precise and evocative, with strong image work around the garden and fragment. Some abstraction and paraphrase loops (“quaking reverie,” reiterated thematic claims) dilute momentum. Information density is good, with limited scaffolding. Final lines are clean and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis—hyperbolic‑geometry living garden, retrocognitive trap, halo fragment—feels fresh and cohesive. The return of the fragment and the geometry‑driven activation show conceptual follow‑through. Emotional specificity lags slightly behind conceptual novelty, but the closing transformation is memorable. Bold without gimmickry.</comment>
