<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear, urgent motivation and a consistent internal logic drive his choices, and the on‑page cost (shortened future) lands. However, interior contradiction is minimal; he rarely wavers or reveals layered impulses under pressure. Embodied details (gloved fingers on the pendant, breath syncing with the pulse) help, but much of the feeling is declared rather than conflicted. A touch of heroic flatness keeps it below top tier.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strong causal chain: disturbance → time‑sculpting investigation → crystalline map → tower → cage → sacrifice/shatter → restored cadence. Orientation is immediate and steady; the giant’s nap functions as a ticking clock that tightens options. Closure is decisive and on‑page with cost (collapse, life shaved off). The causal lens holds cleanly through the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rooftop canals, crystalized water, and the humming chamber are vivid and purpose‑driven, not postcard. Environment shapes tactics (rooftop leaps, water‑map) and charges the final image (canals restored). World rules (temporal manipulation altering water) are shown through action. Rich specificity without bogging pace.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore rhythm before the giant wakes) is explicit and the pressure meaningfully tightens as the nap ends. The key escalation—borrowing deeply from his future to shatter the cage—narrows options with a visible price. The giant’s stir and the lurch provide a live turn that tests commitment. Resolution is earned by agency rather than coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm, time, and creation versus control cohere into a meaningful meditation on cost to restore order. The motif of echoes and cadence earns a resonant reweighting at the release. Some lines lean toward explicit summation (“all thanks to one natural history illustrator”) that slightly blunts subtext. Still, the final cost image sustains a reflective aftertaste.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a measured, slightly lyric diction that fits the character’s observational bent. No head‑hopping; stance and distance remain steady as pressure rises. Occasional elevated phrasing skirts generic lyricism but mostly keeps a distinct perceptual signature (sound‑first noticing, crafted temporality). Clean mechanics and modulation under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Generally clean, propulsive lines with efficient progression and a few striking images (water crystallizing into a map). Some purple notes and familiar phrases (“defied natural physics,” “songs never sung”) soften edge and originality at peak beats. Minimal redundancy and solid rhythm; clarity holds. Strong, if not razor‑honed.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis—rooftop canals, a pendant that sculpts time, a giant’s nap as a clock, and a chamber birthing echoes—feels fresh and coherent. The sacrifice mechanism (borrowing future time) integrates cleanly with both world and ending. The hero’s arc is conventional, but the worldbuilding turn offsets familiarity. High ingenuity without gimmickry.</comment>
