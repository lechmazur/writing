<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara’s goal is clear and consistent—summoning the “moment before deciding” and the apology—but her interior contradiction (hunger for explanation vs. readiness to forgive) is mostly implied rather than dramatized in decisions. The embodied details (forehead to glass, shard warming) help. The turn from “not enough” after “I’m sorry” to compassion at “I was afraid” reads earned but gentle. A touch of repeated abstraction (“fierce tenderness”) flattens specificity at peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure mounts via condensation messages (apology → images → confession). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with a felt cost in relinquishing the demand for a fuller explanation, culminating in “I forgive.” Orientation is solid early; causality is coherent. The cost is present but soft, keeping it just shy of top tier.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The mangrove labyrinth, moonlight, and singing spirits are vivid, integrated, and purpose‑driven; the environment shapes mood and process (songs crescendo, the window, moon’s effect on the shard). The shard as tool/object-as-setting charges the final image. Sensory balance prioritizes sight and sound effectively. It stops short of constraining a tactical choice, which keeps it under the 9-band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible and escalates through a meaningful deepening (from generic apology to the specific fear). Agency exists (placing the shard, focusing energy, choosing compassion), but external pressures are forgiving and coincidence-leaning; little is truly at risk beyond internal stance. The tightening is real yet subdued, with minimal visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Themes of unsent letters, fear, and forgiveness emerge through concrete images (condensation text, the wavering hand before knocking). Subtext lives in what’s withheld and translated by spirits, and the final repricing (“I forgive”) resonates. A few direct statements (“This was why she had come…”) and explicit phrasing nudge toward tidy moral clarity. Still, the emotional aftereffect is authentic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third‑person close with a steady, lyric sensibility; diction and rhythm are controlled and consistent. The perceptual signature—moonlit water, songlike atmosphere—feels owned by Elara’s sensibility. Minor repetition of favored phrases slightly narrows textural range. No head‑hopping or stance slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clean, evocative lines with good cadence; images do double duty for mood and meaning. Occasional paraphrase/abstraction loops and repeated terms (“fierce tenderness,” “singing spirits”) add a hint of sameness. Mostly shows via action and image; minimal scaffolding. The final image is clear and unblurred by figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—gargoyle shard, moon‑healing, mangrove labyrinth, spirits translating unsent letters via condensation—is fresh and coherent. The conceptual method of communication feels inventive rather than ornamental. The arc’s novelty is more textural than structural; the resolution follows familiar forgiveness beats. Still, the specific toolkit and imagery give it distinction.</comment>
