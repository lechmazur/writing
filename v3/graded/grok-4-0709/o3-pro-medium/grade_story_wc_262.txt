<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to retrieve unused love is clear and intensifies through her psychometry, compelling her to project the film as a high-stakes choice; interiority is concrete via embodied visions like the corridor of letters, revealing contradictory impulses in her tender trembling and sigh of release. Emotions are embodied in pulsing ink and sweeping motes, avoiding stock phrasing, though flaws like fear of love's future feel summarized rather than simultaneous in scene. The single-POV baseline holds with micro-choices under pressure, such as threading the film, showing value hierarchy with felt cost in the emotional exchange at closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through layered imagery and pattern breaks, like the corridor unfurling and letters dissolving, leading to a Conceptual Repricing closure where unused love circulates with undeniable conceptual cost in reweighted exile to freedom. Orientation anchors who (Mira), where (projection booth), and when (stormy night) by the first paragraph, avoiding penalties. Causality holds via textural density increase, with one meaningful cadence shift at projection narrowing options and changing knowledge; the ending reconfigures meaning on-page with felt cost in Mira's sigh and thunder's recession.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The vintage movie palace projection booth is vividly anchored with sensory details like cracked window, dusty balconies, and humming fan, filtered through Mira's POV to reflect urgency in hushed thunder and glimmering seats. Setting constrains choices, such as using the projector to release love, and charges the final image with the marquee at dawn mirroring emotional circulation. Details evolve causally, like booth lights dimming during projection, integrating into action without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of finding and circulating unused love is signaled early, with one meaningful deepening via psychometry leading to projection, reweighting the stake under Accumulative/Textural lens by shifting from paused to freed love. Pressure coheres through internal visions and thunder, crystallizing stance at the kiss and sigh, though cost feels more conceptual than visceral, with no strong reversal narrowing options beyond the cadence shift. Agency in endurance and release forecloses exile with felt emotional price in motes sweeping her ribs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of unused love's circulation emerges organically from images like paused frames and dissolving letters, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in love's hovering state, inviting reflection through Mira's complexity. Subtext in gestures like kissing celluloid and penning notes builds resonance, culminating in a non-literal final image of dawn-painted marquee reweighting the premise without stated moral. Emotional aftereffect arises from particulars, avoiding sentimentality in the thunder's satisfied recession.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in spatial imagination biasing details like unfurling corridors and glowing ink, modulating rhythm with emotional intensity in hushed hums. Prose texture is distinct in poetic syntax and rhythm, teaching patterned elision early for legibility at closure; no dialogue present, so policy skips those bullets. Purposeful compression in visions pays off without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere through vivid images like "breath held underwater" without loops or scaffold; rhythm varies naturally, accelerating in projection beats. Figurative language is controlled, avoiding muddle in peak moments like the kiss glistening like wet ink, though some metaphors stack densely without harming clarity. No artifacts obscure closure, with strong verbs and specific nouns propelling momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality shines in synthesizing psychometry with film projection to explore unused love as paused breath, transforming tropes through specific details like thunder's hush and incubating letters, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, committing to premise with fresh inflection in the tune hiding in the motor. Core premise offers non-obvious angle on exile and circulation, avoiding derivatives.</comment>
