<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Milo's motivation to heed the uncharted echoes is clear and rooted in his cheerful diligence, intensifying through discoveries that compel him to untangle the tapestry; interiority is concrete via embodied sensations like his heart scuttling like a beetle. However, internal conflict lacks strong contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, with emotions more described than contradictorily embodied in peak moments. The final renunciation of ignorance earns a credible endurance with felt cost in the velvet gloom's chafe. Rowan's secondary presence applies relevant pressure via the buried regret, altering Milo's stance without stereotype.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned elisions and cadence shifts, with orientation anchored early in the cemetery and maintained across shards; closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration via the resewn tapestry and harmonious echoes, reweighting the hush with conceptual cost in resolved memory. One meaningful deepening suffices, as the scrap's alignment and decoding accumulate to the yew's revelation. Minor ellipsis in time (hours or centuries) serves the lyric pattern without breaking causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The cemetery and cobalt silo are vividly anchored with purposeful sensory details like lunar milk and grainy scents, filtered through Milo's bias; the silo constrains choices by providing a hidden space for decoding, charging the final image of the yew. Tone tensions the velvet hush effectively, mirroring internal restlessness. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly, with environment evolving causally from dusk to dawn.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake in discovering the echoes' intentions signals early and deepens once via the tapestry's completion, narrowing options under textural pressure; agency in decoding and digging forecloses ignorance with felt cost in the chafe of unresolved memory. However, escalation feels static in loops of whispers without a sharper reversal, and coincidence in unearthing the box complicates without resolving. Moral calculus sharpens the choice to forgive via the relic.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of unresolved intentions emerging from grief develops through particulars like the frayed tapestry and buried regret, inviting reflection on listening beyond life's curtain without tidy morals; subtext in silences and images like faceless figures lifting spades resonates with ambiguity. The final image of harmonious whistles offers a non-literal answer, reweighting the premise with emotional honesty. Epiphanies earn through struggle, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and apt, with perceptual signature in Milo's biased noticing of whispers and velvet; prose texture distinct in rhythmic, patterned diction like "lunar milk" and "velveteen gloom," modulating with intensity. Purposeful compression teaches its lyric pattern early, paying off at closure without obscurity. No dialogue present, so policy skips evaluation; no head-hopping or register mismatch.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere through multi-job lines like the whispers pressing with purpose; rhythm varies naturally, but occasional template cadence in simile strings (e.g., "like blue velvet," "like a metronome") creates minor loops without payoff. Figurative language muddles slightly in peak beats with mixed metaphors, but clarity holds at closure. No major artifacts obscure cause/effect.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The premise of a gardener decoding graveyard echoes via a tapestry-map offers fresh synthesis of gothic and redemptive elements, transformed through specific details like the cobalt silo and sovereign case; risk in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Turns feel earned from patterns, with emotional complexity avoiding templates. Authenticity coheres in the singular vision of harmonious unrest.</comment>
