<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ursa's motivation to collect stories from walls is clear and intensifies through her discoveries, compelling her final realization; interiority is concrete and embodied, with contradictory impulses in her careful handling of fragile diaries versus her bold questioning of the silo. Emotions are shown through physical actions like hovering fingertips and racing heart, avoiding stock phrasing. The meaningful change—stitching collections to right the axis—is earned with felt conceptual cost in the ending. Flaws like occasional abstract self-awareness slightly dilute peak moments but don't undermine closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through layered revelations with pattern breaks like the diary phrase vibrating "like struck brass," leading to a Conceptual Repricing closure where Ursa understands the lever, reweighting stakes with undeniable conceptual cost in the tilting wind. Orientation anchors early with the silo and Ursa's arrival. Causality holds via motivated ellipses, such as the fireplace's embers breathing gratitude, charging the final image. Minor redundancy in echo descriptions doesn't distort the resonant reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting of the reclaimed silo library is vivid and purposeful, with corrugated metal and spiral ladders constraining Ursa's actions and charging the closure as she presses her forehead to the wall, feeling vibrations that reveal the story. Sensory details like bronze quiet and dust spiraling like script are filtered through her perceptive bias, mirroring internal states. The environment evolves causally, from hushed entry to echoing response, and a recurring object like the tapestry fragment charges the final image. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly, enhancing atmosphere without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of collecting stories to right the displaced axis signals early and deepens through a meaningful cadence shift in the silo's echoing response, narrowing options to stitching collections with visible conceptual cost in the tilting wind. Pressure coheres under Textural lens via accumulating discoveries, forcing stance crystallization in her realization. No multiple reversals needed; one intensification via the diary's abrupt end suffices, interweaving internal conflict. Stakes feel abstract at times, like celestial mechanics smelling of politics, slightly softening visceral impact but not resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of memory righting displaced axes emerges organically from images like the snapped rod in the tapestry and Clemency's whispers, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer where quiet places form cogs for alignment, reweighting the premise without moralizing. Subtext in silences and implications, like the fireplace's embers of gratitude, invites reflection on lost dreams. Emotional aftereffect is concrete through Ursa's kinship and smiling promise, embracing complexity without tidy binaries. The core concept integrates via specific events, avoiding abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable and apt, with distinct perceptual signature in Ursa's sensitive noticing of murmurs and vibrations; prose texture in rhythmic, metaphorical syntax reflects her mind, like "holding silence the way lungs hold breath." No dialogue, so policy skips those bullets; purposeful compression in lyric mode teaches patterns early and pays off at closure. Narrative stance modulates with intensity, maintaining modesty without unwarranted certainty. Rhythmic control heightens pressure in the final survey of walls without obscurity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere through multi-job sentences like the wind circling "rusted ribs carefully"; rhythm varies naturally, accelerating in heart-racing moments. Figurative language is controlled, though dense metaphors in peak beats like "dust spiraled like script unrolling" risk muddle but pay off without clarity loss. No significant loops or artifacts; strong verbs and specific nouns propel momentum. Final line resolves by recharging motifs with the "faintest promise of returning dreams," but occasional overwriting in descriptions slightly dulls propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of post-dream world, listening walls, and medieval tapestry dragons feels inevitable, transforming tropes like forgotten archives into a fresh angle on cosmic correction through historian's stitching. Risk-taking in lyric, accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, as in the silo's non-verbal answer. Emotional specificity in Ursa's kinship avoids generics, with non-obvious moral calculus in tilting realms toward mercy. Core premise commits fully, anchored in specificity like tannin-scented ink.</comment>
