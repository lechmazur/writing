<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation as a solemn archivist is clear and intensifies through her tension with command's suggestion, compelling her personal descent; interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions in seizures and tears, showing contradictory impulses like duty versus haunting. The final endurance earns stasis by archiving the testimony, foreclosing involuntary hauntings with felt emotional cost. Strength lies in her micro-choices, such as arranging debris, revealing values under pressure. No secondary characters on-page limit relationship crucibles, but single-POV interiority holds strong without stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned seizures and imagery to a Conceptual Repricing closure where the lagoon becomes "storied," reweighting history with conceptual cost of suppressed truths; orientation anchors early with the zeppelin over the coast. Causality holds via motivated elisions in retrocognition, with one meaningful deepening at the lagoon encounter. The final image charges options without causality breaks, though some ellipsis feels slightly convenient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid, selective details like the obsidian lagoon reflecting no stars but memory charge the final image, constraining Mara's choices and mirroring her internal hauntings; the zeppelin library integrates into action, evolving causally from descent to return. Sensory hierarchy filters through Mara's urgency, with briny air and rippling water embodying crisis. Micro-setting of the lagoon as a tool for parley elevates specificity, directly shaping closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of uncovering suppressed truths tightens through retrocognitive pressure, deepening at the lagoon with the temporal bridge's tremble forcing stance crystallization; agency in arranging debris and offering the cipher drives escalation under Accumulative lens, with felt cost in tears and loosening hauntings. One meaningful intensification suffices, narrowing options without coincidence resolving. Moral calculus between truth and safety sharpens the peak, though stakes occasionally feel abstract before the encounter.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of documenting truth as revolt emerges organically from Mara's seizures and the figure's story, culminating in a resonant final image of the storied lagoon without stated moral; subtext in symbols like the dove armband invites reflection on suppressed histories. Emotional aftereffect builds through concrete particulars, avoiding sentimentality. The ending offers a non-literal answer to trusting the future, reweighting the premise with complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and biased through Mara's perceptual signature, with poetic compression taught early in shimmering ink and paid off at closure; voice modulates rhythmically under stress, like rippling syllables. Dialogue pursues goals with subtext, distinguishing the figure's idiom from Mara's formal tone. Patterned elision in seizures serves emotional beats without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose density advances atmosphere through vivid images like "moonlight lacquered the sand," with rhythmic variety and concision; however, some figurative overload in peak beats, such as "heart hammering between centuries," muddles clarity slightly without loops. Information propulsion holds, but occasional synonym churn like "shimmered with ink that refused chronology" trends toward overwriting. Final line resolves strongly by recharging motifs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of retrocognition, zeppelin library, and civil-rights archiving transforms tropes through specific details like the debris code and forbidden dove, feeling inevitable at the lagoon parley; risk in nonlinear seizures heightens stakes organically. Premise offers non-obvious angle on historical suppression without echoes. Emotional specificity anchors universality boldly.</comment>
