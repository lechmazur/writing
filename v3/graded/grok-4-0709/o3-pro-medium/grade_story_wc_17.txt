<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Liora's motivation to uncover wall dreams is clear and rooted in her guild traits, intensifying through discoveries like the negative and recorder, culminating in her vow to guard with felt cost of forsaking comfort. Interiority is concrete and embodied, with contradictory impulses shown in her temptation to sell versus enduring legacy's burden, revealed in the moment she sketches maps instead. Strength lies in micro-choices under pressure, like tapping the floor to follow hum, aligning actions with motives. No major flaws, but emotions occasionally lean poetic over contradictory embodiment in peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through layered discoveries with coherent pressure toward resonant reconfiguration in Liora's final vow and note 'The walls are awake', earning stasis by foreclosing easy life with visible cost. Orientation anchors early with Liora under bruised sky, charting hallways. Closure lands on-page as Charged Poise, reweighting legacy with undeniable conceptual cost in her inheritance hum. Strength in patterned elision of echoes guiding turns, like hum leading to hatch, without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting of ivy-veiled passage in drowned Verdillon is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like humming archway and fractal corridors constraining choices, such as ivy thinning to reveal hatch. Atmosphere of cracked, steaming world mirrors Liora's perceptual bias, with environment charging final image as quivering ivy and awake walls. Micro-setting like charred hearth and crawlspace etched with formulae directly enables discoveries, evolving causally. Recurring ivy and echoes charge closure without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving legacy's echoes signals early and deepens through accumulative pressure, like discovering negative and recorder, forcing stance crystallization in vow to guard with cost of comfort. Under Accumulative/Textural lens, cadence shift in anthem playback reweights stakes, narrowing options from selling to guardianship. One meaningful deepening suffices, with agency in renunciation foreclosing paths. Strength in ethical calculus at climax, but cost feels more conceptual than visceral in final beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of legacy's burden emerges organically from discoveries like protest anthem in walls, resisting tidy morals through ambiguity in walls' dreams and Liora's complex vow. Subtext in images like phantom projection and humming inheritance invites reflection on resilience amid ruin. Final image offers resonant, non-literal answer to what walls dream, reweighting premise without statement. Strength in emotional aftereffect from children's voices, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with distinct perceptual signature in acoustic focus, like ears as compass, and rhythmic prose modulating with intensity, such as dense silence pressing like velvet. No dialogue, so policy skips those bullets; voice texture in syntax and patterned diction teaches lyric compression early, paying off at closure. Purposeful elision in echo motifs is legible under lens. Strength in prose as character, with perceptual bias consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere through vivid images like bruised orange sky and gray snow dust, varying rhythm naturally without loops. Figurative language is controlled, like echoes murmuring histories, enhancing propulsion without muddle in peaks. Minor scaffold in occasional synonym pairs, like cracked and steaming, but no clarity loss at closure. Strength in final line's resonant image, with clean grammar and purposeful syntax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality shines in fresh premise of echo cartography post-climate shift, transforming exploration tropes through specific acoustic worldview and wall dreams concept, feeling inevitable in vow. Risk-taking in lyric, accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, synthesizing legacy with sonic motifs organically. Non-obvious synthesis in anthem awakening walls charges closure. Authenticity coheres as singular vision, avoiding derivatives.</comment>
