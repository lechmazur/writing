<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marisol's motivation as a gossip-column exorcist is clear and intensifies through her past role in the scandal, compelling her to deliver the apology with embodied regret; interiority is concrete, showing contradictory impulses like her reminder to advise through metaphors amid electric possession. The ghost's regret welds him to the shelves, driving flawed endurance with visible cost in his incomplete release. Strength lies in the final micro-choice to place the bottle on the stump, revealing her hierarchy of values with emotional layering.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural, with density building through lilac scent, sparks, and melody to a cadence shift in the final chord and bottle placement. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the lilac carries the apology upward, reweighting gossip as absolution with conceptual cost in Dulio's incomplete freedom. Orientation anchors early on the library steps before dawn; one meaningful deepening suffices, but the orchard transition feels slightly elliptical without stronger causal ellipsis.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid and purposeful, with dust and alto clefs in the archive mirroring stalled melodies, while the orchard's hush and sawdust like snow constrain the timeline and charge the final stump image. Sensory details are selective, filtered through Marisol's bias, evolving causally as music rides lilac through windows. The micro-setting of the piano and bottle constrains choices, heightening pressure without excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reconnecting the duet tightens once through the music delaying the axes, under Accumulative/Textural lens, with deepening via electric possession narrowing options. Cost is legible in Dulio's lingering incompleteness and the narrator's overdue nerve, driven by agency in playing the adagio. Coincidence of workers listening complicates without resolving; one meaningful shift suffices, but internal-external weave could deepen further.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of gossip as fragile absolution emerges organically through images like the cracked bell and lilac-ozone mingle, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in imperfect miracles. Subtext in silences and implications, like the missing chord laugh, invites reflection on regret's cost. The final stump image offers a resonant, non-literal repricing of apologies without stating a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in metaphorical noticing, like fog as gauze; voice modulates rhythmically under pressure, with purposeful compression in the possession beat. Dialogue with Dulio is natural, subtext-laden, advancing the apology via images. No head-hopping or unmotivated elision; diction fits the exorcist's idiom without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with rhythmic variety in metaphors like "throat clearing that never resolved" advancing atmosphere without loops; information density high, sentences multi-tasking in peak beats. Minor figurative muddle in "accidental sharps of lightning" but no clarity loss at closure; zero scaffolds or template cadence, passing read-aloud test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of gossip exorcism with Tesla coil and perfume transforms supernatural tropes through specific stakes in musical regret; non-obvious angle on absolution feels inevitable via the orchard hush. Risk in ethereal grit heightens stakes without gimmickry, committing to premise's implications in the fading lilac.</comment>
