<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Milo's motivation to resurrect hope through engineering is clear and intensifies through micro-choices like splicing conduit, rooted in his functionally creative traits; interiority is concrete and embodied, as in his stoic wonder amid popcorn smells, avoiding stock phrasing. Emotions are contradictory yet subtle, blending fascination with melancholy, shown in actions like pocketing the sextant. The final renunciation—leaving the note and sextant—earns stasis with felt cost of personal detachment, though lacks sharper internal conflict under pressure. Single-POV focus excels without needing relationships.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with pattern breaks in imagery (e.g., branching rivers to redirected flows) building to a Conceptual Repricing closure where hope's equation reweights the terminal's abandonment with conceptual cost of forgotten moons. Orientation anchors early in the shuttle platforms and post-carnival silence, no debt applied. Causality is motivated through elisions like following drips, leading to the atrium revival as a resonant reconfiguration. Minor slip in unmotivated warmth of the sextant slightly softens the final image's inevitability.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like dust, popcorn, and ion oil filtered through Milo's engineering bias, constraining choices like tracing greywater lines. Micro-setting of pipes and atrium planters charges the final image, as rotating them to catch sun reconfigures hope. Atmosphere evolves causally from silence to murmuring humidity, mirroring internal stoic wonder. No white-room issues; spatial choreography tracks cleanly, elevating to 9+ with environment shaping tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of resurrecting hope through flows signals early and deepens via one meaningful tightening when splicing conduit narrows options amid nightfall, under Accumulative/Textural lens. Pressure coheres through accumulating details like clogged pipes, forcing stance crystallization in the atrium revival with felt cost of labor-blackened knuckles. Agency in redirection forecloses stagnation, though coincidence of finding the sextant complicates without resolving. Escalation is protagonist-driven but lacks a sharper reversal for higher band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of hope as redirectable resource emerges organically from particulars like sugar-water flows and the sextant, inviting reflection on resurrection without tidy morals. Subtext in images like fractal shadows offers resonant ambiguity, reweighting the premise in the final equation without statement. Emotional aftereffect is honest stoic wonder, earned through struggle like unclogging pipes. Ending provides non-literal answer via stars finishing the work, though could deepen counter-readings for 9+.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable and apt, with perceptual signature in engineering-biased noticing like pipe elbows; no dialogue, so policy skips those bullets. Voice texture is distinct in rhythmic, metaphorical prose like "caramel sigh," modulating with intensity in night work. Purposeful compression in lyric mode teaches patterns early, paying off at closure with legible Charged Poise. Distinct signature and control under pressure hit 9+ test, with no elisions obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, sentences advancing atmosphere and character like "hope equaled flow multiplied by orientation"; rhythm varies naturally, passing read-aloud test. No major loops or artifacts; metaphors are coherent, like solar sail unfurling, without muddle in peak beats like atrium reconnection. Information propulsion is strong, though occasional elevated diction like "stoic wonder" borders register drift but fits voice. Zero scaffold in closure secures high band, with multi-job lines throughout.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of engineering and hope in a spaceport transforms tropes like abandoned places through specific details like hydroponic revival, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk in lyric, accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, committing to premise implications. Emotional specificity avoids generics, with non-obvious angle on post-carnival decay. Minor hedging in abstract equation slightly tempers boldness for 9+.</comment>
