<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyra's motivation is clear and intensifies through grief-rooted choices, with embodied emotions like the memory knotting her throat driving micro-decisions; interior conflict shows contradictory impulses in accepting torment's radiance while seeking completion, earning the final endurance with felt cost in ongoing tears.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, patterned motifs of shadows and cranes build density toward a Resonant Reconfiguration in the ending, with conceptual cost legible in the compromise of winged sorrow that stays; orientation anchors early with Lyra lighting the globe, and one meaningful cadence shift suffices, though some elisions feel slightly untaught.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid, purposeful details like porcelain cups on leashed clouds and refracting panes constrain Lyra's journey and charge the final image of cranes fluttering through the garden, mirroring internal grief; sensory hierarchy reflects her biased perception under pressure, evolving causally without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of transforming grief tightens through the basilica confrontation, deepening via the dream projection and crane blooming, with agency in Lyra's folding and release foreclosing untamed sorrow at visible cost; under Accumulative lens, pattern break reweights stakes effectively, though coincidence in the acolyte's guidance slightly complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of grief's luminous torment emerges organically through recurring images like quivering shadows and origami cranes, offering a resonant non-literal answer in the final reconfiguration where sorrow gains wings that stay, embracing complexity without tidy morals; subtext in gestures like blowing across gems deepens ambiguity inviting reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable with distinct perceptual signature in selective noticing of light and torment; poetic voice modulates rhythm under pressure, teaching patterned elision early for legibility at closure; minimal dialogue carries subtext naturally, as in Jorin's smiled question.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose density is high with vivid, multi-job sentences like the wind tasting for sorrow advancing atmosphere and momentum; rhythmic variety supports beats without loops, though some stacked figuratives in the projection scene risk muddle but pay off in transformation; no artifacts obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fantasy elements like dream recordings and descending-ascending ladders transforms grief tropes through specific, inevitable choices, with risk-taking in lyric structure heightening stakes organically; the core premise feels singular, committing fully without hedging, as in the cranes' release recharging motifs.</comment>
