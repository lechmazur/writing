<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The dweller's motivation to become visible is rooted in consistent traits of kindness and method, intensifying through sensory memories to compel the high-stakes rescue; interiority is concrete and particular, with embodied emotions like pulse-fluttering fear contradicted by methodical actions. The relationship with the child acts as a crucible, forcing visibility that alters their state by the end with felt cost in tears and gratitude. A key moment is pressing the tape shard to listen, revealing internal conflict between isolation and connection without stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned sensory callbacks and object reprises, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration in the final image of holding magnetized night with conceptual cost of ongoing vigilance. Orientation anchors early in the crawl space and library, with deliberate hush serving closure. One meaningful deepening occurs via the child's discovery, tightening options without causality breaks, though ellipsis in the cache's history is motivated.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The shadowed library at dawn is vividly specific with sapphire hush and cobalt gloom, filtered through POV bias; micro-setting of ducts and pipes constrains choices, like using wire for visibility, charging the final image of aisles in hush. Sensory details evolve causally, mirroring internal memory states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of visibility to those in need tightens once through the child's rescue, deepening via induced charge that narrows isolation options with felt cost in her tears; under Accumulative/Textural lens, pattern break in humming Salcedo's interval forces stance crystallization without coincidence resolving. The peak turn of revealing silhouette is driven by agency, though cost could be more viscerally embodied.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of remembrance as circuitry emerges organically from sensory particulars and object reprises, like the tape fragment, inviting reflection on visibility without tidy morals; the final image of sealing exam notes offers a resonant, non-literal repricing of forgotten things, embracing ambiguity in the dweller's enduring hush.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in sensory metaphors like dust and cardamom, modulating rhythm under pressure; purposeful compression in lyric mode teaches patterns early, paying off at closure without head-hopping. Dialogue with the child carries subtext of reassurance, advancing the rescue naturally.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in hushed descriptions and propelled beats like crawling to the stairwell; figurative language like "blue pre-morning gloom bled" is controlled without muddle, though one paraphrase loop in memory summons slightly drags momentum. No artifacts touch closure, maintaining clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The premise of a crawl space dweller cataloging lost items through sense memory offers fresh synthesis, transforming invisibility tropes via specific objects like the tape fragment; risk-taking in lyric hush heightens stakes organically, feeling inevitable in the visibility turn without gimmickry.</comment>
