<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Marlin's motivation to prove whispers' power drives consistent, trait-specific choices like identifying walks, with embodied interiority in his prickling beard and gait memory; Liora's relationship as crucible forces tactical micro-choices under pressure, earning the final renunciation of mystery with felt cost; however, internal contradictions are more implied than simultaneous in scene, slightly limiting depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Under a Causal lens, because/therefore linkages advance from map discovery to key insertion and whisper diversion, anchoring orientation by the first paragraph; closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with Charged Poise in the final duet walk, reweighting silence's power with conceptual cost of mysteries resting; one meaningful tightening suffices, but cost feels more poetic than visceral at the storm's boom.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting anchors early with Pier Seven's container maze under auroral stormlight, vividly filtering sensory details through Marlin's POV bias; the geomagnetic storm constrains choices by frying comms and prickling skin, charging the final image of shaking containers; micro-setting of vents and ladders evolves causally, mirroring internal spontaneity without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of proving whispers' reach escalates causally when patrols approach, tightening via the ladder descent and vent murmur that narrows evasion options; agency in Marlin's whisper diversion crystallizes stance with visible cost of exposed position; one deepening suffices, but stakes remain somewhat abstract beyond the dare.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of silence as the loudest song emerges organically from whisper challenges and network discovery, resonating through subtext in gestures like mouthed words; final image offers non-literal repricing of noise in storms without moralizing; ambiguity lingers meaningfully in mysteries resting, avoiding tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person close POV stays stable with Marlin's perceptual signature in gait rhythms and salt air, modulating rhythm under pressure; dialogue carries subtext through whispers and indirection, distinguishing voices via tempo; purposeful compression in map folds teaches pattern, paying off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose density shines with multi-job sentences like the key chiming "like a question," varying rhythm purposefully without loops; figurative language is consistent and taught, accelerating momentum in peak beats like the ladder descent; no artifacts obscure closure, with strong verbs propelling the final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of whisper smuggling and auroral mazes transforms port tropes through specific zodiac mechanics and gait motifs; risk in calculated spontaneity heightens stakes organically, feeling inevitable at the vent murmur; avoids derivatives with fresh emotional truth in silence's victory.</comment>
