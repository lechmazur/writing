<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maris's motivation to defeat emotional numbness is clear and intensifies through embodied vibrations in her bones, leading to micro-choices like tuning drums that reveal her values with felt cost in tears; interiority is concrete and contradictory, avoiding stock phrasing, though the single-POV limits relationship crucibles.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through patterned elisions and resonant images like the filament threading the needle, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing where numbness retreats with undeniable emotional cost in tears and awakened heart; orientation anchors early in the cavern, but some ellipsis feels slightly unmotivated at the gramophone reveal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The cavern setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like cedar smell and stone vibrations constraining Maris's choices and charging the final image of leaves echoing within drums; micro-setting of the anvil and gramophone integrates action, mirroring internal hush without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of overcoming numbness escalates through textural density in vibrations and resonant drums, with one meaningful deepening when the backward song awakens hearts, forcing a stance crystallization with felt cost in retreating numbness; pressure coheres but lacks a sharper reversal under the lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of eloquent quiet defeating numbness emerges organically from images like the filament and backward notes, offering a resonant non-literal answer in the final thunder applauding restraint, with purposeful ambiguity in "magic" vs. "feeling" without moralizing; subtext in silence and vibrations enriches complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in bone-felt vibrations and hush, rhythmic prose modulating with pressure like quivering filament; no dialogue, so policy skips those bullets, but purposeful compression teaches patterns paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied rhythm in lines like "Her cane tapped, audibly muted to others, thunderous within her bones," advancing atmosphere without loops; some figurative stacking in peak beats like "trembling constellations" risks muddle but pays off in resonance, with clean mechanics and no artifacts touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of deafness, silence as music, and backward records feels inevitable, with risk-taking in lyric hush heightening stakes organically; transforms tropes like the quest for feeling through specific cavern vibrations, committing to premise without hedging.</comment>
