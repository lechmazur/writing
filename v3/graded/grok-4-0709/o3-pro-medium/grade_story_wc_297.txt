<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Strong interior contradiction in the hesitation before tracing the spiral, with embodied anxious elation; motivation rooted in scar-linked dreams intensifies to compel the high-stakes cut, earning the resolution with visible blood-sap cost at the climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with pattern breaks in root tightening and scar glowing leading to resonant reconfiguration; closure lands on-page with felt cost in pain and tremor, shaped by persistent scar-linking constraint, though orientation anchors slightly delayed by poetic density.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Vivid cobalt glade details like blue glow and petrichor integrate purposefully into action; setting constrains choices via root tightening and charges the final spiral path image, with sensory hierarchy reflecting Lysander's plant-dream bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of honoring the covenant tightens through the self-wounding choice under Accumulative lens; agency drives deepening with unmistakable cost in blood and ground tremor, though lacks a secondary pressure for fuller escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of human-root symbiosis emerges organically from scar-sap mingling and spiral redesign; final image offers resonant, non-literal repricing of the covenant without moralizing, embracing complexity in dream intersections.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Consistent close-third POV with distinct perceptual signature through plant-whisper filters; rhythmic control heightens pressure in the cutting beat without elision or head-hopping, maintaining voice-modulated intensity.</comment>
