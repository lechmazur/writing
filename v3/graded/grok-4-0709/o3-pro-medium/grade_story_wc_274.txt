<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Ila's motivation is clear and intensifies compellingly from conflict over the letter to her risky transmission, with embodied emotions like trembling gloves and pulsing heartbeat revealing contradictory impulses in scene. The Curator's unexpected empathy adds relational crucible pressure, earning the shared witness moment. Interiority is concrete and particular, avoiding stock phrasing, though some metaphors border on diagnostic self-awareness mid-crisis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under a Causal lens, the structure builds through motivated choices from discovering the letter to transmitting it and facing the Curator, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration via the reply that reweights rebellion with felt cost of endangerment. Orientation anchors early in the buried citadel and library, with clear causality in her decision cracking like a reflection. One meaningful tightening suffices, but the ending's subtle thaw feels earned without excess reflection.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The echoing library under snow is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like hushing snow and breathing corridors mirroring Ila's internal thaw, constraining her choice in Alcove Seven without cameras. Micro-setting of the comms crypt and frozen pane charges the final image of shifting world. Environment evolves causally, affecting actions like padding between shelves.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of risking rebellion escalates causally through her transmission, tightening options with the Curator's confrontation, forcing stance crystallization and a visible cost in shared vulnerability. One meaningful deepening via the letter's content changes knowledge, though coincidence of the reply complicates without resolving. Pressure coheres until the resonant reply reweights the stake.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of thawing suppressed truths emerges organically from images like melting ice and pulsing words, culminating in a resonant final image that reweights archival silence without moralizing. Subtext in the Curator's regret and the reply invites reflection on rebellion's cost. Emotional aftereffect lingers through complexity, avoiding tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in poetic, frost-laden noticing, like inhaling shards of cold as arguments. Voice texture is rhythmic and purposeful, with patterned elision taught early and paid off in the quiet thaw. Dialogue is natural, subtextual, and advances plot, as in the Curator's soft accusation and whisper of regret.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in lines like "Snow hushed the buried citadel" that advance atmosphere and stakes without loops. Figurative language is controlled, avoiding muddle in peak beats like the transmission. Minor scaffold in some descriptive runs, but clarity and propulsion hold through closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cryogenic archiving with rebellion via weather buoys transforms sci-fi tropes through specific details like admin glyphs and buoy packets. Risk-taking in the subtle, thaw-like closure heightens stakes organically. Avoids derivative premises with authentic vision in the library's listening presence.</comment>
