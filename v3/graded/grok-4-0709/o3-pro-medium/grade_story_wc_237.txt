<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Seren's motivation to transform scars into stories is clear and intensifies through embodied emotions like warming scars and blood-mingled ink, culminating in an earned renunciation where she keeps scars as lanterns with visible cost. Interiority is concrete, showing contradictory impulses in revisiting fears without cowering, revealed through micro-choices like dipping the quill in tea. Master Yulo's passive presence applies subtle pressure, but his lack of distinct voice slightly limits relational dynamics. Overall, flaws are minor and do not touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned imagery and cadence shifts, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration in the final rune that reweights fears into dialogue with undeniable conceptual cost in the humming rune and lightened scars. Orientation anchors early with the platform and Seren's kneeling, serving closure without disorientation. Closure lands on-page with cost via the blood-ink mixture and thunder's applause, holding the lens without contradiction. One hairline slip in mid-story ellipsis, but it does not distort causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The floating rock platform constrains choices by rocking with storm winds, charging the final descent and rune-humming image, while sensory details like mist and incense ropes reflect POV bias and urgency. Atmosphere evolves causally with weather, mirroring internal transformation without overt symbolism. Environment pressures the ceremony's timing, making it indispensable to closure. Exemplary integration with no slips.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of transforming scars signals early and deepens through a single meaningful intensification when storm winds rock the platform, forcing the blood-ink choice under Accumulative/Textural lens, with felt cost in pain and reconfiguration. Pressure coheres via internal fears and external storm, crystallizing stance without coincidence resolving it. Agency in renunciation forecloses fear's hold, but one minor abstraction in "promise hidden" slightly dilutes visceral stakes. Escalation driven by protagonist, cost unmistakable in final exhale.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of transforming pain into narrative emerges organically from particulars like quill droplets forming lullaby letters, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer via the restoration rune that reweights scars as lanterns without moralizing. Subtext in silence and images invites reflection on fear's harvest, avoiding sentimentality. Emotional aftereffect lingers through ambiguity in scars' lightness. Final image recharges prior motifs effectively.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable with distinct perceptual signature in poetic, image-dense noticing, like scars as "pale reeds," and rhythmic control heightens pressure in closure without obscurity. Patterned elision in lyric mode is taught early and pays off at ending. No dialogue present, so policy skips those bullets; no head-hopping or register drift. Perceptual bias consistent under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with vivid, multi-job sentences like "droplet fall onto the parchment, where it froze into a minuscule prism," propelling momentum without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is controlled, but one mixed metaphor in "incense ropes to nothing" slightly muddles in a non-closure beat, deducting minimally. Rhythm varies naturally, clarity strong in peak moments. No artifacts touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of rune scholarship, thunder bird quill, and tea ceremony transforms familiar fantasy tropes through specific emotional truth in scar-writing, feeling inevitable with risk in blood-ink that heightens stakes. Non-obvious angle on superstitions as harvestable seeds avoids generics. Bold lyric structure coheres without gimmickry. Proximity check clear, no echoes.</comment>
