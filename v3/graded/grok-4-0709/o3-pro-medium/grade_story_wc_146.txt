<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Characters like Marek and Lira are defined through poetic traits and actions, with Marek's infinite patience constraining his waiting and Lira's motivation to rebuild emerging from her cartographer background, leading to an earned choice to stay; however, interiority relies on abstract embodiments like tears charting routes, lacking contradictory impulses in peak moments, which softens the emotional progression at the climax where she aligns steps without deeper internal friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned walking and rhythmic echoes, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Lira's choice to continue walking reconfigures the town's balance with felt cost in her tears and foregone maps; orientation anchors early in the plaza, but causality feels elliptical in how footsteps revive the town, with the fork's hum as a pattern break that deepens rather than strictly causes the revival.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The setting of the cracked plaza and ancient archway constrains choices by channeling the walking revival, with vivid, purposeful details like mossed columns and cobblestones embodying the hush and heat that mirror Lira's hope; the archway charges the final image as it gleams with fresh mortar, evolving causally to support the thematic restoration without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reviving the ghost town escalates through accumulative walking rhythms that deepen the town's inhalation and window openings, with one meaningful cadence shift at the fork's hum narrowing options to Lira's choice; cost is felt in her tears and renunciation of mapping ruins, but pressure remains textural rather than viscerally tightening with a clear reversal, allowing coincidence in echoes to complicate without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of restoration through balanced rhythm emerges organically from walking and the fork's hum, resisting tidy morals by embracing ambiguity in whether revival is ghostly or real, with the final image of the town keeping time offering a resonant, non-literal reconfiguration of collapse; subtext in silences and echoes enriches complexity, though some direct statements like "balance wants music" verge on assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person voice maintains a consistent poetic texture with rhythmic syntax and perceptual bias toward silence and echoes, teaching patterned elision early in the wild hush; dialogue is natural and subtextual, advancing the revival through Marek's cryptic lines like "the stones know your name," with no head-hopping and rhythmic control heightening the walking cadence under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in sentences like "shutters sighed and doors hung like spent tongues" to propel atmosphere without loops; figurative language is controlled and coherent, avoiding muddle in peak beats like the fork's hum, though minor scaffold appears in repetitive "walk" phrasing, but it serves the textural pattern without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The premise of reviving a town via rhythmic footsteps transforms ghost town tropes through specific sonic motifs and Lira's cartographer motivation, feeling organic and inevitable in the charged poise of continuing choreography; risk in elliptical causality heightens thematic resonance without gimmickry, though echoes of folklore revival narratives limit full novelty.</comment>
