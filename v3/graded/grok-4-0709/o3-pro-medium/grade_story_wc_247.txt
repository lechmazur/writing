<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to map silence into music is clear and intensifies through embodied contradictory emotions like joyful sorrow, shown in her signing despite frightened tears; Harlan's ethereal presence applies pressure but lacks full on-page status dynamics as he's not fully corporeal. Interiority is concrete, with micro-choices like dipping fingers and photographing hushes revealing values under stress. Flaws complicate choices without hedging, leading to the earned stasis of crystallized light with the cost of Harlan's fading.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned elisions and image accrual toward a resonant reconfiguration where silence becomes visible music, with conceptual cost in Harlan's dissolution and the town's partial forgetting; orientation anchors early in the harbor by moonlight. Closure lands on-page with charged poise in the color melodies, reweighting the premise of silence as ink. Persistent constraint of dawn's approach shapes tactics effectively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The luminous harbor anchors vividly early, with sensory details like rippling mirrors and glowing water constraining Mara's glyph-tracing and signing; it pressures choices by supplying the tide as a medium and evolving causally with the resonant pulse. Micro-setting of the pier and water charges the final image of spilling colors. Tone tensions the ethereal hush purposefully, mirroring internal joyful sorrow without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of disrupting the town's silence signals early and deepens through accumulative pressure, with one meaningful cadence shift in the harbor's pulse forcing stance crystallization; cost is legible in Harlan's fading and Mara's frightened tears. Agency via signing and photographing forecloses paths with felt emotional price. Coincidence of musicians waking complicates but doesn't resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of translating silence into resonant forms emerges organically from images like nocturnal lilies and color chords, culminating in a non-literal final image that reweights the premise without moralizing; subtext in gestures and pauses invites reflection on memory and loss. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality through complex joyful sorrow. Purposeful ambiguity lingers in the town's humming hues.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with perceptual signature in Mara's biased noticing of silences and ripples; voice texture is distinct in rhythmic, poetic syntax that modulates with intensity, like bolder signing. Harlan's whispers carry subtext and advance plot naturally, though some diction drifts into elevated register. Patterned elision in whispers is taught and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose has high density with metaphors like patient lantern and nocturnal lilies advancing atmosphere, but occasional paraphrase loops (e.g., multiple descriptions of silence as map/ink) and template cadence in signing sequences dull momentum slightly; rhythm varies naturally, and final line recharges motifs effectively. No major artifacts obscure closure, though figurative density in peak beats borders on muddle without full payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sign language and silent music transforms tropes through specific details like film-less camera capturing hushes, feeling inevitable in hindsight; risk in ethereal advisor heightens stakes without gimmickry. Core premise offers non-obvious angle on grief and resonance. Authenticity coheres in singular poetic stance.</comment>
