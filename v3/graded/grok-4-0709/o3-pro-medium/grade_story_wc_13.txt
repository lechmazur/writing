<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Eira's motivation to uncage the proto-echo is clear and rooted in her illustrator traits, intensifying through embodied actions like pressing the pendant and drawing with borrowed time; interiority shows contradictory impulses in her lack of guilt amid city disruptions, culminating in an earned renunciation of linear time with the felt cost of her cracked stylus. Strengths include micro-choices under pressure, such as twisting the pendant to extend the corridor, revealing her value hierarchy. No secondary characters, so relationship bullets are ignored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds density through patterned imagery of cadence and echoes, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration in the final release with conceptual cost as the city relives voices and Eira's tools break; orientation anchors early with Eira on the sluice in Harkhar at gray dawn. The closure's charged poise in her sketching without sight reweights the premise of illustration. Persistent constraint of the giant's breath shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The rooftop canal system is vividly specific, with sensory details like silver threads and greased tiles constraining Eira's punt journey and charging the whirlpool climax; it mirrors her internal pursuit of echoes, evolving causally as water lengthens into a corridor. Environment directly shapes the final image of ripples striking towers. Micro-setting of the stone cage and mote integrates seamlessly with POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of uncaging the proto-echo escalates through textural density increase in the corridor and whirlpool, with a meaningful deepening as Eira borrows time, narrowing options amid flickering lights and stalled bells; agency drives the drawing that frees it, with legible cost in the thunderous double-beat and emptied seconds. Coincidence of rain complicates but doesn't resolve. Under Accumulative lens, the cadence shift reweights stakes effectively.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of freeing unmediated resonance from structured time emerges through images like the infinity pendant and proto-echo, culminating in a resonant final image of sketching by hearing that reweights the premise without moralizing; subtext in ripples reliving voices invites reflection on echoes' commerce. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality via the cost of disruption. No overt statements; complexity in Eira's causal role lingers ambiguously.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in poetic, illustrator-biased noticing, like canals as ink ribbons; rhythmic control heightens pressure in the stillness without obscurity. No dialogue, so those bullets ignored. Patterned elision in time manipulation is taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with vivid metaphors like "snoring hurricanes" advancing atmosphere, but minor overwriting in stacked figuratives like "silver gasp blooming" slightly muddles peak beats without harming clarity; high information density and varied rhythm support momentum. No loops or artifacts touch closure. Opening anchors voice; final line resolves with resonant image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of time-sculpting via giant's nap and echo birth transforms fantasy tropes through specific illustrator lens, feeling inevitable in the uncaging; risk-taking in non-linear time corridor heightens stakes organically. Fresh angle on echoes as imprisoned ur-sound avoids derivatives. Bold commitment to premise without retreat.</comment>
