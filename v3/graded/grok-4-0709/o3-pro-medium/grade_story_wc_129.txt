<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Alyss's motivation to graft herself onto community is clear and intensifies through embodied actions like weaving reeds, revealing contradictory impulses in her luminescent ache that sharpens into purpose at the climax. Lio's role as historian complements her sympathetically, with their relationship pressuring choices toward shared resolve. Interiority is concrete and particular, avoiding stock phrasing, though some emotions lean toward poetic abstraction rather than raw embodiment in the final palm-pressing moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned imagery of light and weaving to a Resonant Reconfiguration at the arbor's hum, with felt cost in the braided sensations and new shoots symbolizing threaded belonging. Orientation anchors early with the orchard and dawn, avoiding disorientation. Closure lands on-page with conceptual repricing of kinship, though the sudden apparitions feel like a micro-turn without deeper causal linkage.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The crystalline orchard is vividly specific, with branches shining like bottled rain constraining choices and charging the final sun-painted image, where environment mirrors internal grafting. Sensory details are purposeful, filtered through Alyss's bias, and evolve causally with the hum dislodging frost. A recurring object like the obsidian arbor constrains the weaving action and elevates the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of grafting onto community tightens meaningfully when Alyss weaves reeds into the arbor, deepening through the hum and apparitions that reweight options with communal potential. Under the textural lens, cadence shifts with the resonant hum, forcing stance crystallization, though cost feels more conceptual than visceral in the palm-pressing beat. Agency in her dedication forecloses isolation with felt pull, but coincidence of the arbor's appearance complicates without fully resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of kinship as woven fabric emerges organically from weaving actions and etched sentences like "Offer your thread," culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer at the new obsidian shoots without moralizing. Subtext in gestures like laying reeds and palm-pressing invites reflection on orphaned monuments. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality through complex ache, though some ambiguity borders on obliqueness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person voice is consistent and poetic, with perceptual signature in light-pouring imagery biased toward Alyss's sympathetic worldview, modulating rhythm under pressure like the trembling voice at realization. Dialogue is sparse but natural, carrying subtext in confessions about grafting. Patterned elision in lyric descriptions is taught early and pays off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with vivid metaphors like "bottled rain," varying rhythm naturally, but occasional overwriting in peak beats, such as stacked flakes ringing like teaspoons, muddles clarity without payoff. No major loops or artifacts, though some synonym churn in light descriptions (gleam, luminescent, shimmering) dulls momentum slightly. Information density is high, advancing atmosphere and character efficiently.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of marsh-reed sculpting with obsidian arbor transforms familiar community-seeking tropes through specific fantasy elements like breathing aurora petals, feeling inevitable at the grafted shoots. Risk-taking in lyric density heightens stakes without gimmickry, committing to the premise's implications. The core premise offers a non-obvious angle on kinship webs, avoiding derivatives.</comment>
