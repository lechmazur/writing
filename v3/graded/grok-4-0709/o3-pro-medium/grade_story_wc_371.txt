<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to catalogue vanishings and plant alternatives is clear and intensifies through embodied guilt, culminating in an earned realization that forecloses passive noticing with the cost of ongoing insurgency; contradictory impulses shine in his confession to Madam Ko, where professional curiosity itches but he waits, revealing values under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned images of planting and revelation to a Conceptual Repricing closure where Elias reweights noticing as active rooting with conceptual cost of perpetual vigilance; orientation anchors early in the palace colonnades, but minor elision in the pavilion entry feels slightly unmotivated without stronger causal cue.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The overgrown courtyard and pavilion vividly anchor the scene, with vines and mosaic basin constraining Elias's guerrilla actions and charging the final moonlight image of rivulets, making the micro-setting indispensable to the resonant reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of seeking absolution for unnoticed losses tightens through the conversation's deepening revelations under Accumulative/Textural lens, with agency in planting and confessing forcing a stance crystallization; guilt's felt cost is legible, but escalation relies on subtle cadence shifts rather than a sharper narrowing of options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of finding sacredness in ordinary defiances emerges organically from planting seeds and sharing bread, culminating in a resonant final image that reweights the premise without moralizing; subtext in silence and steam shapes adds complexity, inviting reflection on quiet revolutions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable with distinct perceptual signature in Elias's scent-guided noticing, and prose rhythm modulates poetically under pressure; dialogue carries subtext naturally, as in Madam Ko's low voice rattling teacups, advancing the thematic pursuit without artificiality.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with vivid, purposeful images like "golden steam" and "steam shaping a fleeting dragon," varying rhythm without loops or artifacts; the final line's propulsion recharges motifs cleanly, with no overwriting muddling the closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of guerrilla gardening as revolution against creeping normality feels inevitable, transforming tropes of urban decay through specific details like seedballs and anise bread; risk in lyric compression heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
