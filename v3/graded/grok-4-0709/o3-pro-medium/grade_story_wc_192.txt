<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation as a shadow keeper is clear and intensifies through her careful bridge-burning trait, compelling her ritual with embodied emotion in scars and breaths; interiority is concrete via gloved tenderness and rib-clicking inhales, though Declin's phantom presence lacks contradictory impulses in scene, slightly limiting depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Structure accumulates textural density through patterned imagery of soot and breath, leading to a resonant reconfiguration in the final water-light flood and Mara's departure, with felt cost in articulate emptiness; orientation anchors early in the sanctuary, and the Accumulative/Textural lens holds without ambiguity, though ellipsis in Declin's appearance feels mildly unmotivated.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The ashen sanctuary under starlight vividly constrains Mara's ritual, with soot-traced constellations and roof gaps pressuring choices like kneeling at the threshold; sensory details like tasting midnight embody POV bias, charging the final image of rinsed stones, meeting the 9+ test by shaping closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of teaching breath to the suffocating deepens through scar-linking and mist-sculpting, with one meaningful cadence shift in Declin's successful sphere that reweights options under the Accumulative/Textural lens; cost is felt in Mara's alone-again emptiness, though pressure from the phantom feels coincidental rather than agency-driven.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of tidy endings and holding wounds emerges organically from images like braided ash ribbons and breathing lessons, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer as soot learns lungcraft, reweighting grief as stewardship without moralizing; subtext in silences and shimmers invites reflection on severance's cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable with distinct perceptual signature in violet-bleeding night and soot constellations, rhythmic control in patterned elision like Morse-exhaled names; purposeful compression teaches lyric mode early, paying off at closure without head-hopping, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose density is high with multi-job sentences like wind tapping the knocker polite as a debt collector, propulsion via varying rhythms; however, occasional figurative muddle in peak beats, such as mist learning cursive, slightly obscures clarity without harming closure, and no loops or scaffolds appear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of grief as shadow-keeping with ingenious scar-linking method transforms familiar loss tropes through specific sanctuary ritual; risk in lyric compression heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in the breathing silence at closure.</comment>
