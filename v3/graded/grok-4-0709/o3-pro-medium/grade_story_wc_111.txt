<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Orlan's motivation to outgrow his father's deceptive legacy is clear and intensifies through pragmatic actions like polishing the marble, revealing internal conflict via contradictory impulses to despise yet repurpose the inheritance; emotions are embodied in his curved spine lightening and hesitant steps, with the final renunciation of deception earning a visible cost in redistributed luck. The single-POV interiority is concrete and particular, avoiding stock phrasing, though the trait of wisely pragmatic feels slightly label-like without deeper contradiction in a pivotal choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned images of cracking, polishing, and blooming/withering, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration in the sundial's shift to 'Gardener' with conceptual cost of redistributed luck and faith's validation; orientation anchors early in the maze at dawn, and causality holds via textural density increase, though one ellipsis in the maze shift feels slightly unmotivated. The closure lands on-page with undeniable pressure, reweighting Orlan's legacy from deception to transparency.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The garden maze setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like mist weaving and roses blooming/withering constraining choices and charging the final image of the rearranging hedges; it pressures Orlan's actions through roots pulsing and passages opening, evolving causally to nod at his path home, making the environment indispensable to the reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of proving gardens know gardeners escalates texturally through polishing and commemorating, tightening in the maze shift that narrows options toward the sundial; agency drives the polishing action, with legible cost in luck redistribution and acceptance of blooming/withering, though coincidence in the hedges leaning complicates without fully resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of mending deception into transparency emerges organically from polishing the cracked marble and the garden's response, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer at the sundial's 'Gardener' mark that reweights luck as faith; subtext in images like sap sealing cracks invites reflection on caretaking without tidy morals, avoiding direct statements.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The third-person close POV is stable with a distinct poetic texture in syntax and rhythm, like "blooming while withering simultaneously," modulating with emotional intensity; perceptual signature filters through Orlan's pragmatic bias, noticing dew counts and root pulses, with patterned elision taught early and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with high information in metaphors like "break trust like glass, then glue the shards," but occasional overwriting in peak beats, such as stacked figuratives during the tremor, muddles clarity slightly without loops; rhythm varies naturally, though some sentences border on purple, like "petals fresh and shriveled alike convulsed," reducing momentum in the climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The premise ingeniously synthesizes measurable luck with a garden's subterranean conversation, transforming inheritance tropes through Orlan's polishing into a fresh angle on faith and caretaking; risk in lyric density heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in the sundial's reconfiguration, avoiding stock metaphors.</comment>
