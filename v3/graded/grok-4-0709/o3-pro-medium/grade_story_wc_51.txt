<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Olivine's motivation to collect and weave burdens is clear and intensifies compellingly, rooted in her fractal weaver traits, with embodied emotions like the yank behind her sternum revealing internal conflict under pressure. Her final renunciation of isolation earns a meaningful change, foreclosing self-neglect with felt cost in the twelve-dram burden. Interiority is concrete and particular, avoiding stock phrasing, though some poetic abstraction slightly softens contradictory impulses in peak moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through layered confessions and crystal bursts, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Olivine weaves her own burden, reweighting options with conceptual cost legible in the braided filaments and harmonious geometry. Orientation anchors who, where, and when by the first paragraph without debt. Closure lands on-page with felt cost, though one minor redundant image in the exhaling grotto slightly dilutes propulsion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The bronze grotto under starlight is vividly specific, with sensory details like shingled hush and calcifying droplets filtered through Olivine's POV, constraining her choices and charging the final image as it turns to pale gold. Environmental evolution from mineral gloom to rose-tinged brightness mirrors her internal shift, integrating action purposefully. The setting pressures tactics, such as flame orientation revealing burdens, meeting the 9+ test by constraining closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of collecting burdens tightens meaningfully when Olivine confronts her own twelve-dram isolation, deepening under Accumulative/Textural pressure to crystallize her stance with undeniable cost. Agency drives escalation via micro-choices like reorienting the flame toward her shadow, foreclosing boundary-less trapping. One visible price in paralysis creeping like frost charges the image, though coincidence in the grotto's revelation slightly complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of weaving burdens into harmony emerges organically from particulars like siphoned filaments and the grotto's exhales, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in Olivine's unfinished mission. The final image of braided threads roofing the sky offers a resonant, non-literal repricing of isolation's cost. Subtext in blurred boundaries enriches complexity without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Consistent single POV with distinct perceptual signature in fractal patterns and mineral gloom, modulating rhythm from hushed reverie to eager flame without register drift. Prose texture is purposeful and lyric, teaching patterned elision early for legibility at closure. No dialogue present, so policy skips those bullets; elision pays off in the upside-down flame question mark.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied rhythm, like "flame licking downward like a question mark," advancing atmosphere without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is controlled, though one mixed metaphor in "shingled hush peeled away like opened shutters" slightly muddles in a non-peak beat. High information density and clarity support momentum, meeting 9+ test criteria but capped by minor overwriting in descriptive runs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of fractal weaving and burden-measuring in a bronze grotto feels inevitable, transforming tropes like self-discovery through specific, non-obvious inflections like upside-down flame orientation. Risk-taking in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, cohering as a singular vision. The core premise offers fresh emotional truth, passing the 9+ test with hindsight inevitability.</comment>
