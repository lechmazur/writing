<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and intensifies compellingly, rooted in intuitive traits that drive her pursuit of the anomaly, with embodied doubts like smoke curling inside conviction adding contradiction; the final realization about the bond as anomaly is earned through prior causality with felt cost in harmony achieved. Silas, as a secondary character, applies relevant pressure but lacks deeper status dynamics. Interiority is concrete, avoiding stock phrasing, though emotional progression could layer more irrationality under stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under a Causal lens, the structure links beats through motivated actions like Mara's sprint after the mirror vision, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration in the shard combination and realization, with conceptual cost in reweighted futures; orientation anchors early in the polar sea setting. One meaningful tightening suffices, but ellipsis in the stranger's disappearance feels slightly unmotivated, softening causality at the lantern room pivot.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The lighthouse orchard above shifting ice floes is vividly specific, with sensory details like hissing spray and clicking branches filtering through Mara's POV; it constrains choices, such as skidding boots on frost during the sprint, and charges the final image of aligned roots and floes. Atmosphere supports theme through pelagic winds and glowing fruit, evolving causally without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of mapping empathy onto action tightens meaningfully when shards combine, narrowing options and reweighting with cost in the bond's courage steadying the storm; agency drives escalation under Causal lens, with internal doubts conflicting needs. One deepening suffices, but stakes remain somewhat abstract until the projection, lacking a sharper ethical calculus at the climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of empathy as actionable bond emerges organically from particulars like the emotional map and shard reconstitution, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer where the anomaly is collective; subtext in mirrors and whispers invites reflection without confusion. Final image reweights the premise with complexity, avoiding tidy morals.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in Mara's intuitive sensing of unrest like tasting salt; voice texture is distinct and rhythmic, modulating with pressure in poetic compression. Dialogue is natural, subtextual, and advances plot, as in Silas's explanation testing sincerity; no head-hopping or register mismatch.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with vivid metaphors like branches clicking and light spiraling that advance atmosphere without loops; syntactic variety supports rhythm, especially in the climax's soft clang like bells underwater. Some figurative density in peak beats borders on muddle but pays off in closure image; zero scaffold or artifacts obscure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lighthouse orchard, emotional cartography, and anomaly as bond feels inevitable, transforming oracle tropes through specific details like birch bark maps; risk in lyric compression heightens stakes without gimmickry, as in the mirror's rippling view. Originality shines in non-obvious angle on empathy, committing fully to premise.</comment>
