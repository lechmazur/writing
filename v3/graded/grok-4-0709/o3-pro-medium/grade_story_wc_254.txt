<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation to seek boundaries aligns consistently with the poet's, shown through micro-choices like accepting the stone and paraphrasing verses, revealing internal contradiction in the tremor of certainty. The poet's aesthetically driven flaw complicates his actions, creating a crucible relationship that forces the narrator's stance shift. However, interiority occasionally slips into abstract labels like "tremor of certainty" without fully embodied contradiction mid-crisis, slightly diluting peak emotional progression.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned imagery and cadence shifts, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing closure where the columns' hum reweights certainty with a felt conceptual cost in the lingering pulse. Orientation anchors early with the journey east and frozen lake. One meaningful deepening occurs as they travel and reveal the colonnade, holding the lens without contradiction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The cobalt atrium and frozen lake constrain choices, pressuring the encounter and journey, while recurring motifs like the quartz shard and humming columns charge the final image of lingering hum. Sensory details are vivid and POV-filtered, evolving causally from winter glass to pink fires, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism. The micro-setting of the stone pulses with specificity, guiding action to the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake of striding through boundaries tightens meaningfully as the hum reveals the columns, deepening via the poet's verse and the narrator's resonance, reweighting certainty with a visible cost in doctrine shaken from memory. Under the Textural lens, pressure accumulates through motif density, forcing stance crystallization without coincidence resolving it. Moral calculus sharpens at the plaza, between sacred boundaries and change, with one credible loss in unfastened cloaks.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of dissolving boundaries and trembling certainty emerges organically from images like drifting stanzas and humming columns, offering a resonant non-literal answer in the final image of welcomed tremor without moralizing. Subtext in silences and implications, like the stone's pulse, invites reflection on language's edges. Emotional aftereffect arises from particulars, avoiding sentimentality through complex ambiguity in liberated voices.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person POV remains stable with a distinct perceptual signature in poetic, sensory noticing, like breath-sketching syllables, and rhythmic control heightens under pressure without obscurity. Dialogue pursues goals indirectly, as in the poet's murmurs advancing their compact, with subtext in implications. Patterned elision in lyric mode is taught early and pays off at closure, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose density is high with purposeful metaphors like "lantern-moth hush" advancing atmosphere without muddle, and syntactic variety creates propulsion in beats like the columns rising. No significant loops or artifacts obscure clarity, though occasional figurative stacking in the atrium scene borders on overwriting without harming momentum. Final line recharges motifs effectively, with clean grammar and rhythmic ear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise of a post-ban poet testing truth through humming quartz offers a fresh synthesis of sensory architecture and aesthetic hunger, feeling inevitable in the columns' revelation. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, transforming tropes like sacred boundaries through specific imagery like cobalt panes storing twilight. Originality shines in non-obvious inflections, like certainty trembling as rhythm for change.</comment>
