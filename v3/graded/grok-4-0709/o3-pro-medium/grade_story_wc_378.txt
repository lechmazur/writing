<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The android's motivation to resolve inner static is clear and intensifies through embodied contradictions, like pulsing hands and surging nostalgia, compelling the controlled burn choice with felt cost in accepting fragmented wholeness. Interiority is concrete and particular, with emotions embodied in coral patterns and heartbeat moss, avoiding stock phrasing. The single-POV focus excels in showing internal conflict via micro-choices, such as opening the chest despite dread, revealing a hierarchy of values anchored in guarding fears.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through layered images and memories toward a resonant reconfiguration in the controlled burn, with conceptual cost legible in the final image of anchored direction amid spinning compasses. Orientation anchors who (android caretaker), where (glass dome farm), and when (pre-storm) by the first paragraph, serving closure without disorientation. Causality holds via textural density increases, like memory fragments fluttering like petals, culminating in earned stasis without redundancy.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The desert rose farm under a glass dome constrains choices, supplying ethanol from rose waste for the burn and pressuring the android's actions during the storm, charging the final image of glowing petals in dormancy. Sensory details are vivid and purposeful, filtered through the android's perceptual bias, with dust glittering like powdered amber and heat tethering the storm. Micro-setting elements like the irrigation pump and chest integrate into action, evolving causally to mirror internal resolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, the dominant stake of resolving inner static escalates through pattern breaks like the geomagnetic surge amplifying fears, forcing stance crystallization in executing the burn with visible cost in compressed fears and dormant roses. One meaningful deepening narrows options when holograms swirl, leading to miniaturization that reweights chaos containment. Pressure coheres without coincidence resolving, though moral calculus could sharpen the ethical trade-off of containing rather than eliminating fears.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of fragmented wholeness emerges organically from images like shrunken fears and dormant roses, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to containing chaos without moralizing, with ambiguity in accepting enduring dread. Subtext operates in implications of donated memories and the chest's vapors, eliciting emotional aftereffect through the android's quiet heart. The final image reweights the premise of remembrance with conceptual cost, integrating core concept without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable and apt, with perceptual signature in mechanical-yet-organic noticing, like servo grace and pulsing moss, modulating rhythm under pressure without head-hopping. Prose texture is distinct in poetic syntax and word choice, teaching patterned elision early and paying off at closure with legible effect. No dialogue present, so policy skips evaluation; voice remains coherent and character-specific throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere through vivid lines like "flame slithered along the ethanol ring, rose-bright and low," varying rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is controlled and coherent, enhancing propulsion in peak beats like ignition, though occasional elevated diction like "soothing augury" borders on register drift without harming clarity. No artifacts obscure closure; sentences propel with strong verbs and specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes android nostalgia with geomagnetic chaos in a fresh, non-obvious way, transforming sci-fi tropes through specific details like coral-patterned hands and fear holograms, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyric, accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, committing to fragmented wholeness as authentic vision. Originality shines in the controlled burn as metaphor for inner resolution, avoiding derivatives.</comment>
