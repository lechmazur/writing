<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mora's motivation to shape futures is rooted in her backstory of collecting tide letters, intensifying through contradictory impulses of caution and hunger that culminate in the relieved-yet-condemned duality at closure; the herald applies secondary pressure effectively, forcing her micro-choices like inviting him in and rotating the wick; interiority is concrete and embodied, with emotions like shadowed elation tingling in her fingers, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through layered imagery and pattern of prophetic riddles, with a cadence shift in the final balcony scene reweighting the stake of stewardship; orientation anchors early in the lighthouse balcony under stars; closure lands as Charged Poise with felt cost of eternal vigilance, though the herald's abrupt exit feels like a minor ellipsis without stronger payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The emerald lighthouse setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like vibrating glass and salt-wrapped balcony filtered through Mora's sailor instincts; it constrains choices, as the central prism enables the wick insertion and shadow steering, directly charging the final image of gleaming stones and contagious guidance; micro-setting of the prism evolves causally, mirroring her internal ache.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of shaping dawn escalates through textural density of storm memories and spectral headlines, with one meaningful deepening when they insert the wick, narrowing options to prophetic stewardship; cost is legible in her electric calm and the wick's echo-burn limit, though coincidence of the herald's arrival slightly complicates without fully resolving; agency in rotating the wick drives the reconfiguration under the lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of story's persistence beyond print emerges organically from particulars like auroral headlines and tide letters, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in prophecy's accident; subtext in gestures like the herald's tucked laughter and Mora's tingling fingers invites reflection on creation's cost; final image of steering shadows offers resonant, non-literal repricing of dawn without stated moral, reweighting the premise of borrowed realms.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in Mora's salt-flecked, instinctual noticing; voice texture is distinct in rhythmic, metaphor-rich prose that modulates with pressure, like skipping octaves in the herald's laugh; dialogue carries subtext and advances plot, with natural indirection in lines like "This will steer what comes"; patterned elision in prophetic hints is taught early and pays off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, sentences like "light did not bloom; instead, shadowed elation coursed outward" advancing atmosphere and character; rhythm varies naturally, avoiding loops or scaffold, though minor figurative muddle in "caged lightning" is isolated; no artifacts obscure closure, with strong verbs and specific imagery propelling to the electric calm line.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lighthouse as future-mapper transforms trope through specific emerald prism and wick mechanics, feeling inevitable with risk in contagious darkness-guidance heightening stakes; non-obvious angle on media's end via auroral stories avoids derivative premises; the herald's jester-thunder persona offers memorable ingenuity without gimmickry.</comment>
