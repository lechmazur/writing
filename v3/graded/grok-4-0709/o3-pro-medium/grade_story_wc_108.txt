<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation is clear and intensifies compellingly, rooted in contradictory impulses like fear and adaptive reflex, culminating in the earned rebirth dive that forecloses his old identity with visible emotional cost. Interiority is concrete and embodied, as in fingering the seashell amid shaking knees, revealing values under pressure without stock phrasing. The child's brief role applies relevant pressure, but secondary characters like the director feel somewhat stereotypical, slightly limiting depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under a Causal lens, the structure links discoveries to actions with motivated escalation, from payroll revelation to broadcast and dive, landing a Decisive Change closure with rebirth and exposure that reconfigures options at the felt cost of risking death. Orientation anchors who (stunt double), where (rusted library roof), and when (night shoot) by the first sentence, serving clarity without debt. One meaningful tightening suffices at this length, but the engineer's cables feel like a minor coincidental complication that doesn't fully resolve via protagonist agency.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The rusted library under stars anchors vividly with sensory details like rattling gutters and desert wind, constraining the stunt choice and charging the final dive image through the glass atrium. Micro-setting elements like the seashell and child's cast integrate into action, reflecting POV bias and evolving causally. However, some details like the production trailer feel underused, not fully mirroring internal states.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Under the Causal lens, the dominant stake of reclaiming identity escalates through meaningful tightenings like decrypting the cast, narrowing options and raising costs, forcing the broadcast and dive with legible trade-offs in safety for truth. Agency drives the reversal from feigned terror to controlled rebirth, with visible costs like quaking body and potential fatality. Coincidence of the cables complicates without resolving, but the ethical calculus sharpens peak choices effectively.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of vulnerability as power emerges organically from events like the seashell toss and dive, offering a resonant non-literal answer in the final image of walking toward a new name without stated moral. Subtext in gestures like handing back the cast deepens complexity, inviting reflection on porous identities. The core concept integrates tightly, but occasional direct statements like "vulnerability is power" border on thematic echo, slightly reducing subtlety.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature in poetic, tremor-infused noticing, like the seashell's hiss, and rhythmic control under pressure without head-hopping. Dialogue is sparse but natural and subtextual, as in the child's whisper advancing plot. Some elision in backstory is taught and paid off, but minor register drifts into elevated diction like "galaxies" feel slightly unmotivated for the character's voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm and syntax to propel beats, as in the climactic dive sequence, with strong verbs and specific images avoiding major loops. Figurative language like the seashell as comet tail enhances without muddle, but occasional paraphrase loops, such as repeating fear's expense, and template cadences in reflective blocks slightly dull momentum. No artifacts touch closure, preserving propulsion there.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The premise of a surgically altered stunt double discovering his replacement status offers fresh synthesis on identity betrayal, transformed through specific choices like the child's cast cipher, feeling inevitable in the rebirth dive. Risk-taking in broadcasting the ledger heightens stakes organically without gimmickry. However, echoes of sci-fi tropes like cloned identities aren't fully subverted, limiting ingenuity slightly.</comment>
