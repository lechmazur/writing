<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's logical emotionality drives her protective focus effectively, with interiority shown through precise considerations like plotting resonance paths, but emotions feel more summarized than embodied in contradictory impulses during the climax. Callix's traits align consistently, and their relationship under pressure forces collaborative choices that alter the barricade's state. The final smile reveals a rare thaw, earning a meaningful change with visible cost in Callix's exhaustion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Under a Causal lens, the structure flows with clear because/therefore linkages from rumor to preparation to repulsion, anchoring who (Mara), where (marina), and when (sunset) by line 2 without orientation debt. Closure lands as a Decisive Change with the raiders' defeat and relic's security, carrying felt cost in Callix's collapse and the coastline's unclenching. One meaningful tightening at the barricade activation suffices, though minor ellipsis in raiders' arrival feels convenient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina is vividly sensory with clinking floes and icicle chandeliers, constraining choices like positioning forks on hulls and threading wire to the beacon, directly charging the final aurora image. Details evolve causally, mirroring internal states through apricot fire and trembling light without overt symbolism. Environment pressures tactics, such as the cutter slicing crimson water, making it indispensable to the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of protecting the artifact signals early and tightens causally with the raiders' arrival, forcing agency in adapting the sonic barricade under the Causal lens. One meaningful deepening at the chord's ripple narrows options, with visible cost in Callix's exhaustion and the raiders' amplified shame. Pressure coheres without coincidence resolving, though stakes remain somewhat abstract until the invisible wall moment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of sonic absolution emerges organically through vibrational matching cloaking the chamber, resisting tidy morals by embracing complexity in greed's discordant reflection without false equivalence. Subtext in gestures like steadying hands and the key's return offers resonant ambiguity, culminating in a non-literal final image of auroras as signatures that reweights protection's cost. Emotional aftereffect lingers via Mara's evidence-based belief shift, avoiding assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV on Mara remains stable and modest, with perceptual signature in engineer-precision observations like beam sweeps, and rhythmic prose modulating with pressure in warm thunder ripples. Minimal dialogue feels natural and subtextual, advancing plot through whispers about the key without as-you-know exposition. Distinct texture in syntax and diction heightens emotional beats without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose density shines with multi-job sentences like "icebergs chimed in sympathetic reply," varying rhythm naturally and avoiding loops or scaffold, though some metaphors (e.g., "air taste simultaneously fleshly ethereal") border on overwriting without muddling clarity. Clarity and propulsion hold through the climax, with strong verbs and specific nouns propelling momentum. Final line resolves by recharging motifs like silent parchment without artifacts touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of metal gears and sonic wavelengths transforms fantasy tropes into a fresh premise of vibrational protection, feeling inevitable through Mara's logical heart and Callix's absolution quest. Risk-taking in poetic compression heightens stakes without gimmickry, as in the subharmonics' invisible wall. Non-obvious angle on greed's mirror avoids derivatives, committing fully to implications like amplified shame.</comment>
