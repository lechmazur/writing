<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Arlen's motivation to preserve wonder is rooted in his seasonal muteness and embodied listening, compelling choices like answering the council through motion; interiority is concrete via metaphors like ribs as a cage, with contradictory impulses in his resolve despite silence's cost, earning the final stasis of etching instructions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through patterned images of ice and chimes toward a Resonant Reconfiguration in the etching and final thrum, with conceptual cost of ongoing silence legible; orientation anchors early on the bluff, but minor elision in council interaction slightly softens causality without breaking lens coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The Whispering bluff above clouds vividly anchors and constrains choices, with wind stealing vowels and fog painted by prisms charging the atmosphere; recurring iceberg fragment as micro-setting charges the final image of ravens and etched stone, constraining Arlen's repairs and amplifying thematic wonder.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving wonder tightens through the crack's discovery and repair, deepening via textural cadence shift in the bright refrain; under Accumulative lens, pressure coheres with felt cost in potential splintering, though coincidence of dawn's pulse slightly complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of truth beyond words emerges organically from silence and kinetic symphonies, culminating in a resonant final image of muted vigor that reweights the premise without moralizing; subtext in glances and dissolving worries invites reflection on unspoken certainty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Consistent third-person close POV with poetic texture in syntax like "silver hush" and rhythmic elisions taught early, maintaining perceptual signature biased toward auditory and visual wonder; no dialogue, but voice modulates with pressure, as in the hesitant pulse under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with rhythmic variety and purposeful metaphors like "clouds curled like parchment," propelling momentum without loops; minor figurative muddle in "fire blushed at colder colors" slightly dulls clarity, but overall clarity and concision support the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of muteness, kinetic sculpture, and polar ice transforms familiar silence tropes into a fresh premise of wordless symphonies, with risk-taking in lyric structure heightening stakes; the etched script as non-verbal legacy feels inevitable, avoiding derivative echoes.</comment>
