<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interiority with embodied emotions like the "pang of being dimensionally homesick" revealing contradictory impulses in scene, and the final endurance forecloses certainty with felt cost; motivation intensifies through waiting as a craft, compelling the guardian's choices; single-POV focus excels without needing relationships, though some phrasing borders on archetypal stray-scholar stock.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, density builds through patterned images like spirals and frost to a Conceptual Repricing closure where thresholds travel with listeners, with conceptual cost in softened homesickness; orientation anchors early in the frozen garden pre-dawn; one meaningful cadence shift suffices, with the pendant's warmth turning waiting into opening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Vivid, purposeful sensory details in the frozen garden, with rime-bloomed statues and foggy lucidity mirroring internal uncertainty; environment constrains choices, like brushing ice from the fern, and charges the final image of carrying the garden inside; micro-setting of sundial and mist evolves causally, reflecting POV bias without excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of befriending uncertainty escalates via textural density increase in the pendant's warmth and mist-shape interaction, forcing stance crystallization with felt cost in homesickness; one deepening through interiorizing exteriors narrows options; agency in waiting and pocketing reweights stakes, though pressure feels more atmospheric than urgent at peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of embracing potential over certainty emerges organically from images like blank margins and spirals, culminating in a resonant final image of thresholds traveling without moralizing; subtext in silences and fog-bodied curiosity invites reflection; emotional aftereffect lingers through conceptual repricing of home, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Consistent first-person POV with distinct perceptual signature in poetic, mist-infused noticing; rhythmic control heightens under pressure, like voice as "pages riffled by wind"; purposeful compression in lyric mode teaches patterns early, paying off at closure without elision issues; no dialogue, so policy skips those bullets.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density and propulsion in metaphor-rich lines like "distance had become elastic," advancing atmosphere without loops or scaffold; syntactic variety breathes with beats, zero artifacts in closure; figurative language purposeful and coherent, elevating peak moments without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of feral guardian and dimensional homesickness transforms library trope through spirals and waiting, feeling inevitable with risk in abstract stakes heightening resonance; non-obvious angle on uncertainty avoids generics, committing to premise without hedging.</comment>
