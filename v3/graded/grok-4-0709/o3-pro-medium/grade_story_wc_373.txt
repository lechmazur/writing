<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Clara's motivation as the moonshine runner's daughter is clear and intensifies through her steadfast pursuit, with embodied emotions like her hammering heart under pressure; internal conflict shows in her contradictory impulses during the confrontation, earning the final vow with felt cost. The watch fob reveals her hierarchy of values, constraining choices without stock phrasing. Minor slip in diagnostic self-awareness mid-crisis, but it doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Inferred lens is Causal, with because/therefore linkages from Clara's descent to the confrontation and resolution; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration via Charged Poise in the final vow, with legible conceptual cost in ruptured faith and narrowed timeline. Orientation anchors early in the midnight jetty; one meaningful tightening suffices, but a micro-turn with Cinder feels slightly convenient without fuller causality break.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The pirate market beneath the rotting pier is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like brackish steam and swaying lanterns filtered through Clara's urgency, constraining choices like her stall browsing for exits; the environment charges the final image as the market folds into rumor, meeting the 9+ test by shaping tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of capturing the sound escalates causally through the rival's interruption, tightening options with the broken hush and pilings' wrath; one meaningful deepening forces stance crystallization, with visible cost in market destruction risk, but coincidence of Cinder's arrival slightly complicates without fully resolving under the lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of trust's fragility emerges through images like the cracking sound and watch fob, offering a resonant non-literal answer in the final vow that reweights prior betrayals; subtext in gestures and silences enriches complexity without tidy morals, meeting the 9+ test by reweighting the premise with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in Clara's biased noticing of secrets and hushes; prose texture in rhythmic, poetic syntax reflects her state, with purposeful compression in whispers; minimal dialogue carries subtext effectively, meeting the 9+ test without elision issues or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with vivid images like barnacles glittering like broken glass, varying rhythm purposefully; minor paraphrase loops in market descriptions and a mixed metaphor in tension rippling like wind under tarps dull momentum slightly, but no artifacts touch closure, and information density remains high.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of pirate market with contraband sounds and hush truce transforms smuggling tropes through specific details like crystal diaphragms; risk-taking in abstract commodity heightens stakes organically, feeling inevitable in the captured crack of trust, meeting the 9+ test without gimmickry.</comment>
