<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Corvin's motivation to preserve methods through rational rebellion drives consistent, embodied choices, with internal conflict peaking in doubt seeping "cold as the water" during the debate with Mara, earning the final acceptance with visible cost of tempered calm.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through layered imagery and philosophical accrual to a resonant reconfiguration in the vault, with closure as Charged Poise where stars reweight plague cycles, carrying conceptual cost of myth surrender; orientation anchors early in the sewer attic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The sunken city's reefs, canals, and silt layers constrain ascent and descent, charging the final vault projection with tidal patterns that mirror thematic strata, making the environment indispensable to closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of challenging narratives tightens through debate and vault discovery under textural lens, with one meaningful deepening in doubt's cold seep that forces stance crystallization, though cost feels more conceptual than visceral at peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of stratified truth versus myth emerges organically from cog and layers, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer where stars tolerate verification, reweighting prior debates without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV stays stable with distinct perceptual signature in abrasive calm, like "sanding down certainties"; dialogue carries subtext in clipped syllables versus narrative counters, with rhythmic control heightening tension without elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose dense and propulsive with vivid metaphors like "roofs became reefs," varying rhythm purposefully; minor synonym churn in descriptive layers avoided closure harm, maintaining high information density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-plague submersion with philosophical relic-hunting feels inevitable, transforming tropes through sedimentary method and vault projection, heightening stakes with bold lyric risk that charges the dawn promise.</comment>
