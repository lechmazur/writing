<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Marlen's motivation to uncover ceilings' secrets is clear and intensifies through observant actions like analyzing dust, compelling his climb and retrieval; interiority is concrete via embodied perceptions, such as heart drumming like a calliope, revealing values with felt cost in relieving burdens. Ghosts as secondary characters apply thematic pressure without full status dynamics. No strong contradictory impulses in scene limit depth, but the earned endurance of his quest forecloses isolation with gratitude's cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, textural density builds through ghostly whispers and dust patterns to a resonant reconfiguration where pocketing the mainspring relieves burdens with conceptual cost in time's exhale; orientation anchors early in the service call and location. One meaningful deepening via the crawl space tightens discovery. Closure lands on-page with charged poise in dawn's fingers and relaxed cracks, though ellipsis in donation intent slightly softens causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The abandoned circus ticket office anchors vividly with wind-whistled posters and peeling clowns, constraining choices like ladder use and crawl space; sensory details like cobwebs twitching and dust crescents reflect POV bias and mirror internal quest. Micro-setting of the ceiling vent charges the final image by housing the mainspring. Tone tensions eerily with weightless silence, evolving causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of discovering ceilings' secrets tightens once through dust analysis and vent inspection, deepening knowledge with ghostly warnings; under textural lens, cadence shifts reweight burdens with felt cost in ghosts' relief. Agency in pocketing the device crystallizes stance, foreclosing unrest. Coincidence of timing complicates but doesn't resolve; lacks a second intensification for higher escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of hidden truths and unresolved burdens emerges through recurring cracks and mainspring's spin, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer as time exhales without moralizing; subtext in ghostly murmurs and weightless burdens invites reflection on time's facade. Emotional aftereffect lingers via relieved faces, embracing ambiguity. Final image reweights premise with conceptual cost, though some overt symbolism borders on direct statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV stays stable with perceptual signature in observant details like thin dust layers; voice texture in rhythmic, poetic syntax modulates with intensity, as in whirring matched to dreams. Ghostly dialogue carries subtext and advances plot naturally, like "The ceiling keeps the time." No head-hopping; purposeful compression in crawl teaches pattern, paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose density advances atmosphere with multi-job lines like peeling clowns exposing cracks, but occasional paraphrase loops (e.g., weightless burden repeated) and template cadence in descriptive runs dull momentum slightly. Rhythm varies with purposeful syntax; final line resolves imagistically. No major artifacts obscure closure, though figurative muddle in "gravity remembered kindness" strains clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of elevator tech with ghost-seeing and horologist relic transforms supernatural trope through specific dust analysis and carnival decay; risk in poetic elision heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry. Core premise offers non-obvious angle on time's hidden counts. Inevitable in hindsight via observant traits, though archetypal quest echoes familiar motifs.</comment>
