<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to balance fair trades roots in her father's legacy and drives concrete micro-choices like waiting actively, revealing contradictory impulses of honesty versus necessary deceit in the climax. Interiority is character-particular through mathematical metaphors, embodying emotions without stock phrasing. The final renunciation of pure honesty forecloses her rigid integrity with felt cost, as she calculates imperfect equations in the body bag.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under a Causal lens, because/therefore linkages propel the plot from Corvus's arrival to the shard's drop and escape, with orientation anchored early in the prep room. Closure lands as Charged Poise in the body bags, reconfiguring options with conceptual cost of unbalanced justice, though the minister's quick assent feels slightly unmotivated. One meaningful tightening suffices, with the ink pot constraint shaping tactics effectively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The funeral home prep room constrains choices vividly, supplying resources like body bags and refrigeration units that enable the escape, while sensory details like chemical fragrance and cold coils integrate into action. The vintage ink pot functions as a recurring object charging the final image, left as an "open variable." Environment pressures tactics, with formaldehyde mist mirroring philosophical themes without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving integrities escalates causally through Corvus's threat, tightening to the shard's cut and body-bag plan, narrowing options with visible cost of Corvus's death. Agency drives deepening via Mara's active waiting, forcing stance crystallization without coincidence resolving. Moral calculus sharpens the peak choice between deceit and freedom, though the escape feels slightly convenient in execution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of fair trades amid corruption emerges organically from events like repurposing the confession and calculating life exchanges, with subtext in gestures like whispering to the ink pot. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer by repricing deceit as necessary liquidity, embracing ambiguity without tidy morals. Emotional aftereffect lingers through Mara's realization that the world requires liquefied thinking.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and modest, with perceptual signature biased toward mathematical proofs and embodied stress like pulse scrawling. Voice texture distinct in rhythmic, metaphor-laden prose that modulates with pressure, teaching patterned elision early. Dialogue is sparse but natural, subtextual, and goal-driven, as in Mara's counter to the minister's objection.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose density high with purposeful metaphors like "deathly vitality" advancing atmosphere without loops, though some figurative density in the opening risks muddle. Rhythm varies naturally, sentences propel via strong verbs, and clarity holds despite poetic compression. Final line resolves by recharging the ink pot motif effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of con artistry and political asylum in a morgue transforms tropes through specific details like the glass shard and mathematical fair trades, feeling inevitable. Risk-taking in metaphorical density heightens stakes without gimmickry, committing to the premise's implications. The non-obvious angle on deceit as liquidity offers memorable ingenuity.</comment>
