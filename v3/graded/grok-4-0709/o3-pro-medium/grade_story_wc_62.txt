<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Len's motivation to carve collective grief is clear and intensifies through meditative actions, rooted in traits like silence as a "fiercely meditative tide," with embodied emotions shown in breaths and chisel work; interior conflict emerges in his walks and listening to voices, leading to an earned stasis in exhaling at the end; however, Harrah and Mira feel secondary without fully pressuring his choices, slightly diluting relational crucible potential.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through patterned motifs like butterflies and ribbons, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where the monument reweights grief with conceptual cost felt in the town's hush; orientation anchors early in the shed and greenhouse; closure lands on-page with the gathering and exhale, but some ellipsis in weeks of walking feels loosely linked without tighter causal beats.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The greenhouse setting constrains and enables choices, from sheltering slabs to hosting dinners, with dusk and glass charging the spectral mentorship; sensory details like violet dusk and creaking glass are vivid and POV-filtered, mirroring Len's meditative state; butterflies on the roof and ribbon knots evolve causally, charging the final monument image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of discovering collective grief tightens through accumulating walks and ribbon knots, deepening via Mira's guidance to a cadence shift in carving the porous monument; under Accumulative/Textural lens, pressure reweights with felt cost in Len's exhaustive nights, but escalation relies on poetic density rather than sharp agency-driven turns, slightly softening the peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of shared grief as porous and continuing emerges organically from motifs like butterflies, poems, and ribbons, culminating in the non-literal final line "For everything that leaves, stay" that reweights loss as resonance; subtext in silences and implications enriches complexity without moralizing; the ending invites lingering ambiguity on collective healing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and character-specific, with perceptual signature in meditative observations like "dusk bled violet"; voice texture is distinct in rhythmic, poetic syntax that modulates with calm thunder; dialogue in poem trades feels natural and subtextual, advancing theme without exposition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, sentences like "butterflies gathering on the roof glass like dull stars" advancing atmosphere and motif without loops; rhythm varies naturally, avoiding template cadence; minor figurative muddle in overlapping metaphors (e.g., tide, thunder, wings) but none obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of gravestone carving with spectral mentorship and butterfly migration transforms familiar grief tropes through specific details like ribbon knots mapping sorrow; risk in lyric accumulation heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry; core premise feels organic and inevitable in the monument's unfolding wing.</comment>
