<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mina's motivation is clear and rooted in her orphaned background, compelling her high-stakes broadcast choice with embodied grit; interior contradictions shine in her cautious hope amid Calvin's opportunism, earning a meaningful change with felt relational cost. Calvin applies immediate pressure as a secondary character, forcing her renunciation of his alliance. Emotions are embodied without therapy-speak, though some traits feel slightly stock in the mentor dynamic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with because/therefore linkages from signal decoding to counter-broadcast, culminating in on-page decisive change where tricksters retreat with visible cost in Calvin's slump and unity's bloom. Orientation anchors early in the booth; one meaningful tightening occurs when Calvin bursts in, narrowing options. Minor ellipsis in signal translation feels motivated but slightly convenient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Vivid, selective details like blinking LEDs and tattered charts constrain choices, with the radio booth and campus green pressuring Mina's antenna reroute; atmosphere mirrors internal tension through ozone-scented air and auroras charging the final image. Sensory hierarchy fits POV urgency, evolving causally without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of uniting against tricksters escalates causally when Calvin interferes, forcing agency in her reroute and broadcast with legible cost in mentor betrayal; one meaningful tightening narrows options effectively. Pressure coheres under causal lens, though coincidence of idle subwoofers slightly complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme of unity through cleverness emerges organically from signal decoding and counter-broadcast, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in cosmic power plays; final auroras offer resonant, non-literal reconfiguration without statement. Subtext in Calvin's silk-over-steel voice enriches complexity, though some direct assertions like "cleverness could be kinder than conquest" border on thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and modest, with perceptual signature in Mina's ethereal yet gritty noticing of signals and charts; prose texture distinct through rhythmic metaphors like "underground thunder." No head-hopping; purposeful compression in signal translation pays off at closure without obscurity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>High density and propulsion with vivid images like "ribbons of green and violet," but occasional overwriting in stacked metaphors (e.g., "trembling like distant stardust against the glowing meters") muddles peak beats; syntactic variety supports rhythm, though some paraphrase loops in description drag momentum slightly. No major artifacts touch closure, and clarity remains strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cosmic signals and campus divides transforms sci-fi tropes through Mina's radio-based ingenuity, feeling inevitable in her inverting broadcast; risk in ethereal grit tone heightens stakes organically without gimmickry. Premise commits fully, avoiding derivative safety with non-obvious moral calculus in unity's cost.</comment>
