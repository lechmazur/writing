<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong motivation rooted in memory loss compels choices like entering the whale and exhuming the core, with embodied emotions in tears and merging; interiority is concrete but occasionally slips into summary, as in the brittle souvenirs line, without fully contradictory impulses in peak scenes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with pattern breaks like the vision's spiral leading to reconfiguration; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration via memory cascade and merging with felt cost in tears and lighter air, though one ellipsis in the transition to tidal flats slightly softens causality without breaking it.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid, purposeful details like crunching crystals and sideways steam constrain choices and charge the final image of dawn-lit waves; micro-setting of the whale's maw and pit evolves causally, mirroring internal recovery without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reclaiming memories tightens through the coffee vision and descent, with one meaningful deepening in the exhumation that narrows options and incurs emotional cost; pressure coheres under Textural lens but lacks a secondary accent for fuller escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of preserved yet erased memories emerges organically from images like fluttering moths and dissolving crystals, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer via the merging child that reweights forgetting's cost without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Consistent third-person close POV with perceptual signature in sensory biases like gleaming silence; prose texture is distinct and rhythmic, modulating with pressure in the vision, though no dialogue to evaluate.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density and propulsion in vivid lines like "crystals wailed in frequencies below sound," with varied rhythm; minor scaffold in repetitive silence motifs dulls momentum slightly but doesn't obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of folklore-like memory harvesting with surreal gravity pockets feels inevitable, transforming tropes through specific choices like coffee divination that heighten stakes in the exhumation without gimmickry.</comment>
