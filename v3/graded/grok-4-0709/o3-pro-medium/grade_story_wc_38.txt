<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to liberate secrets is clear and rooted in her traits as a code breaker, intensifying through calm defiance that compels high-stakes choices like sabotaging the lab; interiority is concrete and embodied in her dance translations, with contradictory impulses evident when she whispers to her doubts amid vulnerability. The encounter with Dr. Vane serves as a crucible, forcing a final gesture that alters their dynamic with felt cost. Minor slip in archetypal phrasing, like "calm defiance," feels slightly stock without deeper contradiction in peak moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned motifs like the spider web and dance, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration in the lab's collapse and secret broadcast, with felt cost in the protagonist's burning lungs and triumphant float; orientation anchors early in the sunken lab descent. Causality holds via motif accumulation rather than strict therefore links, with one meaningful deepening in the vault opening. Minor ambiguity in sabotage timing slightly softens ellipsis motivation, but closure lands with undeniable pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The sunken laboratory setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like algae-slick stairs and plankton constellations constraining choices and mirroring internal states; the environment pressures the climax by flooding, directly charging the final escape image. Micro-setting elements like the vault door and dice plinth guide actions tactilely. Spatial choreography tracks coherently through descent and ascent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the dominant stake of liberating secrets tightens through pattern intensification, with one meaningful deepening in the dice authorization and turret persuasion, narrowing options amid rising floods; cost is legible in the lab's implosion and protagonist's physical triumph. Pressure coheres but occasionally diffuses via metaphors, slightly softening agency in the sabotage reveal. Coincidence of the storm aids without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of encrypting vulnerability as strength emerges organically through dance motifs and liberation, culminating in a resonant final image of floating amid applause-like thunder that reweights secrecy without moralizing. Subtext in gestures like giving the die to Dr. Vane invites reflection on humility. Emotional aftereffect lingers via complexity, avoiding tidiness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in lyrical, motif-driven noticing, like ocean groans as familiarity; voice texture shines in rhythmic syntax that modulates with pressure, teaching patterned elision early. Brief dialogue with Dr. Vane carries subtext and advances the encounter. No head-hopping or register mismatch.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with vivid metaphors like "metal petals unfurled," varying rhythm purposefully, but occasional overwriting in stacked figuratives during vault scene muddles clarity slightly without harming closure. No major loops or artifacts, though some synonym churn in web repetitions feels near-redundant. Information density high, advancing atmosphere and action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Originality shines in synthesizing code-breaking via dance with hangman's dice in a sunken lab, transforming tropes through specific motifs like whale-oil journal and plankton stars; the calm defiance angle feels fresh and inevitable, heightening stakes without gimmickry. Risk in lyric compression pays off at closure.</comment>
