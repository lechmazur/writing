<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sable's motivation to defy the nostalgia ban through her art is clear and intensifies compellingly, rooted in her traits as a tide dancer; interiority is concrete and embodied, with contradictory impulses like risking drowning in recollection to gain resonance. Emotions are vividly embodied, as when she guides the tide inward, showing internal conflict in scene. The meaningful endurance of exile is earned with felt cost, reframed as chosen purpose in the final sway. Flaws complicate choices without hedging, elevating the score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural, with density increasing through patterned imagery of tides and gaps, holding through closure; orientation anchors who (Sable), where (twilight garden), and when (after ban) by line 1. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), as exile becomes origin with visible cost in exhaustion and anchoring, reweighting the stake on-page. One meaningful cadence shift at dawn suffices, but minor ellipsis in current mapping slightly softens causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The twilight garden is vividly specific, with sensory details like dew on black loam and salt smell filtered through Sable's bias, mirroring her internal state. Setting constrains choices, as the dry fountains and cherub enable the notebook placement and speck discovery, charging the final image of blooming tide lilies. Environment evolves causally, from dusk to dawn, affecting action with purposeful tone tension. Recurring objects like the notebook and cherub charge closure, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of inscribing the planet despite the ban signals early; one meaningful deepening occurs when ingesting the speck tightens pressure, narrowing options with risk of drowning and raising conceptual cost. Under Accumulative/Textural lens, pattern break in garden widening reweights stakes with felt price in equilibrium struggle. Agency in renunciation of roaming forecloses paths; cost is legible in exhaustion draping shoulders. Coincidence of finding the speck complicates without resolving, but stakes feel somewhat abstract until closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of forbidden nostalgia and art's defiance emerges organically from images like the moonstone speck and tidal glyphs, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in officials' inevitable failure. Subtext in gaps and absences invites reflection on memory's condensation, culminating in a resonant final image of the wave lifting with promise, reweighting the premise without statement. Emotional aftereffect is concrete, avoiding sentimentality through complexity. The ending offers a non-literal answer to exile's cost, satisfying the 9+ test but with slight overtness in "elective exile had become origin."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable and apt, with perceptual signature biased toward tidal metaphors and absences, modulating rhythm under pressure like shortened sentences during the ingestion risk. Prose texture is distinct in syntax and word choice, teaching patterned elision early (e.g., gaps observation) and paying off at closure without obscurity. No dialogue, so policy skips those bullets; free indirect style is clean, with purposeful compression heightening emotional beats. Distinct voice holds under stress, satisfying the 9+ test with rhythmic control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, each sentence advancing atmosphere and character through vivid images like "quill's kiss" without loops or scaffold; rhythm varies naturally, accelerating in writing beats. Figurative language is controlled and coherent, with no muddle in peak moments like dissolving the speck. Clarity and propulsion are strong, with strong verbs and specific nouns; zero artifacts touch closure. Satisfies 9+ test with exceptional integration, though one mixed metaphor ("brine ice beneath sunrise") is a hairline slip.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of tide dancing, nostalgia ban, and cosmic inscription feels fresh and inevitable, transforming exile trope through specific details like moonstone condensation. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, with non-obvious angle on memory's materiality. Core premise commits fully, avoiding middle-ground hedging; the speck's ingestion inflects boldly. Satisfies 9+ test with hindsight inevitability, earning +0.3 risk bonus.</comment>
