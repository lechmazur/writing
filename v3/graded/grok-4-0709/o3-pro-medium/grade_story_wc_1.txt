<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Yara's motivation to decode the ledger and expose the network is clear and rooted in her adaptive traits as a glass artist, with embodied emotions like anger annealing into resolve showing contradictory impulses in scene. Interiority is concrete and particular, avoiding stock phrasing, as seen in her sketching constellations to channel worry. The final endurance forecloses naive safety with felt cost in ongoing pursuit, earning Charged Poise. Minor slip in over-articulated self-awareness mid-crisis slightly hedges emotional rawness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure accumulates pressure through patterned images of glass, heat, and frost, leading to Charged Poise closure where the pendant's tapping reconfigures purpose with conceptual cost of tempered survival. Orientation anchors early in the canyon under stars, with causality in motivated actions like waiting for frost to reveal sigils. One meaningful deepening tightens at dawn with hoofbeats, narrowing options without coincidence resolving. Minor orientation debt in initial repetitive "stars" phrasing briefly muddles spatial clarity but pays off in ritual silence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The quiet canyon under stars is vividly specific, with sensory details like frost lace and echoing hoofbeats filtered through Yara's artist POV, constraining choices like using shadows as stepping stones. Atmosphere builds drifting resonance, mirroring internal pauses, and the environment charges the final image as sunlight dazzles pursuers. Micro-setting of the ledger and pendant evolves causally, affecting escape tactics. No generic clichés; details like basalt slab integrate into action purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of survival and exposing smugglers signals early, with one meaningful deepening at frost revelation tightening options and raising pursuit cost. Under Accumulative/Textural lens, pattern break at dawn hoofbeats forces stance crystallization into adaptive escape without coincidence resolving. Agency in retracing path forecloses direct confrontation with felt cost in measured breaths. Stakes feel visceral but slightly abstract in untested council delivery, capping escalation intensity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of creation and survival sharing rhythms emerges organically from glass metaphors and pauses, culminating in non-literal Charged Poise where the pendant promises brighter purpose, reweighting prior fury without moralizing. Subtext in frost revealing negatives invites reflection on hidden truths, with ambiguity in uncertain justice lingering meaningfully. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality through embodied annealing. Minor thematic echo in "scorched testament" phrase feels slightly overt but integrates via ledger.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in glass-artist biased noticing like crystalline filaments, and rhythmic prose modulates with pressure, compressing in escape. No dialogue, so policy skips those bullets; free indirect style clean, with purposeful compression in lyric images taught early. Elision of chase details pays off in present tension without withholding known facts. Distinct texture in syntax like crackling parchment heightens without obscurity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere through multi-job sentences like frost unfurling as lace, varying rhythm naturally without loops. Figurative language consistent in glass motifs, avoiding muddle in peak beats like dawn escape. Minor scaffold in repeated "steadily adaptive" but no template cadence or synonym churn. Final line resolves with resonant image, propelling to Charged Poise without artifacts dulling clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of glass artistry with smuggling ledger decoded via frost offers non-obvious angle on survival and purpose, transforming tropes through specific motifs like annealing fury. Risk in lyric compression heightens stakes organically, feeling inevitable in hindsight at pendant beacon. No derivative echoes; authenticity in singular vision of pauses as purpose. Bold ambiguity in open justice commits without retreat.</comment>
