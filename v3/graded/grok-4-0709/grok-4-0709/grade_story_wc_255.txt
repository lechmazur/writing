<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under a Causal lens, the plot advances through motivated actions like arranging plants and offering the reed, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration in Elias's acceptance of grayscale with conceptual cost of lost illusions; orientation anchors early in the courtyard, but minor ellipsis in spirit manifestation slightly softens linkage without breaking causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The glassblower's courtyard is vividly specific with fractured sculptures and overgrown edges that constrain choices, like gathering plants around the marred orb, charging the final image where Elias paints amid imperfections; atmosphere of ashen rebirth mirrors his internal quest, with sensory details filtered through his grayscale POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of awakening colors tightens causally when visions reveal garish clashes, forcing revocation with visible cost in faded colors and accepted flaws; one meaningful deepening occurs in the horror grip, narrowing options, though coincidence in spirit's compliance slightly complicates without resolving.</comment>
