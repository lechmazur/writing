<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong motivation rooted in preserving ephemeral moments intensifies through ritual choices, with embodied contradictory emotions like grief-laced joy evident in the steeping act; interiority is concrete and particular, avoiding stock epiphanies, but slight diagnostic label-speak in "haunted euphoria" undercuts peak specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, ritual steps build density through patterned memories and sensory callbacks, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where the covenant regenerates with felt cost in tears and haunting presence; orientation anchors early at the jetty, and causality holds via proximate linkages without breaks, though minor redundancy in memory prompts slightly dilutes propulsion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid, purposeful sensory details of the blooming jetty at twilight integrate with POV bias, mirroring internal regeneration through floral nods and salt spray; the setting constrains and enables the ritual, charging the final image of brighter blooms celebrating the bond, fulfilling the 9+ test by shaping closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of regenerating the covenant tightens through accumulative ritual deepenings, narrowing options as twilight fades and forcing agency in steeping the photo; cost is legible in emotional resurgence and tears, but pressure feels somewhat internal and low-external, with one meaningful deepening sufficient yet not maximally visceral under the lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of cherishing the ephemeral emerges organically from ritual images and motifs like ink-steeped photo, resisting tidy morals with ambiguous haunting bliss; subtext in silences and whispers invites reflection, and the final image offers a resonant non-literal answer reweighting loss as living bond, though occasional direct statements border on assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Consistent third-person close POV with distinct perceptual signature in earthy, memory-filtered noticing; prose texture modulates rhythm effectively under ritual pressure, but some elisions feel untaught, and figurative density occasionally strains clarity without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>High information density advances atmosphere and character through vivid, multi-job sentences, with varied rhythm and clean mechanics; however, occasional paraphrase loops like repeated "proximate cause" and stacked metaphors in the ritual beat dull momentum slightly, though no major artifacts obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archival ritual with walnut ink and jetty setting transforms grief tropes through specific sensory and emotional details, feeling inevitable in the steeping climax; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes organically without gimmickry, though premise echoes familiar mourning narratives without bolder subversion.</comment>
