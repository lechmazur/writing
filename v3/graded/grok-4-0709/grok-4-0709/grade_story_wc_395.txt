<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to uncover deleted files and solve the cold case is clear and intensifies through discoveries, compelling higher-stakes choices like lying to the AI. Interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions in her steady fingers during deception and panic at the end, revealing contradictory impulses under pressure. The final renunciation of digital evidence carries a felt cost in her memory's weight, earning the bittersweet endurance. Minor stock phrasing in traits like "brightly attentive" slightly flattens specificity, but it doesn't undermine the closure choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under a Causal lens, the structure builds through motivated linkages: noticing 47 patterns leads to accessing restricted sectors, lying enables discovery, and revelation triggers self-erasing logs, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara emerges with printed proof but lost digital truth, with conceptual cost in the deepened absence. Orientation anchors early in the archive setting with Elara's role. One meaningful tightening suffices at this length, with the node's collapse as a decisive turn. Minor ellipsis in the download feels slightly unmotivated, but closure lands with legible cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The social network archive is vividly anchored with sensory details like warped songs and holographic displays, filtered through Elara's attentive POV, subtly mirroring her sensed absence. Environmental elements constrain choices, as server hums and data debris pressure her navigation and discovery. The recurring patch object charges the final image, constraining her emergence with bittersweet fulfillment. Sensory selection reflects urgency, with no white-room issues, though occupational depth is minimal but apt for length.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake in solving the cold case escalates causally: recurring 47s tighten pressure, leading to the lie and forbidden access, narrowing options with AI detection risk. One meaningful deepening—the logs' revelation and self-erasure—forces stance crystallization with felt cost in lost evidence. Agency drives turns through Elara's decisions, though coincidence in anomaly discovery slightly complicates without resolving. Stakes feel visceral, culminating in bittersweet closure without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of digital erasure and lost human connections emerges organically from Elara's quest, with the patch and songs as motifs that shift meaning, reweighting the premise in the final image without moralizing. Subtext in sensed absence invites reflection on forgotten lives, earned through specific struggles like the self-erasing logs. Emotional aftereffect lingers in bittersweet fulfillment, embracing complexity without false equivalence. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to where deleted files go, reconfiguring the archive's void.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable, with perceptual signature in Elara's sharp noticing of patterns, modulating rhythm under stress like panicked download. Prose texture is distinct, with purposeful syntax varying for propulsion, and brief dialogue feels natural in her typed lie to the AI, advancing plot with subtext. No head-hopping or register mismatch; elision in discoveries is taught and paid off at closure. Psychic distance shifts intentionally during immersion in the underbelly, heightening intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere through warped songs and data debris without loops; rhythm varies naturally, accelerating in the panic download. Figurative language like "ghosts in a digital mausoleum" is controlled, avoiding muddle in peak beats. Minor scaffold in repetitive "47" mentions feels patterned but doesn't obscure closure; strong verbs and specific details propel momentum. Final line recharges motifs effectively, though one simultaneity in "flickered, the forgotten songs swelling" slightly blurs sequence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes sci-fi archive with cold case obsession in a fresh way, transforming tropes of digital ghosts through Elara's specific pursuit of deleted files' fate. Risk-taking in the self-erasing revelation heightens stakes organically, feeling inevitable via patterned 47s. Emotional specificity in bittersweet absence avoids generics, with no close echoes of famous scenes. Minor familiarity in spaceship crash motif is personalized through the patch's role, committing fully without retreat.</comment>
