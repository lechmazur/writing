<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to preserve hope is clear and intensifies through her deliberate actions, rooted in consistent traits like sharp-eyed observation; interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions in her handling of the river stone and confrontation of her own regret. However, some stock phrasing, such as "burned quietly within," slightly dilutes specificity in peak moments. The final renunciation of unbound parts of herself earns a credible endurance with felt cost, visible in the lingering luminous regret.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under a Causal lens, the structure flows with because/therefore linkages from noticing the shadow to comparing footage and binding it, anchoring orientation early in the floating library. Closure lands as a Decisive Change with the shadow's metamorphosis into a guardian, carrying felt cost in Elara's lingering regret that reconfigures her self-understanding. One meaningful tightening suffices at this length, though the video comparison feels slightly elliptical without deeper causal friction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The blooming library above clouds is vivid and purposeful, with vines and petals mirroring internal states and constraining choices, such as the shadow drifting across shelves. Sensory details are selective, filtered through Elara's POV, and the environment charges the final image as the library blooms brighter, embodying preserved hope. Micro-setting like the archival chamber integrates action seamlessly without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving hope escalates causally through the shadow's threat and Elara's realization of its personal origin, with one meaningful deepening in the video comparison narrowing options. Agency drives the metamorphosis, foreclosing unchecked regrets with visible cost in her heart's luminous regret. Coherent pressure forces stance crystallization without coincidence resolving it, though stakes remain somewhat abstract until the binding.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of transforming regret into enduring hope emerges organically from events like the shadow's binding, with subtext in images of blooming and luminous sorrow avoiding direct statements. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal reconfiguration without moralizing, embracing complexity in Elara's changed self. Emotional aftereffect lingers through purposeful ambiguity, though it borders on sentimentality in phrases like "glow of what might have been."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and apt, with perceptual signature in Elara's dusk-noticing bias and softly deliberate grace; no dialogue present, so policy skips those bullets. Prose texture is distinct in rhythmic, poetic syntax that modulates with intensity, teaching patterned elision early for legibility. Psychic distance serves emotional beats, though occasional elevated diction like "ethereal archive" slightly drifts from grounded voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm and syntax to propel momentum, as in the overlay of footage leading to metamorphosis. Some paraphrase loops, like repeated "luminous regret," and template cadence in "softly deliberate" phrases trigger minor deductions without obscuring closure. Information advances story effectively, with strong verbs and specific details charging the final blooming image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The premise of shareable dreams and an unbound shadow offers fresh synthesis, transformed through Elara's personal regret and the library's blooming logic, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyric, accumulative imagery heightens stakes organically without gimmickry. Core elements cohere as a singular vision, avoiding tropes via specific details like the river stone's patterns.</comment>
