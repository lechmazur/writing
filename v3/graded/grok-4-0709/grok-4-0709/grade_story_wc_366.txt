<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to bottle safety is clear and rooted in his losses, intensifying to compel his spectral intervention; interiority is concrete, with embodied grief mirroring the ghosts' ache. However, emotions lean toward performed longing rather than contradictory impulses in scene, slightly softening peak authenticity. The final renunciation of isolation through the chain earns stasis with felt cost, as in his softened ache into resolve.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned reflections and motifs to a resonant reconfiguration where the ghosts fade peacefully, with conceptual cost in Elias's quiet resolve; orientation anchors early via his role and isle. Closure lands on-page with felt cost from his grief, reweighting safety's meaning. Minor ellipsis in hauntings' intensification feels motivated but could tighten causality slightly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The haunted lantern room constrains choices, pressuring Elias's ritual and charging the final glow; sensory details like salt-etched glass and swirling wisps are vivid, POV-filtered, and evolve with events. Atmosphere mirrors internal ache through ethereal glows, supporting tone without overt symbolism. Micro-setting of stones and glass integrates into action, subtly guiding the protective act.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of providing solace escalates texturally via the lamp outage and ghostly intensification, deepening to force Elias's ritual with visible cost in confronting grief; one meaningful cadence shift narrows options effectively. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, crystallizing stance without coincidence resolving it. Moral calculus between duty and personal loss sharpens the peak, though secondary accents feel lightly interwoven.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of preserving safety amid loss emerges organically from the chain and glass motifs, culminating in a resonant, non-literal reconfiguration of protection without moralizing; subtext in silences and implications enriches complexity. Final image of softened ache offers lingering ambiguity, eliciting emotional aftereffect through concrete ritual. Insights arise from Elias's struggle, avoiding platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in warmly observant details like curling waves; prose texture distinct via rhythmic, image-rich syntax modulating with intensity. No dialogue, so policy skips those bullets; elision in backstory anchors via cues, tilting present stance. Psychic distance serves emotional beats cleanly, without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere through vivid images like "frosted blue like frozen twilight," but occasional paraphrase loops (e.g., repeated ache descriptions) slightly dull momentum in reflective blocks. Rhythm varies naturally, with strong verbs and specificity; no major artifacts obscure closure, though some figurative stacking in hauntings feels dense without full payoff. Clarity and propulsion hold under pressure, integrating details purposefully.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The premise transforms haunted lighthouse tropes through the anonymous chain and stone-stacking method, synthesizing into a fresh angle on solace with organic ingenuity; risk in spectral extension heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity in bottling safety feels memorable and inevitable. Core elements cohere as singular vision, avoiding stock echoes.</comment>
