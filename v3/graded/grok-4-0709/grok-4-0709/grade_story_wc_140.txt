<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The survivor's motivation to discover memory textures is clear and intensifies through collecting fragments, compelling choices like climbing containers; interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions like the "burn of forgotten pain" from the poison label revealing contradictory impulses under pressure. However, internal conflict alternates summaries rather than simultaneous scene action, slightly weakening peak moments. The nameless identity trait shows flaws complicating choices, leading to an earned stasis with felt cost in persistent erasure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through layered story fragments across tides, with orientation anchored early in the port maze; closure is a resonant reconfiguration via conceptual repricing, where erased histories become a pulsing archive with felt cost in transformed namelessness, evident in the final descent with talisman. One meaningful cadence shift tightens at the poison label discovery, reweighting prior echoes. Minor elision in transitions doesn't obscure causality, holding the lens through to the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The port city labyrinth of containers anchors spatially and temporally early, with vivid, selective sensory details like "salty air" and "creak of metal" filtered through the survivor's distorted lens; tides evolve causally, pressuring movement and discoveries, while the red container perch charges the final overlook. Micro-setting of barnacled pilings and mud constrains choices, mirroring internal erasure. Tone tensions the theme effectively, with no white-room issues.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of rebuilding erased identity signals early and deepens through fragment collection, with one meaningful cadence shift at the poison label intensifying personal cost under Accumulative lens; pressure coheres via tidal rhythms forcing stance crystallization, but stakes remain somewhat abstract without visceral trade-offs. Agency in layering forecloses void paths with felt opportunity cost in ongoing namelessness. Coincidence of overheard stories complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of erased histories emerges organically from layered fragments and the survivor's quest, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer where namelessness becomes defiant strength, reweighting prior voids without moralizing; subtext in whispers and textures invites reflection on identity's complexity. Emotional aftereffect arises from particulars like the sticky label's burn, avoiding sentimentality. Final image offers conceptual repricing with lingering ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with distinct perceptual signature in filtered "what-ifs and half-remembered echoes," and rhythmic control via tidal cadence; purposeful compression in lyric mode teaches patterns early, paying off at closure without obscurity. Dialogue is natural, subtextual, and advances accumulation, like the dockworker's grumbled tale. Minor register drift in elevated diction slightly jars under stress, but no head-hopping or leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied rhythm, but occasional paraphrase loops like repeated "texture" descriptions in adjacent lines dull momentum without payoff; metaphors are vivid yet sometimes stacked, as in "veils of what-ifs and half-remembered echoes," risking muddle in peak beats. Clarity holds with strong verbs, but template cadence in tidal transitions adds minor scaffold. Final line recharges motifs effectively, with no major artifacts touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of clerical error survival with port labyrinth collecting creates non-obvious angle on identity erasure, transforming tropes through specific textures like "rough like weathered rope"; risk in accumulative structure heightens stakes organically, feeling inevitable at the talisman clutch. Emotional specificity avoids generics, with bold lyric commitment. No derivative echoes, committing fully to premise.</comment>
