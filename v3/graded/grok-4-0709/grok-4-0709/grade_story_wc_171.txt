<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara's motivation for redemption is clear and rooted in her flawed past, intensifying to compel the sacrificial ritual; interiority is concrete, with embodied emotion in the chest pull and dimmed eyes at closure. Internal conflict shows through her gentle approach contrasting war's violence, earning the endurance with visible cost. However, some emotions lean toward summary labels like "weary" without deeper contradiction under stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds density through ritual steps to a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost in Elara's siphoned vitality; orientation anchors early on the terrace. Closure lands on-page with the treaty anchored, reweighting the war's stakes. Minor redundancy in descriptive buildup slightly dilutes propulsion without breaking causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The ancient terrace and celestial dance provide vivid, purposeful atmosphere, with runes and nightflowers mirroring flawed beauty; sensory details are selective and POV-filtered. Setting constrains the ritual, charging the final dawn image. However, some details like blooming scents feel ornamental rather than pressuring choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of ending the forever war escalates through ritual pressure, deepening with spirit muster and personal sacrifice; under textural lens, cadence shifts reweight cost legibly in the chest pull. Agency in gentle invocation forecloses her vitality with visible price. Coincidence of celestial alignment complicates but doesn't resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of redemption's price emerges organically from ritual and sacrifice, resonating in the flawed peace without moralizing; final image offers non-literal repricing of harmony's cost. Subtext in ethereal spirits' regrets deepens complexity. Avoids tidy binaries, embracing ambiguity in lingering scars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual bias in Elara's gentle noticing; voice has distinct poetic texture, modulating with incantations. Some register drift into elevated diction like "languid waltz" feels slightly unmotivated under stress. No dialogue, so policy skips those bullets; elision is minimal and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose is evocative with varied rhythm and high density in ritual descriptions, advancing atmosphere; final line recharges motifs effectively. However, paraphrase loops like repeated "flawed beauty" and stacked metaphors in celestial descriptions create minor scaffold, dulling momentum without obscuring closure. Clarity remains strong, with clean mechanics.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of fantasy ritual with peace negotiation transforms war tropes through Elara's gentle method and essence sacrifice, feeling inevitable at the spirit endorsement. Emotional specificity in redemption's cost adds freshness. Some reliance on familiar ethereal ghosts hedges boldness.</comment>
