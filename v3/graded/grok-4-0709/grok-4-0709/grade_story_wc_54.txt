<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation as a curious intern drives her actions consistently, with stoic wonder embodied in her methodical repairs, but interiority relies on stock phrasing like "stoic determination" without deeper contradictory impulses in key moments. The final renunciation of decay feels earned through her choices, yet flaws like label-speak in emotional peaks slightly dilute specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Under a Causal lens, the structure anchors early and builds through motivated steps from discovery to repair, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost in her effort amid neglect; however, the closure's conceptual repricing of hope feels slightly summarized rather than fully dramatized in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport is vividly specific, with details like vines-choked light shafts constraining Elara's exploration and charging the revival; sensory hierarchy through her engineering POV integrates action, though minor repetition of decay ignores some causal evolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reigniting hope tightens meaningfully when she redirects flows, narrowing options with physical effort, but pressure remains low-stakes without a strong reversal or visible cost beyond implied determination; coincidence of finding the sextant complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of renewal from ruins emerges through images like sprouting seeds, offering resonant ambiguity in the final reconfiguration without moralizing, but explicit statements like "puzzled out new equations" border on thematic echo, reducing subtext depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with perceptual bias in Elara's engineering gaze, and prose texture modulates rhythmically; no dialogue, so policy skips those bullets, but minor register drift into elevated diction like "maze of intentions" feels unmotivated in peak beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose has rhythmic variety and density, but paraphrase loops like repeated "stoic wonder" and template cadence in descriptive runs (e.g., "She [action], her [trait]") dull momentum without payoff; overwriting in figurative strings obscures clarity in the revival beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of carnival aftermath with spaceport revival offers fresh ingenuity in repurposing debris, transforming tropes through Elara's creative fixes, but the premise echoes familiar post-apocalyptic hope narratives without bold risk-taking to heighten stakes.</comment>
