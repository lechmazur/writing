<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong motivation from erased past compels choices toward empathy, with contradictory impulses in tunnel doubts; interiority is embodied but slips into stock labels like "hollow shell"; final regret earns change with visible cost at the lake.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with because/therefore choices from clue to revelation; orientation anchors early with Alex and baseball; closure reconfigures via lake toss with regret's cost, though clue conveniences mildly soften inevitability.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Underground lake's bioluminescent glow constrains revelation and charges closure image, with purposeful sensory details; tunnel forks guide choices effectively, but initial settings remain somewhat generic without deeper POV filter.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of kindling empathy tightens through labyrinth choices under causal lens, with regret as felt cost; one meaningful deepening at the revelation forces stance crystallization, but pressures feel internally dominant without sharper external opposition.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of redemption through self-confrontation emerges organically from choices and baseball motif; final lake image offers resonant, non-literal repricing of empathy without moralizing; subtext in clues adds complexity, avoiding tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Consistent close third-person POV with perceptual bias toward deception; prose texture distinct in rhythmic descriptions, but syntactic repetition in "he" clauses under pressure dulls variety; no dialogue, so policy skips those bullets.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>High density in vivid phrases like "delicately robust," with propulsion through journey beats; however, paraphrase loops around "jaded wonder" and attribute repetition create minor scaffold drag without obscuring closure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Ingenious twist of self as time traveler transforms memory-wipe trope into fresh redemption arc; risk in unorthodox clue method heightens stakes organically, with synthesis feeling inevitable at the lake revelation.</comment>
