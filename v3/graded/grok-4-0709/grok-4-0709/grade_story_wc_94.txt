<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to map scars for poetic transcendence is clear and intensifies through internal contradictions like furious tranquility, embodied in his still exterior amid whirling rage; however, some interiority veers into abstract labels like "storm-kissed wonder" without deeper embodiment under pressure, slightly diluting the emotional progression at the climax where he refines verses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned storm imagery and reflective shards to a resonant reconfiguration in the final dawn-lit sealing of the poem, with conceptual cost of past scars reweighted as strength; orientation anchors early in the observatory, but the brief backstory shard at the bus shelter feels like a minor ellipsis without stronger causal tilt to the vigil's resumption.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The stormlit observatory above clouds is vividly specific, with lightning and thunder mirroring Elias's turmoil and constraining his vigil through amplified roars and flashes; this micro-setting charges the final image of dawn piercing clouds, elevating resonance, though some details like faded star charts remain static without direct tactical impact.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of understanding scars to rarefy poetry tightens through the envelope's discovery and map's revelation, deepening via a single textural cadence shift at the timer's beep that narrows options to poetic refinement; cost is felt in the reconfiguration of burdens to insights, but escalation relies on atmospheric coincidence rather than agency-driven pressure, slightly undercutting lens coherence at closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of transcending censorship through scar-mapping emerges organically from images like lightning-struck resilience, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer via the sealed poem's cycle; subtext in silences and storm metaphors adds complexity without confusion, though the mentor's message verges on explicit moralizing, mildly diluting ambiguity in the final reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable with perceptual bias toward poetic storm analogies, and rhythmic prose modulates with intensity, as in the furiously tranquil description; however, some elisions like the envelope's invisible hand feel untaught, and diction occasionally drifts into elevated register mismatched to Elias's censored frustration, evident in phrases like "ethereal dome."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose features high density with metaphors advancing atmosphere, like clouds boiling as an unquiet sea, but paraphrase loops appear in repetitive storm descriptions (e.g., lightning dancing, illuminating, flashing) that dull momentum without payoff; syntactic variety is present, yet figurative overload in peak beats like the map's revelation muddles clarity slightly, though propulsion holds through to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The premise of a censored poet rarefying verses via a scar map in a storm observatory offers fresh synthesis of censorship and natural fury, transforming tropes through specific details like the bus timetable delivery; risk in lyric compression heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry, though the cycle of hidden truths echoes familiar resistance narratives without bolder subversion.</comment>
