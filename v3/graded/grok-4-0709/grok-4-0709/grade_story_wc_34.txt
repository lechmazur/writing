<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist Elowen's motivation to articulate unspoken needs is clear and intensifies toward the encoding action, but interiority relies on poetic summaries rather than embodied contradictions, as in the humming melody that feels performative without conflicting impulses. Lira's late introduction provides a crucible for kinship, yet her dreamer traits are label-only without on-page micro-choices under pressure. Strengths lie in Elowen's ghostly flaws complicating his isolation, but the resolution accepts costs obliquely without dramatized endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned imagery of encoding and storm rhythms to a resonant reconfiguration in Elowen's materialization and song, with conceptual cost in the bridged realms. Orientation anchors early in the misty courtyard, and causality holds via motivated actions like pressing the plate. Closure lands on-page with a decisive change, but the thunder's arrival feels coincidental in resolving tension without protagonist-driven escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The misty courtyard above clouds is vividly sensory and purposeful, with weather pulsing anticipation and constraining the timeframe, directly pressuring Elowen's encoding as thunder inches closer. Details like glowing runes and floating arches integrate into action, mirroring internal wonder without overt symbolism. The setting evolves causally with the storm, charging the final image of humming echoes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of articulating unspoken needs tightens once through the storm's rhythm, deepening via the graffiti's hidden map under Accumulative/Textural pressure, forcing Elowen's persistence with felt cost in his spectral ache. Lira's intervention crystallizes stance, but coincidence in her emergence complicates without fully resolving, and stakes remain somewhat abstract until the plea reveal. One meaningful cadence shift suffices, yet lacks a sharper trade-off in the climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of unspoken needs for connection emerges organically through graffiti patterns and Elowen's plea, culminating in a resonant final image of shared wonder without stated morals, reweighting isolation via the promise of stories. Subtext in silence and implication, like vines looping pleas, invites reflection on freedom. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality, though complexity leans toward tidy kinship.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person POV is stable with perceptual bias in Elowen's driftingly alert gaze, and prose texture distinct in rhythmic, inventive syntax like "tinkersong wonder." Elision in storm timing is taught and paid off at closure without obscurity. Voice modulates with pressure, but some register drift into elevated diction, as in "spectral minstrel," feels unmotivated for the ethereal tone.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Prose has rhythmic variety and density in images like blooming graffiti, advancing atmosphere, but paraphrase loops appear in repeated "driftingly alert" and synonym churn around "unspoken needs," dulling momentum in the encoding beat. Metaphors are vivid yet occasionally mixed, as in "veins of glowing runes" clashing with digital code. Clarity holds, with no major artifacts touching closure, but scaffolding in descriptive stacks slows propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Originality shines in synthesizing ghost-in-code premise with graffiti encoding, transforming spectral haunting into digital artistry that feels inevitable, as in the flower press bolt plate's humming resonance. Risk-taking in lyric, accumulative structure heightens wonder without gimmickry. Fresh angle on connection avoids tropes through specific, bold details like binary roses.</comment>
