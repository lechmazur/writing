<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Alex's motivation to unearth his swallowed truth about his father drives consistent choices, intensifying from exploration to confrontation with ghosts, with embodied contradictions like skepticism cracking under visions; however, interiority relies on somewhat stock phrasing like "heart raced" without deeper idiosyncratic embodiment, and the final renunciation feels earned but lacks a sharper visible cost in the climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned reflections and radio calls toward a Conceptual Repricing closure where turning the valve wheel reweights Alex's truth with conceptual cost of forgiveness; orientation anchors early in the tunnel, but some causality feels elliptical, like the sudden ghost manifestation, though it pays off in the resonant ending image of dawn's light.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The abandoned train tunnel setting is vivid and purposeful, with dust, graffiti, and rusted tracks constraining Alex's movement and mirroring his internal decay; sensory details like crunching gravel and glinting beads integrate into action, charging the final image of water release, though occupational mill details remain somewhat generic without deeper constraint on choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of measuring swallowed truth escalates texturally through radio calls and visions, tightening to a meaningful deepening in the ghost encounter that narrows skepticism and forces stance crystallization; cost is felt in the burden's release, but coincidence of the hum and shapes materializing complicates without fully resolving, keeping pressure coherent yet not maximally agency-driven.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of confronting buried truths emerges organically from Alex's skepticism clashing with ghostly echoes of exploitation, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer via the valve turn washing away dust; subtext in radio metaphors deepens complexity without moralizing, though some overt symbolism like rosary beads borders on tidy, inviting reflection on forgiveness with authentic ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable, with perceptual bias in Alex's skeptical filtering of visions and radio; prose texture distinct in rhythmic, introspective syntax modulating with drowsiness, but occasional filter verbs like "he realized" dull immediacy in the climax, and no dialogue present avoids evaluation there.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose advances atmosphere with vivid images like "beads clicking like rosary prayers," but paraphrase loops (e.g., repeated "swallowed truth" variations) and template cadence in reflective blocks drag momentum; information density is functional yet overwritten in peak beats with mixed metaphors, obscuring clarity slightly at the ghost manifestation without fully harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes urban legends with personal confession in a fresh angle on skepticism via radio psychics, transforming ghost tropes through Alex's truth-seeking; risk in blending hallucination and reality heightens stakes organically, but echoes familiar explorer-haunting arcs without bolder subversion, feeling specific yet not wholly inevitable.</comment>
