<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The queen's motivation from disenchantment and dreams is clear and drives choices, but interiority relies on stock phrasing like "heart raced" without deeper embodiment; Lir's wary loyalty provides secondary pressure, yet their relationship lacks crucible-level tension in the climb. Emotions are somewhat contradictory during the ritual hesitation, but flaws feel summarized rather than complicating on-page micro-choices. The final resolve shows credible endurance with felt cost, earning credit under causal lens.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Structure follows causal linkages from departure to climb, ritual, and revelation, with orientation anchored early in the mountain kingdom; closure as conceptual repricing occurs on-page when Elara dips fingers into the pool, reweighting her disenchantment into resolve with the cost of forsaken peace legible. One meaningful tightening during the slip on the ledge narrows options, but some ellipsis in the descent feels unmotivated. Inferred lens: Causal, held consistently to ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details in the ember and cobalt grottos, like pulsing walls and crimson rivulets, are filtered through Elara's urgency and mirror her internal awe/dread; the environment constrains choices during the climb with slick outcrops and poisonous vines, charging the final pool image. Spatial choreography tracks coherently, but some details like bioluminescent vines feel ornamental without evolving causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of unraveling dreams escalates causally through the climb's perils and ritual temptations, with one meaningful tightening when Lir slips, forcing a trade-off in unity; agency in dipping fingers drives the revelation, but cost feels conceptual rather than viscerally felt at closure. Coincidence in fireflies complicates without resolving; under causal lens, pressure coheres but lacks a second deepening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Theme of truth amid betrayal emerges from dreams and starlight visions without direct statement, but subtext in temptations feels overt; the final image of descending with resolve offers resonant reconfiguration, reweighting disenchantment, yet invites limited reflection due to tidy moral ambiguity. Emotional aftereffect is concrete but borders on sentimentality in the reckoning promise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable with perceptual bias toward Elara's commanding resolve, but voice texture is overly poetic with repetitive syntax like "softly commanding" echoes; dialogue is natural and subtextual, advancing plot in moments like "Steady, we are bound," distinguishing characters subtly. No head-hopping, but some elision in visions feels untaught.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Prose has rhythmic variety but suffers from paraphrase loops, like repeated "disenchantment" and "lacy menace" without propulsion, and mixed metaphors like "malevolent sprites" clashing with "luminous crimson"; information density is low in reflective blocks exceeding BRR allowance, stalling momentum at the ember grotto pause. Clarity is maintained, but overwriting in peak beats like the ritual obscures escalation; no major grammar issues.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Bleeding starlight and grotto ritual offer fresh synthesis on familiar quest tropes, transformed through Elara's specific disenchantment; the revelation turn feels earned from dreams, heightening stakes without gimmickry. Emotional complexity in temptation avoids generics, but premise echoes standard fantasy betrayal without bold risk-taking.</comment>
