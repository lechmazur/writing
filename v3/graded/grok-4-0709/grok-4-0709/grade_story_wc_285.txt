<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to distill the palimpsest promise is clear and rooted in lineage, intensifying through patient reflection to a serene acceptance, with embodied calm in the final boarding; interiority is concrete via needle-pricking and perceptual details, showing contradictory impulses between family greed and core protection without stock epiphanies. However, flaws like avarice and vengeance are summarized rather than dramatized in contradictory scene actions, limiting depth. No second character, so relationship bullets ignored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, textural density builds via fog, rain, and river cues to a Conceptual Repricing where the promise reweights from possession to protection with conceptual cost of unburdened heart; orientation anchors early in the fog-bound dock. However, causality is loose with minimal beats advancing knowledge, relying on passive percolation without a tightening turn; closure feels earned but lacks a persistent constraint shaping tactics beyond waiting.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting vividly anchors in the fog-bound river crossing with sensory details like mist, rain pattering, and damp earth, filtered through Elias's attentive POV; environment constrains choice by tying revelation to ambient cues and charges the final image as fog lifts, revealing the ferry. Details evolve causally with rain slowing, mirroring internal clarity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of unraveling the lineage mystery signals early but escalates minimally under Textural lens via one cadence shift as rain stops, reweighting with conceptual cost; pressure is coherent but static, with no meaningful tightening or reversal narrowing options. Agency is endurance through awareness, foreclosing greed but without visible trade-off dramatized.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of distilling layered promises to essential protection emerges organically from parchment layers and ambient percolation, inviting reflection on betrayal versus loyalty without tidy morals; final image offers resonant, non-literal answer by Elias carrying the unweighted promise forward. Subtext in needle-pricking and fog echoes implies overwritten oaths, but some abstraction like "fundamental essence" borders on statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in subtle environmental absorption and no head-hopping; voice texture is distinct in rhythmic, atmospheric diction like "spindrift serenity," modulating with calm intensity. No dialogue present, so ignored; purposeful compression in reflective mode is taught early and pays off at closure without obscurity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere through vivid images like needle glinting and rain ticking, varying rhythm naturally; however, some overwriting in stacked metaphors (e.g., shroud, spindrift, sediment) muddles in mid-beats without harming closure clarity. No major loops or artifacts, but occasional template cadence in descriptive runs slightly drags momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of palimpsest as overwritten vow with yarn needle revelation offers fresh angle on ancestral mystery, transformed through textural serenity and ambient solving; risk in passive, reflective structure heightens introspective stakes organically. However, premise echoes familiar haunted-lineage tropes without bolder subversion.</comment>
