<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to learn the language of buildings is clear and intensifies compellingly toward the rooftop interrogation, with interiority rooted in curiosity and doubt; Mira's traits as a tutor feel consistent but slightly archetypal, lacking deeper contradictory impulses in scene. The relationship serves as a crucible, forcing Elias's insistent questions that alter their bond by the end. Emotions are embodied through actions like tracing the seal, revealing values with felt cost in the revelation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Under the Causal lens, the plot progresses through because/therefore linkages from the contrived borrowing to tea sessions and the rooftop confession, with orientation anchored early in the crumbling city and apartment. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing when Elias presses the seal and understands the language as believed stories, with conceptual cost in reweighting his motivation. One meaningful tightening occurs in the interrogation, narrowing options and changing knowledge effectively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The rooftop garden during the meteor shower is vividly specific, with vines clinging like possessive lovers and the building humming, constraining choices by amplifying the mysterious tone and charging the final seal-pressing image. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, reflecting Elias's urgency, while the crumbling city mirrors internal curiosity. Atmosphere supports the theme without overt symbolism, evolving causally with the meteor streaks.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of deciphering the buildings' language escalates causally through sessions to interrogation, with one meaningful tightening in Elias's insistent questions forcing Mira's confession and reweighting options. Agency drives the climax via his decision to press the seal, with legible conceptual cost in accepting truth from lies. Pressure coheres but feels somewhat abstract until the rooftop, lacking a sharper internal-external interweave.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of truth emerging from agreed upon lies develops organically through sessions and stories, culminating in a resonant final image where the language is repriced as believed narratives without stated moral. Subtext in gestures like Mira's evasive smiles and the seal's glow invites reflection on familiarity. Emotional aftereffect arises from the bond sealed in possibility, embracing complexity without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable, with perceptual signature biased toward Elias's curiosity, like feeling the seal resonate; voice has poetic texture but occasional register drift in phrases like "patiently nimble." Dialogue is natural and subtextual, advancing plot through evasion and confession, with distinct idioms. Elision in backstory is taught and paid off in the rooftop revelation without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose has rhythmic variety and density, with sentences advancing atmosphere like the building's groans, but paraphrase loops appear in repeated "mysterious familiarity" and template cadence in session descriptions dull momentum slightly. Figurative language like "eyes like forgotten scrolls" is purposeful but muddles in peak beats without payoff. Clarity is maintained at closure, with strong verbs and concise integration overall.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The premise of decoding buildings via dead languages and lies offers fresh synthesis, transformed through specific choices like the seal's incantation and rooftop whispers, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk in blending fact and fiction heightens stakes organically without gimmickry. Avoids tropes by grounding in emotional complexity, with the tone of mysterious familiarity providing a non-obvious angle.</comment>
