<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lirah's motivation to graft into the community is clear and intensifies through her bold sympathy, shown in offering reed talismans and comforting searchers, leading to earned endurance with the cost of resurfaced aches. Interiority is concrete in her isolation's "luminescent ache," but emotions lean toward abstract labels rather than contradictory embodiment under stress. The final choice to sculpt the arbor reveals her values with visible integration cost, though secondary characters apply pressure only generically.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through layered discoveries and shared rituals, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where the tag's mandala and arbor reweight kinship with conceptual cost of transformed ache. Orientation anchors early in the crystalline orchard and crater, with no disorientation debt. Causality holds via pattern of accumulating tags mending bonds, though some ellipsis feels convenient; the closure lands on-page with felt belonging as price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The crystalline orchard and shimmering crater are vividly anchored early, with sensory details like quartz fruits and misty depths filtering through Lirah's sculptor's eye, constraining choices during perilous searches. Environment evolves causally, mirroring internal ache in hues of blue and gold, and charges the final arbor image at the heart. Micro-setting of crystal boughs and glow-veins pressures actions without anachronisms.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of grafting into community tightens through accumulative search deepenings, like tag fragments reuniting kin, forcing stance crystallization with felt cost of resurfaced memories. One meaningful cadence shift narrows options as they piece the mandala, driven by Lirah's agency without coincidence resolving. Pressure coheres under textural lens but remains somewhat abstract, lacking visceral trade-offs in peak moments.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of weaving kinship emerges organically from shared searches and reed markers, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in the luminescent ache's transformation to strength. Subtext operates in gestures and dances, culminating in a resonant final image of the arbor reweighting isolation without stated epiphany. Emotional aftereffect lingers through complexity, though some direct statements like "bold sympathy the light" border on assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and modest, with perceptual signature in Lirah's reed-weaving bias and rhythmic prose modulating with emotional intensity. Voice texture is distinct in poetic syntax, teaching patterned elision of words into gestures early, paying off at closure. No dialogue present, so no evaluation there; minor register drift into elevated diction under pressure slightly muddles immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Prose advances atmosphere through vivid images like "fruits of quartz and amethyst dangled like forgotten stars," with varying rhythm, but repetitive phrasing (e.g., "luminescent ache" in multiple paragraphs) creates paraphrase loops dulling momentum. Information density is high in descriptive beats, yet overwriting with stacked metaphors in the search sequence obscures propulsion without payoff. Clarity holds with clean grammar, though template cadence in "as they searched" openings triggers minor artifact debt.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Originality shines in synthesizing silent world with crystal orchard and reed sculptures, transforming journey trope through specific kinship webs and tag search, feeling inevitable at the mandala revelation. Bold risk in textural, wordless communication heightens stakes without gimmickry. Core premise offers fresh angle on belonging, though archetypal outsider integration echoes familiar arcs without full subversion.</comment>
