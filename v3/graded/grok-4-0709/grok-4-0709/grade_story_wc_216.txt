<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to grasp time's texture is clear and intensifies through her discoveries, rooted in her role as timekeeper with hourglass tattoos and waning borrowed time. Interiority is concrete via sensory details like feeling time's pulse, though some emotions feel performed rather than contradictory. The final endurance earns a meaningful change by confronting her flaws, with visible cost in her urgency before the capsule mends.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through layered discoveries with pattern breaks like the timeless bubble, leading to a Conceptual Repricing closure where understanding reweights time's premise with conceptual cost of past tampering. Orientation anchors early in the silo's shadow, avoiding penalties. One meaningful deepening suffices, but causality feels elliptical in visions without stronger linkage to tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The emerald silo setting is vivid and purposeful, constraining choices like climbing the ladder and sifting relics, with sensory details like aged metal scent mirroring Elara's quest. It charges the final image as an eternal beacon, evolving consistently. Micro-details like the urn fragment function as setting to heighten atmosphere without overbreadth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of unraveling time's mysteries tightens once through the timeless state, deepening knowledge under textural lens, but escalation feels static with abstract visions rather than narrowing options. Cost is felt in waning time, yet coincidence of discoveries complicates without resolving. One meaningful shift is present, but lacks a sharper trade-off at peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of time's elusive nature emerges through images like swirling ashes and borrowed moments, inviting reflection on loss without tidy morals. Subtext in flyers and urn implies hidden knowledge, earning resonance via the final non-literal answer of feeling time's texture. However, some overt statements like "rediscovered the essence" border on assertion over implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with perceptual bias in time's "slippery weave," and prose texture uses rhythmic, patterned diction like "borrowed-time" that teaches its lyric mode early. No dialogue, so policy skips those bullets; elision in visions pays off at closure. Minor register drift into abstract phrasing under pressure slightly muddles immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Prose has rhythmic variety and density, advancing atmosphere through images like "gritty drag of hours," but paraphrase loops appear in descriptions of time's flow, and stacked metaphors like "rough silk of seconds" create minor muddle without payoff. Clarity is strong, with no major artifacts touching closure, but some redundancy dulls momentum in relic sifting. Information density is high in visions, supporting propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of warped time with garage sale codes transforms tropes like time capsules into a non-obvious quest, feeling inevitable via the urn's pulse. Risk in surreal elements heightens stakes organically without gimmickry. Core premise offers ingenuity in embedding messages, though echoes familiar sci-fi shifts slightly hedge boldness.</comment>
