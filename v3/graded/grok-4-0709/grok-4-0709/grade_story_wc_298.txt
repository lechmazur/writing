<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara's reckless idealism and fiercely gentle nature are consistently shown through her actions, like offering compassion to the Keeper, but much interiority relies on stock labels like "dusky resolve" without embodied contradiction in key moments. The final trade reveals a hierarchy of values with felt cost, earning credit for micro-choices under pressure. However, flaws feel summarized rather than complicating choices simultaneously in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the story builds through patterned imagery and symbolic elision to a Resonant Reconfiguration at the trade, with legible cost as Elara inherits torment. Orientation anchors early in the catacomb orchard, avoiding penalties. Closure lands on-page with a felt cost that reweights her resolve, though some causal links feel elliptical rather than motivated.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard is vividly specific, with roots snaking between bones constraining Elara's path and charging the final energy surge, meeting the 9+ test by shaping the closure image. Sensory details like damp earth and fungal glow are purposeful, filtered through her idealism. Environmental evolution during the trade heightens atmosphere without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, pressure deepens through symbolic density to the trade, narrowing options with a visible cost of inherited torment, sufficient for this length. The dominant stake of patching her brother's soul tightens meaningfully at the Keeper's bargain. However, escalation feels more textural than agency-driven, with coincidence in the orchard's response complicating but not resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of bartered destinies emerges organically through Elara's trade and the card's symbolism, offering a resonant non-literal answer in the final image of enduring purpose. Subtext in her compassion toward the Keeper adds complexity without tidy morals. Yet, some direct statements like "weave wholeness where despair had torn through" border on thematic echo, slightly reducing resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Single POV remains stable with a distinct poetic texture in syntax and rhythm, modulating with pressure like shortened sentences during the trade. Dialogue is natural and subtextual, advancing the barter without exposition. However, occasional register drift into elevated diction, such as "inlaying meaning everywhere," feels slightly unmotivated for her voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose has high density with vivid metaphors like roots as veins, but paraphrase loops (e.g., repeated "dusky resolve" and "half-lit corridors") and mixed metaphors in peak beats dull propulsion, triggering a -0.6 artifact penalty. Rhythm varies, but template cadence in descriptive runs slows momentum without payoff. Clarity remains, avoiding major causality breaks.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard with bartered destinies offers a fresh synthesis of fantasy and symbolism, transforming fate-bargaining tropes through specific details like the burned card. Risk in lyric compression heightens stakes without gimmickry, adding +0.3. However, the premise echoes familiar mythic bargains without fully non-obvious moral calculus.</comment>
