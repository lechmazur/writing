<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The keeper's motivation to witness change without judgment is clear and consistent, driving his ritual journey, but interiority lacks embodied contradictions or micro-choices under pressure, remaining abstract and serene. Emotions are not contradictory or degraded under stress, with no visible flaws complicating choices. The final renunciation of deeper involvement feels unearned without prior causality showing cost, as in the observation of the civilization's discovery, which passes without internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned motifs like the origami swan and seasonal drifts, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration in Earned Stasis at the end, with conceptual cost of eternal impartiality felt in the final line. Orientation anchors early in the library, but the portal transition creates minor disorientation without payoff. Closure lands on-page with the return and ritual reinforcement, though causality feels loose without a decisive tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The overgrown library and obsidian refuge are vividly detailed with purposeful sensory elements, like vines and river reflections, mirroring the keeper's crumbling peace and constraining his journey via the portal. The refuge's walls gripping reality loosely charge the final image of return, evolving causally from decay to regeneration. Tone supports the meditative concept without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake of impartial observation is signaled early but remains abstract, with minimal escalation under the textural lens; the venture forth offers one deepening via the portal, but no meaningful reversal or cost narrows options. Pressure feels static, lacking a visible price in the climax of witnessing the civilization's shift. Coincidence in the swan's echo complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of impartial witnessing emerges organically from motifs like the origami swan and regenerative silence, culminating in a resonant final image that reweights the keeper's purpose without moralizing. Subtext in crumbling peace invites reflection on change's cost, avoiding tidy resolutions. The civilization discovery offers earned irony, deepening complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person POV is stable and apt, with a distinct poetic texture in syntax and rhythm that modulates with the journey's hush, teaching patterned elision early. Perceptual signature biases toward faded, shimmering observations, consistent under stress. No dialogue present, so not evaluated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Prose has high density and rhythmic variety, advancing atmosphere through vivid images like "vines twisted through cracked stone shelves," but paraphrase loops (e.g., repeated "drift of untold seasons") and template cadence in descriptive runs dull momentum without payoff. Figurative language muddles in peak beats, like the portal's "burrow through layers," with minor register drift into abstract diction. Clarity holds at closure, but artifacts obscure propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The premise of an eternal keeper using an origami swan portal synthesizes fantastical elements freshly, transforming guardian tropes through textural observation without judgment. Risk in meditative structure heightens thematic stakes organically, feeling inevitable in the return ritual. No close echoes of famous scenes, with authenticity in the singular vision.</comment>
