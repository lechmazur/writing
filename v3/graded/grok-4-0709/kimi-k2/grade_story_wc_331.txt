<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mireille's motivation to seek dormant stories is clear and intensifies through her actions, rooted in her sanely eccentric traits that enable her navigation; interiority is concrete via embodied perceptions like the scarf's tug, with emotions contradictory in her provisional belief. The final endurance forecloses nothing dramatically but accepts the cost of heavier voices with visible weight on the scarf. No second character limits relationship crucibles, but single-POV interior contradiction shines in her cartographer-like skepticism.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through patterned imagery and cadence shifts like flickering lights and bending aisles, leading to a Conceptual Repricing closure where stories' location is reweighted with undeniable density cost in the air. Orientation anchors early in the library at 3:17 a.m. with Mireille; one meaningful deepening via the book's opening reconfigures knowledge without causality breaks. Closure lands on-page with felt cost, but lacks a persistent constraint shaping tactics beyond the scarf.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The scientific poetry library setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like hot toner and cold starlight filtered through Mireille's bias; hyperbolic geometry constrains her path and charges the final straightening of aisles. Environment evolves causally, mirroring her quest, and a recurring object like the scarf integrates into action. Micro-setting of shelves and books pressures choices, anchoring tone without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of finding stories' abode signals early and deepens once via the book's activation, narrowing options under textural pressure; agency in opening it leads to reconfiguration with legible cost in the library's inhale and denser air. No multiple reversals needed, but escalation feels more atmospheric than tightening, with coincidence in flickering complicating without resolving. Under Accumulative lens, cadence shift reweights stake effectively, though cost is conceptual more than visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of stories living in reader-read intervals emerges organically from images like humming books and reawakened narratives, inviting reflection on analog memory without tidy morals; final image offers resonant, non-literal answer by repricing solitude as a door. Subtext in scarf's guidance and patrons' reactions enriches complexity. Emotional aftereffect lingers through sepia light shift, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in Mireille's creak-avoiding gait and selective noticing of equations; prose texture distinct in rhythmic, poetic syntax that modulates with intensity, teaching patterned elision early. No dialogue, so policy skips those bullets; purposeful compression pays off at closure without head-hopping. Diction fits her eccentric voice, with rhythmic control heightening the surreal bends.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere through vivid images like Möbius drool without loops or scaffold; syntactic variety supports rhythm, varying sentence lengths naturally. Figurative language is controlled, not muddled in peaks, with strong verbs and specifics like "oxidized copper." Minor overwriting in stacked metaphors at the center slightly dulls propulsion, but closure image is sharp and propulsive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of scientific poetry and hyperbolic geometry transforms library trope into a non-obvious quest for stories' abode, feeling inevitable via scarf's evolution; risk in surreal bends heightens stakes organically without gimmickry. Emotional specificity in observed solitude avoids generics, with bold commitment to premise. Core premise offers memorable angle on memory and narrative.</comment>
