<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and intensifies from her diagnosis to fostering interspecies respect, with embodied calm amid weakening body; interiority is concrete, showing contradictory impulses in her brazen acceptance versus physical decline. The final renunciation of life is earned through accumulated choices, foreclosing paths with felt cost in her synchronized heartbeat and last breath. No stock phrasing; her flaws, like limited time, complicate and drive her systematic work.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, with density building through secrets and remodels to a Resonant Reconfiguration in the final image of moonflowers opening at her death, reweighting the stake with conceptual cost of her pulse ending while the temple grows. Orientation anchors early in the temple orchard; causality holds via patterned discoveries without breaks. The closure lands on-page with undeniable pressure, shaped by persistent time constraint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The temple orchard is vivid and purposeful, with living pillars constraining Mara's choices and supplying resources like the mineral spring that integrates her ashes; sensory details filter through her POV, evolving causally to charge the final image of growing pillars. Micro-setting of branches and wires mirrors her internal calm, guiding action without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of renewing the living contract tightens accumulatively through three secrets, deepening options with agency in her remodels; cost is legible in her weakening body and foreclosed life, forcing stance crystallization without coincidence resolving. One meaningful deepening suffices, but the persistent six-month clock narrows tactics effectively.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of interspecies respect emerges organically from events like grafts and wires, culminating in a resonant final image that reweights the premise without moralizing; subtext in images like synchronized sap and moonflowers invites reflection on transmitted legacy. Her diary entry offers a non-literal answer to the central question of renewal, embracing complexity with emotional honesty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable and apt, with distinct perceptual signature in systematic, prayer-like observations; prose texture is lyrical yet controlled, modulating rhythm under pressure without elision or head-hopping. No dialogue, but narrative voice reflects Mara's calm mind-state consistently.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied rhythm and high information density in lines like "roots had followed hidden channels, knitting calcium into load-bearing ribs"; zero loops or artifacts, clarity in syntax supports accumulative build to closure without overwriting. Final line resolves by recharging motifs like growth and song.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of dying with living architecture feels inevitable, transforming tropes through specific details like copper-wired seismograph and whale-song trunk; risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, committing to premise of interspecies treaty.</comment>
