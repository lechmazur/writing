<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lila's motivation is clear and rooted in her orderly intuitive trait, compelling her to reorganize the city with embodied emotion shown through her use of the stone chip; internal conflict emerges in her hopeful desperation, earning the final defiant stance; Tomasso applies relevant pressure as a secondary character, though his dialogue borders on expository.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Solid causal structure under the inferred Causal lens, with because/therefore linkages from Lila's arrival to the maze's reconfiguration; closure lands as an Earned Stasis with felt cost of ongoing corporate threat, visible in the buyers' confusion; orientation anchors early in the raft city off Naples, though the abrupt cutoff slightly muddles the final beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid, purposeful sensory details of the perpetual carnival afloat integrate with action, constraining Lila's choices via murals and structures; the setting evolves causally, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism; the raft city charges the final image, with the Whale's ribs from the basilica reweighting memory's cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of resisting privatization escalates through coherent pressure, tightening via the night painting that narrows options under the Causal lens; one meaningful deepening forces stance crystallization with visible cost in the defiant brass; agency drives the maze's turn, though coincidence in surveyor confusion slightly complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of dual allegiance emerges organically from events and images like the stone chip, inviting reflection on memory versus corporatization; subtext in graffiti and mirrors builds resonant ambiguity without confusion; the final image offers a non-literal answer, reweighting the premise with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature filters the carnival through Lila's wary grace, with rhythmic prose modulating under pressure; POV is stable and modest, avoiding unwarranted certainty; dialogue pursues goals with subtext, as in Tomasso's knife metaphor, distinguishing voices effectively.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density advances story without loops or scaffold, as in the seamless integration of painting spirals; rhythmic variety supports propulsion, with strong verbs and specific nouns; minor figurative density in peak beats is pattern-taught and pays off, avoiding muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of drowned Naples with a floating carnival transforms tropes through specific details like the stone chip compass; risk-taking in the maze reconfiguration heightens stakes organically; fresh angle on gentrification feels inevitable in hindsight without gimmickry.</comment>
