<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to understand living houses is clear and intensifies through ritual actions, culminating in an earned transformation from noticer to listener with the felt cost of leaving the shard behind. Interiority is concrete and particular, embodied in sensory perceptions like the shard warming in her palm, revealing contradictory impulses between curiosity and the hush's inadvertent profundity. The widow's brief interaction applies secondary pressure, forcing a shared ceremony that alters the house's state. The handwriting on the note provides a pivotal moment of self-recognition that charges the character's hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned rituals of sanctification, leading to a Conceptual Repricing closure where the bay's stillness reweights absence as life's echo, with the conceptual cost of transformed perception legible in the final image of resuming tide and hushed houses. Orientation anchors who (noticer), where (quiet bay), and when (spring) by the first sentence, serving the accumulative pattern without disorientation. One meaningful cadence shift occurs at the end, sufficient for length, as houses exhale in unison, foreclosing her old role with undeniable pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The quiet bay in spring is vividly specific, with sensory details like salt air threaded with violet dust and lilacs smelling of sugar and thunder, filtered through the noticer's perceptual bias. Setting constrains choices, as the pier and cottages supply displaced objects that drive the ritual, charging the final image of glowing houses like paper lanterns. Micro-setting elements, like the orris root shard, evolve causally and mirror internal hush, enhancing thematic resonance without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, the dominant stake of sanctifying displaced objects to quiet the bay escalates through density increase in rituals, culminating in a cadence shift that reweights the stake with the cost of her transformation and the bay's stillness. One meaningful deepening suffices, as sanctifying the compass pauses the tide, forcing stance crystallization with visible price in the hushed blaze. Pressure coheres without coincidence resolving it, and the moral calculus between grief and haunting sharpens the widow's nod.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of houses as living echoes of absence emerges organically from rituals and images like the orris root absorbing sounds, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in futures remembered. Subtext in silences and implications, such as the note in her handwriting, invites reflection on loss without confusion. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer, repricing life as absence's echo, elicited through concrete particulars like the shard's fading scent.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in selective, hush-focused noticing like floorboards sighing, and rhythmic control in poetic syntax that modulates with emotional intensity. Patterned elision in lyric mode is taught early and pays off at closure, with diction like "hushed blaze" fitting the focalizer's lexicon. No dialogue present, so policy skips those bullets; no head-hopping or unwarranted certainty.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, each sentence advancing atmosphere and theme through vivid images like streetlights daydreaming, without loops or scaffold; syntactic variety creates natural rhythm, as in the varying lengths during rituals. No figurative muddle, with metaphors coherent and purposeful, like houses glowing like paper lanterns charging the closure. Zero artifacts in peak beats, propulsion strong in the final walk away.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The premise of a noticer sanctifying displaced objects to hush living houses offers fresh synthesis, transforming familiar haunted-house tropes through specific, poetic details like orris root and inadvertently profound shards. Risk-taking in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in the handwriting note's reveal. Emotional specificity in absences as echoes avoids generics, committing fully to the vision.</comment>
