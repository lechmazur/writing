<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to erase her bloodline intensifies compellingly into a contradictory impulse to reclaim it, embodied in her handling of the crank and final choice to speak her name, earning the renunciation with visible cost of shifting from ender to beginning; interiority is concrete and particular through tactile vibrations and pulses, avoiding stock phrasing; the single-POV focus reveals hierarchy of values in micro-choices like keeping the crank turning despite the revelation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned images of shadows and waves to a resonant reconfiguration where Lira plants the handle as a seed, reweighting her role with conceptual cost of dynasty's silent end; orientation anchors who (Lira), where (sepia reading room), and when (first yawn of evening) by the opening sentence; closure lands on-page with the whispered name and sigh, though the transition to the river feels like a minor shard extension without full causal ellipsis.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The sepia reading room's dust, lamplight, and golden shadows vividly anchor and evolve, constraining Lira's choices by pooling like cognac and thickening to witness her decision; sensory details like cedar and iron tastes integrate into action, mirroring internal sorrow; the recurring shadows charge the final image, transforming from past to dawn, satisfying the 9+ test by constraining the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of ending the dynasty tightens through the gramophone's revelation, deepening to force Lira's stance crystallization under Accumulative/Textural lens, with felt cost in renouncing her trained role; one meaningful cadence shift narrows options from erasure to reclamation; pressure coheres but coincidence of the hidden truth complicates without fully resolving, keeping agency in her final act.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of uncovering truth as deciding its weight emerges organically from images like the vibrating strand braiding past and future, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in Lira's shift from ender to beginning; subtext in silences and waves invites reflection on inheritance; the final image of planting the handle offers a resonant, non-literal answer to dynasty's betrayal, reweighting the premise without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and biased through Lira's perceptual signature of tactile intuitions and shimmering waves, with rhythmic prose modulating like the standing wave under pressure; no dialogue present, so policy skips those bullets; patterned diction in metaphors like "yawn of evening" is taught early and pays off at closure, satisfying the 9+ test with distinct texture and no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose density is high with multi-job sentences like the opening's atmospheric pooling, propulsion through ratchet gears to final sigh; figurative language coheres without muddle, varying rhythm naturally; minor scaffold in repeated "golden shadows" serves pattern without looping, and no artifacts obscure closure, though some metaphors like "spilled cognac" border on ornate.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The premise of a gramophone revealing ancestral memory via standing waves offers fresh synthesis of sound and intuition, transforming dynasty-ender trope through Lira's self-revelation and bold risk in conceptual repricing; originality in the crank as scepter heightens stakes organically; it feels inevitable in hindsight, with no close echoes of famous scenes.</comment>
