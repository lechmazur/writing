<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Calen's motivation from the forgotten vow intensifies compellingly to drive his merging with the puppet, with embodied emotions like "trembling with shivering bliss" revealing contradictory impulses under pressure; interiority is concrete and particular, avoiding stock phrasing, though the single-POV limits relationship crucibles.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned imagery and cadence shifts to a Resonant Reconfiguration in the merging and threshold-crossing, with felt cost in the grafting to sinew; orientation anchors early with the iron arch and violet glow; closure lands on-page with the vow echoing in newborn sky, though ellipsis in memory flood feels slightly unmotivated.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The alchemical greenhouse is vividly specific with phosphor-apples and silver sap that constrain choices, directly charging the final image as it folds like a paper lantern; sensory details like cedar and lavender integrate into action, mirroring internal regret without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of capturing possibility tightens through the puppet's stirring and sap-braiding, deepening via memory flood to force the merging with visible cost in grafted cords; under Textural lens, pattern break in the tilting orchard reweights options effectively, though coincidence of appearing doors complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of re-stitching reality through performed regret emerges organically from gestures and motifs like the scroll's patterns, culminating in a resonant final image of the vow dancing without stated moral; subtext in the puppet's mirror-face invites reflection on lost courage with purposeful ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Consistent third-person close POV with distinct perceptual signature in poetic, image-dense texture; rhythmic control heightens pressure in beats like the cords whipping inward, with purposeful compression taught early and paid off at closure; no dialogue, so policy skips those bullets.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied rhythm, like "petals of light peeling" advancing atmosphere without loops; some figurative stacking in peak beats, such as sap braiding into cords, borders on muddle but pays off in closure without obscuring; high information density and clean mechanics support momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of knightly vows with alchemical puppetry transforms tropes through specific details like runic roots and violet seed, feeling inevitable in the merging; risk-taking in surreal compression heightens stakes without gimmickry, as in the greenhouse hatching a new time axis.</comment>
