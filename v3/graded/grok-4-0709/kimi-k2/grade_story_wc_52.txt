<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and intensifies compellingly from fear of releasing the roar to accepting absence, with embodied emotions like pressing dimples as micro-choices revealing values; interior contradiction shines in her reluctance versus the loft's insistence, earning the final renunciation of grief's hold with felt cost in the portable weight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through patterned images and emotional density to a Conceptual Repricing closure where love is compressed into portability, with legible cost in absorbed memory; orientation anchors early in the loft, but minor ellipsis in the carving process slightly softens causality without breaking the resonant final image of sun-ignited hollows.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The rain-beaded skylight loft is vividly specific, with sensory details like wet canvas smell and sliding raindrops mirroring internal states; it constrains choices by providing light for the carving and pressures the timeframe, charging the final image as the loft exhales and brightens, making the micro-setting indispensable.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of harvesting grief escalates texturally through deepening density of presses and absences, tightening to a cadence shift in the whistle's urgency; one meaningful deepening forecloses inaction with felt cost in compressed loss, though coincidence of sunlight at closure complicates without resolving, fitting the lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of love as compressed absence emerges organically from carving images and motifs like lion spaces, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer that reweights grief as nourishing; subtext in gestures like thumb presses invites reflection on forgiveness without sentimentality, with ambiguity in "stay wild" embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in grief-filtered details like fingerprint ghosts; prose texture in rhythmic syntax and purposeful compression teaches patterned elision, paying off at closure; no dialogue, so policy skips those bullets, but voice modulates effectively under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied rhythm, zero loops or scaffolds, and metaphors like rain as applause cohering without muddle; high information density advances atmosphere in every line, as in the kettle's rumble building momentum to the scream, with flawless clarity at peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of grief as sculptural compression transforms widow trope through specific ash wood and lion motifs, feeling inevitable in the thumb-press method; risk in lyric accumulation heightens emotional stakes without gimmickry, though premise echoes familiar elegies slightly.</comment>
