<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to restore through unraveling is clear and intensifies compellingly, rooted in her traits as a restorer absorbing grief, with embodied emotions shown in her fingertips feeling memories. Interior conflict emerges in her unflinching guidance of the spirit, revealing contradictory impulses of burden and duty. The meaningful endurance earns closure by foreclosing isolation with felt cost, as her mask gleams whole but anticipates new silences. Strength in micro-choices like whispering the secret, which reveals her value hierarchy with visible emotional price.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through patterned knot-unraveling beats that deepen grief's release, with orientation anchored early in the sanctuary under starlight. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration via spirits' ascent and Lira's lightened weight, with felt cost in her ongoing promise to return, reweighting the stake of accumulated silence. Persistent constraint of the net's knots shapes tactics, paying off in the final image of the coiled net as gentle loops. No orientation debt; lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary's crystal walls and starlight refraction vividly anchor atmosphere, with sensory details like salt crust biting palms filtered through Lira's urgency. Setting constrains choices, as faceted ceiling refracts grief into specters that pressure the unraveling. Micro-setting of the net and altar charges the final image, evolving causally as knots open to lacework. Strength in purposeful integration mirroring internal hush dissolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of exhuming names to release spirits signals early and deepens through knot-unraveling, narrowing options as memories rise and hush quivers. Under Accumulative/Textural lens, escalation via density increase in released silences forces stance crystallization, with visible cost in Lira's absorbed weight lightening yet persisting. Agency in guiding the spirit's fingers drives intensification, earning the resolution without coincidence. Peak moment of pricking the silence cloud reweights stakes with undeniable pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of freeing bound grief emerges organically from unraveling knots and exhuming names, with subtext in gestures like the fisherman's hooked eyes and Lira's needle as baton. Final image of spirits drifting upward offers resonant, non-literal answer to silence's weight, reweighting restoration's cost without moralizing. Emotional aftereffect lingers through ambiguity of Lira's whole yet anticipatory mask. Strength in complexity avoiding tidy binaries, tied to core concept of interlaced hush.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable, with perceptual signature in Lira's bias toward silences and grief, modulating rhythm under pressure like deepening hush. Prose texture distinct in poetic syntax and rhythm, teaching patterned elision early for lyric effect paid off at closure. Dialogue natural and subtextual, as in the fisherman's named release advancing the unhushing. No head-hopping; purposeful compression heightens emotional beats without obscurity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose propels with high density and varied rhythm, as in knot-sighing sentences accelerating release; no loops or scaffold, though some metaphors stack densely without muddle. Clarity strong, with concrete images like bead of silence vanishing advancing atmosphere. Final line resolves by recharging mask motif effectively. Minor overwriting in peak beats like cloud unraveling, but propulsion holds without clarity loss.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mask restoration as literal grief-unraveling feels inevitable, transforming tropes like haunted sanctuary through specific needle-threaded moonlight and net-knots as vows. Risk-taking in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, as in collaborative unraveling with spirit. Authenticity coheres in singular vision of silence as accumulative force. Bold commitment to premise's implications elevates ingenuity.</comment>
