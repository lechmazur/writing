<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lys's motivation as a chaste courtesan defying conformity is clear and intensifies through her deliberate actions, with embodied reverence in trembling fingers revealing internal conflict; the final absorption of the prism earns her endurance with felt cost in remembering for others.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds density through echoing voices and unraveling threads, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where the prism's absorption reweights stakes with conceptual cost; orientation anchors early in the silver courtyard under snow, and the closure's light collapse charges the final image without contradiction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary refracts starlight into fractured rainbows that dance on skin, constraining Lys's choices and charging the crumbling closure; sensory details like melting snow under bare feet and steaming beams evolve causally, mirroring her defiance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of harvesting echoes tightens through untangling threads, deepening density under the Textural lens to force stance crystallization; the sanctuary's shudder and prism absorption make cost legible in the empire's faltering lullaby, though coincidence of light pouring out slightly complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of silence becoming scream emerges through unraveling echoes and defiance of conformity, with the final prism absorption offering a resonant, non-literal reconfiguration of memory's weight; subtext in bodily poetic inscriptions invites reflection on erased souls without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable with perceptual signature in starlight shards and absence language, modulating rhythm from slow flakes to searing light; no dialogue, but patterned elision in echoes teaches and pays off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with purposeful metaphors like threads as starlight tethers, varying rhythm from deliberate flakes to thrumming marble; minor synonym churn in light descriptions ("searing, starfire") avoids muddle, propelling to the exhaling sky without loops touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chaste courtesan harvesting echoes in a prism sanctuary transforms conformity tropes through specific untangling and prism absorption, with risk in lyric compression heightening stakes; the non-obvious echoes as defiance feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
