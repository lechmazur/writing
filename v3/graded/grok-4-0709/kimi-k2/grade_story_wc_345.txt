<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The altruistic ghost's motivation to orchestrate collective healing is clear and intensifies through her persistent chalk messages, culminating in her sacrificial dissolution; interiority is embodied in her spectral actions, like steadying the bell, revealing contradictory impulses of altruism and fading existence. Kiran's arc from isolation to leadership shows credible endurance with felt cost in brambled hope. Relationships as crucible work well among the gathered strangers becoming family, pressuring choices like weaving the net. However, secondary characters like the mechanic and twins feel somewhat stock, with traits shown more through summary than distinct micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through mosaic shards with legible transitions, from Luma's messages to the collective effort and final reconfiguration; closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with Luma's dissolution into perpetual dew, carrying conceptual cost of her eternal anchoring. Orientation anchors who (ghost Luma), where (Orchard Planet), and when (centuries after death) early, with purposeful disorientation in the nebula paying off at closure. One meaningful deepening occurs in the seventh-dawn waterfall descent, tightening the stake without redundancy. Minor slip in the abrupt "Years later" shard, but it holds the lens without breaking causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The orchard planet with floating rock arches constrains choices, like the fallen arch hiding the bell and the cracking arches pressuring the net-weaving; sensory details are vivid and purposeful, with midnight-blue blossoms and lavender nebula mirroring hope's brambles. Micro-setting of the watering bell functions as a recurring object charging the final image of perpetual dew. Tone tensions the ethereal with tangible decay, supporting theme without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly, evolving causally as arches steady and sing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of healing the planet before collapse signals early via Luma's altruism; one meaningful deepening in the net-weaving tightens pressure, forcing stance crystallization under Accumulative lens, with visible cost in fatigue and Luma's dissolution. Agency shines in Kiran's proposal and bell-ringing, interweaving internal doubt with external action, though coincidence of discoveries slightly complicates without resolving. Moral calculus between isolation and family sharpens the climax. Stakes feel visceral but occasionally abstract in the plague of forgetting.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of strangers becoming family emerges organically from chalk messages and collective effort, culminating in the resonant final message without moralizing; subtext in brambled hope invites reflection on altruism's cost. Final image of the bell at the orchard's heart offers a non-literal answer, reweighting isolation with communal tending. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality through thorny doubt. Minor weakness in overt thematic echo in the last chalked line, slightly reducing ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person omniscient POV is stable, shifting focalizers at clear breaks (Luma to Kiran) under Multi-POV Track C, with coherent Accumulative lens at closure; perceptual signature is distinct, like Kiran's wonder at letters feeling like a lullaby. Prose texture in rhythmic, image-rich syntax modulates with intensity, teaching patterned elision in ghostly actions. No dialogue present, so policy skips evaluation; free indirect style clean in interior moments. Elision of plague details pays off in diaspora isolation without withholding for suspense.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere through vivid images like "droplets scattered into miniature galaxies"; rhythm varies naturally, accelerating in the net-weaving beat. No significant loops or artifacts, though some figurative density in nebula descriptions borders on muddle without harming clarity. Strong verbs and specific nouns propel momentum, with final line recharging motifs effectively. Minor register drift in elevated diction like "brambled hope" fits voice but feels slightly strained in peak moments.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghostly altruism with sci-fi elements like nebula dew transforms familiar redemption tropes through specific choices, like chalk messages on sidewalks; emotional complexity in brambled hope avoids generics. Core premise offers non-obvious angle on community via a ghost's silent orchestration, committing fully without retreat. Bold risk in mosaic structure heightens stakes organically. Proximity to archetypal ghost stories is distanced by planetary setting and collective motivation.</comment>
