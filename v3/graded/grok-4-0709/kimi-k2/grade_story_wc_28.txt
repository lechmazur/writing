<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Azim's motivation as a gentle radical is clear and intensifies through retrocognitive visions that compel the mosaic repair, showing embodied emotion in kneeling and history folding around his lungs; Leylah's exhausted softness provides relational pressure that alters their shared stance. Interiority is concrete with contradictory impulses like cradling empathy in steel arms, earning the final renunciation of rage. Flaws complicate choices without hedging, but some diagnostic self-awareness in reflections trends slightly stock.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through patterned images of fire, mercy, and mosaics toward a Conceptual Repricing closure where placing the tessera reweights the plaza's memory with conceptual cost of exhausted empathy over rage. Orientation anchors early in the ancient plaza post-fire, with one continuous scene and meaningful deepening via retrocognition. Causality holds in elided, pattern-taught form without breaks, but minor ambiguity in sky's "bleeding" persists without full payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The ancient plaza with frost-rimmed colonnades and shattered minaret provides vivid, purposeful sensory detail filtered through Azim's bias, constraining choices like kneeling on the mosaic; the cracked sky and star pools mirror internal mercy, charging the final hum and exhale. Micro-setting of the stepping stone evolves causally, directly shaping the closure image. Tone tensions cold glowing night with warm breath, supporting theme without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of renaming mercy post-fire escalates through accumulative density of images and shared sifting, deepening via Leylah's teardrop placement that forces stance crystallization on empathy vs. rage with felt cost of rebuilding exhaustion. One meaningful tightening suffices, narrowing options to cradle empathy; agency in pressing the tessera earns reconfiguration without coincidence resolving. Moral calculus sharpens at "empathy burns more than rage," with visible price in the plaza's tremor.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of aberrant mercy emerges organically from images like surgeons' kind eyes and the red tessera, resisting tidy morals through ambiguity in exhausted softness vs. revenge; final image of the humming mosaic offers resonant, non-literal repricing of empathy's cost. Subtext in gestures like tracing the leaf and shared footfalls invites reflection on rebuilding without sentimentality. Emotional aftereffect lingers via the plaza's exhale, tied to protagonist's arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in poetic, image-dense noticing like stars pooling in cracks; rhythmic control modulates with pressure, using patterned elision taught early and paid off in retrocognitive bursts. Dialogue is natural, subtextual, and goal-driven, distinguishing voices like Leylah's whisper vs. Azim's reply. No head-hopping or register mismatch, with prose texture reflecting focalizer's mind.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in metaphors like "sky once porcelain lay cracked like old glaze" that advance atmosphere without loops; clarity holds despite figurative layers, with strong verbs and specific nouns propelling to closure. Minor scaffold in repetitive "mercy" phrasing, but no artifacts obscure the final hum. Information advances multi-job lines, though some overwriting in peak reflections slightly muddles propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of retrocognition and mosaic repair transforms post-apocalyptic tropes through specific details like the blood-red teardrop and fire-cartographer, feeling inevitable in hindsight; risk in lyric compression heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional complexity in warm coldness avoids generics, committing to premise of empathy's cost. No close echoes, but premise borders familiar redemption arcs without full boldness.</comment>
