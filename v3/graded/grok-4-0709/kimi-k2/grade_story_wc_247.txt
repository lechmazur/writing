<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The advisor's motivation to translate silence into music is clear and rooted in his deafness, intensifying through embodied actions like signing chords and submerging, revealing contradictory impulses of joyful sorrow; interiority is concrete, with micro-choices like the final arpeggio earning the renunciation of being remembered, foreclosing paths with felt emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned images and cadence shifts toward a Resonant Reconfiguration in the submersion and surfacing, with conceptual cost legible in the fading footprints and harbor's exhaled chord; orientation anchors early in the luminous harbor, and causality holds via motif accumulation without breaks, though minor elision in backstory reflections slightly softens linkage.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The luminous harbor by moonlight is vividly specific, with sensory details like soft slaps against hulls and water as glass scored by invisible staff constraining choices and charging the final image of the exhaled chord; micro-setting of the pier and water evolves causally, mirroring internal states through purposeful, POV-filtered integration without excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of translating silence escalates texturally through signing intensity and submersion, with one meaningful deepening that reweights options via the harbor's response; cost is felt in joyful sorrow and foreclosed recognition, driven by agency in ritual gestures, though coincidence of the gull's wingbeat slightly complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of finding music in silence emerges organically through images like bubbles as dotted half notes and the harbor's requiem-lullaby, offering resonant ambiguity in the final reconfiguration without moralizing; subtext in gestures and motifs deepens complexity, eliciting emotional aftereffect via conceptual repricing of loss into distilled joy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in musical metaphors for silence, rhythmic syntax modulating with pressure like faster signing; no dialogue, but prose texture is purposeful and lyric, teaching patterned elision early and paying off at closure without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied rhythm in metaphors like "bubbles rising in dotted half notes," advancing atmosphere without loops; minor scaffold in repetitive signing descriptions slightly dulls momentum, but clarity holds at closure with strong verbs and no artifacts obscuring the final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of deafness, invented sign language, and harbor as orchestra transforms familiar loss tropes through specific details like the film-less camera as tuning fork; risk in lyric submersion heightens stakes organically, feeling inevitable without gimmickry, though premise echoes poetic solitude archetypes.</comment>
