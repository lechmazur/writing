<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Arlen's motivation to capture wonder is clear and intensifies through micro-choices like adjusting the dial, revealing contradictory impulses between rational trapping and emotional sweetness; interiority is concrete via embodied reactions to sparks and echoes, though flaws like peripheral focus enable endurance without deeper moral ambiguity. The final renunciation of direct engagement with moths earns stasis with felt cost of containment. No diagnostic labels mar the portrayal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned echoes and reflections, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where the timer runs backward, reweighting wonder with conceptual cost of rational confinement; orientation anchors early in the cavern with Arlen kneeling. Closure lands on-page with the labeled shelf and reverse ticking, charging the final image without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The marble cavern's veins and reflections constrain choices, like aligning the dial at specific angles to access memories, charging the final reconfiguration as Arlen shields it from frost; sensory details are vivid and POV-filtered, evolving with light shifts from noon to dusk to candlelight. Micro-setting of the mechanism integrates into action, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of trapping wonder before the season's end tightens through frost's approach and gear resistance, forcing a deepening via backward winding that narrows options and incurs conceptual cost of wonder's containment; under Accumulative lens, cadence shifts with sparks and echoes reweight pressure. One meaningful intensification suffices, driven by agency without coincidence resolving it.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of rationalizing wonder emerges organically from echoes and reverse-engineering, culminating in a resonant final image of the labeled shelf that reweights the premise without moralizing; subtext in peripheral focus and moth memories invites ambiguity about loss. No thematic statements or false equivalence dilute complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable with distinct perceptual signature in angled reflections and indirect noticing; voice texture is poetic yet controlled, with rhythmic syntax modulating under pressure like gear biting. Patterned elision in echoes is taught early and pays off at closure without obscurity; no dialogue present, so policy skips those bullets.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose density is high with multifaceted lines like "veins of quartz catching the wounded season’s pale sun like cracked glass," advancing atmosphere and theme without loops or scaffold; figurative language is coherent and purposeful, avoiding muddle in peak beats like the sparks turning to moths. Rhythm varies naturally, propelling toward closure with zero artifacts touching the final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of locksmithing with echo-harvesting transforms time tropes through specific angles and reverse mechanics, feeling inevitable as Arlen stores laughs and promises; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes without gimmickry, committing to the premise's implications. No derivative echoes mar originality.</comment>
