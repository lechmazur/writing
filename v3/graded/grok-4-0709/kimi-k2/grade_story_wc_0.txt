<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation as a researcher seeking to understand gradual change is clear and intensifies through her actions, with interiority concretely embodied in her humility and preprocessing habit; the final renunciation of loud endings feels earned by prior observations, foreclosing her prior focus on sudden collapses with a felt emotional cost. No other characters are present, so relationship bullets are ignored. The contradictory impulses between scientific precision and quiet acceptance act simultaneously in her collection and reflection beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned observations and image accrual to a Conceptual Repricing closure where Mara reweights change as continuous, with conceptual cost in accepting erosion's patience; orientation anchors early in the greenhouse post-flood. The lens holds without contradiction, and the final image of seedlings charges the reconfiguration. One persistent constraint— the damaged environment—shapes her tactics and final insight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The storm-damaged greenhouse is vividly specific, with sensory details like crunching glass and sour smells filtered through Mara's POV, evolving causally from flood aftermath; it constrains her choices by providing wings and chrysalis that charge the final image of seedlings, mirroring her internal shift. Micro-setting elements like the dust and irrigation drip guide her realizations purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the dominant stake of grasping gradual change escalates through density increase in collected wings forming a gradient, culminating in a cadence shift that reweights her worldview; one meaningful deepening occurs via the chrysalis discovery, forcing stance crystallization with felt humility as cost. Agency is in her renunciation of dramatic endings, foreclosing prior assumptions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of gradual decay as a quiet lullaby emerges organically from butterfly-star parallels and wing collections, with subtext in images like dust patterns; the final image offers a resonant, non-literal repricing of change without moralizing. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality through honest humility.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature biased toward scientific analogies; voice texture is distinct in rhythmic, metaphorical prose that modulates with reflection. Solo dialogue to butterflies feels natural and subtextual, advancing her insight. No head-hopping or untaught elision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied rhythm and syntactic variety accelerating in reflective beats; no loops or artifacts obscure clarity, and metaphors like "slow comets" enhance without muddle. Final line resolves by recharging motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of astrophysics and lepidoptery in a post-flood setting transforms familiar decay tropes through specific, non-obvious parallels; risk in quiet, accumulative structure heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry. Core premise feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
