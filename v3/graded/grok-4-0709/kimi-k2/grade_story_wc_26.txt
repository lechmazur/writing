<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Strong motivation rooted in preserving hope intensifies to compel intervention despite orders, with embodied contradictory impulses in the pulsing stone moment; interiority is concrete and particular, earning the final renunciation with felt cost in luminous regret at the summit.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, image patterns build density to a resonant reconfiguration where the shadow is bound with conceptual cost; orientation anchors early in the blooming library, with no debt, and closure lands on-page via the stone's anchoring.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Vivid, selective details like glass petals folding into talons constrain choices and charge the final image of restored glow; atmosphere mirrors internal hope through evolving cloudscape, with sensory hierarchy biased by Lira's dusk-noticing role.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving hope tightens through shadow's advance, driving agency under textural lens; cost is unmistakable in the sorrow of what almost slipped away, with one meaningful deepening at the video comparison forcing stance crystallization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of hope's fragile shape emerges organically from stone and shadow motifs without statements; ending offers resonant, non-literal repricing via luminous regret, reweighting prior images with emotional honesty and ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Consistent third-person close POV with distinct perceptual signature through sharp-eyed bias; rhythmic control heightens pressure in poetic syntax, with no head-hopping or elision issues, teaching its lyric pattern early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density and propulsion with varied rhythm, zero loops or artifacts; figurative language like "shadow pooled like spilled ink" enhances clarity without muddle, especially in the climax beat where syntax breathes with action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dream library and unbound shadow transforms tropes through specific poetic ingenuity; risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes organically, feeling inevitable in the stone's binding moment.</comment>
