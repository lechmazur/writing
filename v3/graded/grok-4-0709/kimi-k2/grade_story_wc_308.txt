<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to learn navigation without moving is clear and intensifies through poetic interiority, but emotions feel abstract rather than embodied, with contradictory impulses summarized alternately instead of acting simultaneously in scene. Interiority uses character-particular metaphors like skimming memories, yet relies on stock phrasing in reflective blocks that exceed BRR allowances without tilting present stance via micro-choices. The final transformation earns endurance with conceptual cost, but flaws like unearned epiphanies in the climax weaken holistic success.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through patterned repetitions and density increases, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing closure where the protagonist becomes a tower of bone, reweighting stillness with undeniable conceptual cost on the page. Orientation anchors who (skimmer), where (canyon), and when (timeless dust-layered present) by line 3, serving the lyric pattern without debt. One meaningful cadence shift tightens toward the spiral pattern, but minor redundancy in echoed phrases slightly dilutes propulsion without breaking causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting vividly integrates the canyon of endless echoes and towers of bone, with sensory details like humming grief and dust mortar filtered through POV bias, constraining choices and charging the final transformation image. Micro-setting of the body and arrowhead evolves causally, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism. The environment pressures the dominant stake, with bone towers teaching resolve that directly shapes the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the dominant stake of learning to navigate without moving escalates through pattern breaks in bird flights and pulse quickening, with one meaningful deepening that reweights options via the paradox realization. Conceptual cost is legible in the transformation, foreclosing mobility with felt price, but pressure remains somewhat abstract without a sharper trade-off in tactics. The flock's frozen pattern forces stance crystallization, yet coincidence in echoes complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of stillness as accumulation emerges organically from images like dust grains and bone towers, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer at the ending where transformation reprices navigation without moralizing. Subtext operates in silences and patterns, inviting reflection on grief's patience with purposeful ambiguity. Motifs like the pulse constrain closure without tokenism, but occasional abstract statements slightly dilute emotional honesty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable with perceptual signature biased toward historical reverence, using patterned elision in repetitions that teach the lyric mode early and pay off at closure. Prose texture is distinct in rhythmic, metaphorical syntax, modulating with intensity without register drift. No dialogue present, so policy skips those bullets; purposeful compression heightens subtext without obscurity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose advances atmosphere through dense, purposeful metaphors, but paraphrase loops like repeated "centuries of layered dust" and "pulse left wandering" create template cadence in peak beats, triggering -0.6 artifact penalty without obscuring closure. Rhythm varies naturally with syntactic variety, yet some mixed metaphors (e.g., wings writing equations) muddle clarity mid-story. Information density is high, with lines multitasking, but redundancy in reflective blocks dulls momentum slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes fantastical elements like harmonic skimming and bone towers into a non-obvious exploration of stillness, feeling inevitable through patterned motifs that heighten stakes. Risk-taking in lyric structure transforms familiar transformation tropes with specific emotional complexity, avoiding derivatives. The final reconfiguration grows from prior particulars, offering fresh ingenuity without gimmickry.</comment>
