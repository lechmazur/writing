<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to become visible is clear and intensifies compellingly, rooted in her past with the custodian, leading to embodied emotions like tears blurring the crawl space; interior conflict shows in her methodical patience contrasting fierce simplicity, with the final choice to share the tape revealing a hierarchy of values at visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned sensory details and memory accruals to a resonant reconfiguration in the final realization of bidirectional visibility, with felt emotional cost in shared tears; orientation anchors early in the shadowed library at dawn, though one minor elision in retreat mapping slightly softens causality without harming closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The shadowed library at dawn, with flickering lights and pipe chases, vividly anchors and constrains Lira's movements, charging the final image as the tape adheres beneath the girl's feet; sensory details like sapphire hush and condensed steam reflect POV bias and pressure urgency, evolving causally with the outage.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of becoming visible tightens through the deepening act of sharing the tape, reweighting options with emotional cost in the girl's tears under the Accumulative/Textural lens; one meaningful cadence shift forces stance crystallization, though coincidence of the girl's arrival slightly complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of visibility and preserved memory emerges organically from particulars like the tape fragments and custodian's voice, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer that reweights the premise without moralizing; subtext in gestures like pressing the tape to ear and knothole viewing invites reflection on connection's ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and modest, with perceptual signature in Lira's braille-like memorization and sensory bias toward hush and vibrations; prose texture distinct in rhythmic, patterned diction that teaches lyric compression early and pays off at closure without obscurity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with vivid metaphors like "oxide skin flaking like rusted petals" advancing atmosphere and character, varying rhythm naturally; minor scaffold in one paraphrase loop ("sapphire hush" repetitions) dulls momentum slightly but doesn't touch closure, with clean grammar and propulsion overall.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of crawl space dwelling with memory-bleeding tapes feels inevitable, transforming familiar lost-voices trope through specific sensory ingenuity; risk in lyric hush tone heightens stakes organically, committing to premise without retreat.</comment>
