<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Cassia's motivation as a lonely visionary chasing prophecies is clear and intensifies through her actions, like polishing the glass and tuning receivers, revealing embodied emotions in her solder burns and ozone-tasting ear presses; internal conflict shows in her allegiance to futures not chosen, with the final endurance earning a cost in the non-gentle dawn. Strengths include character-specific flaws driving mistakes, like harvesting static as berries, but minor stock phrasing in reflections slightly flattens interiority at peak moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through patterned imagery and cadence shifts, like storm harvests leading to the voice's numbers and chord ladder, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing closure where "Remember" reweights the world's shadows with undeniable conceptual cost in the lightening earth and non-gentle dawn; orientation anchors early with Cassia's observatory, and causality holds via textural density without breaks. The equinox lightning strike as inciting incident pays off at climax without coincidence resolving it.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The stormlit observatory above clouds is vividly specific, with cobalt glass drinking lightning and glowing as a bruised beacon, constraining choices like pressing her ear to the crack and affecting closure as it folds into petals; sensory details like ozone and copper taste are POV-filtered and evolve causally, charging the final image where the glass opens to the silhouette.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake in shaping a new dawn escalates through textural density, with the voice's numbers and chord ladder tightening pressure, forcing Cassia's stance crystallization at the storm's peak; one meaningful deepening via the congregation's arrival narrows options with felt cost in the dissolving silhouette's iron-lilac taste, though coincidence in lightning strikes slightly complicates without fully resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of remembering forgotten shadows emerges organically from images like fragmented frequencies and the silhouette of dark things, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer as the earth lightens, reweighting the premise with ambiguity in the non-gentle dawn; subtext in blue reflections and prophetic nonsense deepens complexity without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Consistent third-person close POV with lyric compression taught early through poetic fragments, maintaining perceptual signature in Cassia's biased noticing of static as berries and solder burns; voice texture in rhythmic, purposeful syntax heightens under storm pressure, with the voice's dust-accented dialogue carrying subtext and advancing the prophetic arc without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with vivid metaphors like "bellies full of static" advancing atmosphere without loops or scaffold; syntactic variety and rhythm vary naturally, as in the rippling floorboards, and the final line recharges motifs with high information density, though one mixed metaphor in "sleeves stiff with solder burns" is a hairline slip not touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sci-fi isolation and prophetic whimsy transforms tropes through specific details like numbers-fed receivers exhaling chords, feeling inevitable in the silhouette's bow and dissolution; risk-taking in lyric abstraction heightens stakes without gimmickry, as the congregation's cobalt dreams offer a non-obvious angle on communal remembrance.</comment>
