<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to graft new meaning is clear and intensifies through embodied vulnerability, with contradictory impulses of fear and proactivity culminating in the rose-splicing act that forecloses hiding with felt emotional cost. Interiority is concrete and particular, avoiding stock phrasing, as seen in her whisper “Not to erase, but to grow over,” revealing a hierarchy of values. No diagnostic speak mars the crisis; flaws like protected vulnerability complicate choices authentically.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned images like dripping icicles and moss, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration in the final grafting and realization, with conceptual cost of reweighted wounds legible in the rose blooming as apology. Orientation anchors early in the data center; causality holds via motif accumulation without breaks. Minor elision in backstory is anchored and tilts present stance via the grafting micro-choice.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The abandoned data center turned moss garden is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like soft peat and dripping meltwater filtered through Lira's bias, constraining her search and charging the final image of growth over wounds. Environment evolves causally, mirroring internal thaw, and the rack's residual hum directly enables the grafting choice. Micro-setting of the amber pendant and moss integrates seamlessly, heightening atmosphere without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of grafting meaning onto wounds tightens through the hologram projection and rose insertion, deepening via pattern break in the "forgive" message that reweights options with emotional cost. Under Accumulative/Textural lens, pressure coheres via motif density increase, forcing stance crystallization in her whisper and decision to wait for bloom. Agency in proactivity drives the single meaningful intensification, with visible price in vulnerability trembling like a bird.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of transforming wounds into growth emerges organically from images like the grafting rose and thawing icicles, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in forgiveness's cost, eliciting resonant aftereffect through the final petal as mercy. Subtext in silence and motifs like the twitching bee deepens complexity without confusion. The ending offers a non-literal answer via the blooming rose, reweighting the viral confession's premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in selective noticing of moss and drips biased by Lira's watchful dreaming; rhythmic prose modulates with hush and pulse, teaching patterned elision early for legibility. No dialogue present, so policy skips evaluation; free indirect style is clean, with syntax reflecting her proactive interiority. Elision in backstory pays off at hologram, heightening closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in honeyed hush and drip metronome, advancing atmosphere without loops or scaffold, as in the seamless grafting sequence. Figurative language like "mycelial threads" is controlled and payoff-driven, avoiding muddle in peak beats. Minor register elevation fits voice, with strong verbs propelling to the resonant final line.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of data ruins as healing garden transforms viral confession trope through specific grafting ingenuity, feeling inevitable via motif buildup, with risk in lyric ambiguity heightening vulnerability stakes. Emotional specificity in protected thaw avoids generics, committing to premise without retreat. The non-obvious angle on forgiveness via plant-data splice elevates coherence.</comment>
