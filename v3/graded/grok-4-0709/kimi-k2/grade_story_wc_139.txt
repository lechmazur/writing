<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lila's motivation as the con artist's honest child is clear and intensifies through contradictory impulses, embodied in her apology to the corpse and the weight of the ink pot; internal conflict shows in her calculation of moral ledgers, earning the final endurance with felt complicity cost. Minor slip in stock phrasing like "palms open" slightly genericizes embodiment, but it doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, holding through patterned metaphors building to closure; the ending delivers a Conceptual Repricing via dawn's "pale ink" reweighting fairness as process with conceptual cost of ongoing revision. Orientation anchors early in the prep room; one meaningful deepening via the stamp's irrevocable mark tightens stakes sufficiently for length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The funeral home prep room constrains choices vividly, with formaldehyde and lilies scent mirroring Lila's internal rot, and the porcelain table supplying the breach opportunity; micro-setting of the ink pot charges the final image as inheritance, evolving causally without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of faking death for asylum escalates via textural density increase in metaphors like ink spreading guilt, culminating in the stamp's tightening that narrows options with legible cost of complicity; one meaningful deepening through the director's pivot forces stance crystallization under Situational pressure in this Hybrid lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of fairness as negotiable borders emerges organically from ink motifs and moral calculus, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in the corpse's smile; the final image offers a resonant, non-literal repricing of inheritance without stated moral, eliciting lingering complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in Lila's biased noticing of scents and weights, rhythmic control heightens pressure via short sentences in the breach; dialogue is subtextual and goal-driven, like her lie about witnessing embalming, with patterned elision in metaphors taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm naturally in beats like counting Mississippis; metaphors like "ink bled through, marrying real and unreal" propel without muddle, zero loops or scaffolds in peak moments, though one mixed vehicle ("keys jangling like tiny shackles") is minor and doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of forgery and asylum through the ink pot's evolving role transforms trope of con artist legacy, with non-obvious moral calculus in "one death equals one life"; risk in lyrical compression heightens stakes organically without gimmickry, feeling inevitable at the dawn-cracked sky.</comment>
