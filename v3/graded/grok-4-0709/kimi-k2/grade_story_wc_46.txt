<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and rooted in resurfacing memories of her mother, compelling her to polish the sea glass with embodied emotion and contradictory impulses, like trembling fingers amid growing certainty. Interiority is concrete, with emotions embodied in actions like counting heartbeats, revealing hierarchy of values in sharing light without fire. The closure's endurance forecloses isolation with felt cost of lifted weight, though secondary characters like the village girl appear briefly without applying immediate pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, patterns of memory and imagery build density toward a Resonant Reconfiguration in the pearl's exhalation, with conceptual cost legible in the reweighted premise of stars staying. Orientation anchors who (Lira), where (serpentine grotto), and when (dawn teasing) by ~50 words. Closure lands on-page with charged poise in the village awakening to gentle light, though one micro-turn in polishing feels more deepening than reversal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The serpentine grotto in mist is vivid and purposeful, with slick walls and tide pools constraining Lira's actions and charging the final image of mist parting like book pages. Sensory details like salt and phosphorescence are filtered through her bias, evolving causally as she moves deeper. The setting pressures choices, supplying the basin and pearl that enable the light-sharing, mirroring her internal lightness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of sharing light without fire signals early and deepens through polishing, narrowing options with the glass thinning and pearl's absorption, under Accumulative lens. Agency in Lira's renunciation of fire forecloses isolation with felt cost of lifted weight. One meaningful intensification suffices, though coincidence of finding the pearl complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of carrying inner light amid loss emerges organically from memories and the pearl's quiet radiance, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in stars "learning to stay." Subtext in gestures like whispered apology and exhaled light invites reflection on shared memory. Final image offers resonant, non-literal answer to carrying the sky, reweighting premise without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in Lira's biased noticing of aurora greens and zephyr blooms, modulating rhythm under pressure without elision. Prose texture is distinct, lyric yet legible, with syntax reflecting her contemplative state. Brief dialogue at end feels natural, subtextual, and advances theme, distinguishing voices in the child's wonder and Lira's salted smile.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with vivid images like "zephyr bloom of dawn" advancing atmosphere without loops, though some figurative stacking in mist coiling risks muddle but pays off in pattern. Rhythm varies naturally, sentences multi-tasking character and momentum, as in polishing counted by heartbeats. No artifacts obscure closure, with clean grammar and purposeful syntax supporting the lyric mode.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of legend and memory in polishing sea glass to share auroral light transforms trope of lost parent into non-obvious renunciation of fire, feeling inevitable via grotto's pearl. Risk in lyric compression heightens stakes without gimmickry, committing to premise's implications. Emotional specificity in weighed stars avoids generics, though village awakening echoes familiar resolutions.</comment>
