<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to transform scars into stories is clear and intensifies through embodied stress like crystallizing skin and burning lungs, with micro-choices like tapping the quill revealing values; emotions are contradictory and embodied, avoiding stock phrasing; the final endurance forecloses shame with felt cost, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through memory layers and rune-drawing beats to a Resonant Reconfiguration where scars become a book, with felt cost in held breath and platform lurch; orientation anchors early in the floating rock setting; closure lands on-page with conceptual repricing of wounds as stories, holding the lens without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The floating rock and tea platform constrain choices by tying the ceremony to storm timing, with sensory details like swaying lanterns and thunder mirroring internal pressure; recurring elements like the cedar plank charge the final image of the book settling; environment shapes the closure by buoying the rock post-transformation, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of transforming scars escalates through rune-drawing and crystallizations under Accumulative/Textural lens, with one meaningful deepening via memory spirals narrowing options; agency in holding breath drives the reconfiguration with unmistakable cost in physical pain and potential plummet; coincidence of storm timing complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of transforming wounds into narratives emerges organically from rune etchings and shedding, with subtext in crystalline scars as unspoken words; final image of teardrop-to-feather rune offers resonant, non-literal reconfiguration without moralizing; emotional aftereffect lingers through ambiguity of future storms, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable, with perceptual signature in ink and scar details biased by Lira's scholarly flaws; prose texture distinct in rhythmic, saturated hush; no dialogue, so policy skips; elision of warfront details is purposeful and paid off in memory beats without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in storm buildup and no paraphrase loops; metaphors like molten glass in ribs advance atmosphere without muddle; minor scaffold in repeated quill mentions, but propulsion holds through peak beats; zero artifacts touch closure, meeting 9+ density test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of rune magic and emotional crystallization transforms familiar scar-as-metaphor trope through specific ceremony on floating rock; risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry; premise commits to implications, with non-obvious angle on held-breath transformation feeling inevitable.</comment>
