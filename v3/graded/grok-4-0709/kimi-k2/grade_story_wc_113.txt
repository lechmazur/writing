<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to disrupt the ghost's legend is clear and rooted in her liminal existence, intensifying through embodied actions like wading and playing the clarinet, with internal conflict shown in her pulse syncing with the building's creak. Interiority is concrete and particular, avoiding stock phrasing, as seen when she reads the silence as a language. The final renunciation of the ghost's trap feels earned with a conceptual cost of shared breath, though secondary characters are absent, fitting the single-POV scope.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned images of water and notation, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Mara plays a lingering note, reweighting silence into song with a conceptual cost of merged identities. Orientation anchors who (Mara), where (flooded opera house), and when (night, amid hush) by the first sentence, with no disorientation debt. Closure lands on-page with the note's resonance and dawn's promise, though the ending cuts off mid-sentence, slightly softening the cadence shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The flooded opera house with flickering lanterns is vividly specific, constraining Mara's movements as she wades and projects light, charging the final dry floor image where the house hums with promise. Sensory details like ripples matching notation and algae-heavy curtains are purposeful, filtered through her musician's bias, evolving causally as the flood recedes. The micro-setting of the program and clarinet as tools directly shapes choices, such as tilting the instrument to complete the glyph.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of unraveling the ghost's code escalates texturally through deepening patterns of water glyphs and ripples, tightening to a single intensification where the clarinet spills a note, forcing stance crystallization with the cost of seeing her reflection as the prima donna. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, with agency in Mara's deliberate actions like pressing the page and tilting the instrument, though coincidence in the flood receding complicates without resolving. One meaningful deepening suffices, narrowing options to perform the silence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of silence as a resonant space between memory and forgetting emerges organically from images like warped notation and unstruck chords, culminating in the program's blank line that reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext in wordless conversations and ghostly absences invites reflection on liminality, with emotional honesty in Mara's anticipation symphony avoiding sentimentality. The final image offers a non-literal answer to the code's invitation, embracing ambiguity as the note lingers indefinitely.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and modest, with Mara's perceptual signature in musical metaphors like blood composing a symphony, and rhythmic prose modulating with pressure, such as short sentences during the silhouette's appearance. No dialogue present, so policy skips evaluation; elision of the ghost's full history is patterned and paid off at closure. Syntax varies purposefully, though some long sentences in peak moments slightly compress clarity without obscuring.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with vivid images like droplets carrying gold leaf glittering like stars advancing atmosphere and theme, and syntactic variety creating rhythm, as in the ripples intersecting to match notation. Minor scaffold in repetitive water motifs (e.g., "water damage," "floodwater," "droplets") appears but pays off in the textural buildup without obscuring closure. No major artifacts touch the final note's resonance, though one mixed metaphor ("hush deepened until Mara could hear her own blood composing a symphony") slightly muddles in a peak beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The premise of performing a ghost's watery code in a flooded theater offers fresh synthesis, transforming ghost story tropes through musical liminality, with ingenuity in the clarinet as a tidal instrument spilling notes. Risk-taking in lyric, accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, as the wordless note's suspension feels inevitable. Originality shines in the conceptual repricing of silence, avoiding derivatives with specific details like inverted clefs and algae curtains.</comment>
