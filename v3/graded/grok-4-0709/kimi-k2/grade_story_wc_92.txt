<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to spark revolution is clear and intensifies through her inventive actions, rooted in traits like vigilance and calm ingenuity, with embodied emotions shown in her heart pounding during descent; however, internal conflict lacks strong contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, as her progression feels smoothly rational without visible hypocrisy. The final endurance as sentinel with hidden rebellion earns stasis through prior causality, foreclosing obedience with conceptual cost in her isolated promise. Strengths shine in micro-choices, like scratching the sigil, revealing values under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under Causal lens, the structure holds with because/therefore linkages from blackout to sigil to forge to bird release, anchoring who (Lira), where (fort), and when (twilight blackout) by the first paragraph; closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) in the warming gate and pamphlet, reweighting her role with conceptual cost of suppressed dissent now ignited. One meaningful tightening suffices, as descending and programming birds narrows options amid risk. Minor slip in ellipsis from release to murmurs, but it motivates the final stance without breaking causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The luminous fort at twilight anchors vividly with purposeful sensory details like violet afterglow and hot metal scent, filtered through Lira's POV; the blackout and cradle constrain choices, enabling secrecy while pressuring urgency, and the half-painted sundial charges the final image by guiding rebellion. Micro-setting of the quill holder and forge evolves causally, mirroring her internal spark. 9+ test met as recurring objects like the holder constrain actions and recharge closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of sparking silent revolution signals early and tightens once via descent and bird programming, narrowing options under Causal lens with coherent pressure from blackout and Regent's hoard; agency drives escalation through her choices, with felt cost in heart-loud risk and foreclosed obedience. No multiple reversals needed, but coincidence of blackout complicates without resolving. Peak at releasing birds forces stance crystallization with unmistakable on-page cost in the city's murmuring awakening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of suppressed ideas igniting revolution emerges organically from images like sparks and pamphlets, resisting tidy morals through ambiguity in Lira's hidden role; subtext in winking hush and spiral sigil invites reflection on obedience versus mischief without confusion. Final image of warming gate offers resonant, non-literal answer to hoarded light, reweighting premise with conceptual cost. Emotional aftereffect builds from particulars like the bird's "NOW" without sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable third-person close POV with distinct perceptual signature in Lira's tactile tracing and shadow alignment, modulating rhythm with pressure like short sentences during descent; no dialogue, so policy skips those bullets. Prose texture is purposeful and lyric, teaching patterned elision in hush motifs paid off at closure. 9+ test met with rhythmic control under stress and no head-hopping or unwarranted certainty.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in vivid images like "cursive fire" advancing atmosphere without loops; minor scaffold in repeated "winking hush" but it patterns purposefully without obscuring closure. Strong verbs and specific details propel momentum, with clean grammar and no figurative muddle in peak beats like bird release. 9+ test nearly met but hairline register drift in poetic flourishes slightly elevates beyond guard's lexicon.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fantasy elements like quill holder as stylus and spark birds transforms trope of hidden rebellion through specific, inevitable turns like sigil warming; risk-taking in lyric hush heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling organic to voice. Core premise offers non-obvious angle on revolution via coded sundial, committing fully with authenticity. 9+ test met as synthesis feels inevitable and bold choices charge clarity.</comment>
