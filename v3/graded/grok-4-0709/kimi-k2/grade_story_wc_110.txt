<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The registrar's motivation to listen and thaw mistrust is clear and rooted in her traits, intensifying through micro-choices like decoding the ticket and scribbling her response, revealing contradictory impulses of reverence and unmasking; the predecessor's confession earns the endurance of their chill with felt relational cost. Interiority is concrete and embodied, avoiding stock phrasing, though the single-POV limits status dynamics. The final grip without question forecloses isolation, charged by prior honesty.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned images of lenses, whispers, and tickets toward a resonant reconfiguration in their shared clarity and departure, with conceptual cost of past secrets legible in the admission and ledger corrections. Orientation anchors early in the forecourt after rain. Closure lands on-page with the lens offering a flawless mirror, reweighting mistrust into connection without decisive physical change but with undeniable relational repricing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The crystal whispering forecourt after rain is vividly specific, with droplets and puddles mirroring emotions and constraining choices, like crouching to eavesdrop; it charges the final image of trembling puddles and humming columns, evolving causally to absorb admissions. Sensory details are purposeful, filtered through POV bias, and the micro-setting of marble seams and cloisters guides the reconciliation without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of thawing mistrust escalates through accumulative pressure of decoding the ticket and responding, deepening via the stone's whisper that forces stance crystallization with felt cost of unmasking; one meaningful tightening suffices, narrowing options to honest confrontation. Agency in her scribbling and offering the palm forecloses prior chill, though coincidence of the murmur complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of honesty freeing like dawn emerges organically from images of lenses and transparent messages, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in "ambiguously clear" night; subtext in gestures like the exhaled cloud clearing resonates without statement. The final image of the lens mirroring night offers a non-literal repricing of secrets' weight, eliciting emotional aftereffect through complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in soft footfalls as questions and biased noticing of ticket stubs; voice texture is distinct in rhythmic, poetic syntax that modulates with emotional intensity. Dialogue is natural, subtextual, and advances reconciliation, like "Truth weighs more, but it is easier to carry than secrets." Patterned elision in whispers is taught and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in metaphors like "droplets still slide like silent apologies" that advance atmosphere without loops; some figurative density in peak beats borders on muddle but pays off in closure's clarity. No artifacts obscure cause/effect, and final line resolves by recharging the lens motif. Syntactic variety supports propulsion, though occasional simultaneity in actions could tighten.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of cryptic doodles, whispering stone, and projector lens transforms reconciliation trope into non-obvious honesty ritual, feeling inevitable through registrar's choices; risk in lyric ambiguity heightens stakes without gimmickry. Fresh angle on transparency avoids generics, committing to premise with authentic vision.</comment>
