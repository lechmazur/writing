<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lin's motivation as the last pacifist is clear and rooted in her upbringing, compelling her to stitch photographs and offer the tear, with embodied emotion shown through floating when her heart lifts; interior conflict emerges in naming wounds, revealing contradictory impulses of helpless love and rage; the final renunciation of the tear earns stasis with felt cost, as gravity returns anchoring her; minor weakness in archetypal traits slightly flattens specificity without harming closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, with pattern of grief images building to resonant reconfiguration where the tear dissolves, opening a garden with conceptual cost of transmuted sorrow; orientation anchors early in the creaking hull and corridor; closure lands on-page with seeds planting and lanterns settling, reweighting the ship's isolation; persistent constraint of the locked airlock shapes tactics, elevating the score.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The recycled spaceship setting is vivid with creaks like an old violin, hydroponic basil gone wild, and reclaimed aluminum chapel, selectively filtered through Lin's bias; environment constrains choices via gravity shifts and the etched airlock sigil; it charges the final image of bioluminescent moss on weapon bones, mirroring internal transmutation; sensory details evolve causally, supporting tone without excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of opening the locked dimension via shadow work tightens through stitching and naming wounds, deepening with her tear doubling the glow; under Accumulative/Textural lens, pattern break at the door swinging open reweights grief's cost; agency in offering the relic forecloses holding onto the past with felt emotional price; minor abstraction in stakes slightly softens visceral impact at peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of transmuting grief through merciless presence emerges organically from stitching ghosts and naming shadows, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in the garden's growth on weapons; subtext in hovering tapestry and flaring tear invites reflection on denied sorrows; final image of seeds planting offers resonant, non-literal repricing of pacifism's cost; emotional honesty avoids sentimentality, charging the aftereffect.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and modest, with perceptual signature biased toward sorrowful details like flaking photographs; voice texture is distinct in poetic rhythm and syntax, modulating with intensity as she floats; AI's whispered dialogue carries subtext and advances plot naturally; purposeful compression in lyric mode is taught early and pays off at closure without obscurity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, sentences advancing atmosphere and character through vivid images like "wind through bamboo"; rhythm varies naturally, avoiding loops or scaffold, with syntactic variety accelerating at the door's opening; figurative language is controlled and coherent, enhancing propulsion without muddle; zero artifacts in closure beat secures high band.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of pacifism, shadow work, and zero-gravity emotion in a post-human spaceship transforms tropes through specific details like the crystal tear pulsing like a lighthouse; risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens stakes organically; core premise feels inevitable with non-obvious angle on grief's dimension; authenticity coheres without hedging.</comment>
