<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to process grief is clear and intensifies through embodied somatic markers, compelling her to plant the photograph as an earned renunciation with visible emotional cost. Interiority is concrete and particular, showing contradictory impulses like joy tilting to grief in real-time perceptions. The single-POV focus excels without needing secondary characters, as her flaws and micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values. Quick test satisfied with contradictory impulses in scene and final choice earned by prior buildup.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds density through reflective shards and sensory patterns, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Mira leaves the photograph, reweighting grief with conceptual cost in the final image. Orientation anchors early with the arboretum and Mira's walk, serving closure without disorientation. Closure lands on-page with felt cost via the "Still possible" inscription and shifted somatic markers. Persistent constraint of the olive tree shapes tactics and charges the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The arboretum's seaside cliff setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like salt and rosemary filtered through Mira's grief-biased perception, constraining her choices and charging the final image of the lighthouse. The olive tree as micro-setting evolves causally, mirroring her internal state without overt symbolism. Environment affects action, such as the wind softening, and quick test met as it constrains the planting and reconfigures meaning. Plausible realism in the abandoned lighthouse era enhances atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of anchoring optimism amid grief tightens through one meaningful deepening via somatic markers and tree interaction, narrowing options to an earned stance crystallization with felt emotional cost. Agency shines in Mira's decision to speak aloud and plant the photo, foreclosing forgetting while accepting grief's presence. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens without coincidence resolving it. Quick test met with protagonist-driven deepening and unmistakable on-page cost in the rearranged markers.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of finding stillness amid grief emerges organically from images like the olive tree and photograph, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in "Still possible." Subtext operates in gestures and implications, such as the tree's "patient curiosity," inviting reflection on loss without sentimentality. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to balancing joy and sorrow, reweighting prior material. Quick test satisfied without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Close third-person POV is stable and apt, with perceptual signature biased toward grief markers like metallic taste and frozen lungs, modulating rhythm under emotional intensity. Prose texture is distinct in syntax and diction, reflecting Mira's mind without filter-verb excess. No dialogue present, so policy skips evaluation; no elision or slippage issues. Quick test met with rhythmic control and consistent voice under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Prose is concise and propulsive, with high density in lines like the photograph "drinking the story," advancing character and atmosphere without loops or scaffold. Rhythm varies naturally, syntactic variety supports emphasis, and metaphors are coherent without muddle in peak beats. No artifacts obscure closure; information density excels in the tree interaction. Quick test satisfied with zero loops, clear propulsion, and controlled figurations.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of drone strike trauma in a cliffside arboretum transforms grief tropes through specific details like somatic markers and the olive tree, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in quiet, accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, committing to emotional complexity. Core premise offers non-obvious angle on survival and optimism. Quick test met with bold choices charging the resonant ending.</comment>
