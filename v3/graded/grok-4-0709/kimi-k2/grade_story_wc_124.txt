<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elian's motivation to understand why smells trigger tears is clear and intensifies through embodied grief, culminating in his decision to release the scent, which forecloses his past as a broker with felt emotional cost. Interiority is concrete and particular, with contradictory impulses shown in his cautious handling versus the final uncorking. The single-POV focus excels in revealing flaws through micro-choices, like pressing the vial to his lips, tasting regret.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through layered sensory memories to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elian releases the scent, reweighting his life's stake with the conceptual cost of past selves grieved. Orientation anchors early in the greenhouse as transformation completes. Closure lands on-page with undeniable pressure in the dawn departure, lighter yet scented.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The greenhouse for extinct plants is vividly specific, with sweating panes and ultraviolet lamps constraining Elian's actions and charging the final image of rekindled lanterns. Sensory details, like violet dew and phosphorescent leaves, are purposeful and POV-filtered, evolving causally as the scent revives plants. This micro-setting directly shapes the closure by enabling the release and bloom.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of returning the memory escalates texturally through deepening fragrances that force stance crystallization, narrowing options to release with the felt cost of grieving past selves. One meaningful deepening suffices, as the scent's ribbon triggers memories, leading to the uncorking. Pressure coheres under the lens, though coincidence of transformation complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of memories' impact via scents emerges organically from images like the vial's drop reviving plants, offering a resonant non-literal answer in the final elegy without moralizing. Subtext in gestures, like shoulders collapsing, invites reflection on loss. Emotional aftereffect is concrete, avoiding sentimentality through complex ambiguity in lingering scents.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in aromatic biases, like fearing a careless breath, and rhythmic control heightens pressure in scent releases without obscurity. Prose texture is purposeful, with patterned elision in memory shifts taught early and paid off at closure. No dialogue present, so no evaluation needed; focalization stays character-bound.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere through vivid images like "ribbon of fragrance so delicate it felt like the exhale of a sleeping child," though minor overwriting in stacked metaphors slightly muddles one peak beat. Rhythm varies naturally, with no loops or scaffolds; final line recharges motifs effectively. Clarity and propulsion are strong, supporting the textural lens without artifacts touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original synthesis of lantern brokering with extinct plants and scent memories feels inevitable, transforming tropes through specific details like the midnight cereus drop. Risk in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, committing to the premise's implications in the wandering broker legend. Fresh angle on memory avoids generics, with emotional specificity in tear-tasting jasmine.</comment>
