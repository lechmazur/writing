<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The caster's motivation is clear and intensifies through guilt-rooted memories, with embodied emotions like the "snowmelt ardor of forgiveness" showing contradictory impulses in her apologies and actions. Interiority is concrete, revealing flaws via specific recollections of Lina, Tor, and Arin, though some self-awareness borders on diagnostic without mid-crisis cost. The final endurance forecloses war's path with felt emotional cost, but relationships are absent, limiting crucible depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned imagery and elision to a Conceptual Repricing closure where names are restored in wax, reweighting memory's premise with undeniable emotional cost in the glowing footprints. Orientation anchors early in the icebound sanctum under aurora, with no disorientation debt. Causality holds via textural density increases, like droplet names, though some reflective blocks summarize without fully tilting present tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The icebound sanctum and aurora are vivid and purposeful, with ice prisms and rope constraining choices like climbing and reconfiguring, charging the final image of glowing footprints. Sensory details filter through POV bias, mirroring internal grief via fractured rainbows and melting droplets. Micro-setting of the rope and wax tablet evolves causally, guiding the ritual without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving forgotten names tightens through the ritual's deepening, narrowing options via rope reconfiguration and culminating in wax impression with felt emotional cost. Agency drives escalation under the textural lens, with one meaningful cadence shift as the rope sings names, though coincidence in aurora pulsing slightly complicates without resolving. Moral calculus between war guilt and forgiveness sharpens the peak, but internal conflict could interweave more externally.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of redeeming lost memories emerges organically from images like the punched card and singing rope, offering a resonant non-literal answer in the new bell's lullaby without moralizing. Subtext in gestures like gloved hand and whispered apologies invites reflection on forgiveness's complexity. Final image reweights the premise with ambiguity, avoiding tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in selective noticing of aurora and ice, modulating rhythm under emotional pressure like resonating droplets. Prose texture is purposeful and lyric, teaching patterned elision early for legibility at closure. No dialogue, so policy skips those bullets; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied rhythm, like "breath crystallizing in the aurora-lit air," advancing atmosphere without loops, though some metaphors stack in peak beats without muddle. Clarity holds with strong verbs and specific details, but occasional overwriting in similes like "sparrow’s tongue" borders on excess without harming closure. No artifacts touch the final image; high density integrates action and image seamlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lost wax casting with war guilt and mystical rope ritual feels inevitable, transforming tropes through specific details like name droplets and wax impressions. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, committing to premise's implications in the singing names. No derivative echoes; emotional specificity anchors universality.</comment>
