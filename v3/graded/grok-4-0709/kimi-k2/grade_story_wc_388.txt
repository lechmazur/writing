<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lina's motivation as a debunker is clear and intensifies through discoveries, culminating in a contradictory impulse between revealing truth and preserving peace, earned by her father's note and the Apple's visions; the final renunciation forecloses broadcasting with a felt conceptual cost of buried memories. Interiority is concrete and embodied, with emotions like stillness under pressure showing flaws without stock phrasing. No other characters, so relationship bullets ignored; her sharp observation drives micro-choices, such as intuiting paper order, revealing value hierarchy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, held consistently as fragmented discoveries build density and break patterns toward closure; orientation anchors who (Lina), where (orchard), and when (post-liquidation) within first sentence. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration via planting the Apple, repricing truth as buried growth with undeniable conceptual cost in the final image of the orchard compassing itself. Persistent constraint of radiation and lies shapes tactics, like checking the dosimeter and reassembling papers, with cost proof in her sharper gaze amid potential reprisal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The wasteland orchard is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like pulsing green trees and iodine-cinnamon wind filtered through Lina's observant bias, constraining choices like pocketing the Apple. Atmosphere supports theme by mirroring hidden truths in thriving decay, and the stillpoint under quartz evolves to register her heartbeat, charging the final image. No occupational depth needed; spatial coherence tracks her movements cleanly, but lacks a body or tool constraining mid-choice beyond the Apple itself.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of excavating truth tightens through paper revelations, deepening via her father's note to force stance crystallization on broadcasting vs. silence under Accumulative/Textural lens; one meaningful intensification narrows options with ethical calculus between peace and reprisal. Agency in renunciation forecloses revelation with legible cost of unwitnessed memories. Coincidence of finding the satchel complicates but doesn't resolve; pressure coheres without multiple reversals required.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of truths buried to prevent graves emerges organically from Apple's encoded memories and Lina's choice, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in her sharper gaze; final image of the orchard preparing harvest offers resonant, non-literal repricing without statement. Subtext in wind's hiss and paper compass implies history's whispers, eliciting aftereffect of cautious hope. No overt symbolism; insights earned through dramatized struggle, avoiding platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in Lina's sharp observations like torn edges' tension; prose texture distinct in rhythmic, compressed syntax that modulates with discoveries, teaching patterned elision in fragmented papers paid off at revelation. No dialogue, so ignored; free indirect style clean, with distance shifting intentionally for emotional beats like the stillpoint flicker. No head-hopping or register drift; uncertainty in Apple's facets serves closure legibly under lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere in lines like "wind hissed, smelling of iodine and cinnamon" without loops or scaffold; rhythm varies naturally, accelerating in reassembly beat. Figurative language purposeful and coherent, like trees as "cynical monuments," without muddle or register drift. Minor template cadence in discovery sequence, but no artifacts touch closure; final line recharges motifs with propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes post-apocalyptic sci-fi with memory-encoding quartz in a fresh, non-obvious way, transforming cursed-object trope through Lina's debunker lens and ethical renunciation; risk in lyric compression heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity in buried truths avoids generics; father's note inflects boldly, feeling inevitable. No close echoes of famous scenes; commits to premise without retreat.</comment>
