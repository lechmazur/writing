<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to collect silences drives concrete micro-choices, like limiting tendril exposure, revealing embodied contradictions between claustrophobia and wonder; the father's arc from survival arithmetic to hush gardener shows earned change with visible cost in his weeping. Interiority is concrete and particular, avoiding stock phrasing, though secondary status dynamics emerge late without fully pressuring peak moments. Emotions layer contradictorily, as in her pulse slowed by wonder amid bunker dread.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through patterned silences and inversions to a Resonant Reconfiguration in the final archway bridge, with conceptual cost in reweighted freedom; orientation anchors early via bunker and trellis. Closure lands on-page with felt cost in tears and years endured, though some elliptical jumps mildly obscure causality mid-story. The doll's growth into an archway recharges prior motifs effectively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The xenial trellis above clouds constrains choices, like clipping the doll as anchor, and charges the final image as a bridge; sensory details are vivid and POV-filtered, with hush tastes embodying atmosphere. Micro-setting of doll and roots evolves causally, mirroring internal expansion. Tone tensions confinement with vastness purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of escaping claustrophobia via silence collection tightens through inversion's time limit, deepening in the third blank silence that enables muting alarms; under textural lens, cadence shifts reweight cost in father's weeping. One meaningful deepening suffices, with agency in renunciation (leaving doll) foreclosing paths at felt price. Coincidence of inversion complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of silence as expansive freedom emerges from particulars like tendril flavors and doll roots, culminating in non-literal resonant answer via the smiling doll reflecting a sky without hiding. Subtext in gestures, like pressing doll to sternum, invites reflection on intangible tangibility without confusion. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality through complex ambiguity in father's transformation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single POV remains stable with distinct perceptual signature in metallic tastes and humming lattice; prose texture via rhythmic, patterned diction teaches lyric compression early, paying off at closure. Dialogue is natural, subtextual, advancing plot in father's hoarse "Teach me." No head-hopping; elision of time in "years later" serves emotional beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied rhythm in phrases like "stretched contracted muscles"; metaphors cohere without muddle, though occasional overwriting in silence descriptions risks density in peak beats. No significant loops or artifacts; final line resolves by recharging doll motif cleanly. Information advances atmosphere and character without scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of claustrophobia and silence photosynthesis transforms tropes via specific details like ozone-tasting hush; risk in surreal elements heightens stakes organically, feeling inevitable in the bridge walk. Premise commits to implications without retreat, avoiding generic settings.</comment>
