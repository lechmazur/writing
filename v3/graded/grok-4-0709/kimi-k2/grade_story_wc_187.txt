<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to sculpt identity from experience is clear and intensifies through embodied nostalgia and fear of betrayal, culminating in an earned renunciation of selective archiving with visible emotional cost. Interiority is concrete and contradictory, shown in her preemptively nostalgic pauses amid pressure, avoiding stock phrasing. The single-POV focus reveals hierarchy of values through micro-choices like measuring shadows, with flaws like initial omission bias complicating her arc without hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned images of shadows and memories to a Conceptual Repricing closure where Lira reweights archiving as listening, with felt cost in acknowledging grief. Orientation anchors early in the stormlit observatory, with no disorientation debt. Closure lands on-page via the obelisk merging with parchment, reconfiguring options, though one minor ellipsis in the final realization slightly softens causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the stormlit observatory and fog constraining Lira's isolation while shadows at monuments directly shape her conjectures and charge the final image of fracturing fog. Sensory details are selective, filtered through her archival bias, evolving causally with rain and lightning. Micro-setting like the crystal and obelisk mirrors internal lament, enhancing atmosphere without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of balancing remembrance without omission tightens meaningfully when the obelisk's shadow forces a deepening that reweights forgotten grief, under Accumulative lens, with felt cost in her throat tightening and nostalgic ache. Pressure coheres through coherent environmental forces crystallizing her stance, though coincidence of the undiscovered monument slightly complicates without resolving. One visible price—embracing the ache—alters her archival tactics effectively.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of collective memory as layered lament emerges organically from particulars like shadow measurements and obelisk reflections, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in what deserves survival. Subtext in silences and images, like rain-softened ink as bruises, invites reflection on forgetting's cost. The final image of the obelisk as a page offers a resonant, non-literal repricing of identity without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable and modest, with perceptual signature biased toward archival details like droplet memories, modulating rhythm under pressure without register drift. Lyrical voice has distinct texture in syntax and patterned elision, taught early and paid off at closure. No dialogue present, so policy skips those bullets; no head-hopping or unwarranted certainty.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied rhythm and high information density in images like shadows pooling like spilled ink, free of loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, accelerating in peak beats without muddle. Clarity shines in the closure merge of shadow and script, with strong verbs and specific nouns enhancing momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory archiving via shadow lengths transforms familiar forgetting tropes through specific, grounded choices like the obelisk's void, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Bold lyrical risk-taking heightens stakes in the deepening hush without gimmickry. Authenticity coheres in voice and premise, with non-obvious moral calculus on excision's return.</comment>
