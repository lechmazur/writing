<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The noticer's motivation as a "creeping normality noticer" is clear and intensifies through her grief over small disappearances, culminating in an earned renunciation of vigilance with felt cost in the planting scene. Interiority is concrete and embodied, showing contradictory impulses like clinging to memory while coaxing the future. The relationship with the tea house keeper acts as a crucible, forcing the choice to plant and let go. Flaws, such as her curse of carrying grief, complicate choices without artificial balance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned images of loss and renewal, with causality in motivated ellipses like the bakery's vanishing leading to the bread offering. Closure is a valid Conceptual Repricing in the final realization and shoot emergence, reweighting memory with conceptual cost of forgetting to grow, though the cost feels more oblique than visceral. Orientation anchors who, where, and when by the first paragraph without debt. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length, but the transition to planting feels slightly soft without a sharper pattern break.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The overgrown palace courtyard and secret tea house are vividly specific, with sensory details like moss-swallowed marble and wisteria filtering through the noticer's biased perception of loss. Setting constrains choices, as the courtyard's cracks enable guerrilla gardening and charge the final image of the shoot pushing through frost. Atmosphere supports the theme of tenuous absolution, evolving causally from frost to pale green growth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of guarding memory versus coaxing the future tightens through the bread-sharing and planting, with one meaningful deepening under the textural lens as seeds reweight loss into growth. Agency in renunciation forecloses rigid vigilance with felt cost in the throat-tight nod and soil baptism. Pressure coheres without coincidence resolving it, though the stake remains somewhat abstract until the ending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of absolution grown from loss emerges organically through images like bread steam and planted seeds, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in forgetting's cost. Subtext in gestures, like breaking the loaf, and the final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer by repricing the sacred in survival. Emotional aftereffect lingers through concrete particulars without sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable and apt, with perceptual signature biased toward noticing absences, like the bakery's darker stone. Voice has distinct poetic texture in syntax and rhythm, modulating with emotional intensity, as in the tight-throat nod. Dialogue is natural, subtextual, and advances the scene, with the keeper's lines pursuing gentle guidance; non-standard phrasing feels voice-motivated and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm naturally and avoiding loops or artifacts, as in the seamless integration of "each press of earth over a seed felt like signing a treaty with time." Figurative language is purposeful without muddle, propelling momentum through images like "frost silvered the weeds." Opening anchors voice, and final line resolves with charged imagery; zero scaffold or redundancy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Originality shines in the fresh synthesis of "creeping normality" with guerrilla gardening as absolution, transforming loss tropes through specific details like cardamom-scented bread and seed pouch. Risk-taking in lyric, accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in the shoot's emergence. Avoids derivative premises by committing to a singular vision of sacred survival.</comment>
