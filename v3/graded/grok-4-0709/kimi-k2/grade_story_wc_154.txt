<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lin's motivation as a translator grappling with guilt is clear and intensifies through embodied contradictions, like touching the cast while recalling unsaid apologies, compelling the earned renunciation of giving the coral fragment. Interiority is concrete and particular, with emotions layered in hypocrisy rooted in her flaws, avoiding stock phrasing. The final choice forecloses her personal hold on the relic with visible emotional cost, shown in her exhaled fear dissolving into the night.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned motifs like coral and cast, leading to a Conceptual Repricing closure where planting the fragment reweights wounds into potential growth with undeniable conceptual cost in shared anxieties. Orientation anchors early in the mist-clad atrium at twilight, with no disorientation debt. One meaningful deepening occurs via decrypting the code, tightening knowledge without requiring multiple reversals at this length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The atrium's sensory details—iodine, orchids, mist curling like spirits—are vivid, POV-filtered, and purposeful, constraining Lin's posture and charging the final image of the garden receiving the coral. Micro-setting of the cast and coral functions as environment, evolving causally to mirror internal healing. Atmosphere supports theme through tonal tension, with no generic placeholders.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><grade>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, the dominant stake of translating wounds escalates via pattern break in decrypting the cast, deepening shared anxieties and forcing stance crystallization with felt cost in unsaid apologies. One meaningful intensification suffices, driven by Lin's agency in grafting meaning, though coincidence of the doctor's appearance complicates without resolving. Cost is legible in the fading coral print scoring her palm.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of translating trauma into healing emerges organically from particulars like the coral and cipher, culminating in a resonant, non-literal final image of polyps as brave words without stated moral. Subtext in gestures and implications, like pressing coral to cast, invites reflection on shared fears with purposeful ambiguity. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality through complex counter-readings of endurance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in Lin's biased noticing of ridges and smells, modulating rhythm under stress without head-hopping. Dialogue is natural, subtextual, and advances plot, like Dr. Vanna's soft-eyed report pursuing reassurance. Purposeful compression in lyric mode teaches patterns early, paying off at closure with legible effect.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm and syntax to propel beats, like the anesthetic hush deepening without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is controlled and coherent, enhancing momentum in peak moments such as whispering to the boy. No artifacts obscure closure, with strong verbs and specific details advancing atmosphere flawlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes translator's lens with symbolic coral in a non-obvious way, transforming tropes of guilt and healing through specific choices like decrypting the cast, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk in lyric compression heightens stakes without gimmickry, offering fresh inflection on shared trauma. Avoids derivative templates with authentic vision.</comment>
