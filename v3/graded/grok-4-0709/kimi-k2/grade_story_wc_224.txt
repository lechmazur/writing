<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong motivation rooted in pain of remembering that intensifies to compel speaking the lost language, with interiority concrete through mercury skin reflections; contradictory impulses of forgetting versus resurrecting show in her initial pretense and final weeping, earning the endurance with felt cost of thunderous heartbeat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with patterned elision of memories building to resonant reconfiguration where speaking reshapes the mountain into home, a conceptual repricing with undeniable cost in mercury tears; orientation anchors early in the bookstore mountain, and closure lands on-page with the mountain sighing into belonging.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Vivid, purposeful sensory details like iron-tasting air and crystallized ink stalactites filter through POV bias, constraining choices in the labyrinth and charging the final tree image; setting evolves causally, mirroring internal resurrection without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of understanding home tightens through stone's pulsing and memory seeding, deepening via feather's texture to force stance crystallization under textural lens; one meaningful cadence shift narrows options with felt cost in painful resurrection, though secondary accents feel slightly diffuse.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of home as remembered language emerges organically from images like the petrified tongue tree and mercury tears, offering resonant non-literal answer that reweights forgetting's pain; subtext in silences and implications avoids tidy morals, embracing complexity with lingering ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in mercury reflections and lyric compression, taught early and paid off at closure without head-hopping; prose texture rhythmic and purposeful, modulating with emotional intensity in a consistent focalized stance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with vivid, propulsion-driven sentences like "She spoke the first word—a sound like breaking ice and newborn stars"; zero loops or artifacts, syntactic variety supports rhythm, and metaphors cohere without muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of surreal elements like mercury-glass skin and language-shaping reality feels inevitable, transforming tropes of forgetting through specific grief; risk in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, committing to premise's implications.</comment>
