<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Liora's motivation to untangle intentions is clear and intensifies through her interaction with the tapestry, culminating in a meaningful renunciation that forecloses reunion with her mother at a felt cost of ongoing duty. Interiority is concrete and embodied, with contradictory impulses shown in her hesitation before choosing "Tomorrow," revealing a hierarchy of values rooted in her blithe constancy. The single-POV focus excels in showing internal conflict without stock phrasing, though emotions occasionally lean toward poetic abstraction rather than raw contradiction in the peak moment of decision.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through layered images and motifs like threads and echoes, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration via Earned Stasis where Liora chooses to stay, with the cost legible in foreclosing the forgiving morning. Orientation anchors early with Liora in the cemetery, and the single continuous scene with one transition to the silo holds coherence. The closure lands on-page with the tapestry rolled and lily planted, reweighting stakes, though the pattern break feels slightly soft without a sharper cadence shift at the horizon's dawn.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The cobalt silo under stars constrains Liora's choices by housing the tapestry that forces her decision, charging the final image of the cemetery breathing easier; sensory details like rust and lilac are selective and POV-filtered, mirroring her internal grief. Micro-setting of the sovereign case and tapestry integrates into action, evolving causally to outline the door. This environment directly shapes the closure, meeting the 9+ test by reweighting uncharted echoes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, the dominant stake of discovering intentions deepens through the map's revelation, tightening into a meaningful cadence shift when Liora names "Tomorrow," foreclosing the path with felt cost. Pressure coheres via the trembling tapestry and impatient spade, forcing stance crystallization without coincidence resolving it. The single intensification suffices for length, but the ethical calculus between duty and forgiveness could sharpen the peak choice more viscerally.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of forgiveness and untangling buried intentions emerges organically from Liora's decoding and choice, with the final image of planting the lily offering a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights her constancy without moralizing. Subtext in frayed threads and the blank name invites reflection on legacy's ambiguity. It meets the 9+ test by reweighting prior material through the dawn hint, though purposeful ambiguity borders on obliqueness in the chord's intention.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The third-person close POV remains stable and character-specific, with perceptual signature in humming lullabies and noticing velveteen gloom, modulating rhythm under pressure like the flickering lantern. Prose texture is distinct in poetic syntax and imagery, teaching patterned elision early and paying off at closure without head-hopping. It satisfies the 9+ test with rhythmic control heightening the silo's inhalation, though minimal dialogue limits subtext evaluation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with vivid, multi-job sentences like the tapestry trembling into a cello chord, varying rhythm naturally without loops or scaffold; metaphors are coherent and purposeful, avoiding muddle in peak beats. Clarity propels momentum, with strong verbs and specific details like "knees creaking like old hinges" advancing atmosphere. No significant artifacts touch closure, meeting the 9+ test, though occasional figurative layering in the silo slightly risks overwriting without harming propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes grief, magical realism, and cemetery tending into a non-obvious exploration of intentions via uncharted echoes, feeling inevitable with the sovereign case's evolving role; risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens stakes without gimmickry. It transforms tropes like ghostly forgiveness through specific choices like naming "Tomorrow," meeting the 9+ test with bold, organic ingenuity.</comment>
