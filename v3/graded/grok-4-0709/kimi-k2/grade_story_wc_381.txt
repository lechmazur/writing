<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The solitary summoner's motivation to hush the prophecy is clear and intensifies through her internal contradictions, like hesitation over silencing versus listening, culminating in an earned renunciation with felt cost in the final reflection. Interiority is embodied in metaphors like the "tranquil blaze" in her chest, revealing character under pressure without stock phrasing. However, the abstract, poetic traits feel somewhat archetypal rather than deeply individual, slightly limiting specificity in micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned imagery and cadence shifts, leading to a Conceptual Repricing closure where the prophecy transforms into peace with conceptual cost legible in the final image of the wing drifting upward. Orientation anchors early with the summoner at the brook, and one meaningful deepening occurs as she maps silence into a spiral. Minor elision in prophecy details doesn't obscure causality, but the ending's quiet reconfiguration lacks a sharper before/after cost proof in a pivotal line.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The nocturnal haven beside the quiet brook is vividly specific, with moonlight silvering the water and reeds breathing warnings, constraining choices like mapping silence over ripples. Sensory details are purposeful, reflecting POV bias toward hush, and the setting evolves causally as the canopy hushes the brook. A recurring object (origami wing) charges the final image, meeting the 9+ test by reweighting the prophecy's meaning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, the dominant stake of hushing the prophecy escalates through density increase in silence-mapping, with one meaningful deepening as the voice swallows itself, narrowing options. Pressure coheres toward stance crystallization, but cost feels more conceptual than visceral, slightly softening the final reconfiguration. The prophecy's resistance in sharper glyphs tests commitment effectively.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of hush as attentive presence emerges organically from images like ripples dissolving into a promise, inviting reflection on silence versus erasure without tidy morals. Subtext in the origami wing's flutter conveys hesitation's complexity. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer by transforming the prophecy, reweighting prior material as per the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in selective noticing of hushes and cricket chirps, and rhythmic control in flowing syntax that heightens pressure. No dialogue, so those bullets ignored; patterned elision in cosmic metaphors is taught early and pays off at closure. Distinct texture in word choice like "terrestrially cosmic" fits the lyric mode without obscurity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in sentences like "She pressed the wing to her lips, letting its quiet heat become a tranquil blaze," advancing atmosphere without loops. Figurative language is controlled, avoiding muddle in peak beats like the spiral mapping. Minor scaffold in repetitive hush motifs doesn't dull propulsion, but elevated diction occasionally drifts register slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes origami magic with prophecy-hushing in a fresh, non-obvious way, feeling inevitable through the wing's evolving geometry. Risk-taking in lyric abstraction heightens stakes without gimmickry, transforming tropes like cosmic paper into a singular vision. The final bridge of light offers a bold, memorable reconfiguration.</comment>
