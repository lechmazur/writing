<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to map post-crash patterns is clear and intensifies through curious, embodied actions like smearing ink with her soles, revealing internal contradictions between nostalgia and forward-looking relocation; the final renunciation of her old practice carries a felt cost in "measured darkness," earning the stasis. However, interiority occasionally leans on abstract labels like "steadily curious heart quickened" without deeper contradictory embodiment mid-scene. The grandmother memory anchors reflection effectively under BRR, tilting present stance without excess.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through layered images and patterns to a Conceptual Repricing closure where value's migration is realized, with conceptual cost in cultural relocation made legible in the final descent; orientation anchors early in the first sentence with who (Mara), where (loft), and when (post-crashes). One meaningful deepening suffices, as the spiral card layout accumulates to invert the city's lights into a new constellation. No orientation penalty applies, as disorientation from rain enhances the thematic texture without harming closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The rain-beaded skylight loft is vividly sensory and purposeful, with rain distorting measurements and weeping like trades, constraining Mara's actions and charging the final lens image that reconfigures the city; micro-details like creaking parquet and ozone smell reflect POV bias and evolve causally. Environment mirrors internal longing without overt symbolism, and the loft's slant affects choreography coherently. This recurring setting element constrains choices and elevates the closure, passing the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of mapping relocation post-crash tightens accumulatively through ink blooms and footprint hypotheses, deepening to a resonant reconfiguration with felt cost in the tourniquet against nostalgia; agency drives the intensification via Mara's steps and whispers, narrowing options to acceptance. Pressure coheres under the Textural lens without coincidence resolving it. While one meaningful cadence shift suffices, the ethical calculus between loss and hope could sharpen the peak more viscerally.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of value's migration from digital to gestural emerges organically through images like ink stars and rain trades, culminating in a resonant, non-literal final image of recompiling city footprints that reweights the premise without moralizing; subtext in silences and implications invites reflection on inherited mysteries. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality via concrete particulars like the water-damaged atlas. This passes the 9+ test by offering a conceptual repricing that deepens prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and modest, with perceptual signature biased toward prophetic metaphors like "ghosts of value," and rhythmic control in echoing clicks that heighten pressure; patterned elision in lyric mode is taught early and pays off at closure without obscurity. No dialogue, so those bullets ignored. Prose texture reflects Mara's mind under stress, with purposeful compression in vectors and hypotheses.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with vivid images like "trembling silver rivers" advancing atmosphere and theme without loops or scaffold; syntactic variety breathes with rain's rhythm, though occasional overwriting in metaphors like "micro-narrative of liquidity evaporating" borders on muddle in peak beats. No major artifacts obscure closure, and information density is high, often multitasking in lines like the tape's clicks echoing ticker symbols. Read-aloud flows naturally, but one synonym churn ("confide" repeated) slightly drags momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original synthesis of cartomancy with post-crypto reverse engineering feels inevitable, transforming tropes through specific details like onyx ink blooming into stars; risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry, as in the footprint hypotheses. Core premise offers a fresh angle on cultural collapse, committed fully without hedging. The non-obvious reconfiguration at closure elevates it, passing the 9+ test.</comment>
