<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kiran's motivation to understand resistance to change is clear and intensifies through choices between blooming and char, revealing interior contradictions in embodied ways, like feeling the thrum and tracing patterns. Emotions are contradictory and rooted in flaws, avoiding stock phrasing, with micro-choices showing value hierarchy at the well. The single-POV baseline holds without needing relationship bullets, and the endurance in choosing kindness earns stasis with felt cost in attention's weight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through layered images and pattern shifts, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing where timelines fold with conceptual cost of careful turning. Orientation anchors who (Kiran), where (oasis), and when (dusk) by the first paragraph, serving closure without disorientation penalty. Closure lands on-page as RR with undeniable pressure in the re-formed lantern and rising bees, holding the lens without contradiction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the oasis's fractured timelines constraining choices and charging the final image of bees rising; sensory details like wax ghosts and lavender are POV-filtered and evolve causally. Micro-setting of hives and well guides action, mirroring internal states subtly without overt symbolism. Environment pressures tactics, such as choosing timelines per step, meeting the 9+ test by shaping the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of understanding resistance escalates through accumulative density and cadence shift, with one meaningful deepening when the lantern unfolds, reweighting options via kindness's cost. Pressure coheres under Textural lens, forcing stance crystallization in choosing blooming, with visible cost in the dimming/brightening lantern. Agency in renunciation of char forecloses paths, earning the band without multiple reversals required.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of resistance as continuous turning emerges organically from images like overlapping bowls and unfolding glass, offering a resonant non-literal answer in the final bees stitching the sky. Subtext in gestures and implications, like the ember leaning toward kindness, invites reflection without confusion. The ending reweights prior material without moralizing, meeting the 9+ test through complexity and ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in zen-like noticing of thrums and fractures; prose texture in rhythmic, patterned diction teaches its lyric mode early and pays off at closure. No dialogue, so policy skips those bullets; elision of timelines is purposeful and legible under the lens. Rhythmic control heightens pressure without head-hopping, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied rhythm, high information density in multi-job sentences like the lantern's unfolding into petals, and zero loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is coherent without muddle, even in peak beats like the well lowering. Clarity and concision advance atmosphere seamlessly, meeting the 9+ test despite dense metaphors, as they enhance rather than obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fractured timelines and phototropic kindness transforms tropes into a non-obvious angle on ecological memory, feeling inevitable in the oasis's layered resistance. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, with the potter's choices offering bold specificity. Core premise commits fully, avoiding derivatives, and earns high band through ingenuity in the final reconfiguration.</comment>
