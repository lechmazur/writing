<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to find her brother's fate is clear and intensifies through choices like lying about the drive, revealing internal conflict via embodied emotion in her heartbeat syncing with 117; the final renunciation of her role as keeper for wandering shows earned change with felt cost of leaving the archive.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural, with patterns of recurring 117 and songs building to a Conceptual Repricing closure where Mara reweights deleted memories as traveling in song, with conceptual cost of the crew's erasure; orientation anchors early in the archive, and causality holds through clue accumulation without breaks, though minor elision in the final upload feels slightly soft.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The social network archive setting constrains Mara's search through chilled aisles and server racks, charging the final image as she sings and sees crew silhouettes flicker; sensory details like humming servers and tasted absence are purposeful, mirroring her sensed loss, with the patch as a recurring object that evolves to hold data and warmth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of uncovering the brother's fate escalates through accumulating clues like 117 recurrences, tightening to a meaningful deepening when she lies and copies the drive, forcing stance crystallization with felt cost of the archive's decommissioning; under Accumulative/Textural lens, pattern breaks in the final song reweight stakes effectively, though coincidence in discoveries slightly complicates without fully resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of memory's persistence beyond deletion emerges through motifs of songs and erasures, culminating in a resonant final image where the patch holds the crew's echo, offering a non-literal answer to where deleted files go without moralizing; subtext in static bursts and layered lullabies invites reflection on corporate erasure with emotional honesty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person close POV stays stable with Mara's perceptual signature in attentive details like noticing binary in the patch; prose texture is distinct with rhythmic echoes like "117, 117, 117," modulating under pressure; no dialogue, so policy skips those bullets; patterned elision in discoveries is taught early and pays off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere through vivid lines like "the silence that tasted of sensed absence"; rhythm varies naturally, avoiding loops, though one paraphrase in the final wandering feels minor; no artifacts obscure closure, with strong verbs and specific imagery propelling to the resonant end.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of digital archives and spaceship mysteries transforms tropes through specific details like binary-encoded patch and song-traveling deletions, feeling inevitable with risk in the lyric, accumulative structure heightening stakes; the non-obvious angle on memory harvesting avoids generics, committing to its premise without retreat.</comment>
