<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The inspector's motivation to photograph the orchid is clear and intensifies through her grief and curiosity, compelling her to embed the sand grain in a micro-choice that forecloses its physical existence. Interiority is concrete and embodied, with contradictory impulses like tracing the crater as a love letter amid rising grief, avoiding stock phrasing. The single-POV focus excels in showing her flaws and limits, such as never healing craters, which compound to an earned endurance with felt cost in the final bloom.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds density through timed countdowns and reflective shards, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration in the final ignition and click, with conceptual cost in the vaporized grain and orchid's collapse. Orientation anchors who (inspector), where (Mount Halcyon summit), and when (Earthrise, pre-bloom) by the first 120 words. Closure lands on-page with a pattern break in the violet flare matching the bloom, reweighting the stake of preservation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The moonlit summit and crater constrain choices, with frost and thin air pressuring her endurance, while the micro-setting of the capsule and tripod charges the final image. Sensory details are vivid and POV-filtered, like boots crunching rime and breath crystallizing, mirroring her grief without overt symbolism. The environment evolves causally, from brushing frost to the bloom's unfurling, supporting the accumulative atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of photographing the last bloom tightens through countdown beats, deepening with her grief and the capsule's fever, forcing stance crystallization under situational pressure. One meaningful cadence shift in the ignition narrows options, with felt cost in her rising grief and the grain's vaporization. Agency via renunciation (outlasting cold) forecloses paths with visible trade-offs, aligning with the Textural lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of extinction and fleeting time emerges through motifs like the sand grain and orchid, reweighted in the final non-literal image of the violet bloom matching the petals, inviting reflection on human absence. Subtext in gestures, like embedding the grain as a seed, adds complexity without tidy morals. Emotional aftereffect arises from particulars, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in her cataloguing fractures like love letters, and rhythmic control in countdown pacing that heightens pressure. Prose texture is distinct, with purposeful compression in reflective shards taught early and paid off at closure. No dialogue, but internal voice coheres with poetic idiom under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, sentences advancing atmosphere like "the dawning hush deepened; even the wind had forgotten how to speak," varying rhythm without loops. Figurative language is controlled, avoiding muddle in peak beats such as the bloom's unfurling. No artifacts obscure closure, with strong verbs and specific details propelling to the final click.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sci-fi relic (sand grain) with environmental melancholy transforms tropes of extinction through her purposeful curiosity and the chemical timer, feeling inevitable in the violet streak. Risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Core premise offers non-obvious angle on space-age remnants.</comment>
