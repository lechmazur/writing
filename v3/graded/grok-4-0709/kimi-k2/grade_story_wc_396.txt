<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's characterization shines with concrete interiority, embodied emotions like tasting emotions as salt, and micro-choices under pressure, such as angling mirrors to weave empathy; her calm intuition creates contradictory impulses between passive sensing and active reconstitution, earning the final acceptance with visible relational cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned glimpses in mirrors, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration in the final unified image with conceptual cost of shifted treaty dynamics; orientation anchors early in the lighthouse orchard, and closure lands on-page with the merfolk's sung reply reweighting stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The lighthouse orchard on basalt cliffs vividly anchors atmosphere, with rime-glazed trees and cracking floes constraining Mara's choices and charging the final image of lanterns on ice; sensory details like rattling branches and musical chimes evolve causally, mirroring internal calm amid tension.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of treaty preservation tightens through accumulating mirror glimpses, deepening pressure via shared emotions and culminating in stance crystallization; cost is legible in the foreclosed path of vengeance, though one more explicit trade-off could elevate agency further.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of mapping empathy onto action emerges organically from mirror-weaving particulars, offering resonant ambiguity in the final melted-stars image that reweights injury with repair without moralizing; subtext in felt voices and dulled fragment invites lingering reflection on shared pain.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable with distinct perceptual signature in intuitive, textural noticing like emotions as warm oil; prose rhythm modulates with pressure, building density in the lantern room without elision, and no dialogue present avoids evaluation pitfalls.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with rhythmic variety, such as in "floes cracked and collided below," advancing atmosphere and momentum without loops or artifacts; figurative language like "hope thin as blown glass" integrates purposefully, propelling to the resonant final line.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Ingenious synthesis of fantasy elements like merfolk and crystal fragment with vintage mirrors transforms trope of seers into a fresh empathy loom, heightening stakes through bold, organic risk-taking that feels inevitable in the treaty's germination.</comment>
