<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's skepticism and courageous kindness create contradictory impulses that drive her from doubt to curiosity, culminating in an earned emotional renunciation with visible cost in tears over her mother's death; interiority is embodied and particular, avoiding stock phrasing, as seen when memories flutter "like trapped moths" against her ribs.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through layered memories and patterns toward a Resonant Reconfiguration at dawn, with felt emotional cost in Mara's tears and promise to return; orientation anchors early in the tower and cliff, but minor lens ambiguity in early causal hints caps at 8.7 per cross-caps.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The tower and sea setting constrain Mara's choices, with the parapet and cracked steps enabling the tile's discovery and transcription; vivid, POV-filtered details like "salt wind" and whales' spouts as "brief new galaxies" charge the final image of dawn paling the horizon, meeting the 9+ test by shaping the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of escaping hollow astronomy to find wonder escalates texturally through accumulating memories and whales' song, deepening to force stance crystallization on her grief; agency in transcribing forecloses doubt with legible emotional cost in tears, but lacks a second intensification for higher band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of carrying forward entangled memories emerges organically from the tile's patterns and whales' migration, offering a resonant non-literal answer in Mara's promise to return, reweighting her skepticism into curiosity without moralizing; subtext in images like "silver scars" avoids overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable with distinct perceptual signature in Mara's skeptical gaze "daring the stars"; prose texture modulates rhythmically, as in the symphony's growing presence, with no dialogue to evaluate but clean free indirect style under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in lyrical sentences like "the dark sea heaved in slow pulses" without loops or artifacts; information advances atmosphere and character, with zero scaffold in peak beats like the transcription, meeting 9+ test fully.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of magic square tile with whale migration and entangled memories feels inevitable, transforming familiar wonder-loss trope through specific emotional truth in facing grief; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
