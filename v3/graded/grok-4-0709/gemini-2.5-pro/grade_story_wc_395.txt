<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to find her brother's deleted profile is clear and intensifies compellingly, rooted in obsessive traits that drive frantic searches and the pivotal lie to Kael, revealing embodied emotion under pressure. Interior conflict shines in contradictory impulses, like the "betrayal" felt while lying, which aligns with her values and forecloses easy paths with felt cost. The single-POV focus excels in character-particular interiority without stock phrasing, though secondary character Kael applies pressure effectively but lacks deeper status dynamics.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under a Causal lens, the structure builds through because/therefore linkages from noticing numbers to accessing the Void, culminating in a Decisive Change by forwarding the post with legible conceptual cost of corporate deceit exposed. Orientation anchors early in the archive setting, avoiding penalties. Closure lands on-page with resonant reconfiguration, though the supervisor confrontation feels slightly underplayed in narrowing options further.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The digital archive setting is vividly specific as a "silent city of abandoned profiles," with sensory details like "server noise" filtered through Elara's attentive POV, subtly mirroring her internal absence. It constrains choices, such as navigating server architecture via coordinates, and charges the final image with the patch. Atmosphere supports the tomb-like quiet, though occupational details are plausible but not deeply constraining beyond the search.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of uncovering Julian's truth escalates causally through the numbers pattern and Kael's interruption, tightening via the lie that narrows options and raises job-risk cost, leading to quarantine access. One meaningful deepening suffices, with agency in forwarding the message crystallizing stance and interweaving internal grief with external discovery. Stakes feel visceral, though the ethical calculus could sharpen the peak choice more explicitly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of hidden truths and corporate cages emerges organically from Elara's search and Julian's buried profile, resonating through images like the Seraphim-7 patch without direct statements. Subtext in the lie and final forwarding invites reflection on betrayal costs, embracing complexity with ambiguity in what follows. The ending offers a non-literal answer by repricing "deleted" as "caged," charging prior motifs effectively.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and modest, with perceptual signature in Elara's bright attentiveness noticing patterns others miss, and rhythmic control in urgent syntax during the search. Dialogue is natural, subtext-laden in the lie to Kael, advancing plot without exposition. Elision of backstory anchors in present cues, tilting stance via micro-choices like typing the password.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in metaphors like "sharp pinprick of light" that advance atmosphere without muddle, and strong verbs propel momentum. No major loops or artifacts, though occasional figurative density in descriptions borders on overwriting but pays off in peak beats. Final line resolves resonantly, recharging the patch motif cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The premise ingeniously synthesizes digital archiving with a personal cold case via astronomy coordinates as a key, transforming tropes of lost data into a fresh whistleblower tale. Risk in the quarantine reveal heightens stakes organically, feeling inevitable from Julian's obsessions. Emotional specificity avoids generics, though the corporate deceit angle echoes familiar narratives without bolder subversion.</comment>
