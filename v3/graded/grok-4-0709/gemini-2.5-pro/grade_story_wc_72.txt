<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation shifts from righteous crusade to profound clarity through embodied internal conflict, with contradictory impulses shown in her handling of the ampoule; the burial act reveals a hierarchy of values with felt cost of abandoning indoctrination. Galen's incisively kind telepathy applies pressure as a secondary character, forcing her stance crystallization. Interiority is concrete and particular, avoiding stock phrasing, though one moment of near-therapy-speak in "aching clarity" slightly softens emotional embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, revelations build density and break patterns, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration in the burial, with conceptual cost of repriced beliefs legible in the final vine pulse. Orientation anchors early in the underwater city; causality holds through motivated thought shifts without breaks. Closure lands on-page with felt cost, shaped by the persistent constraint of Galen's guidance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The forgotten underwater city garden is vividly specific, with bioluminescent flora and pearl paths constraining Mara's choices and charging the final image of the buried ampoule; sensory details like the rebreather's hiss and glowing anemone trees reflect POV urgency and mirror internal turmoil. Environment evolves causally, pressuring the climax without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of correcting a wrong tightens through cascading revelations, deepening to force stance crystallization under Accumulative/Textural lens, with visible cost in foreclosing her mission path. Agency in burying the ampoule earns the reversal; moral calculus between competing goods sharpens the peak, though one abstract stake declaration slightly dilutes visceral feel.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of welcoming nuance emerges organically from revelations and images like the gill-membrane, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in Mara's aching clarity; subtext in the ampoule's burial offers a resonant, non-literal answer repricing certainty. Emotional aftereffect lingers through complexity without false equivalence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and biased through Mara's perceptions, with telepathic "dialogue" natural, subtextual, and goal-driven; perceptual signature is distinct in selective noticing of bioluminescent details under stress. Rhythmic control heightens pressure in revelation beats, with patterned elision taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm and syntax to propel revelations; metaphors like "silt clouding beliefs" and "captive nebula" are purposeful without muddle, though one mixed vehicle in "ghost of a vast silence" slightly drags momentum. No loops or artifacts obscure closure; final line recharges motifs effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of telepathic statue and underwater sanctuary transforms discovery tropes through specific stakes in nuance vs. certainty; risk in lyric revelations heightens ingenuity without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in the burial. Avoids derivative echoes, committing to premise with authentic vision.</comment>
