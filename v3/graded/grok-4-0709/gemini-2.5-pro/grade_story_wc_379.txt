<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to mend community through listening is clear and rooted in traits, intensifying to compel the key choice at the mailbox; interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions in his patient waiting, though some stock phrasing like "familiar pull" slightly flattens contradictions. The final endurance earns stasis by foreclosing forceful solutions with felt communal cost. No second character requires status dynamics, but neighbors' contributions reveal Elias's values hierarchy effectively.</comment>
