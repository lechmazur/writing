<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong motivation rooted in curiosity and inherited memories intensifies to compel the final acceptance of knowledge; interiority is concrete through embodied sensations like the bone-chime, but emotions lean toward summary in the vow recollection, lacking simultaneous contradictory impulses in peak moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds density through escalating glimpses and plant changes to a resonant reconfiguration at the orchid's bloom, with felt cost in Lyra's dissolution; orientation anchors early in the greenhouse setting, but some memory bleeds feel like ellipsis without tightening knowledge states as sharply as possible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vivid, purposeful sensory details like chilled breath and toxic dew integrate into action, with the greenhouse constraining choices by nurturing dangerous beauty; the environment charges the final image of motes merging with night, though spatial choreography could track Elian's movements more tactilely during cameos.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of uncovering the debt escalates through textural density of visions and vibrant yet poisonous growth, culminating in knowledge transference with legible cost of lost connection; one meaningful deepening via the bead's resonances narrows options effectively, though coincidence of the bloom slightly complicates without fully resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of poisonous nurturing and cross-lifetime debts emerges organically from images like the acid dew and unfurling orchid, offering resonant ambiguity in mournful elation without moralizing; final image reweights the promise non-literally, but subtext in gestures could deepen ironic gaps further.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Consistent third-person close POV with perceptual bias in noticing plant changes and ghostly flickers; prose texture distinct in rhythmic, lyric diction that modulates with anticipation, teaching patterned elision in cameos effectively for closure legibility, with no dialogue to evaluate.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density and propulsion in concise sentences advancing atmosphere and revelation, with varied rhythm avoiding loops; figurative language like "lovingly venomous" integrates without muddle, though one paraphrase loop in memory bleeding slightly scaffolds the transition to knowing her name.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemical haunting and toxic beauty transforms ghost trope through specific bead resonances and plant catalysis; risk in textural accumulation heightens stakes organically, but premise echoes familiar reincarnation debts without fully non-obvious inflection.</comment>
