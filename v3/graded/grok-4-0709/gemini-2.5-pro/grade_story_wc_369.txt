<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and rooted in Aris's consuming need to discover tree sorrow, intensifying through patient actions like analyzing the shard; interiority is concrete and embodied, with contradictory impulses in his isolation versus archival fulfillment. The final placement forecloses oblivion with a felt conceptual cost, earning stasis. Single-POV strengths shine in micro-choices under storm pressure, though some traits feel slightly abstracted without deeper flaw complication.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through patterned images and cadence shifts, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where archiving the shard reprices sorrow with undeniable conceptual cost in the final mosaic click. Orientation anchors early in the tower with storm details. One meaningful deepening via the lightning-enabled healing tightens the process without causality breaks, and the cost is legible in the shard's transformed glow.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stormlit tower anchors vividly early, with moonlight and rain constraining analysis and charging the healing climax; sensory details like wet earth scent and fractured light are purposeful, mirroring internal sorrow. The micro-setting of the sextant and slate plate evolves causally, heightening the final image's resonance. Environment directly shapes the closure by enabling the shard's acceptance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of archiving tree sorrow signals early and deepens via the shard's discovery and deconstruction, with agency in Aris's choices narrowing options under storm pressure. Under Accumulative lens, density increases to reweight cost in the healing moment, though the price feels more conceptual than visceral. Coincidence of lightning complicates without resolving, forcing stance crystallization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of giving sorrow a home emerges organically from images like dust motes and tree memories, resisting tidy morals through complex ambiguity in acceptance. The final mosaic image offers a resonant, non-literal repricing of grief's density without statement. Subtext in silent archivists deepens emotional honesty, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in sorrow-focused noticing, and rhythmic prose modulates with storm intensity. No dialogue, but purposeful compression in dream-map description is taught and paid off at closure. Prose texture feels singular, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm naturally and avoiding loops, as in the precise "tink" inciting sound advancing momentum. Figurative language like "crystallized despair" integrates without muddle, propelling to closure. Minor scaffold in early description slightly pads, but peak beats remain clear and propelled.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of quantified sorrow and tree witnessing transforms familiar isolation tropes through specific, inevitable turns like moonlight healing, heightening stakes organically. Risk in lyric accumulative structure pays off without gimmickry, committing to premise's implications. The core angle feels memorable and non-obvious in hindsight.</comment>
