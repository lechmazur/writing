<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies through her acts, rooted in a consistent trait of noticing creeping normality, with embodied emotions like her hammering heart during the placement; the realization reconfigures her understanding with a felt conceptual cost, earning the endurance of her mission.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned elisions and image density to a Conceptual Repricing closure where Elara's realization reweights her actions' purpose, with conceptual cost in shifting from sanctifying houses to awakening people; orientation anchors early in the walk, and one meaningful cadence shift suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The quiet bay in spring is vividly specific with salt-heavy air and nascent blossoms, filtering through Elara's bias to mirror her internal state; the setting constrains her stealthy acts and charges the final image of stirring life, with the white cube house as a micro-setting that pressures her desperate attempt.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of combating deadness tightens through her placement of the orris root, deepening via realization to a cadence shift under the Accumulative lens; agency in her renunciation of old beliefs forecloses the prior path with legible conceptual cost in the observed changes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of disrupting sterility through small, startling questions emerges organically from Elara's acts and realization, with subtext in images like the orris root's chaos; the final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer by repricing her interventions as invitations to life, embracing complexity without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature in poetic, selective noticing like "streetlights daydreamed"; voice texture in rhythmic, purposeful syntax heightens emotional beats, with no dialogue to evaluate but consistent elision taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in lyrical sentences like the opening glow bleeding into sky; no significant loops or artifacts, though some metaphors border on ornate without muddle; final line resolves by recharging motifs with propulsion intact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis in conceptualizing small displacements as "shards of hush" to combat creeping normality, transforming trope of quiet rebellion through specific, organic details like the orris root; risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable at the realization.</comment>
