<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elian's motivation to prove coincidences have meaning is clear and intensifies through visions and assembly, compelling the high-stakes placement of the shard; interiority is concrete and embodied, with contradictory impulses vividly shown in the wavering resolve before pressing the shard into place, earning the final endurance with felt loneliness as cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds density through visions and calculations toward a resonant reconfiguration at the beacon's thrum, with on-page closure via the lavender beam reweighting silence into connection; orientation anchors early in the pavilion, but minor ellipsis in assembly feels slightly unmotivated without stronger causal links, though it doesn't harm the ending cadence shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The glass humming pavilion is vividly specific, serving as observatory and lens that constrains Elian's star-tracking method and charges the final image of the pulsing light; fractured plains and bruised twilight mirror isolation, with sensory details filtered through his obsessive bias, evolving causally as starlight pours in during the alignment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of rekindling the beacon tightens meaningfully under Accumulative/Textural lens through the century-rare alignment, forcing stance crystallization with felt loneliness as cost; agency drives the assembly, but coincidence of the star conjunction complicates without fully resolving, slightly diluting escalation purity at the climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of finding hidden design in chaos emerges organically from visions and star arcs, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer via the fragile lavender beam that reweights the premise of silence as pause, not end; subtext in the thistle-blown hope avoids tidy morals, embracing ambiguity with emotional honesty in Elian's profound loneliness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in Elian's obsessive, retrocognitive lens on the prism; prose texture modulates rhythmically under pressure, as in the suffocating void of the shard, with no head-hopping or unwarranted certainty, though minor filter verbs in visions slightly dull immediacy without voice motivation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied rhythm, as in the starlight striping the floor, advancing atmosphere and character without loops or scaffold; metaphors like thistle seed in rubble are controlled and purposeful, but occasional elevated diction in visions risks register drift, though it doesn't obscure the closure beam's clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-apocalyptic retrocognition with cosmic mapping transforms familiar isolation tropes through Elian's star-arc obsession, feeling inevitable in the alignment's payoff; risk in faith-based rekindling heightens stakes organically, but premise echoes standard beacon-revival arcs without bolder subversion.</comment>
