<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation from grief to purposeful aid is clear and intensifies through micro-choices like crafting the crane, rooted in embodied emotion; the woman's arc mirrors his effectively, with their shared vulnerability at the climax revealing values with felt cost. Interiority avoids stock phrasing, showing contradictory impulses in his slow deliberation versus sudden need to help. Flaws complicate choices authentically, as his blind spot for his own healing drives the interaction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds density through patterned origami deliveries, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration in the shared constellation moment with conceptual cost of reframed grief; orientation anchors early in the observatory. Causality holds via motivated ellipses, with one meaningful cadence shift at the dais tightening options. Closure lands on-page with visible emotional reconfiguration, though the "weeks later" epilogue slightly dilutes immediacy without breaking lens coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The timeless observatory is vividly specific, with curtains of intention constraining choices and charging the final projection; sensory details like polished obsidian and humming silence reflect POV bias and evolve causally. Micro-setting of the workbench and telescopes guides action purposefully, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism. Environment directly enables the climax, satisfying the 9+ test by shaping the closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of transforming grief escalates via accumulative pressure of origami sequences, with one meaningful deepening at the lotus message forcing stance crystallization; cost is legible in Elias's vulnerability during the projection. Agency through renunciation of isolation forecloses solitude with felt emotional price. Coincidence of her arrival complicates but doesn't resolve, aligning with lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of grief blooming into renewal emerges organically from cosmic images and actions, with subtext in folded symbols inviting reflection on loss's persistence; the final image offers a resonant, non-literal repricing of stars as enduring patterns without moralizing. Emotional honesty avoids sentimentality, embracing complexity in shared sorrow.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and character-specific, with perceptual signature in Elias's jewelry-maker precision; voice texture modulates rhythmically under grief's pressure. Minimal dialogue is natural and subtextual, advancing the reveal of her brother's love for stars. No head-hopping or unwarranted certainty, satisfying the 9+ test with taught elision in silent observations paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm and syntax to propel emotional beats, like the vivid "cosmic flower blossoming from a dying star"; no loops, artifacts, or overwrought figures obscure clarity. Information advances character and atmosphere efficiently, with strong verbs and specific details. Opening anchors voice, final line recharges motifs resonantly, meeting 9+ with zero scaffold and propulsion under pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of grief, origami, and artificial cosmos feels inevitable, transforming tropes through specific details like the vellum stencil's evolution; risk in subdued, accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Fresh angle on healing avoids generics, committing to premise with authentic vision.</comment>
