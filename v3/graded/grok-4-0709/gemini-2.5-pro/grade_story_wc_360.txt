<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to decode emotions mathematically drives his interactions compellingly, with his habitual borrowing of personalities shown through voice shifts like mimicking Anya's rasp, revealing character under pressure; Anya's grief is embodied in her clutching the photograph and final dizzying shock, though her interiority lacks deeper contradictory impulses in scene, slightly limiting emotional progression.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through patterned metaphors and density of cosmic imagery toward a resonant reconfiguration in the final card presentation, with conceptual cost legible in Anya's recontextualized grief; orientation anchors early with the topaz workshop and Elias at the press, and closure lands on-page as Conceptual Repricing with felt disorientation, though one minor ellipsis in the press's operation feels under-motivated.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The topaz walls catching starlight and the workshop's shimmering air vividly anchor the setting, with sensory details like clicking type and pulsing halo fragment constraining Elias's actions and charging the final shadows' geometry; this micro-setting evolves causally, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism, and directly shapes the closure by rewriting the room during the press activation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the dominant stake of transposing Anya's grief escalates through density of alien, geometric sensations during the press sequence, culminating in a cadence shift that reweights her emotion with conceptual cost; one meaningful deepening occurs as the air thickens with her sorrow, forcing stance crystallization, though coincidence in the halo's flare slightly complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of emotion as mathematical structure emerges organically from the press's transposition and the fractal symbol, inviting reflection on grief's recontextualization without tidy morals; subtext in Elias's ambiguity and the nebula-like ink offers resonant ambiguity, with the final image providing a non-literal answer that reweights the premise, though one overt statement like "empathy is a mirror" borders on directness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person voice maintains stable distance with distinct perceptual signature in cosmic, geometric diction, modulating rhythm from precise echoes to swirling turbulence under pressure; dialogue carries subtext and advances the concept, like Elias's ambiguous "structure requires pressure," with purposeful elision in emotional borrowing taught early and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with vivid, multi-job sentences like the walls holding light "like honey in a jar," varying rhythm naturally without loops or scaffold; figurative language coheres in peak beats, such as the vortex of lucid turbulence, propelling momentum to the resonant thud, though one mixed metaphor in "dry rasp mimicking unshed tears" slightly muddles clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The premise of printing emotions as fractals via celestial ink offers fresh synthesis of sci-fi and psychological depth, transforming tropes through specific details like the halo fragment and borrowed personalities; risk-taking in ambiguous, textural buildup heightens stakes organically, feeling inevitable at the card's reveal, with no close echoes of familiar scenes.</comment>
