<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael's motivation to map empathy onto action is clear and intensifies through his intuitive process, with embodied emotions like the "familiar pull of a schism" revealing internal conflict; Jorn and Mara's traits emerge through actions and visions, showing flaws and fears without stereotypes; the resolution earns a reconfiguration by confronting shared pains, with visible costs in Mara's weary slump and the community's fragile sigh.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under a Causal lens, the plot advances through because/therefore linkages from accusation to visions to resolution, with orientation anchored early in the lighthouse orchard; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration via the revealed truth, reweighting the stake with felt emotional cost in the final shuddering sigh; one meaningful tightening suffices, though the visions feel slightly elliptical without deeper causal friction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The frost-rimmed apple boughs and shifting ice floes create a vivid, purposeful atmosphere of fragility, constraining choices like Jorn's secret mending; sensory details like frozen air and pluming breath are selective and POV-filtered, mirroring internal chills; the setting charges the final image by underscoring the community's precarious existence above the grinding ice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of community fracture signals early and tightens causally through Kael's visions, narrowing options to truth-revelation; pressure coheres under the Causal lens, with one deepening via past traumas forcing stance crystallization; cost is legible in the emotional drain and foreclosed accusation, though coincidence in visions slightly complicates without fully resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of empathy mapping onto action emerges organically from visions reconstituting the past, resisting tidy morals through complex fears; subtext in silences and gazes invites reflection on shared fragility; the final sigh offers a resonant, non-literal reconfiguration of loss without stated moral, reweighting prior accusations.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV on Kael is stable, with perceptual signature in intuitive drifts and biased noticing of emotions; voice texture is distinct in rhythmic, metaphorical prose like "sharp edges and bitter weight," modulating with intensity; dialogue is natural, subtext-laden, and advances plot, distinguishing characters without excess.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in sentences like the opening accusation; some overwriting in stacked metaphors (e.g., "stone cast into a deep well") muddles without payoff, triggering minor deduction; no major loops or artifacts obscure closure, and propulsion advances through vivid images.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The premise of a shadow-laced peacekeeper using mirror glimpses for empathy offers fresh synthesis in a lighthouse orchard, transforming mediation tropes through specific visions; risk in magical intuition heightens stakes organically, feeling inevitable at the resolution sigh; avoids stock echoes with particular emotional truths.</comment>
