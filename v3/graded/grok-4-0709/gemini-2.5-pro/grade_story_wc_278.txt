<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elian's motivation to silence guilt is clear and intensifies through concrete interiority, with embodied emotions like the "low-frequency hum" driving choices; contradictory impulses shine in recognizing his own script in the letters, revealing internal conflict without stock phrasing. The final renunciation of hiding scars earns a meaningful change, foreclosing evasion with felt cost in the etching scene. Relationships are absent, so no penalty there.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through motif density (stars, hush, amber) with one meaningful cadence shift at the screen's slowing text, leading to Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the voice rests with conceptual cost of confronted guilt. Orientation anchors early in the studio scene. Minor ellipsis in transitions feels motivated but could tighten causality slightly at the lab entry.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, purposeful details like the "city as a silent, sprawling nebula" and lab's "concrete monolith" filter through Elian's POV, with the amber as a recurring object constraining the etching choice and charging the final tombstone image. Sensory hierarchy narrows under pressure, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of hushing guilt tightens through one deepening at the screen's text, forcing agency in etching with visible cost of reliving anguish; under Accumulative/Textural lens, pattern break reweights options effectively. Coincidence of finding letters complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of reconciling lost connections emerges organically from motifs like Lyra constellation and amber, culminating in resonant final image of the leather tattoo as peaceful memorial without stated moral. Subtext in the screen's shifting words invites reflection on guilt's persistence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Consistent close-third POV with distinct perceptual signature in star-tracing and hush motifs; prose texture modulates rhythm under pressure, like the etching's deliberate syntax. No dialogue, so no issues there; minor compression in memory elision is taught and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density and propulsion in lines like "his needle a whisper against skin," with varied rhythm and no loops or artifacts; metaphors cohere without muddle, advancing atmosphere in peak beats like the screen's final word. Information packs multiple jobs, especially in the amber's dual role.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tattooing constellations with haunted audio translation transforms grief tropes through specific ingenuity, like etching circuitry as star-map; risk in lyric motifs heightens stakes organically, feeling inevitable at the "Papa" closure.</comment>
