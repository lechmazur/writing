<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Silas's motivation to protect the fragile intimacy is rooted in consistent traits of reticence and routine, intensifying compellingly to drive his storm journey and repair; interiority is concrete and embodied, with contradictory impulses like dread and mechanical focus layering realistically under pressure. The final renunciation of the connection carries a felt emotional cost in the "luminescent ache," earning the stasis through prior causality. No stock phrasing mars the character-specific micro-choices, such as building the stone circle as farewell.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Hybrid (Causal dominant early, shifting to Accumulative/Textural at closure); the structure follows clear because/therefore linkages from light failure to repair and farewell, with orientation anchored early in Silas's porch watch. Closure is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration via Earned Stasis, with the stone circle and sea glass image reweighting the bond's end at a felt emotional cost. Minor slip in unmotivated ellipsis of the keeper's departure, but it doesn't break causality or obscure the on-page cost in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The lighthouse and sea settings are vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like churning foam and slick stairs filtered through Silas's seafaring bias, constraining choices like the perilous ascent. The recurring sea glass object charges the final image, reweighting the emotional ache. Tone tensions the storm's frenzy against the intimate silence, supporting theme without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of protecting the connection signals early and tightens meaningfully through the ascent and discovery, forcing stance crystallization under Hybrid lens pressure; the note's revelation deepens cost, foreclosing the bond with visible emotional price in the ache. Agency drives the repair and stone message as renunciation, with one credible deepening sufficient at length. Coincidence of the storm complicates but doesn't resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of fragile, silent intimacy amid isolation emerges organically from stones, notes, and sea glass motifs, culminating in a resonant, non-literal farewell that reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext in gestures like pocketed glass and final beam refraction invites reflection on unspoken bonds' cost. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality through embodied ache.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable and apt, with perceptual signature biased toward tactile sea details and emotional compression under stress; prose texture in rhythmic, economical syntax reflects Silas's reticent mind. No dialogue present, so policy skips evaluation; elision of keeper's full backstory is purposeful and paid off in closure without withholding for suspense.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere and character through vivid verbs like "bucked" and "churning" without loops or scaffold; rhythm varies naturally, accelerating in the ascent and breathing in the lantern room. Figurative language, such as the beam as "heartbeat," is controlled and payoff-driven in the final image. No artifacts obscure closure, though one near-redundant stem ("he" openings) in the repair beat is minor and doesn't dull propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Originality shines in the invented stone-language and anonymous chain as fresh synthesis for silent intimacy, transforming lighthouse tropes through specific emotional specificity and risk-taking quiet closure. Core premise commits to implications without retreat, with the sea glass reprise feeling inevitable in hindsight. No close echoes of famous scenes, though familiar isolation motif is personalized via embodied choices.</comment>
