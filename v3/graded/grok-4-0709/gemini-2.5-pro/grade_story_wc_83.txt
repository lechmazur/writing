<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Amal's motivation is clear and intensifies through grief-fueled calculations, with embodied emotions like white knuckles and a cold dense star in her chest revealing contradictory impulses under pressure; interiority is concrete and particular, avoiding stock phrasing, though the single-POV limits relationship crucibles.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds density through reflective shards and data sifting to a Conceptual Repricing closure where the discovery reweights her grief with a trajectory, carrying conceptual cost in the persistent wound; orientation anchors early in the observatory, with one meaningful cadence shift sufficient for length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The orbital observatory is vividly anchored with tactile details like ticking capacitors and panoramic viewport, constraining choices via cooling breakers that pressure the timeframe; the geode as recurring object charges the final image, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of hunting unused potential tightens under the cooling breakers' time pressure, deepening to a stance crystallization in the discovery; cost is felt in the grief's trajectory, though escalation relies on internal accumulation rather than external reversals, fitting the lens but with modest agency in the final reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of diverted potential emerges organically from the perturbation metaphor and geode's resonance, offering a non-literal answer in the shimmering frequency that reweights loss without moralizing; subtext in the intangibly tangible echoes enriches ambiguity, though reflection borders on excess without fully tilting present stance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with perceptual bias in scientific-grief fusion, voice textured by rhythmic metaphors like "white-hot shriek" that modulate under stress; no dialogue, so policy skips those bullets; purposeful compression in equations teaches pattern, paying off at closure without elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied rhythm, strong verbs, and integrated metaphors like the pond analogy advancing atmosphere; minor synonym churn in grief descriptions ("cold, dense star") dulls slightly but doesn't obscure closure; high density in peak beats like the cascading solution, with clean mechanics.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of quantum physics and grief as "theft on a cosmic scale" transforms familiar loss tropes through specific perturbation method and geode motif, feeling inevitable in the resonant frequency discovery; risk in lyric-scientific voice heightens stakes without gimmickry, committing to premise implications.</comment>
