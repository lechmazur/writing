<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Aris's motivation to rescue truth is clear and intensifies through precise, measured dialogue that compels Elara's higher-stakes choice; Elara's internal conflict shows contradictory impulses in her steady voice versus the millstone-like weight shift, embodied without stock phrasing. The relationship under pressure forces a status shift at closure with felt cost. Minor weakness in limited interiority for Aris, but the final renunciation is earned by prior parallels without unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density increasing through layered parallels, culminating in a Decisive Change as Elara hands over the vellum with legible conceptual cost of abandoning the noble lie. Orientation anchors early in the terminus setting after the petal falls. Structure builds causally within one continuous scene, with one meaningful deepening via the Ashworth parallel that narrows options; no causality breaks, though ellipsis in her resignation is motivated.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The disused station with ivy and dust motes is vivid and purposeful, filtered through Aris's perceptive bias; recurring ivy mirrors internal suffocation and charges the final image by symbolizing the lie's slow strangulation. Sensory details evolve with action, constraining the conversational pressure without overt symbolism. Atmosphere supports the theme of decayed myths, with spatial choreography coherent in the bench setup.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of truth versus peace tightens accumulatively through parallels, forcing Elara's stance crystallization with visible cost in her resigned click; one meaningful deepening via the Ashworth famine narrows options under coherent pressure. Agency in Aris's method drives escalation without coincidence resolving it. Moral calculus sharpens the choice between competing goods, though internal-external interweave is optional and lightly present.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of noble lies' structural weakness emerges organically from parallels and ivy imagery, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in the looming disaster; subtext in silence and gestures invites reflection on authenticity. The final image of the vellum sliding across offers a resonant, non-literal repricing of the accord without stated moral. Emotional aftereffect arises from Elara's millstone realization, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited to Aris is mostly stable but slips into Elara's interiority at "millstone," an unmotivated head-hop that briefly obscures focalization. Prose texture is distinct with rhythmic control in metaphors like "hungry thing," and dialogue carries subtext through indirection, distinguishing voices. Perceptual signature biases toward historical excavation; no unwarranted withholding, but the slippage prevents higher band.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in poetic openers like the spiraling petal without loops or scaffold; metaphors are coherent and propel momentum, such as ivy suffocation enhancing atmosphere. No artifacts obscure closure, with strong verbs and specific details advancing every line. Opening anchors voice, final line resolves by charged action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of noble lies with historical parallels transforms trope through specific Ashworth details and ivy motif, feeling inevitable in hindsight; emotional complexity in Elara's resignation avoids generics. Core premise offers non-obvious angle on foundational myths without echoes of famous scenes. Risk in quiet, argument-driven structure heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
