<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kaelen's motivation to restore silence is clear and rooted in his role as mapkeeper, with embodied emotions like old bones protesting and internalizing the ice pattern showing contradictory impulses under pressure; interiority is concrete and particular, avoiding stock phrasing, though the single-POV limits relationship crucibles.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, with textural build-up of noise leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration in the bloom of hush, a Charged Poise restoring harmony with felt cost in the terrifying intensification and cave shudder; causality holds through motivated actions like extracting ice, and orientation anchors early in the harmonic caves.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The harmonic caves and Chamber of First Frost are vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like cold air sharpening the hum constraining Kaelen's choices and charging the final quiet; the echo chamber stone as micro-setting evolves causally, mirroring internal peace without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of finding quiet escalates texturally through intensifying hum and a meaningful deepening in the ice examination, narrowing options to the conjuring ritual; agency in releasing the pattern drives the Charged Poise closure with legible cost in the flare and shudder, though coincidence of energy beings complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of seeking profound quiet amid dissonance emerges organically from ice patterns and the bloom, culminating in a resonant final image of earned repose that reweights the premise without moralizing; subtext in silence as textured presence invites reflection, though ambiguity is more conceptual than complex.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in sensory biases like angular hum and weary light; prose texture in rhythmic, patterned diction fits the textural lens, teaching compression early and paying off at closure without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied rhythm and strong verbs, advancing atmosphere through metaphors like "bloom of hush" without loops or scaffold; some figurative density in peak beats like the flare risks muddle but pays off in clarity at the profound quiet, with clean grammar and high information density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original synthesis of mapkeeper role and ice-crack ritual transforms familiar silence-seeking trope into a fresh, inevitable reconfiguration; risk in poetic compression heightens stakes organically, with authentic vision in conceptual hush avoiding derivative templates.</comment>
