<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyel's motivation is deeply rooted in homesickness and guardianship, with embodied contradictions like the ache as his only warmth driving micro-choices under pressure. The final renunciation earns its cost through prior temptation, foreclosing home for earned stasis. Interiority avoids stock phrasing mostly, but "deep, resonant ache" borders on cliché without fuller embodiment in the climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through textural density and pattern breaks, culminating in resonant reconfiguration via earned stasis with felt cost in the portal's closure. Orientation anchors early in the garden and library. Closure lands on-page with the rift sealing and ache reconfigured, shaped by persistent homesickness constraint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The frozen garden's mist and skeletal roses vividly anchor atmosphere, constraining Lyel's choices and charging the final image of swirling mist as peace. Sensory details are selective, POV-biased, and evolve causally, mirroring internal fog without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of homesickness vs. guardianship tightens meaningfully at the portal, forcing stance crystallization with legible cost under textural lens. Agency in pouring longing into the pendant forecloses the path home, a deepening that reweights options. Coincidence of cultists complicates but doesn't resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of embracing uncertainty emerges organically from images like mist and the pendant's temptation, culminating in a resonant final image that reweights waiting without moralizing. Subtext in gestures and implications invites reflection on loss. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality through complex acceptance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature in feral, sensory details; prose texture modulates rhythmically under pressure. No dialogue to evaluate, but voice coherence holds without elision issues. Psychic distance shifts intentionally at the portal for emotional intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied rhythm, but some figurative overload in peak beats like "violent, shrieking edges" muddles without payoff. No loops or artifacts obscure closure; sentences advance atmosphere efficiently. Final line recharges motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dimensional homesickness and guardianship transforms familiar exile tropes through specific mist and pendant details, feeling inevitable. Risk in quiet renunciation heightens stakes organically without gimmickry.</comment>
