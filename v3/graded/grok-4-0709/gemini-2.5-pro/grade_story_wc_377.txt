<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elian's motivation to preserve wonder is clear and rooted in his traits as the last tuner, intensifying through his focused work on the ice; interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions like feeling the song in his palms and calm satisfaction at the end. No contradictory impulses act simultaneously, but his endurance forecloses distraction with the cost of absolute silence, earning the resolution. The single-POV baseline is met strongly, though the lack of internal conflict limits depth slightly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds density through Elian's carving process to a cadence shift when the wind activates the sculpture, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration with the cost of the ice's self-destruction legible in the mist and melting. Orientation anchors who, where, and when by the first paragraph without debt. Closure lands on-page with felt cost, holding the lens without contradiction, though one more persistent constraint could elevate it further.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The whispering bluff above clouds is vividly anchored early, with sensory details like keening wind and pearlescent sky filtered through Elian's priorities, constraining his work as an open workshop. The environment charges the final image, with the updraft enabling the symphony's release and mist rising, meeting the 9+ test. Micro-setting of the ice itself functions as setting, evolving causally and mirroring his internal focus.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving wonder tightens through the carving process under Accumulative/Textural lens, with a meaningful deepening when the wind arrives, forcing the sculpture's activation and self-destruction as cost. Agency is in Elian's endurance and design, narrowing options with the seasonal timing, though coincidence of the wind complicates without resolving. The cost is unmistakable in the melting ice at climax, driving the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of translating fading truths into symphonies emerges organically from Elian's work and the ice's sacrifice, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in the grey world's knowing versus wonder. The final image of the dwindling ice offers a resonant, non-literal answer to preserving joy, reweighting the premise without statement. Subtext in silence and self-destruction enriches complexity, though a stronger counter-reading could deepen it.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with distinct perceptual signature in Elian's sensory focus on ice and wind, and rhythmic control accelerating in the symphony's crescendo without elision issues. No dialogue, so policy skips those bullets; prose texture in syntax and diction reflects his muted vigor under pressure. Meets 9+ test with no head-hopping and purposeful compression in the building sequence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere through vivid images like "frozen tears" and "lattice of frozen light," varying rhythm naturally without loops or scaffold. Minor figurative muddle in "symphonies of truth" at opening feels slightly abstract but doesn't obscure closure. Information propulsion is strong, with final line recharging motifs, though one template cadence in the working description deducts lightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise of a mute tuner shaping ice into truth-symphonies offers fresh synthesis of silence, sculpture, and wonder, feeling inevitable with the self-destructing mobile transforming familiar elements. Risk in the poetic, textural buildup heightens stakes without gimmickry, meeting the 9+ test. No derivative echoes, with authenticity in the singular vision of a grey world renewed.</comment>
