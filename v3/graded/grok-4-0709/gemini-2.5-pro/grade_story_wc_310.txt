<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kael's motivation to wavelength align is clear and intensifies compellingly, rooted in traits like quiet enthusiasm and stellar doubt that create contradictory impulses in scene, such as his hesitation before committing power. Interiority is concrete and embodied, with emotions like doubt gnawing at his stomach during the recalibration beat. The final renunciation of his original purpose earns a meaningful endurance with felt conceptual cost, aligning with Earned Stasis. Quick test satisfied through on-page contradictions and earned closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with density building through static interpretation to a pattern break in the emerging signal, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing where Kael reweights his purpose with undeniable conceptual cost in the final listening image. Orientation anchors who, where, and when by the first paragraph, avoiding any debt. Closure lands on-page with legible cost, though the accumulative buildup could tighten slightly more causally in the hours of waiting. Persistent constraint of the coin system shapes tactics effectively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The ambered observatory deck is vividly specific, with sensory details like shimmering fields and humming consoles filtered through Kael's priorities, constraining choices like power diversion that risks sensors. Atmosphere of cosmic crush mirrors his internal doubt, evolving causally as the field flickers. Environment charges the final image of listening to ghosts, satisfying the 9+ test. Selective, purpose-driven detail enhances immersion without excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of finding resonance or facing madness signals early and deepens through the recalcitrant pulse, with a meaningful tightening in committing to recalibration that narrows options and raises burnout cost. Under Accumulative/Textural lens, pressure coheres via density increase to the signal fracture, driven by agency with unmistakable on-page cost in the conceptual shift. Quick test met, though coincidence of the coin draw slightly complicates without resolving. One credible loss (potential isolation) alters tactics visibly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of curating the past amid universal end emerges organically from events like distilling echoes and the prophecy's reinterpretation, inviting reflection through ambiguity in Kael's role without confusion. Subtext in the coin as "uncoining the void" reweights the premise non-literally in the final image, satisfying the 9+ test. Emotional aftereffect of awe avoids sentimentality, tied to concrete struggle. Resists tidy morals, embracing complexity in purpose's reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable and apt, with perceptual signature biased toward cosmic interpretation, like teasing signals from static. Prose texture is distinct in rhythmic, lyric syntax that modulates with intensity, teaching patterned compression early and paying off at closure. No dialogue, so policy skips; no head-hopping or elision issues. Quick test met with rhythmic control under pressure in the signal emergence beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, sentences advancing atmosphere and character through vivid images like "crush of bruised light," varying rhythm naturally without loops or artifacts. Figurative language is controlled, avoiding muddle in peak beats like the signal fracture. Information propulsion is strong, with no scaffold or redundancy; final line recharges motifs effectively. Quick test satisfied, though one dense sentence in the universe description borders on overwriting without harming clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Core premise of coin-based decisions at universe's end offers fresh synthesis, transforming tropes like prophecy through specific details like the Sol coin's significance. Risk-taking in lyric, conceptual closure heightens stakes organically, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Authenticity coheres in singular vision of resonance with ghosts. Quick test met with non-obvious ingenuity in "uncoining the void."</comment>
