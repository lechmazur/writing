<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lena's motivation is clear and intensifies through her obsession with the numbers and personal void, culminating in a credible endurance that accepts the absence with felt emotional cost. Interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions like the shiver down her spine revealing contradictory impulses in her self-realization moment. However, some stock phrasing in emotional descriptions, such as "burning need," slightly flattens specificity under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned numbers and metadata scans, leading to a Conceptual Repricing closure where files are archived, not deleted, with conceptual cost in Lena's transformed perception. Orientation anchors early in the dimly lit room, avoiding penalties. However, causality feels loose with redundant number appearances that loop without always advancing knowledge, diluting the pattern break at the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The social network archive is vividly rendered with sensory details like dusty hard drives and whispers of the past, filtered through Lena's investigative bias, creating atmosphere that mirrors her sense of absence. Details evolve with her journey, such as numbers in metadata, subtly guiding choices. Yet, the setting doesn't strongly constrain a key decision or charge the final image, limiting higher bands per the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of uncovering the truth tightens once through the numbers forming a map, deepening pressure via the cryptic message, under Accumulative/Textural lens. Cost is felt in her realization of self-deception, reweighting options. However, escalation remains somewhat static with repetitive number sightings that don't force a stark trade-off, and coincidence in the message complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of digital absence and rediscovery emerges organically from Lena's quest, with subtext in recurring numbers implying ghostly persistence, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer that reweights loss as potential. The final image of lingering echoes offers purposeful ambiguity without confusion. Emotional aftereffect is concrete, avoiding sentimentality through her transformed wonder.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in Lena's attentive scans and biased noticing of numbers, modulating rhythm under obsession's pressure. Prose texture is distinct with purposeful repetition taught early, paying off in the pattern. No dialogue present, so no evaluation there; minor register drift into abstract phrasing like "digital abyss" slightly jars the voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Prose is evocative with varied rhythm and selective imagery, but paraphrase loops around number appearances (e.g., "appearing everywhere – in timestamps, metadata, IP addresses") create redundancy, triggering -0.6 artifact penalty. Information density is moderate, with some sentences advancing atmosphere effectively, like the shiver line. No major clarity issues at closure, but template cadence in repetitive stems dulls propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes corporate archive mystery with sci-fi elements like the spaceship patch in a fresh way, transforming missing persons trope through digital legacy and personal void. Risk in the accumulative structure heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry. However, some echoes of familiar conspiracy motifs aren't fully personalized, limiting ingenuity.</comment>
