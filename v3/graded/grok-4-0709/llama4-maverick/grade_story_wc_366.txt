<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The skipper's warmly observant trait is embodied through specific observations like noticing the sea glass's glow and the letters' eerie effect, driving micro-choices such as pocketing the glass and stacking stones. Motivation to protect the lighthouse feels consistent and intensifies toward resolve, with the luminescent ache as a felt cost in the final stacking ritual. However, interiority leans on somewhat stock phrasing like "pang of recognition" without sharper contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The ending renunciation of isolation through the cairn earns credibility but lacks a bolder flaw complicating the choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through layered images from the lamp outage to stone-stacking, culminating in a Charged Poise closure where the skipper's resolve reconfigures his ache into peace with felt conceptual cost in embracing sorrow. Orientation anchors early with the skipper at the lantern room gazing at the sea. Causality is loose but coherent via textural density, with one meaningful deepening in the cairn ritual shifting cadence. Minor slip in unmotivated letter introduction, but it doesn't break closure linkage.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The haunted lantern room and rocky shore are vividly specific, with dusty prisms and chilling air constraining the skipper's meditative actions and charging the final cairn's ethereal glow. Sensory details like the sea glass's weight and waves' rhythm filter through POV bias, mirroring internal longing without overt symbolism. Environment evolves causally from tower descent to shore, guiding the stacking choice. The micro-setting of the sea glass recurs to charge the ending image, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the dominant stake of protecting the lighthouse's safety escalates through pattern break in the stone-stacking ritual, deepening the ache into resolve with felt cost. One meaningful cadence shift narrows options, forcing stance crystallization on the shore. However, pressure remains somewhat abstract, with the anonymous letters complicating but not testing the stake concretely. The ending reconfiguration lands with agency in the cairn, but coincidence of the glass find feels ornamental rather than complicating.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of embracing luminescent sorrow amid darkness emerges organically from images like the flickering lamp and glowing cairn, inviting reflection on safety's fragility without moralizing. Subtext in the stone-stacking ritual implies longing and connection, reweighting the premise in the final dawn-like ache. Emotional aftereffect is concrete via the ache's spread, avoiding sentimentality. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to bottling safety, meeting the 9+ test but with slight thematic drift in the letters' underdeveloped role.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and modest, with perceptual signature in warmly observant details like the sea glass's dawn-like blue, modulating rhythm under emotional pressure. Prose texture is distinct in rhythmic, flowing syntax that breathes with meditative beats, such as the descent and stacking. No dialogue, so policy skips those bullets; elision in whispers of spirits is patterned and pays off in the haunted tone. Minor register drift in abstract phrases like "luminescent ache" slightly jars the voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere through vivid images like the sea glass glowing "with an inner light," and varying rhythm in meditative stacking beats. Sentence propulsion accelerates in the resolution, with strong verbs and specific nouns; no major loops or artifacts obscure clarity. However, minor paraphrase redundancy in repeating the ache's luminescence dulls momentum slightly in the final third. Opening anchors voice effectively, and final line recharges motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes lighthouse isolation with stone-stacking ritual in a fresh, non-obvious way, transforming trope of haunted beacon through the skipper's ache and cairn as bold risk that heightens emotional stakes. Details like the blue sea glass feel particular and memorable, arising from character observation. However, echoes of familiar maritime mysticism (e.g., spirits and anonymous letters) lack bolder subversion. Originality shines in the textural ache's dawn metaphor, but swappability with similar symbols limits ingenuity.</comment>
