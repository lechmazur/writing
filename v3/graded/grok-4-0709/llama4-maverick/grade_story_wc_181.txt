<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The curator's motivation for curiosity and knowledge pursuit is clear and intensifies toward the breakthrough, but interiority relies on stock phrasing like "felt their mind expanding" without embodied contradiction; the final realization feels unearned as it lacks prior internal conflict, though micro-choices like picking up the shell and following the figures reveal values under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through sensory and realizations to a Conceptual Repricing closure with felt cost in the shifted worldview, but causality is loose with unmotivated elements like the bathroom meeting; orientation anchors early in the astral orchard, yet the ending's book handover feels like a soft reset without tightening pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The astral orchard on a lonely asteroid is vividly sensory with shimmering blossoms and scents that mirror the curator's disquiet, evolving to bloom more vibrantly post-breakthrough; details like the grove and bathroom integrate into action, constraining choices, though the bathroom's dim lighting contrasts oddly without fully charging the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake in pursuing forbidden knowledge tightens once through the breakthrough, but escalation under the Accumulative/Textural lens lacks a meaningful deepening or cost legibility, as the realization resolves without foreclosing options; the robed figures provide coherent pressure, yet coincidence drives the encounter without protagonist agency narrowing paths.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme of nonlinear knowledge emerges from the breakthrough and book, resonating in the final orchard image that reweights the premise without moralizing; subtext in symbols like the shell adds ambiguity, but epiphanies feel asserted rather than earned through struggle, inviting reflection yet bordering on pseudo-profundity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person POV is stable with consistent distance, perceptual signature biased toward curiosity and disquiet; prose texture in rhythmic descriptions like "shimmering like stardust" fits voice, but minor register drifts into abstract terms like "nonlinear inheritance" jar; no dialogue present, so policy skips evaluation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Prose has momentum issues with paraphrase loops like repeated "disquiet" and "brightened disquiet" that redundantly cycle without advancement, dulling the breakthrough; information density is uneven with scaffold in reflective blocks, though vivid images like "blossoms shone like stars" propel; artifacts in the final paragraph obscure closure clarity, triggering a -0.6 deduction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The surreal astral orchard and bathroom breakthrough offer a fresh synthesis of sci-fi and philosophy, but tropes like robed figures and forbidden knowledge feel derivative without bold transformation; ingenuity in the pistachio shell as connector is organic, yet the premise hedges risks, echoing familiar mystical encounter templates.</comment>
