<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to mend the orchard and honor vows is clear but relies on summary rather than embodied contradictions under pressure; her feisty spirit is labeled without constraining choices, as seen in the muttering to trees that feels ornamental. Interiority uses stock phrasing like "thoughts often drifted," lacking specific embodiment. The reunion with Aria shows a meaningful endurance with felt cost of separation, but it's told more than dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Under a Causal lens, the structure links the contract breach to Elara's tending and seed-planting to the orchard's thriving, but causality feels loose with reflective blocks dominating over motivated action. Orientation anchors early in the cathedral orchard, avoiding penalties. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration via the reunion and flourishing vows, with conceptual cost of past voids legible in the final image, though it lacks a sharper decisive change.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The abandoned cathedral with lush orchard spanning rafters is vividly anchored early, with sensory details like chirping birds and rustling leaves filtered through Elara's reverence, subtly mirroring her healing theme. The setting constrains choices by providing the space for her work and symbolic ties, charging the final reunion image. However, some details feel overly symbolic without evolving causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of bridging generational wisdom tightens once through planting forgotten seeds, narrowing options toward renewal, but pressure remains low and accumulative rather than escalating with concrete opposition under the Causal lens. The reunion forecloses the path of separation with felt emotional cost, yet coincidence of Aria's return undercuts agency. No meaningful reversal forces stance crystallization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Theme of nurturing deciduous vows emerges from events like planting seeds and the ribbon gesture, inviting reflection on persistence without tidy morals, but subtext is overt in statements like "accidental wisdom." The final image of flourishing vows offers a resonant, non-literal answer reweighting the premise with conceptual cost. However, it borders on sentimentality with abstract philosophizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Third-person POV is stable with controlled focalization on Elara, perceptual signature biased toward natural reverence, but interiority slips into expository telling, as in the contract explanation. Prose texture is poetic with rhythmic flow, though syntax varies little under low pressure. No dialogue present, so those bullets ignored; elision of time feels motivated but not sharply taught.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Prose has some propulsion with vivid images like "quartz-eye mender," but paraphrase loops appear in reflective blocks, such as repeating vows' deciduous nature, dulling momentum without payoff. Sentence variety is present, but figurative language muddles in places, like the contract metaphor, and information density drops in backstory summaries. No major artifacts touch closure, but redundancy obscures clarity mid-story.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise of mending a spiritual orchard post-breach offers a fresh angle on renewal, but elements like forgotten bag contents feel contrived around tropes without bold transformation. Emotional complexity in family separation is specific, yet the synthesis reads as prompt-driven rather than inevitable. No proximity echoes, but hedging avoids risk, lacking ingenuity in turns.</comment>
