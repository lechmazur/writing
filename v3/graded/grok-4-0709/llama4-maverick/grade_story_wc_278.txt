<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The tattooist's motivation to hush old guilt drives her actions consistently, with interiority shown through poetic reflections on letters and cries, but emotions feel abstracted rather than embodied in contradictory impulses during key moments like time folding. Her ability to translate baby cries reveals values, yet it alternates as summary rather than simultaneous conflict in scene. The final renunciation of guilt earns stasis with felt cost, but flaws like stock phrasing in her thoughts limit depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned images like whispers and hushes toward a resonant reconfiguration where guilt lifts, with conceptual cost legible in the dawn vanishing; orientation anchors early in the laboratory. However, causality feels loose with phenomena like haunted firmware emerging without motivated ellipsis, weakening linkage before the cord-tether micro-turn. Closure lands with charged poise in the silent lab, but ambiguity in time-folding's payoff caps higher bands.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The laboratory of lost sounds is vividly anchored with sensory details like sandalwood scent and machinery hum, evolving causally as shadows writhe and dawn creeps in, mirroring the tattooist's inner shift. Specificity in the antique dresser and amber integrates into action, constraining choices like reading letters that surface guilt. Environment charges the final image of shimmering tattoos and glowing amber, though some details like flickering candles feel ornamental.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of hushing guilt escalates texturally through accumulating pressures like whispers and time folding, with one meaningful deepening when tethering stabilizes reality, narrowing options with felt emotional cost. However, pressure remains abstract, with coincidences like the insect stirring complicating but not resolving via agency; the cord action crystallizes stance but lacks a sharper trade-off. Under Accumulative lens, cadence shift at meteor hush reweights stakes adequately for length, but static loops dull intensification.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of confronting inner dissonance through art and artifacts emerges organically from tattoos absorbing fears and letters evoking sorrow, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer where baby cries signal new beginnings without moralizing. Subtext in silences and hushes invites reflection on healing's ambiguity, enriched by emotional honesty in guilt's release. However, overt symbolism like the amber talisman borders on thematic echo, slightly undercutting complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Single POV remains stable with perceptual bias toward sounds and echoes, modulating rhythmically as pressure builds, though elision in time folding is taught but pays off vaguely at closure. Prose texture is distinct in lyric diction like "susurrus," but register drifts into abstract phrasing under stress, like "fabric of reality grow thin." No dialogue present, so policy skips those bullets; overall voice coheres but lacks sharper perceptual signature in peak beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Prose advances atmosphere with vivid images like needles dancing and shadows writhing, but paraphrase loops (e.g., repeated hush and dissonance mentions) and template cadence in reflective blocks dull momentum, especially in the letters discovery. Information density is high in sensory details, yet overwriting in final paragraphs with synonym churn like "calming and unsettling" obscures propulsion without payoff. Rhythm varies, but artifacts touch closure image, triggering -0.6 deduction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes tattooing with supernatural elements like haunted firmware and baby cry translation in a fresh, non-obvious way, transforming tropes through the tattooist's guilt-driven art. Risk in lyric vanishing at dawn heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable via accumulated motifs. However, echoes of familiar surreal tales (e.g., time folding) lack bolder personalization, limiting ingenuity.</comment>
