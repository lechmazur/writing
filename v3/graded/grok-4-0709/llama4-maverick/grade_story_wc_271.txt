<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Amira's motivation to find solace is clear and rooted in her trauma, intensifying through embodied cues like easing shoulders, but interiority relies on stock phrases like "seared into her mind" without deeper contradictory impulses in scene. The final resolve feels earned by prior reflection, yet lacks a visible micro-choice under pressure that forecloses a path with felt cost. No second character, so relationship bullets are ignored; her quiet talent is label-only without constraining actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through descriptive density and a cadence shift to peace, with orientation anchored early in the arboretum walk. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration via Charged Poise in the final image of her lighter heart, with felt emotional cost from trauma legible on-page. No major causality breaks, but the reflective mode dominates without a sharper tightening; the ending reweights her stance effectively for this length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The arboretum setting is vivid and purposeful, with twisted trees mirroring her turmoil and constraining her path to the cliff's edge, charging the final sanctuary image. Sensory details like whipping wind and salty air are selective and POV-filtered, evolving causally as wind dies down to support her calm. No orientation debt from Q2; micro-setting of the body (easing tension) constrains her emotional choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the dominant stake of reconciling trauma escalates via density increase in reflective images, with one meaningful cadence shift to healing, but pressure feels static without a tightening that narrows options or forces trade-offs. The cost is felt in her persistent grief, yet agency is passive endurance rather than active renunciation with visible price. Coincidence of the setting complicates but doesn't resolve; stakes remain somewhat abstract.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme of finding hope amid chaos emerges organically from images like the pearl of stillness and smoothing photograph, offering resonant ambiguity without tidy morals. Subtext in the trees' shifting symbolism (withered to gentle) supports complexity, but the final insight feels slightly asserted rather than fully earned through struggle. No explicit moralizing, yet the emotional aftereffect is concrete via her lighter heart.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with consistent perceptual signature in Amira's biased noticing of solace cues, and prose texture modulates rhythmically with emotional shifts like slowing breath. No dialogue, so those bullets ignored; free indirect style is clean without filter-verb stacks. Minor register drift into abstract terms like "somatic markers" feels unmotivated for her voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Prose has rhythmic variety but suffers from paraphrase loops, like repeated descriptions of wind and trees, and synonym churn around stillness (e.g., "balm," "calm," "peace") that dull momentum without payoff. Figurative language like "blue-gray silk" is vivid but mixed metaphors (branding iron, burning hole) create minor muddle in peak reflective beats. High density in sensory details advances atmosphere, yet scaffold sentences in the ending repeat conceptual redundancy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The premise of a trauma survivor finding stillness in a desolate arboretum offers a fresh angle on healing, transformed through specific details like the photograph's smoothing, but echoes familiar redemption arcs without bold risk-taking. Emotional specificity in embodied calm feels organic, yet the synthesis lacks non-obvious ingenuity, reading somewhat template-like. No major trope reliance, but the quiet ending hedges without heightening stakes uniquely.</comment>
