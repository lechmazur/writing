<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The mapper's motivation to ignite a revolution through moon-tracking feels consistent but remains abstract and told via summaries like "she had been waiting for this moment," lacking embodied contradictions or micro-choices under pressure that reveal values with cost. Interiority uses stock phrasing such as "surge of determination" without specific embodiment or degradation under stress, reducing authenticity. No second character, so relationship bullets are ignored, but the single-POV baseline suffers from unearned epiphanies and label-only emotions at the climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned observations of the moon and viaduct, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration at the energy surge and revolution's start, with conceptual cost in the old order's end legible in the final image. Orientation anchors who, where, and when early in the basalt sanctuary by the frozen lake, passing the test without penalty. However, causality is loose with repetitive beats that summarize waiting without a clear tightening or micro-turn, and the closure feels declarative rather than earned by on-page pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The basalt sanctuary, frozen lake, and magnetic viaduct are vividly specific, with sensory details like "soft crunch of snow" and "humming with a new intensity" filtered through the mapper's purposeful gaze, subtly mirroring her restrained wildness. Setting constrains choices by isolating her vigil and charging the climax with the viaduct's glow, meeting the 9+ test as the environment shapes the final image. However, some details repeat statically without evolving causally, like the unchanging frozen lake.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, pressure accumulates via moon-tracking and viaduct humming but lacks a meaningful deepening or cadence shift that reweights the dominant stake of revolution with clear cost, as the surge feels coincidental rather than protagonist-driven. The stake of unyoking from the old order is declared early but remains abstract, with no on-page reversal or tightening that narrows options. Agency is passive observation leading to a declarative resolution without visible trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme of patient revolution emerges from images of waiting and moon paths, inviting reflection on change without tidy morals, but it resolves into abstract assertions like "nothing would ever be the same" without a resonant non-literal answer. Subtext in the viaduct's hum and restrained wildness adds complexity, yet the core concept integrates superficially via repetition rather than specific events. Emotional aftereffect is asserted via "sense of peace" but lacks concrete particulars to avoid sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>No dialogue, so those bullets are ignored; POV is stable third-person close with consistent perceptual signature in selective noticing of moon and viaduct, and syntax modulates slightly with emotional intensity like shorter sentences at the surge. Prose texture is distinct in rhythmic repetitions, teaching a patterned elision of waiting that pays off at closure. However, some filter verbs like "she felt" dull immediacy in peak beats without strong voice motivation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Prose has rhythmic variety in descriptive passages, but paraphrase loops like repeated "sense of purpose" and synonym churn (e.g., "vigilant," "undaunted," "determination") create momentum drag, especially in the accumulative buildup. Information density is low with redundant sentences restating waiting without advancement, failing the paragraph cut test in mid-story reflections. Figurative language like "burning silver orb" is coherent but clusters in peak beats without payoff, triggering a -0.5 deduction; no major artifacts touch closure, but overall clarity suffers from template cadence in footsteps echoes.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The premise of moon-tracking sparking a patient revolution offers a fresh synthesis of mysticism and rebellion, but it echoes familiar trope of solitary observer without bold transformation through specific details or risk-taking. Details like the magnetic viaduct feel organic but swappable, lacking non-obvious inflections that heighten stakes. No proximity to famous scenes, but the vision coheres generically rather than singularly.</comment>
