<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with textural buildup of craft and aurora leading to a resonant reconfiguration in the haunting hum and final smile, providing on-page closure with conceptual cost of labor and past mistakes; orientation anchors early in the sanctum.</comment>
