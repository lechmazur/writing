<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maya's motivation to restore lost faith is clear and intensifies through discoveries, but interiority relies on stock phrasing like "sense of pride and accomplishment" without deeply embodied contradictions. Emotions are somewhat embodied in actions like tracing grooves, yet lack simultaneous impulses under pressure. The final endurance feels earned with visible cost of tireless work, but flaws feel one-note without complicating choices distinctly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through layered discoveries with one meaningful deepening at the tomb's full reveal, leading to a Charged Poise closure where Maya surveys her work with felt cost of time and responsibility. Orientation anchors who, where, and when by the first paragraph, avoiding penalties. Causality holds via motivated ellipsis in explorations, but redundant sequencing in wandering beats slightly flattens progression without breaking the lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard is vividly specific with scents, dappled shadows, and roots snaking between bones, filtering through Maya's POV to mirror her cautious enchantment. Sensory details evolve with action, like damp earth during excavation, subtly guiding her purposeful wandering. A recurring object like the sundial base constrains her focus and charges the final image, elevating specificity without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of restoring faith signals early and deepens once through accumulated discoveries, but pressure remains static without a clear tightening that narrows options or forces trade-offs. Agency via endurance forecloses disconnection with felt cost of tireless work, yet coincidence in findings complicates without resolving. Under Accumulative lens, cadence shifts at the end reweight stakes modestly, but lack of visible prices altering tactics limits escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of reconnecting with heritage emerges organically from excavations and artifacts, inviting reflection on interrupted journeys without tidy morals. Subtext in the sundial's secrets and roots among bones implies layered history, with the final image offering resonant repricing of belonging. Emotional aftereffect builds from particulars like fragmented memories, avoiding sentimentality, but some abstract statements like "sense of harmony" slightly dilute complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with controlled distance, perceptual signature selective to Maya's curiosity like tracing symbols. Prose texture in rhythmic descriptions modulates with intensity, teaching patterned elision in meditative passages that pay off at closure. No dialogue present, so ignore those bullets; minor register drift into abstract terms like "purposeful wandering" feels slightly unmotivated but doesn't obscure clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose advances atmosphere with vivid images like sunlight filtering through canopy, but paraphrase loops in phrases like "sense of" repeated across emotional summaries dull momentum. Sentence variety supports rhythm, yet template cadence in discovery beats (e.g., "she felt a sense of") triggers minor artifact penalty without touching closure. Information density is functional, with strategic telling compressing time, but some redundancies like multiple "uncovering" references could be cut for propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The premise of a diaspora returnee excavating an ancestral tomb offers a fresh angle on heritage reconnection, transforming exploration tropes through specific orchard-tomb fusion. Emotional specificity in cautious enchantment feels authentic, with the sundial's recurring role providing non-obvious synthesis. Bold commitment to meditative structure heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry, though some generic wandering beats echo familiar discovery arcs.</comment>
