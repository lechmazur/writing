<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The altruistic ghost Aria has a clear motivation to foster community growth, but her interiority lacks concrete, embodied contradictions, relying on summary statements like "Aria's presence was a comforting one" without showing internal conflict under pressure. Settlers feel like a generic collective rather than individuals with flawed, specific traits that complicate choices. No meaningful change or endurance is dramatized with visible cost, flattening character depth. The ending celebration reveals little hierarchy of values through micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the story builds through descriptive patterns toward a resonant reconfiguration in the planet's transformation, with orientation anchored early in the orchard planet setting. However, causality feels loose with events unfolding via summary rather than motivated linkages, such as the cryptic messages leading to excitement without clear beats of deciphering. Closure lands as a Charged Poise in the final image of harmony, but the felt cost of effort is oblique and not dramatized on the page. No meaningful tightening deepens pressure, capping potential.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Setting details like the floating rock arches and orchard planet are vivid and integrated into action, with sensory elements like the watering bell's tones reflecting community rhythm. Atmosphere supports a hopeful tone through purposeful contrasts, such as the nebula's distant mystery becoming integral. However, spatial choreography is vague during gatherings, and details like the arches feel symbolic without constraining choices. The butterfly garden charges the final image symbolically but doesn't evolve causally with events.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of harnessing nebula energy is signaled early but remains abstract, with no meaningful tightening or reversal under the Accumulative lens to reweight options with cost. Pressure builds texturally through descriptions of excitement, but lacks agency-driven deepening, as settlers' efforts are summarized without opposition or trade-offs. Coincidence of Aria's guidance resolves issues without complication. The ending reconfiguration feels unearned, with no visible price altering tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme of collective effort and transformation emerges organically from events like deciphering messages, inviting reflection on community bonds without overt moralizing. Subtext in symbols like the brambled hope adds complexity, but the final image states resonance directly rather than implying a non-literal answer. Emotional aftereffect is sentimental, avoiding deeper ambiguity. Insights feel generic, not earned through specific struggles.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Third-person POV is stable and apt for the accumulative style, with perceptual bias toward Aria's watchful nature filtering descriptions consistently. Prose texture is distinct in rhythmic, flowery syntax, modulating with emotional builds like the glowing pathways. No dialogue present, so those bullets are ignored; elision is purposeful but not fully taught early. Minor register drifts into abstract phrasing understate pressure without subtext depth.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Prose has natural rhythm with varied sentence structures, but paraphrase loops like repeated emphases on community bonding reduce density without advancing pressure. Information propulsion is moderate, with lines often multitasking atmosphere and theme, yet overwriting in figurative stacks, such as "kaleidoscope of colorful creatures," muddles clarity in peak descriptive beats. No major artifacts obscure closure, but redundant stems like "As the settlers..." create template cadence. Final line resolves imagistically but echoes earlier motifs generically.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The premise of a ghost orchestrating planetary harmony via nebula energy offers a fresh sci-fi angle on community, but tropes like cryptic messages and transformative energy feel untransformed from familiar archetypes. Details like the watering bell add specificity, yet the arc could swap settings with minor changes, lacking irreplaceable synthesis. No bold risks heighten stakes; it hedges toward safe, positive resolution. The collective effort motivation echoes stock unity narratives without non-obvious inflection.</comment>
