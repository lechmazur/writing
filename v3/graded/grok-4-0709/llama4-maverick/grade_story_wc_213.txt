<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Ember's curiosity is labeled and motivates her shift, but interiority relies on summary statements like "she was also credibly curious" without embodied contradictions or micro-choices under pressure; the final endurance feels unearned without visible cost, trending functional but limited.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through patterns but lacks a meaningful tightening or cadence shift; closure as Resonant Reconfiguration is vague, with no legible cost in the final "at peace" image, and causality feels summary-like without motivated ellipsis.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Setting anchors early with vivid, sensory details like "windblown sanctuary above the clouds" that mirror Ember's attunement, but it functions more as atmosphere than constraining choices or charging the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>No dominant stake escalates meaningfully; the shift to bell-ringing lacks pressure or cost, reading as static without a tightening that narrows options under the Textural lens, exemplified by the untested "urge to switch."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme of listening over noise emerges through images but resolves tidily in direct statements like "listening is a powerful way," lacking resonant ambiguity or non-literal reconfiguration in the ending.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person close, but voice drifts into repetitive poetic register without perceptual signature; no dialogue to evaluate, and elision feels untaught, as in the abrupt "days passed" summary.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Prose suffers from paraphrase loops like repeated "subtle rhythms" and synonym churn around wind/sounds, dulling momentum; overwriting in peak moments, such as the hovering hand, obscures clarity without propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Premise of siren tester turning to bell in a cloudy sanctuary feels derivative of fable tropes without fresh synthesis; the shift lacks ingenuity, reading as safe and untransformed, especially in the moralizing close.</comment>
