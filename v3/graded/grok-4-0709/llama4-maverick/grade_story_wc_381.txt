<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The summoner's motivation to hush the prophecy is clear but remains abstract, lacking embodied contradictions or micro-choices under pressure that reveal a hierarchy of values. Interiority uses stock phrasing like "overwhelming need" without specific embodiment, and the solitary nature ignores relationship crucibles entirely. The final release of the wing shows endurance but forecloses no path with visible cost, trending functional but limited.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the story builds density through repetitive patterns of silence and meditation, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration in the wing's release that reweights the prophecy with conceptual cost. Orientation anchors who, where, and when early, passing the test without penalty. However, causality is loose with no meaningful tightening beyond descriptive accumulation, and the closure feels more asserted than earned by prior beats.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The nocturnal haven is vividly rendered with sensory details like the brook's flow and rustling leaves, integrated into the summoner's actions and reflecting their meditative state. Details evolve causally, such as the deepening silence, and the setting subtly guides choices like releasing the wing into the brook. A recurring object (the wing) charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ test, though some repetition borders on static.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, pressure accumulates through meditative deepening but lacks a meaningful tightening or cadence shift that narrows options or forces a trade-off. The dominant stake of hushing the prophecy remains abstract without visceral opposition or on-page cost, resolved by assertion rather than agency. Coincidence in the dawn's arrival complicates nothing, leaving conflict static and functional but limited.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme of silence's power emerges through images like the glowing wing and enveloped hush, offering complexity without tidy morals, but it drifts into redundant statements like "a reminder of the power of silence." The final image provides a non-literal resonant answer by reweighting harmony, yet subtext is thin, with motifs feeling token rather than constraining choices. Emotional aftereffect is asserted via satisfaction, not earned through particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV is stable with a poetic texture in syntax and rhythm, reflecting the summoner's meditative state, and perceptual bias filters details like vibrations selectively. No dialogue present, so those bullets are ignored; elision is patterned but not fully taught, with some register drift into elevated diction like "terrestrially cosmic." The final trance emergence maintains coherence, but voice lacks distinct perceptual signature under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Prose suffers from paraphrase loops and synonym churn (e.g., "hush," "silence," "tranquility" repeated across adjacent lines), dulling momentum and obscuring the closure image, triggering a -1.2 artifact penalty. Overwriting with mixed metaphors like "tranquil blaze" contradicts without payoff, and syntactic monotony creates drumbeat rhythm in descriptive passages. Density is low, with sentences often restating atmosphere without advancement, harming propulsion at the release moment.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The premise of mapping silence to hush a prophecy via origami offers a fresh synthesis of mysticism and craft, transforming tropes through the summoner's ritual. Risk-taking in the meditative structure heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry, feeling organic. However, echoes of generic fantasy elements like cosmic energy reduce ingenuity, with no bold subversion.</comment>
