<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The map maker's motivation to uncover a withheld truth is clear and consistent, driving her journey, but interiority relies on abstract summaries like "thrill of excitement" without embodied contradictions under pressure. Emotions feel performed rather than layered with irrationality, as in the repetitive "senses reeling" that lacks specific cost. The final realization earns some change through endurance, yet flaws like stock phrasing limit depth, especially in the climax where her discovery changes her "forever" without dramatized internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through repetitive shifts in worlds, but causality is weak with events like the shard glowing triggering blurs without motivated linkages. Orientation anchors early in the spaceport, avoiding penalties, yet the plot loops redundantly on exploration and revelation without a clear tightening. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing via her discovery, with felt cost in senses reeling, but it feels unearned as prior patterns don't compound to force the reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport is vividly anchored with rust and decay scents, filtering through the map maker's sensory bias, but details like grimy windows and wreckage remain static without constraining choices. Atmosphere supports neglect and mystery, yet lacks evolution or mirroring of internal states in key moments. The green glass shard functions as a micro-setting that charges the journey, but the broader repair bay doesn't pressure tactics or the final emergence back.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake of discovering the withheld truth signals early but escalates weakly under the Accumulative lens, with shifts in worlds adding density yet no meaningful tightening that narrows options. Pressure from the shard's glow leads to blurring realms, but coincidence drives resolution without agency forcing trade-offs. Cost is obliquely felt in her changed understanding, but lacks visibility on-page, diluting the climax's reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme of weaving between worlds emerges through repetitive images of shifting landscapes, inviting reflection on multiverse complexity without tidy morals. Subtext in the shard's vibration implies hidden connections, but epiphanies like the final clarity feel asserted rather than earned from particulars. The ending offers a resonant non-literal answer by reweighting her path, yet thematic drift into generic wonder weakens emotional aftereffect.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual bias in sensory mapping, but voice lacks distinct texture, falling into repetitive syntax like "she felt" stacks that dull immediacy. No dialogue present, so policy skips those bullets; elision in world shifts is patterned but not fully taught, obscuring closure legibility. Prose rhythm modulates slightly with pressure, yet register drifts into abstract phrasing mismatched to crisis urgency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Prose has some density in sensory details like "murmur of half-remembered dreams," but paraphrase loops (e.g., repeated "senses reeling" and "journey she had undertaken") create momentum drag without payoff. Syntactic monotony in "she [verb]" templates obscures propulsion, especially in the climax revelation. Figurative language like "kaleidoscope of images" muddles without contradicting, but redundancy touches closure, triggering a -0.6 artifact penalty.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The premise of a map maker weaving universes via a shard offers a fresh synthesis of sci-fi exploration, but repetitive shifts echo familiar multiverse tropes without bold transformation. Ingenuity in cyclic spontaneity feels organic yet undercommitted, with the final revelation hedging risks for symmetric satisfaction. No close echoes of famous scenes, but lack of non-obvious inflection caps originality.</comment>
