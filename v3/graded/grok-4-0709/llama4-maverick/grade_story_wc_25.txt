<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to prove whispers travel farther is clear and drives her actions, with interiority showing through specific observations like identifying walks, but emotions feel summarized rather than embodied in contradictory impulses during the encounter. The final satisfaction reads as endurance with oblique cost, yet lacks a visible hierarchy of values tested under pressure. Strengths include consistent traits revealed via finds like the coin and key, avoiding stereotypes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds density through layered discoveries and atmospheric shifts, culminating in a Charged Poise closure where the stranger's whisper reconfigures her point with felt satisfaction as cost. Orientation anchors early in the labyrinth and port city. However, causality feels loose with finds like the key appearing conveniently without tighter linkage to prior beats.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The labyrinth of shipping containers is vividly specific, with salt, rust, and shifting shadows constraining navigation and charging the final encounter's atmosphere. Sensory details like howling wind mirror her thrill, evolving causally with the storm's intensification. The setting pressures choices, such as exploring unexplored sections, and recurs to heighten the eerie tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of proving whispers travel farther tightens once through the stranger's encounter, deepening knowledge with conceptual cost in ongoing secrets, fitting Accumulative lens. However, pressure remains low-stakes and abstract, with no clear reversal or trade-off; finds like the key complicate without narrowing options meaningfully. Coincidence in the footsteps undercuts agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of quiet voices carrying far emerges organically from the whisper encounter, resonating in the final image without moralizing, inviting reflection on hidden secrets. Subtext in objects like the coin and key implies deeper puzzles. Yet, it borders on direct statement in her mission, lacking counter-readings for complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with perceptual bias in noticing glints and footsteps, and prose texture varies rhythmically to build eeriness. Minimal dialogue feels natural and subtextual in the stranger's whisper. Elision in storm effects is taught early and pays off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose is concise with vivid images like "chorus of restless spirits," advancing atmosphere without major loops, though some sentence stems repeat ("She" openings). Information density is high in descriptive beats, but figurative language occasionally muddles, as in the storm's "turmoil above." No artifacts obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The labyrinth-as-maze with geomagnetic storm and zodiac elements offers fresh synthesis, transforming exploration tropes through calculated spontaneity. However, the premise echoes familiar mystery quests without bold risk-taking, feeling somewhat swappable. The whisper proof turn feels earned but not inevitable.</comment>
