<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The restorer's motivation to ground spirits is clear and rooted in her craft, intensifying through her deliberate actions with the net, but interiority relies on abstract labels like "lucid unrest" without deeply embodied contradictions or stress-degraded perceptions. Emotions are summarized rather than shown through conflicting impulses in scene, weakening the hierarchy of values at the climax where she simply sits back. The final sense of purpose feels earned by prior work, yet lacks a visible cost beyond vague tension, trending toward stock phrasing in her ongoing unrest.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through repeated motifs of silence and unraveling, with orientation anchored early in the prism sanctuary; closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration when spirits dissipate into the hush, reweighting the stake with conceptual cost in the restorer's lingering unrest. However, causality feels loose with spirits stirring and departing via pattern breaks rather than motivated ellipsis, and time loses meaning without a meaningful tightening beyond gradual unwinding. The ending image of the sanctuary as a beacon offers legible before/after peace, but redundancy in hush descriptions dilutes the cadence shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary under starlight is vividly anchored with prismatic walls and luminescent orbs, selectively filtering sensory details through the restorer's focus on the net, and the environment charges the final image by intensifying light as knots unravel. Atmosphere supports the hush with purposeful stillness, mirroring her internal state without overt symbolism, though spatial choreography remains static with minimal evolution. Starlight and colors constrain her work subtly, adding tonal tension, but occupational details like mask fragments feel underused beyond setup.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of grounding restless spirits is signaled early and deepens through accumulating silence as knots unravel, with one meaningful cadence shift at the last knot forcing stance crystallization under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Pressure coheres via spirits stirring but remains textural rather than narrowing options sharply, and the cost of her lucid unrest is felt conceptually in the ending poise without a foreclosed path. Coincidence in spirit dissipation complicates without resolving, yet the lack of a visible trade-off caps escalation strength.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme of accumulated silence bringing peace emerges organically from repeated images of hush and unraveling, inviting reflection on craft's unrest without direct statements, and the final image offers a resonant, non-literal reconfiguration of purpose. Subtext in whispers and starlight implies complexity, avoiding tidy morals, though ambiguity lingers in her ongoing tension without counter-readings. Emotional aftereffect arises from particulars like the vibrating needle, but recurrence feels token without fully constraining choices.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with consistent perceptual bias toward silence and threads, modulating rhythm with emotional flow in slow movements, and prose texture uses purposeful repetition taught early for lyric effect. No dialogue present, so policy skips those bullets; focalization stays character-bound without withholding known facts. However, diction drifts into abstract registers like "interlaced hush" that feel less voice-motivated under stress, slightly obscuring clarity at peak unwinding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Prose features repetitive loops like "interlaced hush" and "accumulated silence" across adjacent lines, dulling momentum without pattern payoff, and template cadence in phrases like "as she worked" creates syntactic monotony in the middle beats. Information density is low with paraphrase redundancy, such as restating the hush as a "palpable presence," and figurative language stacks in high-pressure moments without clarity. Final line resolves with image but buries propulsion in scaffold; no major grammar issues, but loops touch closure by obscuring the spirits' dissipation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The premise of a mask restorer unraveling a fisherman's net in a prism sanctuary offers a fresh synthesis of craft and spectral peace, with risk in accumulative repetition heightening tonal unrest without gimmickry. Tropes of haunted artifacts are transformed through specific starlight and silence motifs, feeling organic to the voice, though the core angle echoes familiar ghost-liberation tales without bold subversion. The final reconfiguration grows from particulars like the vibrating needle, making it memorable in hindsight.</comment>
