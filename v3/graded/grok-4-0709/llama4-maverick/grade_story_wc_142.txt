<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Ava's motivation to resist gentrification is clear and rooted in her traits as a culture shock absorber, but interiority lacks concrete embodiment and contradictory impulses, relying on summary labels like "hopeful desperation" without showing them under pressure. The final endurance feels earned through her actions, yet flaws like stock phrasing weaken character specificity, especially in the repetitive emphasis on her dual allegiance without on-page micro-choices revealing value hierarchies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through layered descriptions of graffiti and growing unity, culminating in a Charged Poise closure where the community stands ready with a felt cost of impending change. Orientation anchors the raft city early, but causality is soft with summary-heavy progression rather than motivated ellipsis, and the narrative lacks a decisive tightening, making the ending reconfiguration feel more declared than dramatized.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The raft city setting is vividly anchored with sensory details like music and exotic foods, evolving to mirror the community's resilience, and it constrains Ava's choices by providing spaces for graffiti that charge the resistance narrative. However, some details feel postcard-like without fully integrating into action, such as the foundation stone chip's inclusion, which adds specificity but doesn't strongly constrain the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake of preserving the city from gentrification escalates accumulatively through spreading messages and unity, with one meaningful deepening as residents reorganize, but pressure remains abstract without a visible on-page cost or trade-off that narrows options. Agency is present in Ava's actions, yet coincidence in undetected graffiti complicates without resolving, leaving the stance crystallization at closure feeling hopeful but not urgently charged.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme of community resilience emerges organically from graffiti motifs and collective action, resonating in the final image of the enduring carnival spirit without overt moralizing. Subtext in encoded messages invites reflection on cultural preservation, but some direct statements like "the power of collective action" border on thematic echo, slightly reducing ambiguity and emotional honesty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Third-person POV is stable and focalized through Ava, with descriptive voice modulating slightly under pressure, but perceptual signature lacks distinct bias, often falling into generic narration like "a sense of hopeful desperation." No dialogue appears, avoiding related issues, yet syntactic uniformity and occasional register drift into abstract phrasing weaken rhythmic control, especially in summary passages.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Prose features repetitive loops, such as multiple restatements of graffiti's spread and unity's growth, dulling momentum without advancing pressure, and template cadence in phrases like "As the [time] passed" creates artifact drag. Information density is low in summary sections, with overwriting in descriptive stacks that mix metaphors without payoff, though basic clarity holds; these issues touch the closure by softening its resonant image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The premise of resisting gentrification via encoded graffiti in a raft city offers a fresh synthesis of setting and method, transforming trope-like community struggle through specific elements like the foundation stone chip. However, execution hedges with summary telling, avoiding bold risks, and echoes familiar resistance narratives without non-obvious inflections that heighten stakes memorably.</comment>
