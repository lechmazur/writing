<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Ezra's motivation to uncover secrets is clear and rooted in her ghost-seeing trait, intensifying through her exploration, but interiority relies on stock phrasing like "weightless burden" without deeply embodied contradictions; emotions feel performed rather than layered with irrationality, especially in the discovery of the logbook where her reaction summarizes rather than shows internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through layered discoveries like the dust trail and logbook, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration in the ending where Ezra carries the stories with a felt conceptual cost; however, causality feels loose with redundant beats, such as repeated ghost whispers, diluting momentum without a clear pattern break; orientation anchors early in the ticket office entry.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The abandoned circus ticket office is vividly anchored with specific details like faded posters and dusty stubs, evolving to pressure Ezra's discoveries through tactile elements like the mainspring barrel; atmosphere deepens eerily, mirroring her internal quest, and the setting constrains choices by revealing hidden compartments, charging the final image as she leaves with the relic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of uncovering secrets tightens once through the logbook discovery under Accumulative lens, but pressure remains low without meaningful opposition or cost escalation; the "weightless burden" is declared but not viscerally tested, leading to a reconfiguration without a foreclosed path or trade-off; coincidence of finding the compartment complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme of forgotten stories and hidden cracks emerges through images like the fading circus and ghosts, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer via the humming barrel without overt moralizing; however, subtext is thinned by direct statements like "the weight of forgotten dreams," inviting less ambiguity than complexity; emotional aftereffect lingers but borders on sentimentality in the final reflections.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and biased through Ezra's observant lens, with perceptual signature in details like dust patterns; voice has rhythmic texture in descriptive passages, but syntactic repetition in reflective blocks creates monotony; no dialogue present, so policy skips those bullets; elision of deeper ghost interactions is taught but pays off mildly at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Prose has vivid images like "skeletal fingers" of lights, but paraphrase loops (e.g., repeated "weightless burden" and ghost fading) and template cadence in reflective sentences dull momentum, especially in the ending; information density is uneven with redundant openings, obscuring the closure image; no major grammar issues, but overwriting in peak discoveries reduces propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Ghost-seeing elevator tech uncovering circus secrets offers a fresh synthesis with the mainspring barrel as key, transforming familiar abandonment tropes through specific relic use; however, the premise echoes stock urban exploration without bold risk-taking, and the ending reconfiguration feels predictable rather than inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
