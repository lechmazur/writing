<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to find the library is clear and intensifies through exploration, but interiority relies on poetic summaries rather than embodied contradictions or micro-choices under pressure. The veiled dreamer's presence adds relational crucible, yet her actions feel supportive without distinct flaws or status shifts complicating the dynamic. Emotions are described abstractly, like "cautious exuberance," without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in key moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned imagery and motif accrual toward a Resonant Reconfiguration in the garden discovery, with conceptual cost in the vow to document unspoken words. Orientation anchors who and where early via the library entry, though the fantastical when remains deliberately misty but pays off at closure. One meaningful deepening suffices, but causality feels more associative than motivated, with no persistent constraint shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The glowing library in mist is vividly anchored with purposeful sensory details like breathing shelves and dancing halos, selectively filtered through the protagonist's wonder to mirror internal states. Environmental elements, such as floating glyphs and the crystal pedestal, constrain choices and charge the final garden image. Spatial choreography tracks coherently through alcoves and corridors without impossibilities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of finding the library is signaled early but escalates texturally through pattern shifts like gear reversals, with one meaningful deepening at the crystal resonance; however, pressure remains low without narrowing options or visible costs. Agency is exploratory rather than decisive, with no trade-offs or ethical calculus sharpening choices. Coincidence in discoveries complicates minimally, but resolution feels untested by opposition.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of giving voice to unspoken words emerges organically from images like floating syllables and luminous petals, culminating in a resonant final image that reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext in whispers and reversals invites reflection on hidden knowledge, with emotional aftereffect from the vow's promise. However, insights feel somewhat generic, lacking counter-readings or deeper ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct poetic texture in syntax and rhythm, modulating with intensity through compressed, patterned diction that teaches its lyric mode early. Perceptual signature biases toward wonder, with minimal dialogue feeling natural and subtextual in whispers. No head-hopping or elision issues, though some register elevation in peak beats feels slightly unmotivated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose features high information density with vivid, purposeful metaphors like "mist wrap around us like a veil," but repetitive phrasing (e.g., "cautious exuberance" three times) creates minor loops without payoff. Rhythm varies naturally, and sentences propel via image accrual, yet some figurative muddle in high-pressure beats like glyph rearrangements slightly dulls clarity. No major artifacts touch closure, but synonym churn in descriptions (e.g., glow, pulse, shimmer) adds slight drag.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The premise of a living cipher-library offers fresh synthesis of time, code, and unspoken words, transforming exploratory tropes through specific motifs like cyclically reversed gears that feel inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity in the garden's promise avoids generics, cohering as a singular vision.</comment>
