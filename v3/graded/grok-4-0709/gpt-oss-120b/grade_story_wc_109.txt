<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The oracle's motivation to map the endless night is clear and rooted in his obsession, intensifying through micro-choices like lifting the booklet and sealing the map with breath, but interiority relies on abstract summaries rather than embodied contradictions, as in the pulse-thrumming veins without conflicting impulses. Emotions are poetic but not fully embodied under pressure, avoiding therapy-speak yet lacking visible cost in flaws complicating the final renunciation. The single-POV baseline holds with coherent interior voice, though traits like obsession are shown more through declaration than altering worldview in peak moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned images of hush and silence toward a Conceptual Repricing closure where the map dissolves into air, reweighting the premise of charting the void with conceptual cost of endless looping; orientation anchors early in the ridge fort during the storm. Closure lands on-page with the final dissolution, but lacks a decisive physical act, relying on resonant reconfiguration. One meaningful cadence shift in the storm's intensification suffices for length, though causality feels elliptical without stronger before/after legibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The storm-tossed ridge fort anchors setting vividly, with sensory details like groaning stones and salt-scented sighs filtered through the oracle's bias, evolving causally as the gale curls and rain lashes, mirroring internal hush. Atmosphere supports the meditative tone through purposeful contrasts like the marbled hush inside versus external phantom serpent, charging the final image on the turret. A recurring object like the booklet functions as micro-setting, constraining choices in mapping, though spatial choreography remains somewhat abstract.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of mapping the endless night signals early but remains abstract, with one textural deepening in the storm's intensification forcing stance crystallization under the Accumulative lens, yet pressure feels situational without narrowing options or visible cost beyond conceptual loop reminder. Agency is endurance that forecloses nothing tangible, with no reversal or trade-off; coincidence of the star winking out complicates but resolves little. Moral calculus is oblique, sharpening no peak choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme of charting silence's geometry emerges organically from images like unfolding symbols and dissolving map, inviting reflection on knowing the void without tidy morals, culminating in a resonant final image that reweights the premise non-literally. Subtext operates in implications of the booklet's sigh and wind's whispers, eliciting emotional aftereffect through complexity. However, recurrence of "ambered hush" borders on motif checklist without fully constraining choice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and apt for lyric mode, with perceptual signature in selective noticing of tides and symbols, and rhythmic control in patterned elision like summarizing silence that pays off at closure without head-hopping. Prose texture is distinct in syntax and diction, modulating with intensity as pages shiver; no dialogue present, so policy skips those bullets. Purposeful compression teaches pattern early, maintaining legibility under Textural lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical with high density in images like "phantom serpent" and varying rhythm, but paraphrase loops appear in repeated "ambered hush" and "marbled hush" across adjacent lines, dulling propulsion without taught pattern payoff, triggering -0.6 artifact penalty. Clarity holds, yet overwriting in stacked metaphors like "river of stars" and "veins of shadow" muddles peak beats without advancing momentum. Final line resolves by recharging motifs effectively, though template cadence in gust descriptions adds minor drag.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The premise of an oracle mapping endless night via summarizing silence offers fresh synthesis of poetic cartography, transforming trope through specific images like the flaking booklet and dissolving map, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry, cohering as singular vision. However, echoes familiar mystical motifs without bold subversion.</comment>
