<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to restore faith is clear and intensifies through her actions, compelling choices like placing the sundial base amid humming roots. Interiority is concrete in moments like feeling the orchard's resonance, but emotions lean toward abstract swelling rather than embodied contradiction, with stock phrasing like "warmly curious heart swelling" diluting specificity. No strong internal conflict shows simultaneous impulses, limiting depth, though the final endurance earns a subtle cost in patient rebuilding.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through layered excavations and gatherings, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where the altar's restoration reweights faith with conceptual cost of fractured generations mended. Orientation anchors early in the portal entry, with no disorientation debt. Closure lands on-page with the chime and voice, but lacks a sharper persistent constraint shaping tactics beyond repetitive wandering.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard is vividly specific, with roots snaking between bones constraining Mara's purposeful wandering and charging the final dawn-lit image. Sensory details like bioluminescent pulses and rattling bones integrate into action, reflecting POV bias and mirroring internal renewal. Environment evolves causally, guiding choices without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of restoring faith tightens through accumulating excavations, with one meaningful deepening as roots recoil and bones rattle, narrowing options under textural pressure. Agency drives the rebuilding, but cost feels oblique, more conceptual than visceral in the final chime. Coincidence like moonlight sliver complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of mending fractured faith emerges organically from relics and ancestral whispers, culminating in a resonant final image of sunrise spilling over the orchard without stated moral. Subtext in roots as "reverent hands" and bioluminescent guidance invites reflection on diaspora renewal. Avoids tidy morals, embracing ambiguity in cautious enchantment.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable, with perceptual signature in Mara's warmly curious tracing of roots and bones. Prose texture is distinct and rhythmic, modulating with emotional intensity like the humming lullaby. No dialogue present, so not evaluated; purposeful compression in lyric descriptions is taught early and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density in images like "pale rivers of memory," advancing atmosphere without major loops, though repetitive stems like "purposeful wandering" appear thrice, triggering a -0.4 template-cadence deduction. Rhythm varies naturally, but figurative density in peak beats like roots recoiling borders on muddle without harming clarity. No major artifacts touch closure, preserving propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard with snaking roots and sundial restoration offers fresh synthesis on diaspora renewal, transforming ancestral trope through specific bioluminescent pulses and bone hymns. Risk in textural accumulation heightens stakes organically, feeling inevitable in the chime's echo. Avoids stock metaphors, committing to premise without hedging.</comment>
