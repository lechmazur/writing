<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The embroiderer's motivation to uncover conspiracies through stitching is clear and rooted in her trait of disguising wisdom as foolishness, intensifying to compel her final act of sending the chart; interiority is concrete via embodied actions like feeling the flame's heat in threads, though emotions lean abstract without strong contradictory impulses in scene. Her micro-choices, such as synchronizing stitches with the flame's pulse, reveal values with felt cost in the fading ember. The lone POV limits relationship crucibles, but her flaws complicate choices authentically.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned imagery and cadence shifts, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing where the stitched map reweights the city's hidden truths with conceptual cost in the fading ember and promised change; orientation anchors early in the cobalt observatory with autumn winds. Closure lands on-page with the chart's dispatch and the city's new tale, though causality is more textural than linear. The wind-flame pattern break at midpoint deepens knowledge effectively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The cobalt observatory in autumn is vividly anchored with sensory details like whispering winds and brass domes, filtered through POV bias; setting constrains choices, as the telescope mirrors thoughts and the glass roof reflects stars, charging the final image of dawn on the dome. Atmosphere supports the secretive tone without overt symbolism. Micro-setting like the loom and flame integrates into action purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the dominant stake of unraveling the coup escalates through density increases in embroidery knots and flame rhythms, with one meaningful deepening when the flame mimics the city's heart, narrowing options; agency via stitching forecloses paths with felt cost in the ember's fade, though pressure feels more atmospheric than urgent. Coincidence in wind shifts complicates without resolving. Moral calculus sharpens her ethical listening amid conspiracy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of truth in unheard stories emerges organically from stitching and flame imagery, with subtext in silences and adjacent possibilities inviting reflection on suppressed voices; the final image of the stitched sky offers a resonant, non-literal repricing of power without moralizing. Emotional aftereffect lingers through complexity, avoiding sentimentality. Motifs like echoed silence accumulate pressure meaningfully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with consistent perceptual signature in poetic, pattern-taught diction like "whispered with reverence"; voice modulates rhythmically under pressure, with purposeful compression in flame interpretations. Prose texture is distinct, though brief dialogue to the flame feels more internal. No head-hopping or register drift disrupts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density in vivid images like "sky bruised with dying stars," advancing atmosphere; rhythm varies naturally, but some paraphrase loops (e.g., repeated flame rhythms and stitching sync) dull momentum slightly without obscuring closure. Figurative language is controlled, avoiding muddle in peak beats like the final embroidery. Clarity is strong, with no major artifacts touching the ending.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The premise of embroidering conspiracies via eternal flame and adjacent possibilities offers fresh synthesis, transforming tropes through specific worldview; risk-taking in textural structure heightens stakes organically, feeling inevitable at the courier's dispatch. Emotional specificity avoids generics, with non-obvious angle on wisdom disguised as foolishness.</comment>
