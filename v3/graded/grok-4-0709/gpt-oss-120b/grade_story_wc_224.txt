<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to reclaim buried talents through the stone is clear and intensifies via embodied emotions like bone-thrumming vibrations, leading to a credible endurance with the cost of painful recollections; interiority is concrete, with contradictory impulses shown in her daring to follow the stone despite doubt-shards. The realization at the pedestal forecloses her old disconnection, earning the change without stock epiphanies. No secondary characters, so relationship bullets are ignored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds density through patterned elisions of dreams and symbols, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing where home becomes a summonable resonance with the conceptual cost of fractured memories made legible in the final image. Orientation anchors who (Lira), where (mountain bookstore), and when (nights of stone interaction) by the first sentence. Closure lands on-page with undeniable pressure via the mountain's slowing heartbeat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The labyrinthine bookstore in the mountain is vividly sensory with pine resin, old ink, and pulsing vellum, filtered through Lira's biased perception; it constrains choices by revealing new corridors and charges the final image as the mountain breathes with her. Micro-setting of the stone and feather integrates into action, evolving causally with events.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of understanding home escalates texturally via deepening vibrations and painful memory shards, forcing a stance crystallization at the pedestal with the felt cost of confronting doubt; one meaningful deepening suffices, narrowing options from erasure to resonance. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens without coincidence resolving it.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of home as resonant feeling emerges organically from stone maps and blooming talents, with subtext in feather vibrations and thunder echoes; the final image offers a non-literal answer reweighting the premise without moralizing. Emotional aftereffect lingers through complexity, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in metallic eyes and vibration translations, modulating rhythm with emotional intensity; lyric compression is taught early and pays off at closure without obscurity. No dialogue present, so those bullets are ignored.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied syntax and rhythmic control, like "pools of liquid metal" and "shards of doubt," advancing atmosphere without loops; some stacked metaphors in dream-scapes risk overwriting but serve lyric mode without muddling closure. Information density is high, with sentences multitasking image and progression.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of seer, obsidian stone, and mountain bookstore transforms familiar quest tropes through specific vibrational maps and thunder tones, feeling inevitable at the pedestal realization; risk in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
