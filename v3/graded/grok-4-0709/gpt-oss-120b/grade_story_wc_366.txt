<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marek's motivation to bottle safety is rooted in consistent traits like reticence and warm observation, shown through embodied actions in the ritual stacking, but internal conflict lacks strong contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, trending toward summary over scene; the final vow feels earned by prior causality with a felt cost in the luminescent ache, as when he whispers the promise into the hollow.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned ritual stacking with density increase toward a Resonant Reconfiguration in the final glow of memory, landing closure with conceptual cost via reweighted safety premise; orientation anchors early with Marek's arrival at the lighthouse; one meaningful cadence shift suffices, but causality feels elliptical without stronger linkage in the lamp's pulse moment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The haunted lantern room is vividly specific with sighs of wind, iron ribs, and flickering lamp, filtered through Marek's observant POV; sensory details like cold stone and ghostly light constrain his ritual choices and charge the final glowing image, evolving causally as the room softens into sanctuary; micro-setting of the slab and stones guides action purposefully without excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of protecting the anonymous chain signals early and deepens through the ritual's accumulation, with one meaningful tightening as the spiral pulses, reweighting options under Accumulative lens; cost is felt in the luminescent ache but remains somewhat oblique without a sharper trade-off; pressure coheres but lacks a micro-turn to narrow options more viscerally.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of bottling safety amid darkness emerges organically from the sea glass and stone messages, with subtext in implications of cradling waves and whispered promises; the final image offers a resonant, non-literal reconfiguration without moralizing, embracing ambiguity in the enduring chain; emotional aftereffect lingers through complexity, but some abstractions like "luminescent ache" border on assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with character-specific perceptual signature in observant details like trapped sunrise in sea glass; prose texture distinct in rhythmic, patterned diction that teaches accumulative elision early and pays off at closure; no dialogue, so policy skips; psychic distance shifts intentionally with emotional intensity, but minor register drift in abstract phrases like "collective memory" slightly jars.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in ritual descriptions like stacking spirals, advancing atmosphere without loops; some paraphrase redundancy in repeated "glow" motifs dulls propulsion slightly, as in the sea glass's faint glow echoing; clarity strong, but figurative language stacks in peak beats like "luminescent ache" without full pattern payoff, triggering minor overwriting deduction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The premise of a ritual stone chain as anonymous messages offers fresh synthesis on lighthouse isolation, transforming trope through specific sea glass talisman and vow to protect; emotional specificity in childhood voyages avoids generics, with risk in quiet, accumulative structure heightening resonance; however, core frame echoes familiar haunted-beacon motifs without bolder subversion.</comment>
