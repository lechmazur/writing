<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation as a capsize survivor is clear and intensifies through embodied memories of the sea, compelling her to activate the device; interiority is concrete with contradictory impulses of fear and longing shown in her pulse and scars. Emotions are embodied without therapy-speak, and her endurance forecloses silence with felt cost in the final realization. The single-POV focus excels in revealing values through micro-choices like pressing the fork, though secondary characters are absent, fitting scope.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned images of frost and vibration to a Resonant Reconfiguration in the final chord, with conceptual cost legible in weaving storms into song; orientation anchors early in the conservatory. Closure lands on-page with Charged Poise as the conservatory exhales, reweighting silence. One meaningful cadence shift suffices, but minor elision in device activation slightly softens causality without breaking lens coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The winterglass conservatory is vividly anchored with sensory details like humming panes and rose veins, constraining Mara's choices by amplifying the tone; it charges the final image as a pilgrimage site. Micro-setting of the bench and glass evolves causally, mirroring her internal thaw. Purposeful specificity in frost and glimmer supports tone without excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of translating silence escalates texturally through density of emotional maps and vibrations, deepening to a cadence shift that reweights survival with felt cost in smoothed scars; one tightening suffices under lens. Agency in activating the device crystallizes stance, though coincidence of visitors complicates without resolving. Cost is legible but oblique in the conceptual repricing of endurance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of transforming loss into wonder emerges organically from images like the fork's tone and lighthouse chord, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in unheard stories; final image offers resonant, non-literal answer to silence without statement. Subtext in whispers and vibrations invites reflection on redemption. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality through concrete scars and heat.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in sea-tumbled memories and pulse; prose texture in rhythmic syntax heightens emotional beats. No dialogue, so policy skips those bullets; patterned elision in reflections is taught early and pays off at closure. Diction fits Mara's voice without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in whispers and echoes; no loops or scaffold, though some metaphors like "frozen cathedral" border on stock without muddle. Clarity propels through vivid images like rose veins, advancing atmosphere. Final line recharges motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of survivor trauma with heat-mapping device transforms silence trope through specific vibrations and conservatory pilgrimage; risk in lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity in scars avoids generics. Core premise feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
