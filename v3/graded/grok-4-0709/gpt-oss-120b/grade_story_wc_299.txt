<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and particular, with embodied emotions like trembling after failure and wrestling meaning from relics, revealing contradictory impulses in the protagonist's yearning for purpose amid shame; however, phrases like "confidently uncertain" veer into diagnostic label-speak, slightly abstracting the internal conflict without full embodiment in peak moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the story builds through patterned reflections and imagery toward a Conceptual Repricing closure where the protagonist reweights applause as a guiding echo with felt cost of past shame, evident in the final ledger entry and breath mingling with the valley; orientation anchors immediately with the sun slipping behind cliffs, avoiding penalties, though causality is more textural than chained, fitting the lens without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The quarry office trailer and surrounding valley are vividly specific, with dust rising like a slow sunrise mirroring the protagonist's amber cloth and internal longing, constraining choices by evoking echoes that charge the final resolve; sensory details are purposeful and POV-filtered, evolving causally as night falls, though occupational depth is minimal but not required here.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of discovering purpose after public failure tightens accumulatively through reflective deepenings, like examining the compass and imagining cymbal crashes, narrowing options with a felt cost of enduring shame; one meaningful cadence shift suffices, but pressure remains mostly internal without a sharper on-page reversal, keeping agency in renunciation rather than decisive action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of finding purpose amid post-applause vacancy emerges organically from recurring images like the cloth scrap and valley echoes, culminating in a resonant final image that reweights the protagonist's arc without moralizing; subtext in gestures like pulling the scrap tighter invites reflection on rebirth, though some direct statements like "the true stage is not lit by spotlights" border on thematic echo, slightly reducing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature in selective noticing of patina and echoes, modulating rhythm under emotional pressure; prose texture is purposeful in lyric compression, but occasional register drift into abstract phrasing like "paradox that made each breath feel both measured and boundless" slightly jars the focalizer's voice without full motivation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Prose has rhythmic variety and high density, but paraphrase loops like repeated echoes of applause and valley longing create redundancy, and stacked figuratives in peak reflections muddle clarity without pattern payoff; information advances atmosphere, yet template cadence in sentences starting with "I" actions dulls propulsion, especially in the final entry, triggering a -0.6 artifact penalty.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes ex-roadie shame with antiques appraisal in a quarry setting for a fresh angle on purpose after loss, transforming tropes through specific images like the grille cloth wrapping thoughts; risk in textural structure heightens internal stakes without gimmickry, though some metaphors echo familiar redemption arcs without bolder subversion.</comment>
