<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to decode the language of buildings is clear and intensifies through the meeting, culminating in an earned realization about translating heartbeats, with embodied humility in the final departure. Liora's patiently nimble grace is shown through actions like fingertip tracing, creating status dynamics that pressure the narrator's desperation without stereotypes. Interiority is concrete, with contradictory impulses in the agreed lies versus truth-seeking, though emotions lean toward poetic summary rather than raw embodiment in peak moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through layered images like meteors and the seal, leading to a Conceptual Repricing closure where the quest reframes as living dialogue with felt cost in humbled fluency. Orientation anchors early in the rooftop garden under the meteor shower, with causality in patterned elisions that deepen knowledge without breaks. The single scene with one brief transition to the neighbor maintains scope, though the ending's ritual feels more resonant than decisively changed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The rooftop garden during a meteor shower is vividly specific, with sensory details like rosemary and rusted rail filtering through POV bias to mirror internal mystery, constraining choices like borrowing sugar. Atmosphere evolves causally with the cosmic display intensifying the lesson's rhythm, charging the final image of stitching light into brick. Micro-setting elements like the bench and seal integrate into action, supporting tone without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, the dominant stake of decoding the building's language tightens through the seal's revelation and tea ritual, with a meaningful cadence shift in the meteor-intensified lesson that reweights options. Pressure coheres via cosmic and conspiratorial air, but escalation feels more atmospheric than agency-driven, with the borrowed sugar solution complicating without a sharp reversal or visible cost beyond subtle humility. The closure's stance crystallization is earned, though coincidence in the neighbor's aid slightly undercuts tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of agreed upon lies as bridges to truth emerges organically from the seal's pact and ritual, inviting reflection on conversing with stone through purposeful ambiguity without confusion. Subtext in gestures like fingertip tracing and the sigil's curves enriches complexity, culminating in a resonant final image that reweights the premise non-literally. Emotional aftereffect is concrete in the improbable friendship, avoiding sentimentality, though insights border on overt in the purpose clarification.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature in mysterious familiarity, modulating rhythm from cosmic streaks to intimate whispers without head-hopping. Prose texture in syntax like "falling fire" and "fleeting hymn" is purposeful and lyric, teaching patterned elision early for legibility at closure. Dialogue is natural, subtextual, and advances the plot in Liora's soft cadence echoing brickwork, distinguishing voices effectively.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in sentences like the opening sky crack and final stitching, advancing atmosphere without loops, though some figurative stacks like "ghosts of stone" and "murmurs embedded" border on overwriting in the lesson beat. Clarity is strong with clean grammar and propulsion, but occasional synonym churn (e.g., "patiently nimble grace" repeated) slightly dulls momentum. Final line resolves by recharging the seal motif effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The premise of a dead language tutor decoding building murmurs via meteors and lies offers a fresh synthesis of urban mysticism, transforming tropes through specific details like the sigil and borrowed sugar ritual. Originality in the tone's mysterious familiarity feels inevitable, with risk-taking in lyric compression heightening stakes without gimmickry. Core elements cohere organically, avoiding derivative templates.</comment>
