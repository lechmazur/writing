<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The lantern maker's motivation to transform grief into origami cranes is clear and intensifies through his polishing ritual, revealing contradictory impulses of hope and sinking despair in embodied actions like lifting the lantern. Interiority is concrete and particular, with emotions layered via irrational self-deception rooted in loss, avoiding stock phrasing. However, the flaw of over-articulated sorrow in peak moments slightly abstracts the emotional progression, as seen in "luminous torment fills the air."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds density through recurring motifs like shadows and cranes, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration in the basilica's transformation with felt cost of eased but persistent torment. Orientation anchors who (lantern maker), where (floating island tea garden), and when (sunrise to twilight) by the first sentence. Closure lands on-page with conceptual repricing of grief as paradoxical peace, though one minor redundant motif loop slightly dilutes the pattern break at the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The floating island tea garden is vividly sensory with jasmine steam and dew-slick stone, filtered through the maker's crafty bias, constraining choices like recording dreams at noon shadow detachment. Atmosphere evolves causally, mirroring internal paradox via ascending/descending isle, charging the final image of the basilica hovering like a starship. A recurring object (basilica) charges closure, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of transforming grief tightens through deepening imagery of polishing and folding, reweighting options under the Accumulative/Textural lens, with agency in the maker's ritual leading to Charged Poise at the end. Cost is legible in the luminous torment that eases without disappearing, as in "the grief he folded into paper begins to dissolve." One meaningful deepening suffices, but static repetition of light motifs slightly undercuts peak intensification.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of paradoxical transformation of grief emerges organically from images like ascending/descending shadows and cranes, offering a resonant, non-literal answer in the final swirling cranes that reweights sorrow into hope without moralizing. Subtext in gestures like gem polishing invites reflection on memory's cost. Meets 9+ test with emotional honesty avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in selective noticing of light and mist, rhythmic prose modulating with emotional intensity through patterned elision like "descends while ascending." No dialogue, but narrative voice coheres singularly, teaching lyric compression early and paying off at closure without head-hopping. Meets 9+ test with rhythmic control under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied rhythm and specific verbs like "coaxing fireflies into cages," advancing atmosphere without loops, though one mixed metaphor ("light ripple like water over the recorded reverie") slightly muddles a peak beat. High information density in multi-job sentences, zero scaffolds, meeting 9+ test but capped by minor figurative strain in the polishing ritual.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dream recording and grief-folding into cranes feels inevitable through grounded motifs, transforming fantasy tropes with specific emotional complexity in the paradoxical ascent/descent. Risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens stakes without gimmickry, as in the basilica's quivering transformation. Meets 9+ test with non-obvious ingenuity charging the closure.</comment>
