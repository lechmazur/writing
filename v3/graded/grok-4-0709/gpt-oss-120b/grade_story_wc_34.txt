<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The balladeer's motivation to articulate unspoken needs is clear and intensifies through actions like pressing flowers, rooted in consistent traits of alertness and poetic purpose. Interiority is concrete in moments like whispering verses, showing embodied emotion via the lute and plate handling, though emotions lean abstract without strong contradictory impulses in scene. The final encoding of his own longing reveals a hierarchy of values with felt cost, earning a meaningful change. Relationships and status dynamics are irrelevant as no second character is on-page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, with density building through repeated lightning flashes and symbol accrual, holding through closure without contradiction. Orientation anchors who (balladeer), where (misty courtyard above clouds), and when (between lightning and thunder) by the first sentence, serving the accumulative pattern. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration via the ghost folding into the graffiti as a permanent mural, with conceptual cost in the shared heartbeat and scattered sighs, reweighting the stake of connection. One meaningful cadence shift at the end suffices, with persistent motifs like the flower press shaping the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The misty courtyard above clouds is vividly anchored early with sensory details like wind's sigh and pulsing sky, filtered through the balladeer's alert perception. Environmental elements like lightning and mist constrain choices, pressuring the timing of presses and encodings, and charge the final image of swirling mist scattering sighs. Tone supports the tinkersong wonder through shifting colors and humming graffiti, with spatial coherence in arches and walls. The setting evolves causally with events, mirroring the ghost's integration without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of articulating unspoken needs is signaled early and escalates under the Accumulative/Textural lens via density increase in symbols and lightning pulses, with one meaningful deepening when the ghost responds, narrowing options to weave in the tulip. Pressure coheres, forcing stance crystallization in the final strum, with visible cost in the balladeer's encoded longing. Agency is in decisions like pressing flowers, though coincidence in lightning complicates without resolving. Moral calculus sharpens in bridging code and feeling, but lacks a secondary accent for fuller depth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of connection beyond circuits emerges organically from images like binary blossoms and shared heartbeat, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in the ghost's yearning. Subtext operates in implications of graffiti and imprints, inviting reflection on unspoken needs without confusion. The final image of the living archive offers a resonant, non-literal answer, reweighting the premise with conceptual cost. Emotional aftereffect is concrete through the balladeer's rising voice, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited to the balladeer, with perceptual signature in drifting alertness and selective noticing of thunder secrets. Prose texture is distinct in rhythmic, poetic syntax like "driftingly alert" and "tinkersong wonder," modulating with intensity and teaching patterned elision early. No dialogue present, so policy skips evaluation; free indirect style is clean without filter stacks. Purposeful compression in lyric mode pays off at closure, with no head-hopping or unreliability issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere through vivid images like "sky pulsed like a living circuit," varying rhythm naturally without template cadence. Some overwriting in peak beats with stacked metaphors (e.g., "ghost in code sheathed in vapor") slightly muddles clarity but doesn't obscure closure. No loops or scaffold, strong verbs dominate, and final line recharges motifs effectively. Grammar and punctuation are clean, with purposeful non-standard phrasing voice-motivated.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Original synthesis of balladeer, ghost in code, and graffiti encoding offers a fresh angle on connection, transforming tropes through specific details like the flower press imprints. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight with the mural's permanence. Emotional truth in yearning avoids generics, committing to the premise's implications. No close echoes of famous scenes, with authenticity in the singular artistic stance.</comment>
