<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to detach from the past and embrace her true nature is clear and intensifies through her actions, with embodied contradictory impulses like combative tenderness driving choices; the closure renunciation feels earned with felt cost of releasing the scrimshaw. Interiority is concrete, avoiding stock phrasing, but some emotions lean toward performed tenderness rather than raw contradiction in the tower scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through resonant images and pattern shifts like the whale's call revealing the island, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration closure with conceptual cost of lifted centuries' weight; orientation anchors early in the sublittoral fringe. However, some causal linkages feel elliptical without motivated ellipsis, slightly weakening the scrimshaw's pulse as a beat transition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The sublittoral fringe and disappearing island are vividly specific, with phosphorescent algae and jagged reefs constraining Mara's choices and charging the final beacon image; sensory details like seafoam and wet wood are purposeful and POV-filtered. Atmosphere supports the mystical tone without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of finding freedom through detachment tightens via the whale's call and island test, with one meaningful deepening in the tower that reweights options under the Accumulative lens; cost is felt in the scrimshaw's release and spirits' rise. Pressure coheres but occasionally relies on coincidence like the sudden shadow, complicating without fully resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of embracing true nature for freedom emerges organically from Mara's internal conflict and the island's crucible, with subtext in images like the whale-eye and salt spray; the final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer by softening the island's edges. Avoids moralizing, but some direct statements like "combative tenderness turning into quiet resolve" border on assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with perceptual signature in Mara's sea-focused noticing; voice has distinct poetic texture with rhythmic control, like the hymn rising "like a blade." Patterned elision in mystical elements is taught early and pays off at closure; no dialogue to evaluate.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with vivid images like "moon-struck daggers," but occasional overwriting in metaphors (e.g., "horizon trembled as the earth itself seemed to shrink") creates minor muddle without harming clarity; no significant loops, though some sentence stems repeat in descriptive runs. Information density is high, advancing atmosphere and character.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of pirate artifact, whale call, and disappearing island transforms mystical tropes through Mara's dock-worker specificity and non-violent tone; the closure reconfiguration feels inevitable with risk-taking in lyric boldness that heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
