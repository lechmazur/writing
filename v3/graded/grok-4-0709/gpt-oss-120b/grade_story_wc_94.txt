<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The poet's motivation to map humanity's scars through ritual is clear and intensifies via embodied emotions like furious tranquility, leading to an earned stasis in understanding scars as traversable terrain. Interiority is concrete, with contradictory impulses shown in the vigil's suspension and release, though secondary characters are absent, limiting relationship crucibles. The final renunciation of healing for reverence forecloses paths with felt conceptual cost, revealed in the descending steps echoing his heart.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned images and cadence shifts, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing where the ritual reweights scars from wounds to a guiding map with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation anchors who (poet), where (observatory), and when (stormlit night) by the first sentence, with no disorientation debt. The single shard maintains coherence, with one meaningful deepening at the timer's ring that reconfigures meaning without requiring causal turns.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The stormlit observatory is vividly anchored with sensory details like rain hammering the dome and ozone scent, constraining choices by isolating the poet and charging the final image of glowing windows. Atmosphere evolves causally with the storm softening to drizzle, mirroring internal shifts without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from stairs to console, with weather affecting the ritual's timing and tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, the dominant stake of mapping scars escalates through density increase in metaphors and a cadence shift at the timer's ring, forcing stance crystallization on scars as terrain with conceptual cost. One meaningful deepening suffices, as the ritual narrows options from suppression to shared compassion. Agency lies in the poet's renunciation of healing, though coincidence of the storm's timing complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of revealing suppressed truths through scars emerges organically from ritual images and the final reconfiguration, resisting tidy morals by embracing complexity in pain's beauty. Subtext in gestures like whispering uncensored lines and the envelope's scattering invites reflection on collective memory. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the glowing observatory, reweighting the premise without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single POV remains stable with controlled focalization, perceptual signature biased toward poetic metaphors like lightning as silver veins mirroring censored lines. Prose texture is distinct in rhythmic, lyric syntax that modulates with storm intensity, teaching patterned elision early for legibility at closure. No dialogue present, so not evaluated; non-standard punctuation serves voice without obscurity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with sentences advancing atmosphere and theme, varying rhythm naturally in storm descriptions without loops or scaffold. Figurative language like clouds churning as ink on parchment is coherent and purposeful, avoiding muddle in peak beats like the timer's ring. Minor synonym churn in scar metaphors noted, but propulsion remains clear with strong verbs and concise imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The premise of a ritual mapping scars via timer and timetable offers fresh synthesis of censorship and redemption, feeling inevitable through accumulated images. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry, transforming tropes like storm as metaphor via specific observatory details. Emotional specificity avoids generics, though proximity to poetic archetypes limits top originality.</comment>
