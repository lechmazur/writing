<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Selene's motivation to encrypt vulnerability feels abstract and unrooted in concrete traits, with emotions described poetically but not embodied contradictorily under pressure; her dance and journal actions reveal some values, but the final endurance lacks a visible cost, as in the crystal-sealing moment where weakness turns to strength without dramatized friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned imagery like dice and dance, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration in the lab's rising, but causality is loose with unmotivated shifts, such as the tide's role in sealing and liberating; orientation anchors early in the sunken lab, yet the closure's conceptual cost feels oblique without a clear before/after legibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The sunken laboratory is vividly evoked with rusted steel and tides, integrating into action like pressure sealing the door, and sensory details like sighing tides reflect Selene's calm; however, the setting mirrors internal states overtly symbolically without fully constraining choices, as in the dice altar that pulses but doesn't evolve causally with events.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of liberating encoded vulnerability escalates texturally through dance and song, with one deepening in the crystal reveal, but pressure remains abstract without narrowing options or a felt cost; the resolution via whispered tide shift feels coincidental, not driven by agency, undercutting the climax's reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme of turning vulnerability into strength emerges through recurring images like the crystal and journal, culminating in a resonant final image of the lab rising, but it's stated overtly in lines like "encrypting vulnerability as strength was a pact"; subtext in dance and silence adds complexity, yet the ending offers a somewhat tidy moral without lingering ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with lyric compression in phrases like "braid of copper threads that sang," teaching a patterned elision that pays off in the closure's hum; perceptual signature is biased toward metaphorical noticing, but occasional register drift into abstract diction, as in "quiet rebellion against the pressure," feels unmotivated for Selene's voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Prose has rhythmic density with vivid metaphors like "altar of hangman's dice," but paraphrase loops appear in repeated defiance descriptions, and overwriting muddles peak beats, such as the extended tide and spider similes; information advances atmosphere, yet template cadence in dance sequences dulls propulsion without payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The premise of a lyrical code breaker in a sunken lab offers fresh synthesis of cryptography and dance, transforming tropes through poetic encoding, but risks feel hedged with abstract resolutions; the crystal's pulse echoing heartbeat provides a non-obvious inflection that heightens thematic stakes in the closure.</comment>
