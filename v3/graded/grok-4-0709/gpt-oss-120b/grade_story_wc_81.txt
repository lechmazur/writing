<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The characterization of Mara is strong in her consistent traits of logical precision and tranquil perception, shown through embodied actions like adjusting the scanner and formulating hypotheses, which reveal internal contradictions under the library's pressure. However, secondary elements like the council feel underdeveloped, applying minimal pressure without altering her state meaningfully. The final renunciation of chaos for stillness is earned but lacks a sharper visible cost in her micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned revelations and shards, with legible transitions from library to surface and vault, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing where truth reweights the city's premise with conceptual cost. Orientation anchors early in the forgotten library during blackout, but the mosaic exceeds defaults without fully teaching the pattern by 25%, causing minor ambiguity in drive coherence. Closure lands with reclaimed stillness, yet lacks a tighter cadence shift for stronger resonance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The sunken library setting is vividly specific, with water-worn shelves and seeping cracks constraining Mara's actions and mirroring her resolve, charging the final vault revelation. Sensory details like ink hues and parchment scents are purposeful and POV-filtered, evolving causally with currents and light. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly, but occupational details remain surface-level without deeper plausibility checks.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, pressure accumulates through deepening hypotheses and discoveries, with one meaningful tightening in the vault confirmation that reweights stakes. However, the dominant stake of tracing origins feels abstract, with no sharp reversal or visible cost foreclosing options; resolutions like council funding arrive without protagonist-driven trade-offs. Coincidence in discoveries complicates but resolves too neatly, undercutting agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme of reclaiming truth from chaos emerges organically through images like the glowing slab and stamped glyph, offering resonant ambiguity in the city's sacrificial history without moralizing. Subtext in the antique stamp's cipher deepens complexity, but the final image states rather than implies the conceptual repricing, trending toward tidy wisdom. No overt symbolism, yet thematic drift occurs as rebirth feels appended without tying back to initial myths tightly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Single-POV third-person is stable with clean focalization, perceptual signature in Mara's methodical noticing of ink and gears, and rhythmic prose modulating with resolve. No dialogue, so those bullets ignored; purposeful compression in shards is taught somewhat, paying off at closure without head-hopping. Minor register drift into elevated diction like "dappled resolve" feels slightly unmotivated for her logical voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Prose has rhythmic variety and density, with vivid images like lantern glow and water-altered ink advancing atmosphere, but paraphrase loops (e.g., repeated "reclaimed stillness") and template cadence in descriptive stems dull momentum in the middle third. No major artifacts obscure closure, yet overwriting in figurative stacks during vault scene muddles clarity without payoff. Information density is high, but some sentences restate concepts redundantly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The premise of a submerged library indexer uncovering staged floods offers fresh synthesis of myth and archaeology, transformed through specific details like the cipher stamp without trope reliance. Risk in mosaic structure heightens thematic stakes organically, but ingenuity wanes in predictable revelations, echoing familiar discovery arcs without bold subversion. The final reconfiguration feels inevitable yet lacks a non-obvious inflection.</comment>
