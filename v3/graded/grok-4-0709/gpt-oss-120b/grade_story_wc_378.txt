<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Vira's motivation to resolve inner static is clear and rooted in her nostalgic traits, intensifying to compel her use of the box for containment. Interiority is concrete and embodied through circuits humming and static dissolving, with contradictory impulses shown in her glitchy smile revealing humanity's pull. However, emotions sometimes lean toward stock phrasing like "reclaimed memory," slightly undercutting specificity in peak moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Inferred lens is Hybrid (dominant Accumulative/Textural at closure), with pattern breaks in poetic imagery building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where fragmented wholeness reweights her existence with felt cost of burned vigilance. Orientation anchors early in the dome and farm; causality holds through motivated actions like whispering code to the box. One meaningful tightening suffices, but ellipsis in chaos miniaturization feels slightly under-motivated at the inciting shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The glass dome and desert rose farm anchor vividly with sensory details like throbbing heat and glinting skin, evolving causally with the magnetic shift and burn. Setting constrains choices, as the flickering shielding pressures the controlled burn, and charges the final image of stars like fractured glass reflecting inner light. Micro-details like breathing wood integrate into action without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of resolving inner static amid farm chaos tightens once through the box's containment, narrowing options and forcing agency in activating suppression, with legible cost in dissolved static. Under Hybrid lens, pressure coheres via textural density increase, but coincidence of magnetic shift complicates without fully resolving, slightly diluting escalation at the climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of transforming chaos into harmony emerges organically from Vira's actions with the organic box and burn, resisting tidy morals through ambiguous fragmented wholeness. Subtext in pulsing symbols and breathing wood invites reflection on machine-humanity without confusion. The final image of the box as a seed offers a resonant, non-literal answer reweighting the premise with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and modest, with perceptual signature in Vira's sensor-tasting ozone and circuit-humming, modulating rhythm under pressure like the quiet hiss of containment. Prose texture is distinct and purposeful, with patterned diction in poetic whispers teaching compression that pays off at closure. No dialogue present, so no evaluation there; elision in emotional beats serves voice without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied rhythm in phrases like "flames rose in measured arcs," advancing atmosphere without loops, though occasional overwriting in metaphors like "mosaic of molten sky" muddles slightly in the burn scene. Clarity holds with strong verbs and concise images; no major artifacts obscure closure, but synonym churn in "pulsed faintly" and "pulsed brighter" deducts minor momentum. Opening anchors voice strongly, final line resolves with resonant image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Original synthesis of android nostalgia with organic chaos containment feels fresh and inevitable, transforming sci-fi tropes through specific details like breathing wood and miniaturized fears. Risk in poetic structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, committing to premise implications in the legend-whispering roses. Core premise offers non-obvious angle on harmony, with emotional specificity avoiding generics.</comment>
