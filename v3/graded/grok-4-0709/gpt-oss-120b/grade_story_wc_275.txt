<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Motivation to weave continuity is clear and rooted in pacifist traits, compelling choices like whispering to plants and aiding the boy; interiority is concrete in perceptual details like noticing wind tremors, but emotions lack embodiment and contradictory impulses, with no visible cost in peak moments weakening the hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through motif accumulation like sandbag scraps and roses leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration in the community's vow, with conceptual cost of lingering chaos; orientation anchors early in the dome, but causality is loose with elliptical sequencing, as in the abrupt shift to the boy without motivated ellipsis.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Setting of the glass dome and desert rose farm is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like amber glow and trembling leaves mirroring Lira's peace; environment constrains choices, as the dome's perimeter guides gathering scraps, charging the final sunrise image, though spatial choreography occasionally floats without precise distances.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of weaving hope escalates texturally through motif density like recurring engravings and thorns, with one deepening in the boy's calm ignition; pressure coheres but lacks a clear tightening that narrows options, as coincidences like the distant wind complicate without forcing agency, and cost remains oblique in the final poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of silence as strength emerges organically from images like the engraved quiet and sheathed thorns, inviting reflection on peace amid ruin without moralizing; subtext in gestures like offering the petal resonates, but the final image offers a somewhat literal reconfiguration, with ambiguity feeling tidy rather than complex.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with perceptual signature in Lira's wind-sensitive gaze, and prose texture distinct in rhythmic repetitions like "tranquil blaze"; elision is patterned and taught through motifs, paying off at closure, but minimal dialogue lacks subtext, and psychic distance occasionally widens into abstract telling.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Prose has rhythmic variety and density in images like "thorns glinting like tiny swords," advancing atmosphere, but paraphrase loops appear in repetitive motif echoes (e.g., "tranquil blaze" churn) dulling momentum; figurative language muddles in mixed metaphors like "breathed a gentle heat," and scaffold redundancies obscure closure clarity without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Originality in synthesizing pacifism with plant-whispering and sandbag motifs offers a fresh angle on post-collapse hope, with emotional specificity in Lira's perceptions; however, premise echoes familiar apocalyptic tropes without bold transformation, as the quiet engraving feels ornamental rather than inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
