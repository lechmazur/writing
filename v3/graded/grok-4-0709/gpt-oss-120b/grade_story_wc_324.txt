<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation as a tracer of hearts is clear and intensifies through curiosity-driven choices, leading to the earned stasis of accepting heroism's weight; interiority is concrete in moments like sensing the pulse, but emotions lean toward abstract whispers rather than embodied contradictions, especially in the alcove discovery.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through layered imagery and pattern breaks like the synchronizing pulse, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration where the restored photograph reweights the protagonist's promise with felt cost; orientation anchors early in the mist-shrouded atrium at twilight, but some elliptical leaps in tracing the signal mildly obscure causal flow without breaking closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium at twilight is vividly rendered with purposeful sensory details like marble tears and humming circuitry that mirror the protagonist's quest, constraining choices by guiding the trace deeper into corridors; the environment charges the final image as the mist inhales and statues bow, elevating atmosphere without overwhelming momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of protecting vulnerable voices tightens through the deepening pulse trace under the textural lens, with a meaningful cadence shift at the choir synchronization forcing stance crystallization; cost is felt in the heroism's weight, but pressure remains somewhat abstract without a sharper on-page trade-off narrowing options further.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of incidental heroism emerges organically from the protagonist's curiosity saving a lost voice, resonating through images like the restored photograph without direct moralizing; subtext in whispers and echoes invites reflection on memory's fragility, but the final promise borders on stated insight, slightly diluting ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>First-person voice maintains a distinct poetic texture with rhythmic syntax and perceptual bias toward faint signals, modulating effectively under discovery's pressure; purposeful compression in tracing the pulse is taught early and pays off at closure, with no head-hopping or register drift, though the soft voice from the aid feels more narrative than dialogic.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose features high density with vivid metaphors like "cartographer of sighs," but overwrought stacking in peak beats, such as the alcove thrum and cascade of light, creates minor muddle without obscuring closure; some paraphrase loops, like repeated pulse descriptions, dull momentum slightly, though rhythm varies and clarity holds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The premise of tracing hearts' electromagnetic echoes transforms familiar ghost-story tropes through specific ingenuity like the hearing aid transmitter, feeling inevitable in the alcove resolution; risk in lyric compression heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry, offering a fresh synthesis of curiosity and quiet rescue.</comment>
