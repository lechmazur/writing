<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lyra's motivation to hush old guilt is clear and intensifies through her obsession with the amber, compelling her to stitch it onto the recorder; interiority is concrete via embodied dissonance in her chest loosening, showing contradictory impulses under pressure. Emotions are embodied in the rattling guilt and resonant hum, avoiding stock phrasing. The final renunciation of guilt feels earned with felt cost, as she confronts haunted firmware. No second character, so relationship bullets ignored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the story builds through patterned images of amber, cries, and lullabies to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the lab thrumms with calm, reweighting sorrow with conceptual cost of honoring memory. Orientation anchors who (Lyra), where (laboratory), and when (night when time folds) by ~100 words. Closure lands on-page with felt cost as guilt surrenders, via the meteor hush settling like stardust. One meaningful cadence shift suffices at this length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The laboratory of lost sounds is vividly anchored with rustling speakers, ash constellations, and cracked floorboards, selectively filtered through Lyra's obsessive POV; sensory details like humming rhythms and flickering neon mirror her internal dissonance. Setting constrains choices, as the haunted devices and antique desk supply resources for her project, charging the final image of the thrumning sanctuary. Atmosphere supports the tone of hushed sorrow, with details evolving causally as the device translates cries. Micro-setting of the amber and desk directly shapes the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of hushing guilt via translating cries is signaled early; one meaningful deepening occurs as she stitches the amber, narrowing options and raising emotional cost under Textural lens. Pressure coheres through accumulating motifs, forcing stance crystallization in confronting firmware, with felt cost in loosening chest dissonance. No multiple reversals required; agency in endurance forecloses guilt's path. Coincidence of finding letters complicates but doesn't resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of healing haunted sorrow through compassionate reconfiguration emerges from images like the amber beetle and translated cries, without direct statements; subtext in gestures of stitching and slipping the letter invites reflection on honoring memory. Final image offers resonant, non-literal answer by repricing guilt as a soothed echo. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality via concrete struggle. Coherent without false equivalence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature biased toward celestial and sonic motifs, like star maps and humming rhythms; prose texture is distinct in lyrical syntax and rhythm, modulating with intensity. No dialogue, so ignored. Patterned elision in poetic compression is taught early and legible at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere through vivid images like "ceiling of dim constellations painted in ash"; rhythm varies naturally, avoiding loops, though some figurative density in peak beats borders on overwriting without muddle. No artifacts obscure closure; sentences propel via strong verbs and specifics. Final line recharges motifs effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</question><grade>Original synthesis of tattooist in sound lab with amber-translated cries feels fresh and inevitable, transforming tropes of grief through specific celestial-sonic details; risk in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Premise commits fully, avoiding derivatives. Emotional complexity via guilt's dissonance adds ingenuity.</comment>
