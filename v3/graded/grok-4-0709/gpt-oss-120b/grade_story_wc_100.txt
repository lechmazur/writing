<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marlow's motivation as a stubborn undertaker guiding souls is clear and rooted in traits, intensifying through his resolve to reassemble the lens despite water pressure, but interiority relies on abstract metaphors like "carrier of silence" rather than embodied contradictions; emotions feel performed via poetic labels without simultaneous impulses in scene, though his final respite shows a credible endurance with felt cost in the weight lifting from his shoulders.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through patterned imagery of light and rest toward a Resonant Reconfiguration in the library's glow as a sanctuary, with conceptual cost in Marlow's merging silhouette; orientation anchors early with the submerged library and package, but causality feels elliptical with unmotivated transitions like the floating pedestal, slightly weakening linkage without breaking the textural cadence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The underwater library setting is vivid and purposeful, with water pressure and phosphorescent ink constraining Marlow's actions like setting the lens in a rusted cradle; sensory details like echoing boots and bioluminescent fish are filtered through his weary POV, mirroring internal stillness, and the environment charges the final image of the glowing abyss without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of guiding souls to rest signals early but escalates texturally through light pulses rather than narrowing options; one deepening occurs in the chorus of sighs, reweighting the stake with conceptual cost, but pressure remains abstract without a clear reversal or trade-off, relying on imagery over coherent intensification under the lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme of revitalizing rest through distress signals emerges organically from Marlow's actions and motifs like the fractured lens, culminating in a resonant final image that reweights death as sanctuary without moralizing; subtext in silences and implications adds complexity, but some ambiguity feels purposeful yet borders on vagueness, avoiding tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with a distinct poetic texture in syntax and rhythm, modulating with pressure like shortening sentences in the lens assembly; perceptual signature biases toward metaphorical noticing, such as water as "patient sigh," and no dialogue present avoids evaluation there, though some elision is taught and paid off in the ending gleam.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Prose has high density with purposeful metaphors like "cracked like the memory of a storm," but paraphrase loops (e.g., repeating "permanent address" and "chased stillness" without added pressure) and template cadence in descriptive runs dull momentum; clarity holds in peak beats, yet overwriting muddles the closure image slightly without full obscurity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Originality shines in synthesizing an underwater library as a soul sanctuary with a broken lens as beacon, transforming tropes through specific imagery like phosphorescent ink ghosts; the premise offers a fresh angle on grief, but some echoes of familiar poetic devices feel less inevitable, with risk-taking in lyric structure heightening stakes modestly.</comment>
