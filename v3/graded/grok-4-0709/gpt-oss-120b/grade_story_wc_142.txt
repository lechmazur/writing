<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in dual allegiance, compelling her choices like gathering artists and sending the phoenix message, with internal conflict shown through her tugged heart in the climax. However, interiority occasionally slips into stock phrasing like "orderly intuitive mind" without embodied contradiction under pressure. The final renunciation of betrayal earns stasis with felt cost, but emotions are more performed than layered with irrationality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Under a Causal lens, the structure links discovery to actions to reorganization via because/therefore chains, with orientation anchored early in the raft city's drift. Closure lands as a Decisive Change with the postponed privatization and phoenix symbol reconfiguring options, carrying conceptual cost in ongoing fights. Minor summary in the reorganization beat softens causality without breaking it.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The raft city setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like creaking hulls and flickering lights filtering through Mira's bias to guide choices, such as embedding the chip in the oldest pier. It constrains reorganization by shifting stalls to the riverbank, charging the final image of the glass-cased chip at the edge. Micro-setting of the chip as object evolves causally, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reorganizing against privatization tightens through the graffiti network, narrowing options with one meaningful deepening when symbols reveal meeting points, forcing trade-offs in Mira's allegiance. Cost is legible in her hopeful desperation at the end, but pressure feels somewhat abstract without a sharper on-page reversal. Under Causal lens, agency drives the phoenix message, but coincidence of investors' unawareness complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of balancing anarchy and order emerges organically from Mira's dual allegiance and the phoenix symbol, reweighting the premise in the final image without moralizing. Subtext in graffiti and symbols invites reflection on resistance, with ambiguity in future waves adding complexity. Emotional aftereffect is concrete through the tide-turning breath, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Third-person POV stays stable and close to Mira, with perceptual bias in noticing patterns, but occasional register drift into elevated diction like "kaleidoscope of music" feels unmotivated. No dialogue present, so policy skips those bullets; voice texture is distinct but syntactic uniformity in descriptive runs dulls rhythm under pressure. Elision is minimal and legible, supporting causal lens without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Prose has rhythmic variety in openings but suffers from paraphrase loops, like repeating "hopeful desperation" in adjacent beats, dulling momentum at the end. Overwriting in metaphors, such as "floating circus" and "living verses," mixes without payoff, triggering -0.6 artifact penalty in peak reorganization. Density is functional with some propulsion, but scaffold redundancies like restated symbols obscure closure clarity slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The raft city premise offers fresh synthesis of carnival anarchy and resistance via encoded graffiti, transforming tropes through specific details like the foundation chip map. Risk in symbolic network heightens stakes organically, feeling inevitable at the phoenix mural. Minor hedging in balanced allegiance avoids bolder ambiguity.</comment>
