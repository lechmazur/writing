<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mara's motivation as a ghost-seeing technician is clear and intensifies through her actions, with embodied emotions like the tug at her collar revealing internal conflict under pressure; the final transformation from burden to purpose feels earned with a visible cost in her lifted weight, though interior contradictions alternate in summary rather than acting simultaneously in key scenes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned details like dust and sounds toward a Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the burden transforms into purpose with felt conceptual cost; orientation anchors early in the entry to the ticket office, and causality holds via motivated elisions, though some linkages feel more textural than tightly causal at the attic reveal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The abandoned circus setting is vividly specific with sensory details like rain-slick night and sawdust perfume, filtered through Mara's observant POV; it constrains choices, such as climbing the creaking ladder, and charges the final image of the clear sky with ticking stars, making the environment indispensable to the resonant closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake of discovering hidden ceilings escalates through accumulative pressure like the pulsing light and calliope, leading to a meaningful deepening at the ledger retrieval that reweights options with the cost of acknowledged burdens; however, the conflict remains somewhat internal and atmospheric, with coincidence in the ghosts' gathering complicating but not fully testing agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of cracks as frames for hidden truths emerges organically from events and images like the dust patterns and ledger, culminating in a resonant final image that reweights the premise without moralizing; subtext in whispers and tugs invites reflection on forgotten souls, though some direct statements like "cracks were not flaws but frames" border on overt assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable with a distinct perceptual signature in Mara's observant noticing, and prose texture modulates rhythmically with pressure; purposeful compression in elisions like the barrel's sparking is taught early and pays off at closure, though minor register drifts into elevated diction occasionally jar in peak moments.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose maintains momentum with varied rhythm and high density, advancing atmosphere through images like spiraling dust motes; however, figurative overload in sentences like "shattered marquee flapped like a tired animal" creates minor muddle in high-pressure beats, and occasional paraphrase loops, such as repeated "cracks in the façade," dull propulsion without payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The premise ingeniously synthesizes a ghost-seeing technician with circus hauntings, transforming tropes through specific details like dust analysis and the mainspring barrel; risk-taking in textural accumulation heightens stakes organically, feeling inevitable at the ledger reveal, though echoes of familiar supernatural discovery arcs limit ultimate freshness.</comment>
