<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Selene's motivation to harness star dust is clear and rooted in her precognitive curse, intensifying through embodied fear and contradictory impulses that compel her rock-placing choices; interiority is concrete and particular, with emotions like terror outweighed by curiosity shown in scene rather than summarized. The curse's transformation into a compass at closure feels earned by prior causality, foreclosing endless loops with a felt cost of ongoing responsibility. Minor slip in stock phrasing ("weight of the lingering promise settle like a mantle") slightly flattens specificity, but it doesn't touch the pivotal realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned images of aurora, dust, and rocks, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where the curse becomes a compass with conceptual cost of reshaped futures; orientation anchors early with the bluff and tide. Closure lands on-page with the final smile and map realization, reweighting stakes via cadence shift. Minor ambiguity in initial "after the world’s last friction disappears" is taught as poetic disorientation that pays off in the peace motif, avoiding penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The tidal bluff under aurora is vividly specific, with sensory details like salt and ancient fire filtered through Selene's urgency, constraining her rock-placing choices and charging the final flame's seeding. Micro-setting of pools and basalt evolves causally, mirroring her internal reconfiguration without overt symbolism. Environment pressures the climax by pausing the tide, directly shaping the violet flame's ignition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of harnessing dust to rewrite futures tightens through the rock sequence, deepening via luminous knots that reweight her curse with felt cost of intentional alignment; under Accumulative/Textural lens, pattern break at the red stone's placement forces stance crystallization. One meaningful intensification suffices, with agency in her deliberate design foreclosing inevitable visions. Coincidence of aurora complicates but doesn't resolve, keeping pressure coherent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of coaxed cosmic patterns emerges organically from dust, rocks, and curse, resisting tidy morals through ambiguity in whether futures are truly reshaped; subtext in whispering knots and glowing stones invites reflection on agency amid inevitability. Final image of the map offers resonant, non-literal repricing of her curse without stated epiphany. Emotional aftereffect lingers via complexity, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in shimmering skin and vibrating dust biased by Selene's curse; voice texture is poetic and rhythmic, modulating with pressure like the hum's rise. Patterned elision in visionary fears is taught early and pays off at closure without confusion. Minor register drift into elevated diction ("precognitively cursed") feels voice-motivated in this lyric mode, but no dialogue present to evaluate.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere through vivid images like violet ribbons, but repetitive phrasing ("lingering promise" in multiple sentences) creates minor paraphrase loops that dull momentum without obscuring closure. Rhythm varies naturally, with syntactic variety supporting beats, though some stacked metaphors in the flame ignition slightly muddle clarity. No major artifacts touch the final image, keeping propulsion strong overall.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original synthesis of eel herding, star dust, and mathematical rocks transforms fantasy tropes into a fresh angle on precognition, feeling inevitable through Selene's specific choices; risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry. Core premise commits to cosmic patterns with non-obvious moral calculus of intentional design. Bold integration avoids safety hedging, making the reconfiguration memorable.</comment>
