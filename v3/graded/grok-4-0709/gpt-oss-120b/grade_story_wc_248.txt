<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The arsonist's motivation to rescue his mentor's promise is clear and intensifies toward redemption, but interiority relies on abstract labels like "volcanic tenderness" without embodied contradictions in scene. Emotions feel performed rather than layered with irrationality, weakening the internal conflict at the scroll discovery. The final renunciation of destructive flames shows a meaningful change with felt cost, but it's summarized without micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, with motif density (fire, phoenix) building to a Resonant Reconfiguration in the guardian role, landing with conceptual cost of past sins. Orientation anchors early in the village library and canyon, serving the pattern payoff. Causality holds through patterned elision, but summary-heavy sequencing lacks a decisive on-page tightening, diluting the closure's before/after legibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The lost civilization archive is vividly detailed with murals, glyphs, and sandstone, selectively filtered through the protagonist's intuitive bias to guide discoveries. Sensory hierarchy focuses on visual and tactile elements like the tapestry's pulse, mirroring internal grief without overt symbolism. The setting constrains choices by revealing clues, charging the final mural's glow, but some descriptions feel catalog-like rather than urgency-narrowed.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of rescuing the forgotten promise signals early and deepens via the trail, with one meaningful cadence shift at the phoenix completion forcing stance crystallization under the textural lens. Internal redemption interweaves with external discoveries, but pressure remains abstract without a visible trade-off or reversal testing commitment. Coincidence in fittings complicates without resolving, yet the cost feels oblique until the ending reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of redemptive fire emerges organically from motifs like the phoenix and tenderness, culminating in a resonant final image that reweights destruction as illumination without moralizing. Subtext in the vandalized portrait and glyphs invites reflection on judgment and memory, embracing complexity via the arsonist's flaws. The core concept integrates through events, eliciting emotional aftereffect via the glowing mural's invitation to linger.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with controlled distance, modulating voice through poetic rhythm that reflects the focalizer's analytical intuition. Prose texture is distinct in patterned diction like "volcanic tenderness," with purposeful compression teaching the lyric mode early and paying off at closure. No dialogue present, so not evaluated; perceptual signature biases toward fire equations, heightening under stress without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose advances atmosphere through dense, purposeful imagery like flames illuminating ruins, with varied rhythm avoiding monotony. Some paraphrase loops, such as repeating tenderness motifs, dull momentum in the ending beats without payoff escalation. Information density is high in motif layers, but occasional overwriting in peak descriptions like the phoenix wings muddles clarity; overall propulsion supports the textural lens.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The premise of a library arsonist redeeming via ancient art in a desert archive offers fresh synthesis, transforming redemption tropes through specific motifs like the vandalized portrait as map. Risk-taking in lyric summary heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Details are particular to voice, avoiding stock echoes, though the phoenix risks familiarity without bolder subversion.</comment>
