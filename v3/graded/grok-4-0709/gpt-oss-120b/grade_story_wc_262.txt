<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The crystal gazer's motivation to incubate goodbye letters and find unused love is clear and intensifies through her actions, but interiority relies on abstract metaphors rather than embodied, contradictory emotions under pressure. The final endurance of carrying the love feels earned accumulatively, yet lacks a visible micro-choice hierarchy with concrete cost. Strengths include consistent traits shown through perceptual bias, like tracing ghostly impressions, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds density through layered images and pattern shifts, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where the gazer carries unused love as a lantern, with felt conceptual cost in transforming sorrow. Orientation anchors early in the projection booth without debt. The ending reweights the stake legibly, though some elisions feel more poetic than pressured.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The vintage movie palace booth is vividly specific with dust like slow snow and humming thunder, filtering through POV bias to mirror internal quest; it constrains choices by revealing the hidden compartment and charges the final image as walls bend outward. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, evolving causally with the psychometry surge.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of finding unused love tightens accumulatively through the psychometry reading and letter discovery, with one meaningful deepening as letters glow and map unfolds, narrowing options with felt emotional cost in filling empty heart chambers. Pressure coheres under textural lens but remains abstract, lacking a sharper trade-off; agency via humming and whispering earns the reconfiguration without coincidence resolving it.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of transforming unsent goodbyes into reclaimed love emerges organically from images like birds on frames and liquid light river, inviting reflection through ambiguity without confusion; the final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer by setting love free amid shadow applause. Subtext in silences and implications deepens complexity, avoiding tidy morals.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and modest, with perceptual signature in surreal biases like rooms folding into galaxies; voice texture is distinct and rhythmic, modulating with intensity through patterned diction that teaches its lyric compression early. No dialogue present, so policy skips evaluation; elisions pay off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with vivid metaphors like "thunderous hush," varying rhythm purposefully, but occasional overwriting in peak beats (e.g., stacked similes in the letter-glowing moment) muddles clarity without harming closure. No major loops or artifacts, high information density advances atmosphere; final line recharges motifs effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Surreal synthesis of psychometry, film strips, and unused love feels fresh and inevitable, transforming tropes through specific perceptual details like melting celluloid into liquid light; risk-taking in lyric structure heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry. Originality shines in the booth as emotional telescope, committing fully to its premise.</comment>
