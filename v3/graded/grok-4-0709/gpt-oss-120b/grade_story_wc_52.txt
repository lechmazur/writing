<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to harvest lessons from loss is clear and intensifies through her carving, rooted in consistent traits like reverence for paradox, with embodied emotions in handling the wood and sap; interior conflict shows in contradictory impulses between grief and creation, culminating in earned stasis with felt cost of acceptance. However, some emotions lean toward abstract labels like "rust-hued peace" without fully contradictory embodiment mid-crisis. The final choice to place the lantern on the hearth reveals her hierarchy of values, foreclosing raw mourning for shaped utility.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the story builds through patterned imagery of rain, steam, and carving toward a Resonant Reconfiguration in the final lantern glow, with conceptual cost of reweighted grief legible in the hearth union; orientation anchors early in the loft with Mara and rain. Closure lands on-page as Charged Poise, reconfiguring loss into a beacon with undeniable pressure from the kettle's final note. Minor ellipsis in emotional shifts feels motivated by texture without breaking pattern.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The rain-beaded skylight loft is vividly anchored with sensory details like steam on glass and rust hue, filtered through Mara's grief-biased perception; it constrains choices by supplying the table, window, and kettle that enable carving, charging the final image of the lantern on the hearth. Weather affects action, with rain beads as metronomes marking time. Micro-setting of the carving blank functions as extension, evolving causally with her strokes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><grade>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, dominant stake of shaping grief escalates through density increase in carving beats, with one meaningful deepening as sap hardens into a vault, narrowing options to acceptance; cost is felt in the foreclosed roar turned sigh, charging the ending. However, pressure remains somewhat static without a sharper trade-off or reversal, relying on textural buildup rather than agency-driven intensification. Coincidence of kettle timing complicates but doesn't resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of grief as paradox (here and gone) emerges organically from carving imagery and sap sealing, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in the softened roar; final image of the lantern on the hearth offers resonant, non-literal repricing of loss as tool without stated moral. Subtext in gestures like whispering to the carving invites reflection on acceptance. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality through concrete particulars like steam curls.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and modest, with perceptual signature in Mara's biased noticing of rust hues and whispers; prose texture is distinct in rhythmic, metaphoric syntax that modulates with emotional intensity, teaching patterned elision early. No dialogue present, so policy skips those bullets. Minor register drift into elevated diction like "translucent memory vault" feels voice-motivated in lyric mode without obscuring clarity at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with metaphors doing double work, like steam tracing veins to mark time, and rhythmic variety in sentence lengths supporting momentum; however, paraphrase loops appear in adjacent descriptions of rust hue deepening and amber wrapping, dulling propulsion slightly without touching closure. Figurative language is coherent but dense in peak carving beat, with no muddle. Clarity is strong, with strong verbs and specific nouns advancing atmosphere.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of circus widow carving grief into a sap-sealed lantern transforms trope of loss through specific details like iron gouge as whip, feeling inevitable in hindsight; risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry. Core premise offers non-obvious angle on paradox via alchemical process. Avoids stock metaphors, committing to vision with organic combinations.</comment>
