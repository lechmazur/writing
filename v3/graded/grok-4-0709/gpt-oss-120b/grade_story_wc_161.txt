<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lila's motivation is clear and rooted in loss, intensifying through concrete actions like mapping dust and attaching meteorite slivers, revealing embodied emotions and contradictory impulses in her ritual of trust; however, some interiority veers into stock phrasing like "storm of loss," slightly diluting specificity. The final renunciation of past grip feels earned with visible cost in the fading light and layered memory. Relationships are absent, so no crucible applied.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds density through repeated mapping and pigeon flights, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration in the final charged poise where the map glows as testament, with conceptual cost in memory's wilt; orientation anchors early in the attic with skylight. Closure lands on-page with felt reconfiguration of loss to renewal, though one ellipsis in weeks passing feels lightly motivated.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The attic setting is vivid and purposeful, with the skylight and dust motes constraining choices by guiding mapping, while old books and parchment supply resources that charge the final blooming-withering image; sensory details like scent of paper and luminous whirl reflect POV bias and evolve with events, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reinventing history through preserving songs tightens accumulatively via dust mapping and pigeon trust, with one meaningful deepening when attaching meteorite slivers forces a trade-off in fragile trust; cost is legible in the meteorite's fading glow, driving agency in endurance that reweights options under the lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of balancing loss and renewal emerges organically from images like dust trails and humming chips, culminating in a resonant final image that reweights the premise without moralizing; subtext in pigeons as bridges invites reflection on memory's layers, avoiding sentimentality through complex ambiguity in blooming-withering grace.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with distinct lyrical texture in syntax and rhythm, modulating with emotional intensity like the soft chorus; perceptual signature biases toward luminous, fleeting details, but some register drift into elevated diction like "luminous whirl" feels slightly unmotivated for the trainer's voice. No dialogue present, so not evaluated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in poetic cascades, but minor paraphrase loops like repeated "paper trails" and "bloom" in adjacent sentences dull momentum slightly without payoff; figurative language is controlled, though "blooming withering" mixes metaphors in the closure without harming clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of meteorite chip, dust mapping, and pigeons transforms familiar loss tropes into a non-obvious ritual of trust, with risk in lyric accumulation heightening stakes organically; the core premise feels inevitable in hindsight, committing to implications without hedging, as in the pigeons carrying celestial lullabies to vendors.</comment>
