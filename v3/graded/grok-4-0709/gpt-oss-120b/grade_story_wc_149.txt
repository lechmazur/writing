<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The ghost bride's motivation to repay a debt is consistent and intensifies through her actions, but interiority relies on abstract summaries like "a pull of longing" rather than embodied contradictions under pressure. Emotions are poetic yet not fully contradictory in scene, with flaws complicating choices only obliquely. The final renunciation earns stasis with felt cost in her fading, a strength that elevates the score despite stock phrasing in reflections.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned motifs like resonant awakenings, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the bride fades and the orchard transforms with conceptual cost. Orientation anchors early in the greenhouse, avoiding penalties. Closure lands on-page with the sigh and blossoming as a charged poise, but some ellipsis feels unmotivated, slightly weakening linkage.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The alchemical orchard greenhouse is vividly specific, with frost-bitten vines and endless night constraining the bride's ghostly movements and charging the final blossoming image. Sensory details like metallic hymns and liquid amber light are purposeful and POV-filtered, mirroring her mournful state. The setting evolves causally, from dormant to blooming, directly shaping the closure without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake of repaying the debt tightens through accumulative deepenings, like bead placements awakening vines, narrowing options toward transformation. One meaningful cadence shift occurs in the final sigh, forcing stance crystallization with felt cost in her fading. Pressure coheres under the textural lens but remains somewhat abstract, lacking a sharper on-page reversal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of repaying debts through resonant transformation emerges organically from images like the bead and blossoming, offering a non-literal answer in the final reconfiguration without moralizing. Subtext in lovingly venomous affection adds complexity, inviting reflection on love's costs. The ending reweights the premise with mournful elation, charging the aftereffect effectively.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The omniscient-like voice maintains consistent distance with poetic compression, teaching patterned elision early through flickering appearances that pay off at closure. Perceptual signature is distinct in ethereal, memory-infused noticing, with rhythmic control heightening pressure in phrases like "whisper of ash." No dialogue present, so no penalties there; overall texture feels singular and purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied rhythm, as in the symphony of life rising from frost, avoiding loops despite repetitive motifs that serve accumulation. Figurative language like "liquid amber" is coherent and multi-functional without muddle, though some sentences border on overwriting in peak beats. High information density advances atmosphere and theme, with clean grammar and no artifacts dulling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes ghost bride lore with alchemical transformation in a fresh, non-obvious way, feeling inevitable through motifs like the bead's glow. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, transforming tropes like haunting into resonant repayment. Originality shines in the lovingly venomous affection, but echoes familiar gothic elements slightly hedge boldness.</comment>
