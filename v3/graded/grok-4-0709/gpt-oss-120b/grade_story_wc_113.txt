<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to unravel the ghost's code is clear and intensifies through her interactions with the program and water patterns, rooted in her inspired state and leading to an earned endurance that frees the melody with a felt emotional cost. Interiority is concrete and embodied, as in her trembling finger tracing patterns, revealing contradictory impulses between reverence and disruption. However, some emotions lean toward stock phrasing, like "understanding blossomed," slightly diluting specificity at the climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through layered images and patterns, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where playing the note reveals the code as silences, with a legible conceptual cost in the ghost's fading presence. Orientation anchors early in the flooded opera house with Mara in the pit, and causality holds via textural density increases, like water imprints merging into staff lines. The ending reweights the stake effectively, though a minor ambiguity in the ghost's legend setup slightly softens hindsight inevitability.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The flooded opera house with trembling lanterns is vividly specific, with sensory details like water pooling and droplet imprints constraining Mara's choices and charging the final image of steady light reflecting like a calm sea. Atmosphere builds tension through damp air and flickering light, mirroring her internal pressure, and the setting evolves causally as rain ceases and the river recedes. A recurring object like the antique program integrates into the environment, enhancing thematic resonance without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake of unraveling the ghost's code escalates through accumulative pressure, with a meaningful deepening when the water ripples respond to her note, narrowing options and forcing a stance crystallization with felt cost in the ghost's departure. Agency shines in her decision to play the sustained note, bridging worlds, though the conflict remains mostly internal without a sharper external reversal. Stakes feel visceral, tied to freeing the trapped melody, avoiding abstraction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of silences and in-between spaces emerges organically from images like water-etched staff lines and the wordless conversation, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer where the code is revealed as sacred pauses, reweighting the premise without moralizing. Subtext operates through implications in the ghost's sigh and fading presence, inviting reflection on unspoken legacies. Emotional aftereffect is honest, avoiding sentimentality, though the legend's integration feels slightly declarative.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and character-bound, with perceptual signature in Mara's biased noticing of echoes and patterns, and rhythmic prose modulates with pressure, as in the sigh-like note. No dialogue present, so those bullets are ignored; purposeful compression in lyric descriptions is taught early and pays off at closure. Minor register drift into elevated diction, like "resonance to fill the inundated hall," slightly jars under stress but doesn't obscure clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical with high density, advancing atmosphere through vivid images like "amber light trembling like breath on wet wood," but occasional paraphrase loops, such as repeated "wordless conversation" phrasings, dull momentum in the final third without payoff. Syntax varies purposefully, though some sentences stack metaphors, risking muddle at peak moments like the water ripples shifting. No major artifacts touch closure, and information propulsion holds, but minor scaffold in redundant descriptions caps excellence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The premise of a ghost's code etched in water damage offers a fresh synthesis of opera legend and environmental interaction, feeling inevitable through Mara's inspired tracing and the program's marginalia. Risk-taking in the accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, transforming tropes like haunted venues via specific details like swollen violin wood. Originality shines in the code as silences, a non-obvious inflection that recharges the hush motif.</comment>
