<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to encode empathy into prints is clear and rooted in her habit of borrowing personalities, intensifying through her interactions with the halo fragment; however, interiority relies on abstract labels like "transposed empathy" without deeply embodied contradictions or micro-choices under pressure, as seen in the vague pulse alignment moment. Emotions feel performed rather than contradictory, avoiding the required simultaneous impulses in scene for higher bands. The final renunciation of borders between self and other shows credible endurance but lacks a visible on-page cost tied to flaws.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned images of ink, stars, and the halo, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing when the fragment cracks, releasing light as proof with conceptual cost in the ongoing chase; orientation anchors early with Mara in the topaz workshop under stars. However, causality feels loose without motivated ellipsis changing options, and the ending reweights without a decisive before/after change. No orientation debt, but ambiguity persists slightly past midpoint without fully teaching a pattern for payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The topaz workshop under vanishing stars is vividly sensory, with pulsing walls and topaz dust constraining choices like refracting light for deciphering; details filter through Mara's poetic bias, mirroring her internal quest, as in the walls breathing like lungs. Environment charges the final image with a galaxy of feelings, meeting the 9+ test by constraining the closure. Tone tensions the ethereal with precise printing actions, though some details like violet hue feel ornamental.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake in understanding emotion's mathematics signals early and deepens through the halo's echo of verses, with one meaningful cadence shift when the fragment brightens approvingly; under Textural lens, pattern break at the cracking reweights with conceptual cost. However, pressure remains abstract without narrowing options via agency, and no clear reversal forces stance crystallization. Coincidence of the crack complicates but resolves without protagonist-driven escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme of emotion as a transposed function emerges from images like mapping sorrow to minor thirds, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity that invites reflection; the final image of shards as micro-verses offers a resonant, non-literal answer reweighting the premise without stating it. Subtext in deliberate ambiguity and borrowed personalities enriches complexity. However, some direct statements like the theorem echo thesis overtly, bordering on thematic echo in the ending.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with lyric compression taught through patterned metaphors, maintaining legibility at closure; perceptual signature is distinct in poetic noticing of rhythms and equations. Prose texture is purposeful with rhythmic control, like the breathing workshop. No dialogue, so policy skips those bullets; however, some diction drifts into academic register like "theorem" and "transposed function" without full POV motivation under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense with vivid metaphors advancing atmosphere, like the halo shimmering like a cracked mirror, but paraphrase loops appear in repetitive descriptions of borrowing personalities and ambiguity, dulling momentum; sentence rhythm varies but template cadence emerges in phrases like "she believed" and "she felt." Figurative language stacks heavily in peak beats without full payoff, triggering overwrite penalty. Final line resolves with image but carries synonym churn in "lucid turbulence."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The premise of a letterpress operator encoding poets' empathy into a halo fragment offers fresh synthesis of art, math, and mysticism, transforming tropes through specific details like topaz dust refraction; risk in deliberate ambiguity heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry. Emotional complexity feels authentic, avoiding generics. However, some echoes of surrealist poetry feel proximate without full transformation.</comment>
