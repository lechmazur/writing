<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to confront fear is clear and rooted in her brother's resuscitation, but interiority relies on abstract phosphorescence metaphors rather than embodied contradictions; the advisor's traits feel one-note and stereotypical without status dynamics pressuring choices. Emotions are performed through flickering eyes and trembling hands, lacking simultaneous contradictory impulses in key moments like swallowing the clasp. The final endurance carries a felt cost of eternal luminance, earning some credit, but flaws like stock dread phrasing limit depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building through recurring images like luminance and rot, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration in the final bargain where Mara accepts a charged poise with conceptual cost. Orientation anchors early in the moonlit carnival, avoiding penalties, but causality feels elliptical with events like the horse dissolving relying on patterned elision rather than strict linkage. Closure lands on-page with the advisor's offer reweighting her victory, though some setups like the dream dictionary notes feel under-motivated.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The abandoned carnival funhouse is vividly anchored with sensory details like copper-tasting air and cracked mirrors, selectively filtered through Mara's dread-biased perception; it constrains choices by warping reflections into grotesque portraits that pressure her advance. Atmosphere of repulsive allure supports the surreal tone, with the carousel horse as a micro-setting that charges the climax by dissolving into ink. Recurring luminance evolves causally, mirroring her internal state without overt symbolism, though some repetitive rot descriptors risk redundancy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><grade>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, pressure accumulates through intensifying luminance and shadows, with one meaningful deepening when Mara places the clasp, narrowing options and forcing her to whisper 'vanish'. Dominant stake of tricking fear escalates to a visible cost in the eternal beacon, but coincidence like the funhouse inhaling complicates without resolving. Agency via renunciation forecloses paths, though internal-external weave is optional and lightly present here.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of confronting fear through paradox emerges organically from images like the cursed rose and dream notes, culminating in a resonant final image that reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext in gestures like swallowing the clasp implies deeper dread, inviting reflection on terror's allure. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality, but some abstract statements like "unbosom the carnival’s heart" border on overt.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable with Mara's perceptual bias in noticing luminance, but voice drifts into overwrought diction like "slithering susurrus" that feels unmotivated for her state. Dialogue from the advisor carries subtext and advances plot through bargains, with distinct idiom, though under stress, syntax compresses inconsistently. Patterned elision in surreal descriptions is taught early and pays off at closure, avoiding head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense with figurative language, but overwriting muddles clarity in peak beats like the shudder rippling "unspooling shadows like ribbons of black smoke," mixing metaphors and triggering -0.6 penalty. Repetitive stems around "lingering luminance" create template cadence in adjacent sentences, dulling momentum without payoff, adding -0.4. Rhythm varies, but scaffold redundancies like multiple rot descriptors obscure propulsion; final line recharges motifs but artifacts touch closure, capping high bands.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Surreal synthesis of carnival horror with paradoxical dream notes offers a fresh angle on fear confrontation, transforming tropes through specific elements like the photographically cursed rose that constrains the climax. Risk-taking in lyric compression heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in the advisor's bargain. However, echoes of gothic decay feel derivative without bolder subversion.</comment>
