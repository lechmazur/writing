<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The skimmer's motivation to navigate without moving is clear and consistent, intensifying through stillness to a resonant endurance with felt cost of surrender. Interiority is concrete via embodied listening to wingbeats and pulse, revealing character through micro-choices like tracing the arrowhead. However, internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses, relying on summary reflection rather than dramatized tension. The final renunciation feels earned but could deepen with more embodied contradiction in the observation beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through layered images and patterns to an Earned Stasis closure where the skimmer becomes the landmark, with conceptual cost of eternal waiting made legible in the final image. Orientation anchors who (skimmer), where (bone tower in canyon), and when (centuries of dust) by line 3, serving the meditative drive. One continuous scene fits scope, with meaningful deepening via the flock's patterns reweighting knowledge. No causality breaks, but ellipsis in pulse's wandering could tighten for stronger linkage to closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The canyon of endless echoes and towers of bone provide vivid, purposeful specificity, constraining the skimmer's stillness and charging the final image where shadows kiss ribs at noon. Sensory details like humming walls and dust motes are filtered through the skimmer's perceptive bias, mirroring internal resolve without overt symbolism. Atmosphere evolves causally with the flock's arrival and dispersal, supporting tone. The micro-setting of the arrowhead and bones integrates action, elevating to 9+ by directly shaping the closure's directional insight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of capturing the wandering pulse signals early and deepens once through the flock's patterns, forcing stance crystallization in stillness with felt cost of forsaken motion. Agency manifests in renunciation that forecloses chasing, reweighting options under the textural lens. Pressure coheres without coincidence, but lacks a secondary accent for fuller braiding. The tightening in "the pulse nestle into its chest cavity" drives the resonant ending, though cost could be more viscerally embodied.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of guidance through alignment rather than pursuit emerges organically from images like the flock's hymn and smoothed arrowhead, inviting reflection on stillness without moralizing. Subtext in silence and wingbeats builds resonance, with the final image offering a non-literal answer that reweights the premise. Emotional aftereffect lingers via weathered resolve, avoiding sentimentality. However, some abstractions like "physics dressed in reverence" border on direct statement, slightly diluting implicit complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV maintains consistent distance, with perceptual signature biased toward auditory and tactile echoes, modulating rhythm under the flock's pressure without head-hopping. Prose texture in syntax and diction creates a distinct, weathered voice, teaching patterned elision early for lyric effect paid off at closure. No dialogue, so policy skips those bullets; free indirect style is clean and voice-motivated. Perceptual control under stress heightens immersion, meeting 9+ test with rhythmic propulsion in peak beats like the crows' bank.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with rhythmic variety, varying sentence openings and paragraph lengths for natural propulsion, free of loops or scaffold. Figurative language like "black as obsidian shards" is purposeful and coherent, accelerating in the flock beat without muddle. Clarity shines in concise advancement of atmosphere and theme, with strong verbs and specific nouns; zero artifacts touch closure. Opening anchors voice, final line recharges motifs, fully integrated for rare high band.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of stillness as navigation transforms familiar quest tropes through specific, fantastical elements like bone towers and bird patterns, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in meditative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, committing to premise with authentic vision. Emotional specificity in resolve avoids generics, with fresh inflection in the pulse's physics-reverence blend. Proximity check clears; no echoes of famous scenes, elevating via bold conceptual integrity.</comment>
