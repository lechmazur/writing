<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The mapper's motivation for a patient revolution is clear and rooted in traits like purposeful grace, intensifying through micro-choices like marking coordinates that reveal her hierarchy of values with felt cost in enduring silence. Interiority is concrete, embodying contradictory impulses in her restrained wildness, as seen in "sculpted patience from impatience," avoiding stock phrasing. However, secondary characters (children, parents) apply pressure but lack distinct status dynamics, slightly flattening relational crucibles.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned images of frost and moon paths, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where the revolution deepens into "the air they breathed," with conceptual cost in empires cracking. Orientation anchors who (mapper), where (basalt sanctuary by frozen lake), and when (after freeze) by the first sentence, serving closure. One meaningful deepening suffices, with elision taught early via poetic compression paying off in the final thaw mapping.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and purposeful, with the frozen lake and viaduct constraining choices like aligning lattices with moon tracks, charging the final image of thaw without fear. Sensory details are selective, reflecting POV bias toward lunar harmonics, and evolve causally from storm-bruised sky to midwinter overflow. The basalt sanctuary mirrors internal stillness, guiding transformation subtly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of nurturing a patient revolution signals early and deepens through cadence shifts like children arriving, reweighting with cost in old rulers' surrender. Pressure coheres accumulatively, crystallizing stance in the mapper's endurance, foreclosing haste with felt conceptual cost. One tightening via viaduct's resonance change suffices, though coincidence of followers complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of patience over rage emerges organically from images like frost spreading and viaduct lullabies, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in "restrained wildness." Subtext in silence and wonder invites reflection, earning resonance through the final non-literal answer of mapping thaw with reverence. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality via concrete particulars like whispering thanks.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in selective noticing of magnetic hums and lunar tides, modulating rhythm under pressure like wind-translated glyphs. Prose texture is distinct in poetic syntax and diction, teaching patterned elision early for legibility at closure. No dialogue present, so not evaluated; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in sentences like "The revolution she nurtured did not roar — it rippled," advancing atmosphere without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent, avoiding muddle in peak beats like the viaduct's transformation. Opening anchors voice; final line recharges motifs with propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Originality shines in synthesizing revolution as quiet contagion via moon mapping, transforming tropes of rebellion through specific, non-obvious details like brass sextant alignments. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Core premise offers fresh angle on patience, committing fully without hedging.</comment>
