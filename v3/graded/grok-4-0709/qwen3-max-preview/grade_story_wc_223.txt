<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation as a historian of small gestures is clear and intensifies through reflective choices, with embodied contradictions in surviving pretense versus raw absence; however, the internal conflict feels more summarized than simultaneous in key scenes, slightly diluting pressure at the climax where the sovereign arrives.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned reflections and glyphs, landing a valid Conceptual Repricing closure where the sovereign trembles at being seen, with conceptual cost in luminous absence; orientation anchors early in the gallery, but some shards feel elliptically linked without tighter causal ellipsis, mildly softening the overall pattern payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The whispering gallery setting is vividly anchored with echoing silences and circular floor, constraining choices through its architecture for walking patterns; sensory details like slants of window-light and penumbra mirror internal states purposefully, charging the final image where the penumbra pools at the sovereign's feet.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, the dominant stake in archiving gestures escalates via pattern breaks like adding survivors' glyphs and the widow's unbinding, with one meaningful deepening that reweights absence as power; however, pressure remains somewhat abstract without a sharper on-page cost at closure, limiting felt urgency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of absence as syntax emerges organically from images like the pawnless chessboard and penumbra, offering resonant ambiguity in how small gestures sustain worlds; the final image provides a non-literal repricing of power without moralizing, though some epiphanies border on overt statement in lines like "history isn’t moved by kings alone."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person voice maintains a distinct poetic texture with rhythmic syntax and perceptual bias toward luminous absences, teaching patterned elision early; brief dialogue like the widow's whisper carries subtext effectively, and psychic distance shifts intentionally to heighten clarity at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with vivid, multi-job sentences like "the penumbra thickened, not with darkness, but with a clarity that hurt," varying rhythm purposefully; minor paraphrase loops in reflective blocks slightly drag momentum, but no artifacts obscure the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes crisis acting with nomadic penumbra in a fresh interregnum frame, transforming tropes of loss through specific gestures like spelling words via walking; risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens thematic stakes, feeling inevitable at the sovereign's trembling without gimmickry.</comment>
