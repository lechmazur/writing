<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to sanctify forgotten architectures through displaced objects is clear and intensifies via embodied interiority, like the "hushed blaze" in her chest, revealing contradictory impulses of reverence and release; however, the solitary focus limits relational crucibles, though micro-choices under hush pressure earn the endurance with felt emotional cost at the placement moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through reflective shards to a Conceptual Repricing closure where the shard's dissolution releases the cottage's spirit with undeniable conceptual cost, anchored early in who (noticer), where (bay), and when (spring evening); one meaningful deepening suffices, but minor orientation waiver isn't needed as anchors land by ~120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The quiet bay in spring constrains choices with moss-slick stones and salt-kissed air, charging the final image of the shard dissolving into tide-carried memory; sensory details like butter-yellow streetlights and whispering reeds are selective, POV-biased, and evolve causally, mirroring internal hush without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the dominant stake of honoring lingering architectures escalates via pattern break in the hush deepening and shard glowing, forcing stance crystallization with felt cost in the protagonist's chest warmth; however, pressure remains more atmospheric than agency-driven, with no clear foreclosure of options beyond conceptual release.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of navigating creeping normality through reverent sanctification emerges organically from particulars like the orris root's ghost-notes and vanished cottage's release, offering a resonant, non-literal answer in the final image of walking beside the tide with heart alight; subtext in silence and implication avoids moralizing, embracing complexity without false equivalence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in textured thoughts like "hush...clung like pollen to the inside of her ribs," and rhythmic control heightens pressure through purposeful compression; no dialogue present, so policy skips evaluation, and patterned elision teaches lyric mode early for legible closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with vivid, propulsion-driven sentences like "the shard glowed faintly, not with light, but with presence," varying rhythm naturally without loops or artifacts; figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated, accelerating momentum to the hushed blaze without overwriting in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The premise of a noticer sanctifying memory architectures via displaced objects offers fresh synthesis of creeping normality and scent as emotional scaffolding, transforming tropes through specific, inevitable details like the orris root's inadvertent profundity; risk in lyric structure heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
