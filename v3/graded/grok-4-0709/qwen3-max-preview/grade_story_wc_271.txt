<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interiority with embodied emotions and contradictory impulses, like the freeze leading to joy amid grief; motivation roots in trauma and intensifies to compel sketching as renunciation of survival-only mode, with felt cost in the pearl's pulse; therapy-speak like "somatic markers" slightly abstracts emotions but doesn't derail pivotal moments; the sister's laugh echoing as frequency reconfigures internal conflict without stock epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, reflective shards build density through images like the pearl, culminating in Conceptual Repricing where stillness reweights trauma with conceptual cost in the pulse; orientation anchors early in the arboretum; single POV with one transition to ongoing dawns fits defaults; closure lands on-page with undeniable pressure, though causality is more pattern than strict linkage.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details like wind-rattled glass and damp soil filter through POV bias, mirroring internal regrowth; setting constrains choices by enabling grounding and collaboration with nature; the arboretum's decay charges the final pearl image, evolving causally without static repetition; micro-setting of bench and paths guides barefoot presence purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of anchoring optimism signals early and deepens via the freeze, reweighting grief with one meaningful cadence shift to charged poise; internal conflict interweaves with wants versus fear of recurrence, forcing stance crystallization; cost is felt in tears and shifted weight, though coincidence of dewdrop slightly complicates without resolving; agency in endurance forecloses escape, earning resonance under textural lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of stillness as eye within chaos emerges organically from images like the pearl and sketches, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in ruin-regrowth coexistence; subtext in silence and ivy frames invites reflection; final pulse image offers resonant, non-literal repricing of trauma without statement; emotional honesty avoids sentimentality through concrete particulars like jasmine-gunpowder scent.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable first-person POV with distinct perceptual signature in noticing spirals and frequencies, modulating rhythm under emotional intensity like the swelling freeze; prose texture in syntax and diction reflects mind-state, with purposeful compression in reflections; no dialogue, so policy skips those bullets; elision of time teaches pattern early and pays off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with sentences advancing atmosphere and character, like bark-tracing freezing into pearl; rhythmic variety breathes with moments, avoiding loops or scaffold; figurative language coherent and voice-motivated, such as pearl expanding without muddle; zero artifacts in closure, with propulsion through idiosyncratic details like ivy-swallowed slats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of trauma recovery through arboretum collaboration transforms tropes like healing walks via specific somatic markers and pearl concept; emotional specificity in laugh-frequency avoids generics; risk in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry; core premise commits to implications, feeling inevitable in hindsight via sketches as gifts.</comment>
