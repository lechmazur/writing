<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Arlen's diligent curiosity is embodied through obsessive noting and pattern recognition, driving choices like decoding the hopscotch with concrete micro-choices under pressure. Motivation intensifies credibly, culminating in his fluent "whispering back" that forecloses isolation with felt social cost. Minor weakness in lacking contradictory impulses in peak moments, but traits align consistently without stereotypes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with pattern buildup from observations to reconfiguration, anchoring orientation early via airship and Arlen. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration via Charged Poise in the final image of chalk-charting and self-dog-ear, with conceptual cost of transformed isolation legible on-page. One meaningful deepening suffices, but lacks a persistent constraint shaping tactics for higher band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The antique airship setting constrains choices through portholes, deck, and balloon, charging the final luminous ballet image with recurring murmurations that mirror internal discovery. Sensory details like groaning brass and chalk dust are selective, POV-filtered, and evolve causally, heightening atmosphere without stalling. Environment directly shapes the hopscotch decoding and luminance redirection, meeting 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of charting discovery escalates via accumulative pattern recognition, with one meaningful deepening in hopscotch revelation forcing stance crystallization and visible cost in crew's awe. Pressure coheres under Textural lens, but coincidence of finding the board complicates without fully resolving, capping at 8.3 per guardrail. Agency in directing hops drives reconfiguration with unmistakable on-page cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of finding fluency in blank spaces emerges organically from patterns and luminance, with subtext in whispers and dances inviting reflection on discovery's isolation. Final image offers resonant, non-literal repricing of motivation without moralizing, reweighting prior material. Avoids sentimentality through concrete particulars, but lacks deeper counter-readings for 9+.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature in Arlen's muttering and noting, rhythmic control via varied syntax heightening pressure in decoding beats. Dialogue is natural, subtextual, and advances plot, like Veyra's skepticism melting to awe. No head-hopping or elision issues, meeting 9+ test with voice modulating purposefully under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm and syntax to propel accumulative buildup, free of loops or artifacts in peak beats like hopscotch tracing. Figurative language like "living inkblots" is controlled, purposeful, and coherent without muddle. Opening anchors voice; final line recharges motifs with propulsion, but minor scaffold in repetitive "noting" stems deducts slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of hopscotch as luminance map transforms familiar discovery trope through specific airship constraints and pattern-noting, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk in lyric, accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, but proximity to steampunk archetypes lacks bolder subversion for 9+.</comment>
