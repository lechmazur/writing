<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The traveler's motivation to map absences through writing is clear and intensifies via embodied grief, with interior contradictions in projecting presence amid sorrow; the final act of folding the obituary into a crane reveals a hierarchy of values with felt cost, earning the renunciation of closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through reflective shards with one meaningful deepening at the obituary's completion; closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration via Charged Poise in the final image of mapping absence, with conceptual cost legible in the thread's resonance, though orientation anchors slightly late at ~150 words without payoff waiver.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The shadowed autumn garden constrains choices through damp stone and falling leaves, charging the final image of the rosebush and moonlight on the thread; sensory details are vivid, POV-filtered, and evolve causally, mirroring internal decay and splendor without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of understanding healing through explained absences escalates via textural density in the writing process, with one meaningful deepening that reweights absence as presence; agency in the traveler's renunciation forecloses forgetting with felt emotional cost, coherent under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of mapping grief to orient healing emerges organically from particulars like the thread and obituary, culminating in a resonant final image that reweights absence without moralizing; subtext in ivy-choked arches and lichen tears invites ambiguity on memory's cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in selective, memory-biased noticing; prose texture in rhythmic syntax and purposeful fragments teaches a lyric pattern paid off at closure, with no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with vivid, propulsion-driven sentences free of loops or artifacts; metaphors like "ink bleeding like old wounds" are coherent and voice-motivated, varying rhythm naturally to heighten the final image without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original synthesis of obituary-writing as cartography transforms familiar grief tropes through specific details like the weft thread and geography of healing, with bold lyric risk-taking heightening thematic stakes in the resonant ending.</comment>
