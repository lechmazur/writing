<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to understand lies is clear and intensifies through patient observation, culminating in an earned renunciation of chasing legends for honoring ruins, with felt cost in the weight of hindsight clarity. Interiority is concrete and embodied, showing contradictory impulses like hesitation before reaching into the water, revealing values with visible trade-offs. No other characters appear, so relationship bullets are ignored, but single-POV depth excels without stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds with pattern breaks in imagery building to a Conceptual Repricing closure, where the locket's discovery reweights lies as protective architecture with conceptual cost of human frailty made undeniable. Orientation anchors who (seeker), where (canal), and when (twilight to morning silence) by ~50 words, waiving any penalty. One continuous scene fits defaults, with meaningful deepening via the sundial's shadow aligning with the glint, though causality is more poetic than strict linkage.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The twilight barge canal is vividly specific, with moss-slicked edges and lapping water constraining choices like kneeling without slipping, charging the final image as the canal exhales secrets no longer kept. Sensory details are selective and POV-biased, mirroring internal calm amid upheaval, with environment evolving causally from churn to murmur. Micro-setting of the water's surface and pilings guides action purposefully, meeting 9+ test by constraining the salvage moment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of understanding lies' architecture escalates texturally through density increase in reflective patterns, tightening once via the glint's response to the sundial, forcing stance crystallization with felt cost of accepting frailty. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, with agency in patient waiting foreclosing impulsive action. No multiple reversals needed; cost is legible in the locket's sorrowful inscription reweighting options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of lies as protective structures emerges organically from images like vaulted ceilings of distraction, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer via the locket's inscription that reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext in silences and implications enriches ambiguity, inviting reflection on frailty with emotional honesty. Meets 9+ test by reweighting prior material through the final realization.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in selective noticing of shadows and silences, rhythmic control modulating with pressure via varied syntax. Purposeful compression in lyric mode is taught early and pays off at closure without head-hopping. No dialogue present, so ignored; meets 9+ test with elision of action details heightening introspection.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied rhythm, zero loops or scaffolds, and metaphors like "serene upheaval" cohering without muddle, accelerating in peak beats like the locket's retrieval. Information density high, with lines advancing atmosphere and character; no artifacts touch closure. Meets 9+ test with clear propulsion and figurative clarity under pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of legend-seeking as patient salvage transforms tropes through specific motifs like the sundial measuring regret, feeling inevitable with risk in quiet, introspective structure heightening thematic stakes. Originality in conceptualizing lies' architecture avoids generics, committing to premise without hedging. Bold lyric risk coheres without gimmickry, earning +0.3 within band.</comment>
