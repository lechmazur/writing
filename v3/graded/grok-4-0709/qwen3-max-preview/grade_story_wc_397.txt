<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation as "terminally curious" is concrete and intensifies through micro-choices like tapping the parasol tip and climbing the floe, revealing contradictory impulses under pressure. The final renunciation of euthanasia feels earned by the glacier's sigh, foreclosing her prior path with visible emotional cost. Interiority avoids stock phrasing, embodying emotions in perceptual shifts like gripping reality loosely evolving to letting it flow.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the mosaic structure builds through patterned shards of listening and volunteering, with legible transitions and a coherent Conceptual Repricing at the glacier's collapse. Orientation anchors early in the drift-ice marina post-storm. Closure lands on-page with the floe's drift and her realization, carrying conceptual cost in reweighting endings as singing thresholds. One meaningful deepening suffices, but minor ellipsis in the rescue slightly softens causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina is vividly specific, with groaning floes and calving bergs constraining choices like the black ice slip that triggers the ringing. Sensory details, filtered through Elara's auditory bias, evolve causally and charge the final image on the shrinking raft. Atmosphere of salt and surrender mirrors her internal state without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of learning endings' sound tightens accumulatively through the parasol's wet chime, forcing her stance crystallization on the floe with felt cost of isolation. Agency in walking toward the water forecloses safety, reweighting options under textural pressure. Coherent escalation narrows her curiosity to transition, though the rescue coincidence complicates without fully resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of endings as resonant thresholds emerges organically from images like unraveling lace and humming mothers, culminating in a non-literal final reconfiguration without moralizing. Subtext in silences and sighs invites ambiguity, resisting tidy binaries. The glacier's exhalation offers resonant repricing, tying protagonist arc to complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable third-person close POV maintains perceptual signature through auditory bias and patterned compression, with rhythmic syntax reflecting Elara's loosened grip on reality. No head-hopping or elision issues; purposeful poetic diction is taught early and pays off at closure. Prose texture modulates with intensity, heightening the suspended breath moment.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>High density and propulsion shine in varied rhythms, like the low wet chime sentence, with zero loops or artifacts. Figurative language integrates seamlessly, accelerating momentum without muddle in peak beats like the glacier's sigh. Clarity and concision advance atmosphere through idiosyncratic details, passing read-aloud with natural flow.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of euthanasia tourism with acoustic finitude in an ice marina transforms tropes through specific auditory motifs and bold risk in the drifting climax. Originality heightens stakes via the parasol's evolution, feeling inevitable in hindsight without gimmickry. Emotional complexity avoids generics, committing to a singular poetic vision.</comment>
