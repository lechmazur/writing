<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elira's motivation to subsume remorse is clear and intensifies compellingly, with embodied emotions shining in her trembling hands and the tidal wave of anguish at the pillar touch, revealing contradictory impulses under pressure; interiority is concrete and particular, avoiding stock phrasing, though secondary characters are absent as per scope.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through emotional deepening to a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost in her hollowed wholeness; orientation anchors early in the desert fortress, with one meaningful tightening in the basin plunge, though ellipsis in the ascent slightly softens causal linkage without breaking closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The desert fortress after rain and subterranean pavilion are vividly specific, with sensory details like hoarfrost crunch and petrichor charging the final image; setting constrains choices, such as following puddle reflections, and mirrors internal states organically, meeting the 9+ test by shaping the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of subsuming remorse escalates through textural density in contacts with pillars and basin, driven by agency with unmistakable cost in her burning skin and reshaped bones; one meaningful deepening forces stance crystallization, satisfying the lens without requiring multiple reversals.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of absorbing sorrow to enable release emerges organically from images like smoothed stones and dissolving remorse, offering a resonant non-literal answer in the final petrichor possibility; subtext in gestures and implications enriches complexity without moralizing, reweighting prior material at closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in memory-tasting bias and rhythmic prose that modulates with intensity, like shortened sentences under anguish; no head-hopping or elision issues, with syntax reflecting her sorrowful precision, meeting the 9+ test cleanly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied rhythm, vivid metaphors like "liquid shadow" advancing atmosphere without muddle; zero loops or artifacts, high information density in peak beats like the basin plunge, satisfying the 9+ test with flawless clarity at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tasting memories and subsuming remorse in a coral pavilion feels inevitable, with risk-taking in poetic structure heightening emotional stakes; premise transforms familiar grief tropes through specific details like tidal pool analysis, avoiding derivatives.</comment>
