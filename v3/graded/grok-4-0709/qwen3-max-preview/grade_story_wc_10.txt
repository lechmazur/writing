<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The survivor's motivation to translate silence into music is clear and intensifies through embodied actions like striking the fork, revealing contradictory impulses of grief and resolve in her weeping from marvel. Interiority is concrete, with emotions embodied in thermal blooms and bone vibrations, avoiding stock phrasing. The meaningful endurance earns stasis by foreclosing despair with felt cost, shown in her silent expressiveness constraining communication yet enabling her method.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through emotional mappings to a Conceptual Repricing closure where silence is reweighted as vibrant, with conceptual cost in the world's hush made undeniable in the final humming image. Orientation anchors who, where, and when by the first paragraph, with no disorientation debt. One meaningful deepening suffices, as thermal activations accumulate resonance without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The winterglass conservatory is vividly specific, with frost-limned panes and frozen ferns constraining choices like striking the fountain's ice, charging the final image of the humming space. Sensory details are purposeful, filtered through her visor and biased toward thermal overlays, evolving causally as vibrations spread. Micro-setting of the fountain and skylight pressures her mission without generic clichés.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of rectifying silence signals early and deepens through fork activations, forcing stance crystallization in her marvel-weeping under a Textural lens, with felt cost in emotional exposure. One tightening via the ice's resonant fracture narrows options, interweaving internal conflict authentically. Agency in endurance forecloses absence-assumption with visible price in her skin-hearing shift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of silence as presence emerges organically from thermal mappings and vibrations, culminating in a resonant final image that reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext in gestures like palm on ground conveys emotional complexity, inviting reflection on loss and marvel. Earned insight from her method avoids platitudes, embracing ambiguity in fossilized laughter.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in thermal visors and bone conduction, modulating rhythmically under emotional peaks like the fracture. Prose texture is purposeful, with lyric compression taught early and paid off in silent symphony. No dialogue, so policy skips those bullets; elision of sound enhances voice coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in phrases like "brittle geometry of ice-limned glass panes" advancing atmosphere without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is controlled, avoiding muddle in peak beats like the fork strike, with strong verbs propelling momentum. Final line recharges motifs cleanly, passing read-aloud test with natural cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Premise ingeniously synthesizes sci-fi elements like thermal emotions with lyrical silence-translation, feeling inevitable in her bone-hearing shift, transforming tropes of loss into fresh marvel. Risk in quiet, internal arc heightens stakes without gimmickry, committing to premise implications. Specific details like fork frequencies anchor originality, avoiding stock metaphors.</comment>
