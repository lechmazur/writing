<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to graft meaning onto wounds is clear and intensifies through embodied empathy, with contradictory impulses of dread and kinship shown in the decryption beat; the final renunciation feels earned with visible emotional cost, as in pressing the coral to the cast and murmuring reassurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through deepening imagery and resonance, with orientation anchored early in the atrium; closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration via the transformed cast and realized kinship, with felt conceptual cost, though one more explicit tightening could elevate it further.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium's vivid, sensory details—condensation refracting twilight into liquid gold—mirror Mira's internal dissolve and charge the final threshold image, constraining her liminal journey without overwhelming the scope.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The dominant internal stake of unknotting shared anxieties escalates through anesthetic deepening and decryption, forcing stance crystallization with felt cost in the rearranged smudges; agency shines in her whispered phrases, though coincidence in the cast's appearance slightly softens pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of witnessing and braiding pain into kinship emerges organically from coral and cast motifs, culminating in a resonant final image that reweights wounds as symbiosis without moralizing; subtext in smudged phrases invites lingering ambiguity on memory's suturing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Close third-person POV remains stable and character-specific, with perceptual signature filtering through translator's empathetic decryption; prose texture in rhythmic, purposeful syntax heightens emotional beats, teaching patterned elision that pays off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with varied rhythm and propulsion, free of loops or artifacts; figurative language like "memory and metaphor bled together like ink on wet paper" coheres without muddle, advancing atmosphere and character in every line, especially the resonant final paragraph.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes trauma translation with oceanic relics in a fresh, non-obvious way, transforming familiar grief tropes through specific decryption and coral resonance; risk in hallucinatory structure heightens stakes organically, feeling inevitable at the kinship realization.</comment>
