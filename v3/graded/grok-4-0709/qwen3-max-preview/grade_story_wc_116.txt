<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The keeper's motivation to witness without judgment is clear and intensifies through embodied actions like unfolding the swan and hesitating at return, revealing contradictory impulses in weeping for beauty's fragility. Interiority is concrete and particular, with emotions layered in scene, such as the pulse of millennia felt in palms. However, the character leans archetypal without sharp flaws complicating choices, slightly limiting depth in this solitary POV.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through descriptive shards to a Resonant Reconfiguration in the keeper's softened state, with felt cost in the exquisite fragility acknowledged on-page. Orientation anchors early in the overgrown library, and the mosaic pattern is taught by 25% with legible transitions into the refuge. Closure lands as Earned Stasis, but lacks a more decisive tightening, holding it just below exceptional.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details like crunching scrolls and cinnamon-scented paper filter through the keeper's reverence, mirroring internal change without overt symbolism. The catacombs and obsidian refuge constrain choices, such as burrowing via the swan, and charge the final image of crumbling peace. Micro-setting of the origami swan evolves causally, enhancing atmosphere with purposeful economy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake of witnessing change without judgment signals early and deepens once through entering the refuge, reweighting options in the spiral of time under the Accumulative lens. Agency in stepping into the fold forecloses paths with felt cost in the keeper's alteration, but pressure remains low-key without a sharper reversal or ethical calculus. Coherent yet static conflict limits escalation to one meaningful cadence shift at return.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of witnessing as love emerges organically from images like dissolving civilizations and the river's indifference, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in fragility's beauty. The final image of smiling in crumbling peace offers a resonant, non-literal repricing of existence's cost without statement. Subtext in silences and motifs like folds deepens reflection, tied inextricably to the keeper's arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable third-person close POV maintains perceptual signature through selective, biased noticing like silence as regenerative, with rhythmic control in lyrical syntax that heightens without obscurity. No head-hopping or elision issues; purposeful compression in the spiral teaches its pattern early and pays off at closure. Prose texture distinct in metaphor and rhythm, modulating with emotional intensity like the held breath vow.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density and propulsion in vivid, multi-job sentences like "forests grew teeth and swallowed cities," with varied rhythm and no loops or artifacts dulling clarity. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, avoiding muddle in peak beats like the weeping moment. Information advances atmosphere and theme concisely, though occasional stacked metaphors in the refuge description approach overwriting without harming momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archival fantasy with poetic entropy, transforming tropes like time travel through specific images of beetle wings and star maps, feeling inevitable in the swan's riddles. Risk in nonlinear mosaic heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry, committing to the premise's implications. Originality shines in non-obvious angle on judgment-free love, though it echoes mythic archetypes without full subversion.</comment>
