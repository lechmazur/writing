<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to negotiate with her ghost is clear and intensifies through embodied contradictions, like recalling conflicting memories that drive her collecting habit. Interiority is concrete and particular, with emotions layered in hypocritical self-deception, such as regretting ambition while persisting in scavenging. The final renunciation of regret feels earned by prior micro-choices, like handing over the camera, foreclosing the path of hoarding with a visible emotional cost in the dissolving ghost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density increasing through patterned fragments and a cadence shift at the spire climax, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing where the note reweights past ambitions with undeniable cost. Orientation anchors who (scavenger), where (lagoon rim), and when (post-stillness) by the first paragraph, waiving any penalty. Closure lands on-page with the ghost's dissolution and the narrator's stasis, though one more explicit causal link in the envelope reveal could tighten inevitability.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The kinetic lagoon setting is vivid and purposeful, with salt-crusted planks and floating islands constraining movement and mirroring internal stasis, charging the final dangling-legs image. Sensory details are selective and POV-biased, like wind echoes and coral dust, evolving causally without repetition. The environment directly shapes choices, such as climbing the spire, meeting the 9+ test by constraining the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of negotiating eroded ambitions signals early and deepens through a meaningful cadence shift when the ghost takes the camera, reweighting options with the cost of dissolved self-haunting. Pressure coheres under the textural lens, with agency in renunciation foreclosing endless spinning, though coincidence in the drawer opening slightly complicates without resolving. The felt cost of released regret is unmistakable on-page, meeting the 9+ test but capped by minor lens ambiguity in mid-story reflections.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of ambition as illusory carousel emerges organically from images like the scratched record and ticket stubs, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in the ghost's correction. Subtext in gestures, like mimed lens adjustment, invites reflection on self-forgiveness without confusion. The final note offers a resonant, non-literal repricing of the past as frameable, reweighting prior material effectively.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable and apt, with perceptual signature in selective noticing of relics like the camera, biased by regret. Prose texture is distinct in rhythmic, poetic syntax that modulates with intensity, teaching patterned elision early and paying off at closure. No dialogue present, so policy skips evaluation; no head-hopping or elision issues obscure clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied rhythm in sentences like "boots crunching on salt-crusted planks" advancing atmosphere without loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, avoiding muddle in peak beats like the flash "bursts like a dying star." Zero artifacts touch closure, with high information density in every line.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The surreal premise of a stilled carousel lagoon synthesizes familiar regret tropes into a non-obvious, inevitable whole, with risk in chronological confusion heightening stakes without gimmickry. Originality shines in particulars like fossilized sighs and the camera's role, transforming archetypes through voice and theme. The core frame feels memorable and committed, with the envelope reveal arising from established patterns.</comment>
