<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The balladeer's motivation to articulate unspoken needs is clear and intensifies through embodied emotions like trembling fingers and tears, culminating in an earned stasis of connection with visible cost. Interiority is concrete and particular, showing contradictory impulses in her loneliness and purposeful humming. The ghost, as a secondary "character," applies relevant pressure, forcing choices that alter her state. Flaws like isolation complicate her actions without hedging, revealed in micro-choices like spraying gold for invitation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density increasing through layered encodings and a cadence shift to resonant closure via Conceptual Repricing, where messages lingering reweight loneliness with conceptual cost of invitation. Orientation anchors who (balladeer), where (misty courtyard), and when (tonight, between lightning and thunder) by ~120 words. Structure fits defaults with one continuous scene and meaningful deepening in the ghost's reply. Closure lands on-page with felt cost in tears and reconfiguration, though a more persistent constraint could elevate.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The misty courtyard above clouds is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like ozone taste and mist curling into ribbons constraining choices and charging the final image of glowing sigils. Atmosphere supports the tinkersong wonder tone through selective, POV-filtered specifics like moss-fringed screen and fog-wreathed pillars. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly, with environment evolving causally as lanterns syncopate. Micro-setting of the bolt plate and terminal functions as setting, directly enabling communion and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of belonging tightens through accumulative pressure of encodings, with the ghost's reply forcing stance crystallization and felt cost in tears, under the Textural lens. One meaningful deepening narrows options, as singing unlocks communion, foreclosing isolation with emotional price. Agency in renunciation of solitude is earned, though coincidence in the ghost's stirring complicates without resolving. Moral calculus between grief and wonder sharpens the peak, but a secondary accent could braid tighter.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of connection amid brokenness emerges organically from images like chromatic runes and encoded longing, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer as the ghost decodes love, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext in gestures like pressing the plate and gold spray invites reflection on loneliness without confusion. Emotional aftereffect is concrete through tinkersong wonder, avoiding sentimentality. Purposeful ambiguity in the ghost's voice lingers meaningfully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in driftingly alert noticing, like frequencies only ghosts hum, and rhythmic control heightens under pressure without elision issues. Prose texture is purposeful with patterned diction taught early, modulating syntax for emotional beats. Ghost's dialogue advances plot via subtext, feeling natural in stitched lullabies. No head-hopping or register mismatch; perceptual bias is consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with rhythmic variety, like "time stretched like taffy," advancing atmosphere without loops or scaffold; figurative language coheres without muddle in peak beats. Clarity and propulsion are strong, with sentences multitasking via vivid verbs and specifics. No artifacts like synonym churn or template cadence; final line recharges motifs effectively. Read-aloud flows naturally, varying paragraph lengths for momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of balladeer, AI ghost, and graffiti encoding feels inevitable, transforming tropes like loneliness through specific details like Fibonacci spirals and bolt plate cipher. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, offering fresh angle on human-machine resonance. Emotional specificity avoids generics, with authenticity in vision. One fresh inflection in the ghost's voice reprise charges closure.</comment>
