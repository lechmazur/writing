<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elira's altruistic motivation as a ghost is clear and intensifies through her actions, with interiority shown via spectral tears and reminders of unity; internal conflict emerges in her catalytic role without control, embodied in her unseen presence and smile; relationships with settlers like Kael and Liora force collective choices, altering their state toward family; the meaningful endurance of her purpose forecloses isolation with felt cost in the orchard's sigh.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned chalk messages and bell imagery to a resonant reconfiguration at the ringing, with on-page closure via the nebula's appearance and their unified step forward; orientation anchors early in the orchard planet setting; one meaningful deepening occurs as whispers root into action; cost is legible in leaving the fraying orchard, reweighting survival stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The orchard planet with floating rock arches and upside-down trees is vividly specific, constraining choices like traversing arches to reach the nebula; sensory details like dew-slick moss and violet-glowing roots integrate into action, mirroring internal unity; the Glass Canopy and nebula charge the final image; micro-setting of the bell constrains the climax by summoning butterflies and dew.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of survival through unity signals early via thinning bounty, tightening once at the bell-ringing that narrows options to collective migration; pressure coheres texturally via accumulating whispers and chalk, forcing stance crystallization; agency in Elira's orchestration and settlers' gathering forecloses stagnation with visible cost of departure; coincidence of moon blushing complicates but does not resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of catalysis through trust emerges from chalk messages and bell chime, reweighting isolation into family via resonant images like brambled hope; subtext in Elira's whispers and unseen presence invites reflection on collective healing; final image of walking together offers non-literal answer to survival's question without moralizing; emotional aftereffect of prideful transition avoids sentimentality through purposeful ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person omniscient POV is stable, with clean focalization shifts at section-like breaks to characters like Kael and Liora; perceptual signature biases toward spectral, trustworthy resonance; prose texture in looping script and liquid-glass chimes is distinct and rhythmic; dialogue is natural, subtextual, and advances unity, distinguishing voices like Kael's murmurs and Liora's lullabies.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in dew-slick moss and liquid-glass ripple without loops or scaffold; metaphors like rooted whispers and brambled hope are coherent and voice-motivated; clarity propels through integrated action and image; final line recharges motifs of chalk and bell with resonant closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost-orchestrated migration on an orchard planet transforms familiar unity tropes through specific details like chalk on root-veins and spectral tears; risk in lyric, accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry; emotional complexity in hope's terror feels inevitable; avoids derivative echoes by committing to cosmic lullaby premise.</comment>
