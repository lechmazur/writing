<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to uncover her brother's fate is clear and intensifies through discoveries, compelling her to lie and reassemble data, with embodied emotion in her pounding heart and clutched patch. Interiority shows contradictory impulses, like focus amid ache, but slips into stock phrasing like "bright attentiveness was her superpower." Vance, as secondary character, applies pressure but lacks depth beyond recognition of Leo. The final confrontation earns endurance with felt cost of deepening void.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Under causal lens, because/therefore linkages drive Elara from anomaly spotting to void diving and script launch, with orientation anchored early in the archive setting. Closure is a decisive change as she exposes the truth, reconfiguring options with conceptual cost of lingering absence, visible in the final lines clutching the patch. Some conveniences, like numbers appearing everywhere, weaken causality without breaking it. Persistent constraint of the archive's hunger shapes tactics effectively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The social network archive is vividly detailed with sterile glow and void partition, constraining choices like tracing numbers to shredded fragments, and charging the final image of humming silence. Sensory specifics, like flickering code and dim cockpit light, reflect POV urgency, but some generic sci-fi elements lack tactile evolution. Atmosphere supports the sensed absence tone without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of rescuing Leo escalates causally from anomaly spotting to confrontation, with meaningful tightening when Vance interrupts, forcing her script launch and truth exposure. Agency in lying and reassembling narrows options with visible cost of void deepening. Pressure coheres but feels somewhat abstract until the climax; one reversal suffices at this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of consumed memories and digital voids emerges organically from events like fragment reassembly, culminating in resonant reconfiguration that reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext in the patch and numbers invites reflection on absence, with emotional honesty avoiding sentimentality. Final image offers non-literal answer to where deleted files go, embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person close POV on Elara is stable, with perceptual signature in data-focused noticing and no head-hopping. Voice has rhythmic control, like "fingers dancing over the console," modulating under stress. Dialogue is natural, subtextual in lies to Vance, advancing plot; brief elision in video whisper pays off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose is concise with momentum, advancing through vivid images like "digital heartbeat," but paraphrase loops around numbers recurring weaken density in mid-beats. Syntax varies, but some template cadence in discovery sequences, like repeated "she found/she realized," dulls propulsion without obscuring closure. No major artifacts touch the ending; information density is solid in climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of digital archive as consciousness-devouring void transforms missing persons trope through Elara's specific choices, feeling inevitable in the climax exposure. Risk in conceptual repricing heightens stakes without gimmickry, with authentic vision in sci-fi memory theme. No close echoes of famous works; originality in numbers as timestamps elevates.</comment>
