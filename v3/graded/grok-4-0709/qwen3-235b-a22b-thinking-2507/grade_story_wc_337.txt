<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her trauma, intensifying through embodied emotions like trembling hands and the ache easing after releasing her brother's spirit; interiority is concrete and contradictory, with her unrest clashing against her purposeful unraveling. The brother encounter reveals her hierarchy of values, earning the final stasis with visible emotional cost. Some stock phrasing in her "fragmented spirit" slightly dilutes specificity, but flaws do not touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the story builds through repeated knot-unraveling beats, increasing density of silence and hush toward a cadence shift in healing; closure lands as Earned Stasis with felt cost in Elara's eased ache and steady hands. Orientation anchors early in the prism sanctuary under starlight. Persistent constraint of the net's knots shapes tactics without contradiction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary is vivid and purposeful, with crystalline walls fracturing moonlight to charge the atmosphere and final image; it constrains choices by providing the quiet space for unraveling, evolving causally as light softens with spirits' release. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, mirroring Elara's unrest. Recurring prisms charge the closure without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of grounding spirits tightens through deepening emotional pressure, culminating in the brother's release that reweights her unrest with cost; under Accumulative lens, pattern of knot releases intensifies silence's weight, forcing stance crystallization. One meaningful deepening suffices, but coincidence of brother's spirit feels slightly convenient without complicating agency. Cost is legible in her dull ache transforming to purpose.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of healing through acknowledgment emerges organically from knot-unraveling and spirit releases, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in ongoing work; subtext in silence as tangible weight and shared secrets invites reflection. The final image of steady hands in accumulating quiet offers resonant, non-literal reconfiguration without statement. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality via concrete particulars like the warming silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable and modest, with perceptual signature biased toward tactile fragments and spectral threads; prose texture is distinct in rhythmic, lyric compression that teaches patterned elision early. No dialogue, but internal voice coheres under pressure without register drift. Psychic distance shifts intentionally with emotional intensity, heightening unrest without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied rhythm and high information load in metaphors like "solidified shadow"; no major loops or artifacts, though some stacked figuratives in peak beats slightly muddle without harming clarity. Sentences advance atmosphere and character, passing read-aloud test. Final line recharges motifs effectively, but minor synonym churn in "hush" repetitions deducts lightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise ingeniously synthesizes mask restoration with spirit-exhuming via tangible silence, transforming tropes of loss into fresh, non-obvious synthesis; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes organically. Emotional specificity in the brother lullaby moment feels inevitable and authentic. No derivative echoes, with bold commitment to conceptual hush without hedging.</comment>
