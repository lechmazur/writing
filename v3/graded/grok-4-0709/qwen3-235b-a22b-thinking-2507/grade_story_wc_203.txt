<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Silas's motivation to uncover ceiling secrets is clear and rooted in his ghost-seeing gift, intensifying through discoveries like the dust patterns that compel him to climb and retrieve the key; interiority is concrete with embodied sorrow, but internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses, trending toward summary over dramatized tension in the final repair beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under a Causal lens, the plot chains discoveries logically from headlamp adjustment to fixing the bird, leading to an on-page Decisive Change where the ghost ascends with felt cost in Silas's easing burden; orientation anchors early in the ticket office at night, but the ghost's sudden materialization feels slightly convenient without tighter prior causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The abandoned circus ticket office is vividly specific with grime-caked windows, peeling posters, and dust patterns that constrain choices, like climbing the counter to reach the shelf, charging the final image as dawn light seeps in and reweights the space's decay.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of uncovering hidden secrets tightens causally when dust analysis leads to the mainspring barrel, escalating to engaging the ghost and fixing the bird, with one meaningful deepening that narrows options and a visible cost in the sorrow of ghosts; coincidence of finding the key complicates but does not resolve, though pressure could force more stance crystallization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of hidden fractures and releasing secrets emerges organically from cracks in the façade and the clockwork bird's repair, offering a resonant non-literal answer in the ghost's ascension that reweights time and loss without moralizing; subtext in spectral urgency and dust patterns enriches ambiguity, though epiphanies like the weightless burden feel slightly asserted.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable with a distinct perceptual signature in Silas's observant scans and embodied chill, modulating rhythm under pressure like the steady voice engaging Thorn; minimal dialogue is natural and goal-driven, with no head-hopping or unwarranted certainty, though brief elision of backstory is paid off in the letters' reveal.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in sentences like the sputtering fluorescent and whirring bird, advancing atmosphere without loops; minor scaffold in repetitive dust analysis phrasing dulls momentum slightly, but no artifacts obscure the closure image of the ascending ghost.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes ghost-seeing with ceiling obsessions in a circus ruin, transforming tropes through specific details like the horologist's barrel and clockwork bird, feeling inevitable in the dawn release; risk in blending mechanical expertise with supernatural pays off without gimmickry, though echoes familiar ghost-resolution arcs slightly.</comment>
