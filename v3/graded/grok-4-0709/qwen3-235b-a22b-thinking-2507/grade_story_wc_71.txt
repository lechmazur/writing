<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to understand living houses is clear and intensifies through her ritual tests, with interiority embodied in sensory details like the root's vibration; however, internal conflict lacks strong contradictory impulses in scene, trending toward summary over simultaneity. The final realization earns its endurance with emotional cost in tears, aligning actions to traits without stock phrasing. Single-POV focus excels in micro-choices, such as placing objects, revealing values under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through patterned object placements and deepening hush, leading to a Conceptual Repricing closure where houses' aliveness is reweighted with conceptual cost of lost care; orientation anchors early in the bay's curve. Causality holds via textural density increase, but some ellipsis in transitions feels slightly unmotivated. The ending's resonant sigh and glow provide legible before/after with felt cost in Elara's tears.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The quiet bay in spring anchors vividly with sensory specificity like lavender dusk and crunching tideline, constraining choices via found objects that charge the ritual; it evolves causally, mirroring Elara's insight, and the final sand underfoot recharges the setting's pressure on closure. Micro-setting of houses and shore integrates into action, reflecting POV bias without catalog excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of understanding house aliveness tightens through ritual tests under Accumulative/Textural lens, with one meaningful deepening at the Finnegan place forcing stance crystallization; agency in sanctifying actions forecloses inert paths with visible cost like the house's fragile pulse. Pressure coheres but lacks a sharper reversal, keeping escalation functional yet not exceptional.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of sanctity in ordinary care emerges organically from object placements and realizations, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer at the waking house without moralizing; subtext in whispers and sighs invites ambiguity. Emotional aftereffect lands through tears and truth's weight, avoiding sentimentality, though some direct statements like "the living ones weren’t haunted; they were held" border on overt.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable with distinct perceptual signature in noticing sighs and pulses, modulating rhythm to heighten hush; no dialogue, but prose texture reflects Elara's attuned mind. Purposeful compression in ritual beats teaches pattern, paying off at closure without elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose density advances atmosphere with vivid images like "hushed blaze" and varied rhythm, but occasional overwriting in metaphors slightly muddles peak beats without harming clarity; no loops or artifacts obscure closure. Final line resolves with resonant image, propelling to a charged end.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of perfumer's root and house-sanctifying ritual transforms familiar mystical tropes through specific, grounded choices like displaced objects, feeling inevitable at the inadvertent profundity; risk in lyric texture heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
