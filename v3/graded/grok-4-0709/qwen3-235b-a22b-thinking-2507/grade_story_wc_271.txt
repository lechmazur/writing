<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to anchor optimism in realism is clear and intensifies through embodied choices, with internal conflict shown in contradictory impulses during the freeze; emotions are concretely embodied via somatic markers and the photograph's tactile sensations, avoiding stock phrasing. The final endurance forecloses denial with felt cost, as seen in her deliberate return to planting despite erosion's realism. Single-POV focus excels in interior specificity, though slight therapy-speak in "somatic markers" edges toward diagnostic awareness mid-crisis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the story builds density through layered memories and sensory callbacks, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration via Earned Stasis where Elara's stillness reweights trauma with conceptual cost in the final planting image. Orientation anchors early in the cliffside arboretum, with no disorientation debt. Closure lands on-page with felt cost of fragility, though the accumulative pattern could tighten more decisively at midpoint for stronger cadence shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The arboretum's salt-stung, wind-scoured setting is vivid and purposeful, constraining Elara's choices by mirroring her eroded peace and charging the final image of planting on the cliff edge. Sensory details like the gull's cry and sea's churn integrate into action, reflecting POV bias toward resilient flora. Environment evolves causally with her panic, heightening atmosphere without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of finding stillness amid trauma escalates texturally via the gull's cry triggering a deepening freeze, forcing agency through somatic recovery that forecloses unchecked panic with visible emotional cost. Under Accumulative lens, one meaningful intensification suffices, narrowing options to deliberate planting. Pressure coheres but could show slightly sharper trade-off in the recovery beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of anchoring optimism in realism emerges organically from Elara's planting amid erosion, with the final image offering a resonant, non-literal reconfiguration without moralizing. Subtext in the photograph and sea holly invites reflection on fragile peace, embracing complexity. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality through concrete struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable and modest, with perceptual signature biased toward tactile anchors like the photograph's ridge, modulating rhythm under stress without elision issues. Prose texture distinct in syntactic variety, reflecting focalizer's mind. No dialogue present, so policy skips evaluation; minor filter-verb use feels voice-motivated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm and syntax to propel emotional beats, as in the deliberate inhalation pulling from abyss. Figurative language like "pearl of stillness" integrates without muddle, though dense metaphors in panic sequence risk slight overwriting. No major loops or artifacts obscure closure; final line recharges motifs effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of trauma recovery via somatic gardening transforms familiar grief tropes through specific details like the cedar-scented photograph and cliff erosion, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk in lyric introspection heightens stakes without gimmickry, committing to premise's implications. Emotional specificity avoids generics, though core premise echoes common survivor narratives without bolder subversion.</comment>
