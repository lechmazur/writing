<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to map river origins drives consistent micro-choices, like aligning the phrasebook with condensation, revealing embodied contradictions in her worry versus quiet certainty; however, interiority occasionally slips into label-speak, such as "dry wit a shield against despair," which feels diagnostic rather than raw under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through layered interpretations of glyphs, frost, and phrasebook, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing where the condensation map reweights her quest with undeniable conceptual cost of past doubts; orientation anchors early in the outpost by the lake, and one meaningful deepening suffices, though some reflective blocks summarize without tilting present stance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The rusted outpost and frozen lake constrain Elara's isolation and pressure her interpretation, with frost patterns on glass serving as micro-setting that charges the final realization; sensory details like creaking metal and bruised amethyst hues mirror internal tranquility amid worry, integrated purposefully without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of finding river origins tightens through the falcon's message and condensation pattern, deepening to foreclose doubt with felt cost of potential freezing; under Accumulative/Textural lens, pattern break in the ice map reweights stakes effectively, though coincidence of weather timing complicates without fully resolving pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of discovery through convergence emerges organically from images like the dog-eared page and frost map, offering resonant ambiguity in rivers beginning "where the sky weeps," without moralizing; subtext in her dry smile reweights the quest's complexity, though some direct statements like "the beginning was always just a matter of perspective" border on thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable with perceptual bias toward geographic whispers, and prose texture in rhythmic sentences like tracing the window fits her subtle confidence; however, occasional register drift into elevated diction, such as "heralded disaster," feels slightly jarring for her dry-witted voice, and brief dialogue is natural but sparse.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose advances atmosphere through vivid images like "frost patterns bloomed," with good density, but paraphrase loops, such as repeating "worrying tranquility" across sentences, create momentum drag without payoff; syntactic variety is present, though template cadence in reflective blocks, like serial "she'd" openings, dulls propulsion in the middle third.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cartography, linguistics, and atmospheric science transforms trope of elusive origins into non-obvious convergence via condensation map, feeling inevitable with risk in her isolated resolve heightening stakes; avoids stock metaphors, though premise echoes exploratory quests without bolder subversion.</comment>
