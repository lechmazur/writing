<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Characterization is functional with Kael's motivation rooted in desperation and trust in the ghost, showing embodied emotion in his hammering heart and actions under pressure; however, secondary characters like Anya and Renn feel one-note, with reactions that alternate summaries rather than simultaneous contradictions, limiting depth in relationships as crucible during the mobilization beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under the Causal lens, the plot advances through because/therefore linkages from the ghost's message to the discovery of water, culminating in a Decisive Change with the surge of water and ghost's departure; closure lands on-page with felt cost of prior hardships, though the nebula's manifestation feels like a minor unmotivated ellipsis.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting anchors early with the orchard planet's frost, floating rock arches, and nebula, vividly filtering through Kael's POV to constrain choices like digging near the largest arch; the environment charges the final image as water pools under the blazing nebula, evolving causally without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of colony survival tightens meaningfully when reexamining roots leads to digging beneath them, narrowing options under Causal escalation with the cost of labor and prior failures; however, the resolution relies partly on coincidence of the hidden aquifer, complicating without fully resolving through agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of persistent hope amid desperation emerges organically from collective effort and the ghost's guidance, resonating in the final image of blooming hope without moralizing; subtext in the ghost's silent altruism invites reflection on trust, though some overt symbolism like brambled hope borders on direct statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and character-bound, with perceptual signature in Kael's biased noticing of the ghost's trustworthiness; voice has rhythmic texture in descriptive passages, and dialogue advances plot naturally with subtext, like Anya's scoff revealing exhaustion, though minor filter verbs dull immediacy in the comm hub scene.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density in sensory details like fogging breath and gushing water, varying rhythm effectively; however, paraphrase loops appear in hope descriptions ("painful, persistent, and catching on everything" restated later as "brambled hope, now watered"), and some overwriting in the nebula manifestation dulls propulsion without harming closure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Originality shines in synthesizing sci-fi survival with an altruistic ghost orchestrating collective effort via chalk messages, transforming tropes through specific details like the watering bell and floating arches; the non-obvious twist of geological roots feels inevitable, heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
