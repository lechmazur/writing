<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aris's motivation rooted in synesthesia and grandmother's riddle drives consistent, embodied choices like tracing vows for colors, revealing contradictory impulses in his quest for hues in whispers; interiority is concrete without stock phrasing, culminating in an earned endurance that accepts the inward compass with felt emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, textural density builds through revelations like the tag's cipher aligning with the book, leading to a Conceptual Repricing closure where sound's color reweights his worldview with conceptual cost in the final image of carrying courage; orientation anchors early in the pier scene, with one meaningful deepening sufficient for length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The sunken library's preserved shelves and sediment constrain Aris's movements, charging the final image as its secrets recede with the tide, while the festival's lanterns mirror and pierce the setting to heighten resonance; sensory details are vivid and POV-filtered, evolving causally without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of discovering sound's color tightens through the tag's projection and vow-tracing, deepening knowledge with a felt cost in the inward vow's formation under Accumulative lens; pressure coheres but lacks a sharper reversal, with agency in renunciation foreclosing further exploration at a conceptual price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of luminous vows revealing sound's emotional colors emerges through concrete discoveries like sapphire longing, offering a resonant non-literal answer in the final image that reweights promises as echoes without moralizing; subtext in silences and implications invites reflection on light/dark balance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable with distinct perceptual signature in synesthetic details like humming notes felt in bones; prose texture is lyrical and rhythmic, modulating with intensity, while purposeful compression in revelations pays off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with vivid images like "meteor hush," but occasional overwriting in stacked metaphors like swirling sapphire and fiery amber muddles clarity in peak beats without pattern payoff, triggering a -0.6 deduction; rhythm varies, yet some paraphrase loops in vow descriptions dull momentum slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of synesthesia, luminous algae vows, and sunken library offers a fresh angle on perceiving sound's color, with risk in lyric revelations heightening stakes organically; premise transforms familiar quest tropes through specific details like the tag's etchings, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
