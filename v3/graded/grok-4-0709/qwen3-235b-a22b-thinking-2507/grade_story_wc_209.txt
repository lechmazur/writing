<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies through her grief-driven actions, culminating in the earned stasis of creating the mural with visible emotional cost; interiority is concrete and embodied, showing contradictory impulses like shouting pain onto walls versus seeking quiet truth. The single-POV focus excels in revealing flaws through micro-choices, such as angling the postcard in light, without stock phrasing. No second character, so relationship bullets are ignored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned revelations from postcards to cathedral light, leading to a resonant reconfiguration in the final mural with conceptual cost of reweighted grief; orientation anchors early in the pavilion despite minor seasonal ambiguity ("autumnal" amid winter snow melt), which doesn't harm closure. One meaningful deepening occurs at the light revelation, sufficient for length; closure lands on-page with felt cost in the quiet creation act.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Setting anchors vividly in the amber pavilion and cathedral, with sensory details like warm slats and cold stone filtering through Elara's bias to mirror internal hush; the environment constrains choice by enabling the light revelation through etched glass, charging the final image. Minor inconsistency in "autumnal refuge" versus winter snow melt slightly muddles tone but doesn't break coherence. Micro-setting of postcards functions as a tool that shapes the arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, dominant stake of understanding Leo's mystery escalates through density of revelations, with one meaningful cadence shift at the cathedral forcing stance crystallization on grief; cost is felt in the reconfiguration of sorrow to solace, foreclosing loud mourning. Agency drives the deepening via Elara's decision to use the window light; no coincidence resolves, as pressure coheres internally.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of grief blooming in quiet darkness emerges organically from postcards and light revelations, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer at the mural that reweights prior pain without moralizing; subtext in images like moonflowers invites reflection on tenderness. Emotional aftereffect is concrete through embodied realization, avoiding sentimentality. The final image offers conceptual repricing of loss as gentle persistence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in selective noticing of colors and light, modulated rhythm heightening emotional beats like the breath-catching revelation; no dialogue, so those bullets ignored. Purposeful compression in reflective blocks anchors in present cues, tilting stance without head-hopping. Prose texture feels singular, with syntax reflecting Elara's quiet drive.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in lyrical sentences that advance atmosphere without loops; however, minor overwriting in repeated light/snow imagery ("melting snow glistened like scattered stars") slightly muddles peak clarity but doesn't obscure closure. Strong verbs and specific details propel momentum; final line resolves by recharging motifs effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of grief via night-blooming flowers and hidden ciphers feels inevitable, with risk in lyric structure heightening stakes through umbral tone without gimmickry; tropes like lost love are transformed by specific etched-glass method. Emotional specificity avoids generics, committing to premise with non-obvious reconfiguration.</comment>
