<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Silas's motivation to broker peace via puzzle-solving is clear and rooted in his traits as a philosopher-duelist, with the mechanical arm embodying past costs and enabling current actions; interiority shows embodied tension during the duel, like the jolt up his spine, revealing contradictory impulses under pressure. Vorlag as a secondary character applies immediate pressure through the duel, forcing Silas's micro-choices that alter tactics. The resolution earns stasis by confronting flaws with a visible cost in physical strain, though emotional progression could layer more irrationality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under a Causal lens, the structure holds with because/therefore linkages from waiting to discovering the card, then to the duel enabling puzzle alignment, culminating in a Decisive Change where Silas reveals the overture and Vorlag yields; orientation anchors early in the atrium. Closure lands on-page with felt cost in the duel's risk and arm's grinding, reshaping options from war to peace. One meaningful tightening suffices, though the puzzle reveal feels slightly pat without deeper ellipsis motivation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The glass atrium with brook and sundial is vividly specific, with sunlight fracturing and scents anchoring atmosphere; the setting constrains choices, as Silas uses the sundial's shadow and brook's reflection to decipher the code during the duel. Sensory details like damp earth and whirring joints reflect POV bias and urgency, evolving causally with the fight. The environment charges the final image, mirroring internal resolution in the brook's murmur.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of brokering peace via the hidden overture escalates causally through the duel, with one meaningful tightening as Silas pivots to align with the sundial, narrowing options and raising physical cost; agency drives the deflection and revelation, foreclosing violence with legible strain on his arm. Coincidence of the card's placement complicates but doesn't resolve. Moral calculus sharpens the climax, though stakes occasionally feel abstract amid the action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of transforming war's questions into peaceful destinations emerges organically from the puzzle and duel, with the sundial's unfinished lines symbolizing unresolved conflict; subtext in gestures like tracing the card adds resonance without direct statement. The final image of the brook's murmur offers a non-literal answer, reweighting the premise with conceptual cost. However, some philosophizing, like quoting Heraclitus, borders on overt, reducing ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and character-specific, with perceptual signature in Silas's sharp eyes noticing the card's glint; voice texture modulates with pressure, using economical syntax in the duel. Dialogue is sparse but natural, subtext-laden, like Vorlag's hiss advancing the conflict. Elision of backstory is taught early via the arm and pays off in tactics, with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with vivid images like "sunlight fractured through the high glass dome" advancing atmosphere; rhythm varies, but some sentences stack metaphors, like the arm as "a constant reminder that questions left unanswered often became destinations paved with steel," creating minor muddle. No major loops, but occasional synonym churn in descriptions slightly dulls momentum. Final line resolves resonantly without artifacts touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes philosophy, steampunk mechanics, and puzzle-dueling in a fresh way, transforming tropes like the mechanical arm into a tool for both combat and insight; the coded sundial twist feels inevitable from early setups. Risk-taking in blending duel with decryption heightens stakes organically. Avoids stock echoes, committing to its vision without hedging.</comment>
