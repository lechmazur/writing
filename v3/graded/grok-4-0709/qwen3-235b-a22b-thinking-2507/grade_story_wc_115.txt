<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Leo's skepticism and recklessness drive consistent micro-choices, like tuning the radio amid unease, revealing embodied contradictions under pressure; the shift to keeper feels earned by the confession's hush, foreclosing pure skepticism with felt cost in the valve's "crushing lightness."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, textural buildup of radio static, bead clicks, and ghostly vibrations leads to resonant reconfiguration at dawn emergence; orientation anchors early in the tunnel, and closure reprices skepticism with conceptual cost in absolution's compass, though one beat's radio coincidence slightly loosens causality without breaking the pattern.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The abandoned tunnel's damp gloom and decaying scents constrain Leo's movements and heighten atmospheric pressure, with the beaded valve wheel as a recurring object charging the final image of absolution; sensory details like wet stone and bead glints are POV-filtered and evolve causally, mirroring internal dread.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake in debunking ghosts tightens through radio confession and phantom vibration, deepening to stance crystallization as Leo lifts the valve again; under textural lens, cadence shift reweights truth's burden with felt cost, though coincidence in the caller's timing complicates without fully resolving pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of swallowed truths emerging through confession resonates via beads as "counting bones" and valve's heft, offering non-literal repricing of lies' weight without moralizing; subtext in radio hush and ghostly fog invites ambiguity, though final absolution line edges toward tidy insight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV stays stable with perceptual bias in Leo's skeptical lens, like dismissing spirits amid bead "eyes"; prose texture in rhythmic clicks and syntax breathes with pressure, though brief radio dialogue converges slightly in dramatic tone without voice leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose propels with vivid, concise images like "dull eyes" and "ancient throat," varying rhythm effectively; minor paraphrase loops in valve appraisals dull momentum slightly, but no artifacts obscure closure, and density supports textural buildup.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of urban exploration with ghostly confession via radio transforms trope through valve's beaded anomaly and truth's "crushing lightness," heightening stakes organically; risk in conceptual repricing feels inevitable without gimmickry, though premise echoes familiar haunt tales.</comment>
