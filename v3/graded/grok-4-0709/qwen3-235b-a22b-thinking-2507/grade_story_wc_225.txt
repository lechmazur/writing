<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation for redemption is clear and rooted in her chess tutor traits, intensifying through embodied fidgeting and reflections that compel her decoding choice; interiority shows contradictory impulses like guilt and fierce repose, with emotions embodied in hitched breath and stilled hands. However, some reflections border on summary without simultaneous internal conflict in scene, slightly diluting the peak emotional progression. The final self-apology reveals a hierarchy of values with visible cost, earning stasis through self-forgiveness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned reflections and imagery toward a Conceptual Repricing closure where Elara reweights her guilt with exonerating truth, landing on-page with felt cost in her whispered apology and shifted hush. Orientation anchors who (Elara), where (time-frozen village), and when (thunder's lull) by the first sentence, serving the introspective mode without debt. One meaningful deepening occurs via the tapestry decoding, reweighting knowledge without needing causal turns.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The time-frozen village is vividly anchored with sensory details like cobblestones and mirrored reflections, filtered through Elara's strategist POV; it constrains her quest by mirroring her suspended guilt, charging the final image as rain falls on frozen earth. Micro-setting of the tapestry and labyrinth integrates into action, evolving causally as threads are winnowed. Tone tensions the hush with thunder, supporting the theme without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of self-forgiveness signals early and deepens via the decoding, narrowing options as threads reveal conspiracy and force stance crystallization under Accumulative lens, with felt cost in years of shame. One meaningful tightening suffices, driven by her agency in winnowing, though pressure feels more internal than escalating externally. Coincidence of finding the tapestry complicates but doesn't resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of integrating past mistakes for forgiveness emerges organically from decoding particulars, with subtext in frayed threads symbolizing unraveled guilt, culminating in a resonant final image that reweights her exile without moralizing. Emotional aftereffect arises from concrete struggle, avoiding sentimentality through ambiguous thunder shift. However, some direct statements like "forgiveness wasn’t about erasing the past" edge toward thematic echo, slightly reducing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with perceptual signature in chess-pattern noticing, and prose texture uses purposeful compression in lyric mode, teaching patterned elision early via hush and thunder. Narrative stance modulates with intensity, but some register drift into elevated diction like "winnow truth from the chaff" feels slightly unmotivated for her crisis state. No dialogue present, so policy skips those bullets.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose has rhythmic variety and high density, with sentences advancing atmosphere through vivid images like "frayed into chaotic tangles," but figurative overload in peak beats (e.g., woven hush, thunder’s lull, fierce repose) creates minor muddle without full pattern payoff, triggering -0.5 artifact deduction. Some paraphrase loops, like repeated guilt references, dull momentum slightly, though clarity holds at closure. Information propulsion is strong, with no major grammar issues.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes chess strategy with chronomancy in a fresh, non-obvious way, transforming exile trope through specific tapestry decoding that feels inevitable; risk in lyric introspection heightens emotional stakes without gimmickry. However, echoes of frozen-time redemption arcs feel somewhat familiar without bolder subversion.</comment>
