<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Aris's motivation to protect the Tower is clear and intensifies through embodied emotions like the ache in his molars, blending logical calculation with felt sorrow; however, the "logically emotional" trait feels labeled rather than shown through contradictory impulses in scene, slightly undercutting interior complexity at the climax where he hums and adjusts without visible internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under a Causal lens, the structure follows clear because/therefore linkages from the faltering harmonics to Aris's rush up the stairs and key activation, culminating in an on-page Decisive Change with felt cost in his exhaustion; orientation anchors early with the marina and sunset, but the ending's conceptual repricing of fragility feels slightly tacked on without a sharper persistent constraint shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina is vividly specific, with groaning floes constraining choices and pressuring the climax through shards raining on glass; this environment charges the final image of peaceful stillness, evolving causally from threat to harmony without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Under the Causal lens, the dominant stake of protecting the Tower escalates through the sunset timer, tightening options and forcing vibrational adaptation with a visible cost in physical strain; one meaningful deepening suffices, but the pressure feels somewhat abstract until the shuddering Tower beat, where agency crystallizes effectively.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of resonant adaptation amid fragility emerges organically from the sonic lattice and ice dissonance, culminating in a non-literal final image that reweights the world's trembling without moralizing; subtext in the Tower's "pain" adds complexity, though the absolution concept borders on overt statement in the closing line.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable with a distinct perceptual signature in sensory details like subsonic thrums, but rhythmic control wavers under pressure with some syntactic monotony in action sequences; no dialogue present, so those bullets are ignored, and elision is minimal but taught through the humming integration.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose advances with high density in vivid images like "jagged teeth gnawing," but overwriting in peak beats with stacked metaphors (e.g., coat flapping like a wounded bird, light bleeding to bruised purple) creates minor muddle without harming closure clarity; no major loops, though some template cadence in the adjustment sequence slightly drags momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The premise of sonic absolution via vibrational matching in an ice marina offers a fresh synthesis of engineering and mysticism, transforming familiar guardian tropes through specific resonant tactics; risk in the humming adaptation heightens stakes organically, feeling inevitable at the pure tone emergence without gimmickry.</comment>
