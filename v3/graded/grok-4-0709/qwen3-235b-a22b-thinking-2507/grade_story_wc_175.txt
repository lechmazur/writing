<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to honor overlooked histories is clear and intensifies through her precise actions, with embodied emotions like heart hammering and tears showing contradictory impulses under pressure. Interiority is concrete and particular, avoiding stock phrasing, as seen in her deliberate knotting as a vow. The final renunciation of control, earning stasis with emotional cost, feels compelled by prior traits. Minor slip in over-articulated self-awareness mid-crisis slightly hedges full ambiguity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through layered details and a pattern break with the gust, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration in the final image where the butterfly carries the wing, reweighting remembrance with emotional cost in tears and blushing stillness. Orientation anchors early in the verdant grotto above clouds. Closure lands on-page with felt cost, though the coincidental butterfly interception slightly strains situational coherence without fully resolving via agency. One meaningful cadence shift suffices for length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The verdant grotto above clouds is vividly specific, with mossy floor and mist constraining Elara's actions and charging the final image of the cairn against the sky. Sensory details like damp earth and crushed mint are purposeful, filtered through her POV, and evolve causally with the gust. Environment pressures choices, such as the edge placement of cairns, mirroring her transient rootedness. Recurring elements like cloud-fern integrate into action without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of honoring the monarch's migration tightens with the gust's interruption, deepening via the butterfly's interception that reweights the signal as living, with felt emotional cost in Elara's tears and shifted grief. Under textural lens, cadence shift forces stance crystallization without coincidence resolving fully. Agency in knotting and witnessing forecloses permanence, earning the reconfiguration. Stakes remain visceral but could narrow options more explicitly in the peak beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of honoring overlooked histories emerges organically from images like the moth wings and cairns, culminating in a resonant final image that reweights remembrance without moralizing. Subtext in fragile connections and fleeting touches invites reflection on impermanence. Emotional aftereffect is concrete, avoiding sentimentality through embodied grief turning to warmth. Minor drift in abstract phrasing like "fabric of time" slightly dilutes particularity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with distinct perceptual signature in selective noticing of iridescent fragments and luminescence, modulating rhythm under pressure like the gust. Prose texture is purposeful, with lyric compression taught early and paid off in the charged ending. No dialogue, so policy skips those bullets; free indirect style is clean. Syntactic variety heightens emotional beats without obscurity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with vivid images like "fallen constellations" advancing atmosphere, though occasional overwriting in peak beats like the gust's "rare violence" adds minor muddle without harming clarity. No loops or scaffolds; rhythm varies naturally, as in the suspended heartbeat moment. Information density is high, with sentences multitasking character and theme. Figurative language is coherent but clusters densely in the climax, slightly taxing momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of esoteric realism with a fantastical grotto and the last monarch's migration feels inevitable, transforming tropes of loss through specific details like cloud-fern knotting. Risk in poetic structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, as the butterfly's interception reconfigures meaning organically. Premise avoids derivatives, committing to implications of transient signals. Emotional specificity in blushing stillness adds memorable ingenuity.</comment>
