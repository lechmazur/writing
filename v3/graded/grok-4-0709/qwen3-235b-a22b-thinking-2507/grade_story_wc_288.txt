<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong interiority with embodied emotions, like screaming until her throat bled, reveals contradictory impulses of pain and honoring the Aethon; motivation intensifies credibly to the final renunciation of isolation, earning endurance with visible cost in tears and carried loss.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through reflective shards to a resonant reconfiguration at dawn's light, with conceptual cost in transformed pain; orientation anchors early in the tidal library, but minor ellipsis in memory floods slightly softens causality without breaking closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, purposeful sensory details like the glass dome's condensation and buoyant coral shelves constrain choices, with the stone circle's hum charging the final image of clouds parting, reflecting Elara's internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of translating isolation escalates through textural deepening of memories, culminating in a meaningful cadence shift at the hum-tempered awakening; cost is felt in agonizing vividness, though one tightening suffices without broader reversals.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of coexistence with extinction emerges organically from particulars like the Aethon's dissolution, culminating in a resonant final image that reweights independence without moralizing; subtext in the hum's whisper invites lingering ambiguity on loss's sustenance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Consistent third-person close POV with perceptual signature in Elara's biased noticing of vibrations and light fractures; prose texture modulates rhythmically under pressure, with no dialogue to evaluate, and elisions taught through memory shards pay off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density and propulsion in concise sentences like "tears streamed as she understood," with varied rhythm and no loops; minor figurative muddle in "shards of ice in her blood" doesn't obscure closure, maintaining clarity and momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of reincarnation with tidal resonance transforms extinction tropes through specific Aethon lore, feeling inevitable in the hum's promise; risk in lyric compression heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
