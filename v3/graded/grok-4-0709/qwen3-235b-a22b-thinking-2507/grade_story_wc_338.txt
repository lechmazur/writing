<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation as a perceptive map framer is clear and intensifies through empathetic interpretation, with embodied emotions like quickened pulse and tears under pressure; her methodical curiosity drives micro-choices, such as comparing reels and clearing ivy, revealing values with felt cost in the resonant ending. Interiority is concrete and particular, avoiding stock phrasing, though some self-awareness borders on diagnostic in the final note. No second character, so relationship dynamics are irrelevant.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned observations and comparisons, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration in the humming fissure and reconciled time, with conceptual cost legible in dissolved borders and understood secrets. Orientation anchors who, where, and when by the first sentence without debt. Closure lands on-page with felt emotional cost in tears and a charged final image, though the hum's emergence feels slightly elliptical without a sharper causal trigger.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The rain-scoured fresco vault is vividly specific, with sensory details like damp chill and cracking pigments filtered through Elara's POV, constraining choices like threading projectors and clearing fissures; it charges the final image as the vault breathes and frescoes weep, mirroring internal resonance. Micro-setting of the fissure and stones evolves causally, pressuring the restoration without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reopening the chapel's memory tightens through textural deepenings like reel comparisons and fissure clearing, narrowing options with the sinkhole discovery and culminating in empathetic restoration; cost is felt in emotional tears and conceptual border dissolution. Under Accumulative/Textural lens, one meaningful cadence shift in the emerging hum suffices, though pressure feels more introspective than urgent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of interpreting silence with empathy emerges organically from particulars like silent reels and wind sighs, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in reconciled time; the final image of singing stones offers a resonant, non-literal answer reweighting the premise without statement. Subtext in gestures like tracing pigments and waiting in rain deepens complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with perceptual signature in map-framer's eye for shifts and textures, modulating rhythm from methodical unfolding to swelling hum; prose texture is distinct with purposeful syntax like fragmented phrases in rain. No dialogue, so those bullets ignored; no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied rhythm, strong verbs like "coaxing coherence" and "swelled into a chorus," advancing atmosphere without loops; some figurative density in peak beats like "frescoes weeping" is patterned and pays off at closure without muddle. No artifacts obscure cause/effect, though occasional elevated diction like "terra incognita" fits voice.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cartography, silence, and empathy transforms tropes of ancient sites through specific details like timed light shafts and empathetic brushing, feeling inevitable in the humming resolution; risk in lyric accumulations heightens stakes without gimmickry. Core premise offers non-obvious angle on discovery, committing fully without hedging.</comment>
