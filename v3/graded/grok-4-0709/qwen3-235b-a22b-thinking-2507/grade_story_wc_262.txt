<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to find unused love is clear and intensifies through psychic impressions, rooted in her spatially imaginative trait that enables key visions; interiority is concrete with embodied emotions like trembling fingers and warming touch. However, her character leans on mystic stereotypes without deep contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, limiting complexity. The final transfer feels earned by prior causality with felt cost, as she carries the love's weight into a new beginning.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned impressions and cadence shifts toward a Resonant Reconfiguration in the transfer and morning exit, with conceptual cost legible in the love's gentle warmth reweighting her soul. Orientation anchors early in the projection booth on demolition night, but some elisions in vision sequences create minor ambiguity without payoff. Closure lands on-page with cost, though persistent constraints like demolition threat shape tactics unevenly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The projection booth is vividly anchored with dust, decaying celluloid, and flickering light, constraining choices like rushing downstairs amid demolition threat; sensory details like lilac scent and hushed thunder mirror her internal yearning. Micro-setting of the film strip and crystal integrates into action, charging the final image behind the screen. However, some details like neon city outside feel generic without strong POV filter.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of finding unused love tightens through impressions and clues, with one meaningful deepening in realizing love's storage in film gaps, forcing her transfer action under demolition pressure. Cost is felt in carrying the love's weight, but escalation relies on accumulative visions rather than sharp agency-driven turns, with coincidence in letter clues complicating without resolving. Under Textural lens, cadence shift reweights the stake adequately for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of preserving unused love emerges organically from letters and visions, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer that love is stored in remembering and cherished spaces, reweighting prior motifs like forgotten lyrics finding tune. Subtext in interstitial gaps and humming melody adds complexity without confusion. However, some direct statements like "the act of remembering" border on thematic echo, slightly undercutting implicit resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable, with perceptual signature in spatial visions and sensory biases like ignoring images for paper inserts; prose texture is distinct with rhythmic, imagistic diction suiting the mystic tone. No dialogue, so policy skips those bullets; elisions in visions are patterned and paid off at closure. Minor register drift into abstract terms like "living geometry of longing" feels slightly unmotivated for POV under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere through vivid images like pulsing orbs and liquid light; rhythm varies naturally, but some paraphrase loops (e.g., repeating "unused love" storage variants) create minor drag without payoff. No major artifacts obscure closure, though figurative stacks in vision sequences occasionally muddle clarity, like corridors and vaults mixing metaphors. Opening anchors voice strongly, final line resolves with resonant image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes psychic reading with film artifacts into a fresh angle on preserved love, transforming mystic tropes through specific details like spliced letters and interstitial spaces; risk in lyric visions heightens stakes without gimmickry. Originality shines in conceptual storage as film gaps, feeling inevitable in hindsight. However, core frame echoes familiar ghost-in-theater motifs without full subversion.</comment>
