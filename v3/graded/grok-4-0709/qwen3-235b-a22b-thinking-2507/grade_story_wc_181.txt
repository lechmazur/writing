<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to pursue forbidden knowledge is clear and intensifies through micro-choices like picking up the shell, rooted in his curator traits and internal contradictions of disquiet versus calm. Interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions like disbelief tightening his throat, avoiding stock phrasing. The final renunciation of linear time earns stasis with felt cost, as he places the cameo back, foreclosing ignorance. However, some self-awareness feels slightly diagnostic in the bathroom realization, limiting the high band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned images of the orchard and shell, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing where the protagonist realizes the time loop, with conceptual cost in shattered illusions made legible in the final placement. Orientation anchors who (Dr. Thorne), where (asteroid), and when (mission time) by the first sentence. Closure lands on-page with the shell's return closing the loop, reweighting all prior knowledge. Minor elision in the ancestor's image feels taught but doesn't fully constrain tactics, preventing 9+ entry.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The astral orchard setting is vivid and purposeful, with crystalline trees and bioluminescent petals constraining choices by responding to the shell and charging the final image of placement in regolith. Sensory details like soft chimes and cool heaviness are selective, filtered through POV bias, mirroring internal disquiet. Environment evolves causally, glowing brighter in response, and guides the philosophical breakthrough. This recurring object-as-setting charges closure, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of deciphering non-linear inheritance tightens through the shell's discovery and etching, deepening knowledge with a cadence shift in the realization, under Accumulative lens. Agency in inquiring and placing the shell crystallizes stance, foreclosing linear illusions with felt cost in profound peace. One meaningful intensification suffices, driven by protagonist choices. Coincidence of the shell complicates but doesn't resolve, though cost could be more viscerally embodied at peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of non-linear time emerges organically from the shell's images and loop, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in the eternal tapestry. Subtext in the blank cameo's potential resonates without direct statement, inviting reflection on time's illusion. The final image of placement offers a non-literal answer, reweighting the premise with conceptual cost. Epiphany is earned through orchard interactions, avoiding platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in selective noticing of glints and chimes biased by curator's bewilderment. Prose texture is distinct, with rhythmic lyricism like "velvet void" modulating under pressure. No dialogue, so policy skips; elision in time loop is taught early and paid off at closure. Minor register drift in philosophical terms feels voice-motivated but slightly jars in crisis moments.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, sentences advancing atmosphere like "pulsed with a light that felt both ancient and newborn"; rhythm varies naturally, avoiding templates. Figurative language is controlled, with metaphors like "frozen stars" enhancing without muddle. No loops or scaffolds, but some overwriting in the orchard description slightly pads without harming closure propulsion. Information density peaks at the realization, satisfying quick test minus hairline excess.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The premise of a pistachio shell as time-loop key in an astral orchard offers fresh synthesis on non-linear inheritance, transforming time-travel tropes through specific curator POV and blank cameo's potential. Risk in philosophical bathroom breakthrough heightens stakes organically, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Emotional complexity avoids generics, with authenticity in the loop's closure. No close echoes, committing fully without retreat.</comment>
