<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The blooming library above clouds is vividly specific, with petal-like bookshelves and ink-rooted knowledge constraining Elara's choices and charging the final image of stars emerging. Sensory details like the humming pulse and drifting edge are filtered through her POV, mirroring her internal state and guiding her method without stalling momentum. The setting evolves causally, breathing around her in the dusk-deepening close.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving hope tightens through the anomaly discovery, deepening via footage comparison that narrows options and forces the metamorphosis with legible cost in luminous regret. Under Accumulative/Textural lens, pressure accumulates via pattern breaks like the shadow's ripple, driven by Elara's agency without coincidence resolving it. One meaningful intensification suffices, with the final trade-off between shared and solitary hope charging the ember image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of hope's fragile geometry emerges organically from events like the shadow's consumption and metamorphosis, resisting tidy morals through complexity in shared dreams' dangers.

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV remains stable and close, with perceptual signature in sharp-eyed noticing of subtle shifts, modulating rhythm under pressure like the pausing magnification. Prose texture is distinct in poetic syntax, purposeful and legible without head-hopping. No dialogue present, so policy skips those bullets; elision in dream descriptions is taught and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere through vivid images like "sun bled into the cloud-sea" without loops or scaffold; rhythm varies naturally, accelerating in the playback sequence. Figurative language is controlled and coherent, enhancing propulsion in peak beats like the shadow's ripple. Minor overwriting in descriptive stacks exists but doesn't obscure closure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise of a stratosphere library with shareable dreams offers fresh synthesis, transforming tropes of hope and shadow through specific details like the river stone's injection, feeling inevitable in hindsight.
