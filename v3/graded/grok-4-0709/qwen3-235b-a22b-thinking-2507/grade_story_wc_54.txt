<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation as a curious intern drives consistent, intensifying choices toward resurrection, with embodied emotions like pounding heart and pricked tears showing contradictory impulses under pressure. Interiority is concrete, rooted in her engineering traits, and micro-choices reveal values with felt cost, such as steady hands amid dust. The single-POV focus excels without needing secondary characters, but some stock phrasing like "stoic wonder" slightly dilutes specificity at closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned details and insights, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where hope is repriced with conceptual cost in the final image of stars mirroring the glow. Orientation anchors early in the terminal hall, and causality holds via motivated actions like aligning the sextant. One meaningful deepening suffices, with the system's hum as a cadence shift; however, the ending's open poise lacks a sharper decisive change.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport is vividly anchored with sensory details like ozone and popcorn, filtered through Elara's POV, evolving causally as she interacts with panels and kiosks. Setting constrains choices, such as using conduits for redirection, and charges the final image with the Ferris wheel against twilight. Micro-setting like the sextant piece functions as a tool that shapes the resurrection beat effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of puzzling hope equations signals early and deepens through one meaningful intensification when the system hums, narrowing options under Accumulative/Textural lens with felt cost in her stoic wonder. Pressure coheres via internal conflict of decay vs. renewal, but escalation feels textural rather than sharply narrowing, with no strong reversal; coincidence of finding the sextant complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of hope from redirected ruins emerges organically through images like the sextant and humming terminal, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer that reweights decay as possibility without moralizing. Subtext in gestures and silences enriches ambiguity, inviting reflection on resilience. Emotional aftereffect is concrete via her purposeful stride, avoiding sentimentality, but some direct statements like "new equations for hope" border on assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with distinct perceptual signature in engineering-biased noticing, like tracing conduits; rhythmic control modulates with pressure, as in sparks hissing. No dialogue, so policy skips those bullets; elision is minimal and taught. Prose texture is purposeful, but occasional register drift into abstract terms like "entropy into order" slightly jars the focalizer's lexicon at peak.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere through vivid images like deflated balloons, and syntactic variety supports rhythm without monotony. Metaphors are controlled but occasionally mixed, as in "rivers seeking new courses" amid electrical work, triggering minor overwriting deduction. No major loops or artifacts obscure closure, but some paraphrase redundancy in reflection blocks dulls momentum slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes sci-fi renewal with engineering ingenuity in a fresh, non-obvious way, transforming tropes like abandoned structures through Elara's specific actions and the sextant's evolving role. Risk-taking in lyric accumulative style heightens stakes organically, feeling inevitable at the humming climax. Emotional specificity avoids generics, but proximity to familiar hope-from-ruins arcs limits top originality.</comment>
