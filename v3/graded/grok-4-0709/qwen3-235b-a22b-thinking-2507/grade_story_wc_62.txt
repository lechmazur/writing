<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas's motivation to map collective grief is clear and intensifies through embodied actions like tying ribbons, revealing contradictory impulses in his solitary ritual versus family memories; the ghost mentor's presence adds relational pressure that forces a stance shift. Interiority is concrete, with emotions like throat-catching words embodied without stock phrasing. The final renunciation of solitary sorrow earns stasis with visible cost in tears mingling with dust.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned ribbon-tying and butterfly responses, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where grief reshapes as a vessel with felt emotional cost in the tears; orientation anchors early in the greenhouse at dusk. Closure lands on-page with the final image reweighting prior isolation into shared remembrance. One meaningful deepening suffices, with persistent limestone grit constraining tactile memory.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The ancient greenhouse at dusk is vividly specific, with ivy-strained iron and monarch rafters constraining Silas's ritual and charging the final mosaic as a breathing vessel; sensory details like damp earth and amber light filter through his grieving bias. Environment evolves causally as butterflies reconfigure, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism. Micro-setting of glass and canes guides choices tactilely.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of discovering grief's shape tightens through ribbon-tying deepenings that narrow emotional options, forcing renunciation of individual sorrow; cost is legible in the trembling hands and tears, reweighting stakes under textural lens. Agency in ritual actions drives intensification without coincidence resolving. One meaningful cadence shift to collective vessel suffices at this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of grief as shared space emerges organically from ribbon poems and butterfly mosaic, offering a resonant non-literal answer in the final vessel image that reweights solitary carving; subtext in silences and wing-readings invites ambiguity without confusion. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality through concrete costs like throat burrs. No overt moralizing; complexity embraces counter-readings of endurance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person close POV stays stable and modest, with perceptual bias in grit-dusted fingers and monarch embers; voice texture distinct in rhythmic, meditative syntax that modulates with pressure. Dialogue from Corvin carries subtext and advances reconfiguration naturally, with wind-like idiom distinguishing him. No head-hopping; elisions like presence blooming are taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied rhythm in meditative breaths and creaking calm; metaphors like stained-glass wings cohere without muddle, advancing atmosphere. No loops or scaffold; high information density in lines like "threads catching amber light" does double duty. Final line resolves by recharging motifs cleanly, with zero artifacts in closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of spectral mentorship and migrating butterflies transforms grief tropes through specific ritual and living mosaic; non-obvious angle feels inevitable in the vessel reconfiguration. Risk in lyric accumulation heightens emotional stakes without gimmickry. No derivative echoes; authenticity coheres in carver's worldview.</comment>
