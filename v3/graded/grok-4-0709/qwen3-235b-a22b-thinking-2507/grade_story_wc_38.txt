<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong interiority with embodied contradictions, like vulnerability felt in soaking boots yet driving calm defiance; motivation to save Aegis intensifies credibly through dance and dice, earning the final endurance with visible cost of rising water; minor diagnostic echo in "encrypt vulnerability as strength" slightly flattens specificity at peak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with pattern breaks in dance and dice rolling building to Charged Poise closure; resonant reconfiguration at data liberation reweights vulnerability with felt cost of the flooding lab; orientation anchors early in the algae-slick wall, but minor ellipsis in swim-back feels under-motivated without tighter linkage.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, purposeful sensory details like ozone scent and crumbling concrete constrain choices, with the rising water pressuring the dance and charging the final swim; micro-setting of terminal and desk evolves causally, mirroring internal resolve; environment directly shapes closure by forcing urgency without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of liberating algorithms tightens through water's rise and dance's deepening, narrowing options under Accumulative lens with one meaningful cadence shift; agency in rolling dice and inputting code drives escalation, with legible cost in the insistent flood; coincidence of uplink complicates but doesn't resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of encrypting vulnerability as strength emerges organically from dance and journal motifs, culminating in resonant final image without moralizing; subtext in spider web metaphor reweights fear into defiance non-literally; emotional aftereffect lingers through complexity, avoiding tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable third-person close POV with perceptual signature in lyrical noticing of decay and rhythm; prose texture distinct in syntactic flow mirroring dance, with purposeful compression in metaphors; no dialogue, so policy skips; elision in journal parsing taught early and paid off at input.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>High density with sentences advancing atmosphere and action, like fingertips on concrete weaving setting into motivation; minor paraphrase loops in water descriptions ("cold and insistent" repeats) dull momentum slightly; rhythmic variety supports pressure, but some stacked metaphors in spider web strain clarity at dance peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of code-breaking via dance and hangman's dice transforms trope of decryption into embodied poetry; risk in lyric structure heightens stakes organically; core premise commits to vulnerability motif without hedging, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
