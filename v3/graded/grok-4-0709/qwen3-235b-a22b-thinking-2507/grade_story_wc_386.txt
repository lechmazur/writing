<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to salvage purity is clear and rooted in her ghost-whispering traits, intensifying through embodied emotions like freezing tears during the realization. Interiority is concrete, with contradictory impulses in her pursuit of truth amid spectral regrets, culminating in an earned renunciation of the crew's shame. The single-POV focus reveals her values through micro-choices in dream analysis, though flaws like collective lies feel slightly summarized rather than deeply internalized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through dream fragments to a Resonant Reconfiguration, with the final placement of the globe offering Charged Poise and conceptual cost in exposed secrets. Orientation anchors early in the shrine, and causality holds via patterned echoes without breaks. The closure crystallizes with felt cost in Elara's tears, though one ellipsis in crew's fracture feels lightly motivated.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The glacier-ice shrine is vividly specific, with sensory details like subzero stillness and borrowed starlight refracting through ice constraining Elara's ritual and charging the final image of the globe as promise. Atmosphere builds tension through purposeful selectivity, mirroring her internal weaving without overt symbolism. The micro-setting of the shrine and globe directly shapes her choices and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of exposing truth escalates accumulatively through dream cameos, tightening to a deepening realization that reweights the crew's deception with emotional cost in Elara's tears. Pressure coheres under the lens, with agency in her analysis forcing stance crystallization without coincidence resolving it. One meaningful deepening suffices, though the cost feels more conceptual than visceral at peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of salvaging purity from fractured truths emerges organically through images like the melting globe and dream echoes, offering resonant ambiguity in the plea for understanding without moralizing. Subtext in spectral whispers and cameos enriches complexity, with the final image repricing the premise non-literally. Emotional aftereffect lingers via honest grief, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in Elara's spectral focus and rhythmic prose modulating under emotional intensity, like hitched breath at the wire beam. Voice texture is distinct in lyric compression, teaching patterns early for legibility at closure. No dialogue present, so policy skips; elision in dream fragments pays off without obscurity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in phrases like "thread by spectral thread" advancing atmosphere without loops. Figurative language integrates purposefully, avoiding muddle in peak beats like the crystallizing picture. Minor scaffold in one repetitive stem ("she had") doesn't dull closure; propulsion holds through selective verbs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of wreck-diving with dream analysis transforms ghost tropes through specific details like cameo echoes, feeling inevitable in the globe's promise. Risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, committing to the premise's implications. Emotional specificity in Varga's final thought avoids generics, offering non-obvious insight.</comment>
