<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in duty, with embodied emotions like trembling fingers and doubt slithering in, showing contradictory impulses during the lantern adjustment; the herald applies secondary pressure effectively, though his status dynamics feel slightly archetypal without deeper relational crucible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Under a Causal lens, the structure builds through motivated actions like wick adjustment leading to flare and wave disruption causing splintered light, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where broken light amplifies with felt cost of panic; orientation anchors early in the lighthouse climb, but minor ellipsis in shadow merging slightly softens linkage at climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The emerald lighthouse and stormy coast are vivid and purposeful, with rain-slicked dome and salt-crusted stone constraining Elara's actions and charging the final dawn image; sensory details like roaring sea and cool shadows integrate into pressure, reflecting POV bias under crisis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of shaping dawn tightens causally through the wave's disruption, forcing stance crystallization with legible cost in scattered light and panic; one meaningful deepening via realization amplifies the beam, though coincidence of converging beams slightly complicates without fully resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of hope from brokenness emerges organically through images like splintered light converging and shadows weaving into dawn, offering a resonant non-literal answer that reweights the premise without moralizing; subtext in herald's prophecy adds complexity, though occasional direct statements like "using brokenness to mend" border on assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Consistent third-person close POV with perceptual signature in Elara's focused interiority, like thrum of shadows; voice texture is poetic yet legible, with herald's dialogue natural and subtextual in prophetic bellows; minor register elevation in phrases like "shadowed elation" fits without drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied rhythm, like the sharp breath before igniting shadows advancing action; no major loops or artifacts, though some metaphors like laughter "pealing across the waves" verge on stock without muddle; high information density shines in climax without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mystical lighthouse duty with total internal reflection and prophetic herald transforms trope into non-obvious arc of amplification from breakage; risk in lyric elements heightens stakes organically, though premise echoes classic guardian tales without bolder subversion.</comment>
