<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The android's nostalgia and grief are embodied through concrete objects like the tear and circuit board, driving contradictory impulses toward resolution; the final reframing as a compass earns the change with visible cost in the dome's loss; however, phrases like "unresolved grief" edge into diagnostic speak, slightly flattening interiority at peak moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with because/therefore linkages from magnetic shift to chaos containment, anchoring orientation early in the dome farm; closure lands as a decisive change with the dome's implosion as felt cost, shaped by the box's persistent constraint on tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The desert rose farm and cracking dome constrain choices, pressuring the miniaturization; sensory details like crimson blooms under artificial suns reflect POV bias; the final aurora-lit sand charges the closure image with organic light.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of saving roses escalates under causal pressure from the pole shift, tightening to force agency in channeling chaos; the dome's collapse provides unmistakable cost, though coincidence of flares complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of embracing flaws emerges organically from the box's fears and chaos containment, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration where nostalgia reweights as a compass; the final seed image offers a non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Close third-person POV remains stable with a distinct perceptual signature through neural static and optical scans; rhythmic syntax heightens pressure in the climax, with no unmotivated elision or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density propels through vivid images like "sand pouring in like a slow tide," with varied rhythm and no major loops; minor figurative stacking in the storm sequence slightly muddles clarity without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The ingenious synthesis of android nostalgia and chaos miniaturization transforms AI tropes into a fresh escape premise, feeling inevitable through rose stakes; bold risk in conceptual containment heightens resonance without gimmickry.</comment>
