<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation as a persistently curious contact tracer for hearts is clear and intensifies to compel her high-stakes investigation, rooted in her backstory of sensing her mother's presence, which anchors her actions without excess reflection. Interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions like her quickened pulse during the discovery, revealing contradictory impulses between procedure and instinct. The final renunciation of standard protocol earns a meaningful change, foreclosing safety with felt cost in the urgent sprint to warn others. However, some emotional progression feels slightly tidy, avoiding deeper irrationality in peak stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under the Causal lens, because/therefore linkages drive the plot from sensing the pulse to discovering the photo and evacuating, with motivated ellipsis in the signal tracing that narrows options. Orientation anchors who (Elara, Lily, mother), where (mist-clad atrium), and when (twilight) by the first sentence, passing the test without penalty. Closure lands as a Decisive Change with visible cost in the cracking wall and relieved sobs, reconfiguring safety through Agnes's warning. The persistent constraint of the hearing aid shapes tactics, elevating the score, though one minor setup (the blueprints) feels slightly convenient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium at twilight is vividly anchored early with sensory details like damp air and moss-eaten fountain, filtered through Elara's urgent perception, constraining choices by veiling the wall and guiding her to the willow. Environmental details evolve causally, with condensation on the bench aiding the discovery, and the setting pressures the climax by housing the flawed beams. A recurring object (hearing aid against stone) charges the final image of salvation, meeting the 9+ test. Tone tensions the hush with urgency, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Under the Causal lens, the dominant stake of protecting vulnerable voices tightens meaningfully when the photo reveals the wall's danger, narrowing options and forcing Elara's sprint, with a visible cost in the near-collapse and emotional relief. Agency drives escalation through her decisions, like digging into the moss, crystallizing her stance without coincidence resolving it. One deepening suffices, interweaving internal curiosity with external threat, though the moral calculus feels slightly understated in the peak choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A coherent theme of enduring love transcending death emerges from images like the hearing aid's pulses and the photo's warning, developing through particulars without direct statements. Subtext in Agnes's plea invites reflection on listening to the vulnerable, with the final image offering a resonant, non-literal answer by repricing love as salvific, meeting the 9+ test but capped slightly for minor sentimentality in the closing line. Emotional aftereffect arises from the evacuation's relief, embracing complexity without tidy morals.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable, with perceptual signature biased toward sensory echoes of the dead, modulating voice with emotional intensity like the raw urgency in her warning. Prose texture is distinct in rhythmic, image-rich syntax, with purposeful compression in the tracing sequence taught early and paid off at closure. Dialogue is natural, subtextual, and advances plot, as in Lily's whisper about the photo, distinguishing voices without convergence. Minor filter verbs in interiority slightly dull immediacy but are voice-motivated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere through vivid images like "whispers threading through the damp air like cobwebs," varying rhythm naturally without loops. Sentence propulsion accelerates in the climax, with strong verbs and specific details, though one paraphrase loop in the atrium description ("reeling hush settled... thick enough to muffle") triggers a -0.4 deduction. No major artifacts obscure closure, and final line recharges motifs effectively, but occasional overwriting in metaphors muddles a peak beat slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The premise of a heart contact tracer using a hearing aid for ghostly warnings offers a fresh synthesis on grief and protection, transforming tropes through specific details like the photo's rigid finger. Risk-taking in blending supernatural with structural peril heightens stakes organically, feeling inevitable in hindsight with the evacuation. Emotional specificity avoids generics, committing to the vision without hedging, though proximity to familiar ghost story echoes caps ingenuity slightly.</comment>
