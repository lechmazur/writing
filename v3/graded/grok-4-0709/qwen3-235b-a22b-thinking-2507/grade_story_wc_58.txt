<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to map emotional wounds is clear and intensifies through her projections, compelling her to revise Varek's obituary with embodied contradictions like feeling the phantom weight of the boy's hand while confronting her own grief over Silas. Interiority is concrete and particular, with emotions embodied in shivers and thread-warming, avoiding stock phrasing. The final renunciation of external geography for internal courage shows earned endurance with felt cost, foreclosing a path of avoidance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through layered reflections and projections in a single garden scene, with orientation anchored early in the shadowed autumn garden post-ship departure. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing in the final paragraph, reweighting healing as internal witnessing with undeniable conceptual cost in "the courage to describe the hollow." Persistent constraint of the thread shapes tactics, but minor ambiguity in projection mechanics slightly softens causality without breaking the lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The shadowed autumn garden anchors early with vivid, purposeful sensory details like decaying apples and falling leaves that mirror internal decay, constraining Elara's choices by isolating her in solitude. The recurring thread as micro-setting charges the final image, turning crimson into a vein of frozen blood that reweights her realization. Sensory hierarchy reflects her bias toward emotional cartography, with details integrated into action like pressing the thread to her forehead.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of mapping healing tightens through deepening projections, narrowing options as Elara shifts from summoning Varek's absence to recognizing internal geography, with felt cost in the shiver and phantom weight. Under Accumulative/Textural lens, cadence shifts reweight the stake in the revision "He sails the harbor of his grief," driven by her agency. One meaningful deepening suffices, but cost could be more viscerally tied to a foreclosed path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of naming absences to heal emerges organically from projections and revisions, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer that reweights external maps as internal courage without moralizing. Subtext in the thread's echoes and leaf veins invites reflection on loss's splendor, with emotional honesty avoiding sentimentality. The final image recharges the premise through particulars like the thread's hum of unspoken goodbyes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature biased toward emotional textures like saffron scent and vein mappings, modulating rhythm under pressure without elision. Prose texture is distinct in rhythmic, lyric syntax that reflects Elara's introspective state, with no dialogue to evaluate. Minor filter-verb use in projections is voice-motivated and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, sentences advancing atmosphere and interiority through vivid images like "moonlight silvered the thread’s crimson strands" without loops or scaffold. Rhythm varies naturally, accelerating in projections and breathing in revisions, with zero figurative muddle in peak beats. Information propulsion is strong, culminating in the charged final line.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of emotional cartography with a relic thread transforms obituary trope into a non-obvious exploration of projected absences, feeling inevitable in the garden's isolation. Risk in lyric introspection heightens stakes without gimmickry, committing to the premise's implications. Emotional specificity avoids generics, with the internal geography shift as a bold, memorable inflection.</comment>
