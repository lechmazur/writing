<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her brother's ambiguous loss, intensifying through embodied emotion like the "physical ache" that compels her inventive use of the glass eyes. Interiority is concrete and particular, with contradictory impulses shown in her gentle refusal of brute force amid grief. The resolution earns stasis by reweighting loss as an interval, with visible cost in her lingering ache, though secondary characters are absent, fitting the single-POV scope.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through layered emotional vectors and patterns, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing where silence becomes a pause with conceptual cost in reweighted grief. Orientation anchors early in the cavern orchard post-silence, with no disorientation debt. Closure lands on-page with the stalactite's drip as a resonant shift, though causality feels more textural than strictly causal in the final reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The cavern orchard is vividly specific, with stalactites and moon-blossom trees constraining choices, like the chipped mosaic guiding emotional dovetailing. Sensory details are purposeful, filtered through Elara's bias, and the setting charges the final image as the drip restarts, mirroring internal hope. Micro-setting of the stone and eyes evolves causally, enhancing atmosphere without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of understanding ambiguous loss tightens through the glass eyes' use, deepening via the chipped stone to reweight sorrow with hope, under the Accumulative lens. One meaningful cadence shift narrows options, forcing emotional trade-offs with felt cost in her ache. Agency is in renunciation of brute force, though coincidence in the stone's patterns slightly complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of emotion as geometry emerges organically from vectors and patterns, resonating in the non-literal final image of the drip as buried optimism without moralizing. Subtext in fractured visuals and frayed threads invites reflection on ambiguous loss's complexity. The core concept integrates with Elara's arc, eliciting honest aftereffect through reweighted memory.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in Elara's mathematical gaze on emotions; no dialogue present, so policy skips those bullets. Voice texture is distinct in rhythmic, poetic syntax that modulates with intensity, like fracturing world under eyes. Elision is patterned and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied rhythm and high information in metaphors like "grief pool like water in stone," advancing atmosphere without loops. Some figurative density in peak beats risks muddle, but clarity holds at closure with the drip's whisper. No major artifacts, though occasional synonym churn like "absence... hollow space" deducts slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of taxidermist's eyes and emotional mathematics transforms familiar loss tropes into a fresh, cavern-orchard premise with non-obvious optimism. Risk in textural structure heightens stakes organically, feeling inevitable at the drip's return. No derivative echoes, with authenticity in the gentle inventive trait constraining choices.</comment>
