<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to connect with the ghost is clear and rooted in her grief, intensifying through micro-choices like pressing the bolt plate and drawing symbols, culminating in her rusty voice breaking silence with felt cost. Interiority is concrete, embodying contradictory impulses in her drifting alertness amid loneliness, though the ghost's traits feel more conceptual than embodied. The final promise and song reveal a hierarchy of values, foreclosing silence with emotional price on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned symbols and interactions to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the ghost finds peace, with felt cost in Elara's overcome grief; orientation anchors early in the misty courtyard. Closure lands on-page with the song harmonizing symbols, reweighting stakes via connection. One meaningful deepening suffices, though some ellipsis feels unmotivated without stronger causal links.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The misty courtyard above clouds is vivid and purposeful, constraining choices like tracing damp symbols and integrating mist as liquid smoke that reveals graffiti; it charges the final image of swirling notation. Sensory details are selective, reflecting Elara's alertness, with the flagstones' cold and thunder rumbling mirroring internal tension. Environment evolves causally, thinning mist sharpening symbols to enable closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of articulating the ghost's needs tightens through accumulating symbols, deepening via the bolt plate's vibration and Elara's drawing, forcing stance crystallization with cost in her vocal vulnerability. Under Accumulative lens, cadence shifts reweight stakes effectively in the song's harmony. One meaningful intensification suffices, though pressure feels more atmospheric than urgent at peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of connection amid loneliness emerges through particulars like the ghost's symbols and Elara's ballad, culminating in a resonant final image of bridged worlds without stated moral. Subtext in gestures like clutching the bolt plate and encoding replies invites reflection on unspoken needs. Emotional aftereffect is concrete, avoiding sentimentality via her rusty voice and the ghost's peaceful linger.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in drifting alertness filtering misty details; prose texture is distinct in rhythmic, poetic syntax that modulates with thunder's rumble. No dialogue, so policy skips those bullets; elision in ghost's manifestations is patterned and paid off at closure. Some register drift into elevated diction like "tinkersong wonder" feels voice-motivated but borders on precious.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere through vivid images like "neon veins," but occasional paraphrase loops (e.g., repeating ghost's loneliness) and template cadence in symbol descriptions dull momentum slightly. Rhythm varies naturally, with strong verbs and specific nouns; final line recharges motifs effectively. No major artifacts touch closure, though figurative density in peak beats risks muddle without full payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original synthesis of AI ghost in code with balladeer lore feels fresh and inevitable, transforming tropes through specific details like the bolt plate's grooves and graffiti encoding; risk in lyric texture heightens stakes without gimmickry. Core premise offers non-obvious angle on digital loneliness, committed fully with authentic vision. The song-as-bridge reconfiguration arises organically from particulars, avoiding derivative templates.</comment>
