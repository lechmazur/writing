<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to find lost conversations is clear and intensifies through her truth-sense curse, compelling honest admissions that rebuild the map; interiority is concrete, with embodied wilting near Ben's lie revealing contradictory fear and hope. The final blooming endurance forecloses isolation with felt emotional cost, shown in her vulnerable whispers like "I miss my sister’s voice." Ben as secondary applies pressure but lacks depth, slightly limiting relational crucible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Causal lens, because/therefore linkages drive from discovery to honest piecing to tree activation, with one meaningful tightening via Ben's dishonesty forcing her withdrawal. Closure is a Decisive Change as voices flow and she blooms, with conceptual cost of vulnerability made legible in the final image. Orientation anchors early in the greenhouse, but minor ellipsis in corridor hurry slightly softens late causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The greenhouse city's toxic sky and humid corridors constrain choices, pressuring Elara's repair work and map pursuit; sensory details like overripe orchids and condensation drips are vivid, POV-filtered, and evolve causally, charging the final banyan tree reveal. The environment directly shapes the closure by housing the Archive, with the tree's roots and bark parting as a resonant image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of recovering lost voices escalates causally through Ben's lie tightening her isolation, forcing honest admissions that narrow options and deepen cost via vulnerability. One meaningful deepening suffices, with agency in her renunciation of force for candor foreclosing deception paths; cost is felt in wilting and emotional admissions, but coincidence of fragment adhesion slightly complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of truth reassembling what lies destroy emerges organically from map-piecing via admissions, with subtext in wilting and blooming avoiding tidy morals; final image offers resonant non-literal answer by repricing honesty as bloom-worthy. Emotional aftereffect lingers through complexity of curse as gift, earned by specific struggles like whispering fears.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in calligrapher's precision and sensory bias toward scents and tremors; voice texture distinct in rhythmic, image-rich prose modulating with pressure, like shortened sentences during wilting. Dialogue with Ben carries subtext of eagerness, advancing plot naturally; no head-hopping, and purposeful compression in admissions pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing through vivid images like "spine softening like sun-scorched celery" without loops; rhythm varies naturally, but minor scaffold in descriptive openers slightly slows early momentum. No artifacts obscure closure, with strong verbs and specific detail propelling to the blooming end.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of truth-sense curse with map-rebuilding via candor transforms treasure map trope into organic emotional arc; risk in conceptual repricing heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable at the banyan reveal. Avoids stock metaphors, but familiarity of lost-voices archive slightly tempers ingenuity.</comment>
