<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael's motivation shifts credibly from vigilant guardianship to nurturing potential, rooted in embodied habits like touching the chess clock during silence, revealing internal contradictions between despair and hope. The final renunciation of forcing coherence earns stasis with felt cost in his dreamless isolation, charged by the dune's fractured lullaby. Interiority avoids stock phrasing, showing emotions through concrete perceptions like the archive's flickering fragments. Minor slip in over-articulated self-awareness at the realization moment slightly flattens peak contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through patterned elisions of light and sound, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing where the archive becomes a cradle of living potential, with conceptual cost in accepting corrupted pathways as fertile ground. Orientation anchors early with Kael on the glowing dune, avoiding disorientation penalties. Closure lands on-page with the dream of roots, reweighting the premise without mechanical explanation. Lens holds consistently, though one redundant descriptive loop in the middle slightly dilutes density buildup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The glowing dune's bioluminescent sands and fractured lullaby vividly anchor the bruised twilight, constraining Kael's choices by infiltrating the rig and sparking his realization. Sensory details, filtered through his weary POV, evolve causally as spores take root, charging the final image of roots pushing through cracked earth. Environment pressures the closure by merging with the archive, fulfilling the 9+ test. Idiom matches the post-apocalyptic era without caricature.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake in preserving the divergent archive tightens through textural density of invading spores, forcing a deepening stance crystallization where Kael renounces control for cultivation, with felt cost in his fractured vigilance. Under Accumulative lens, pattern break at the spark realization narrows options authentically via agency. Cost is unmistakable in the dream's arrival after prolonged emptiness. Minor abstraction in stakes during console flickers slightly undercuts visceral escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of cultivating potential from broken remnants emerges organically through recurring light motifs and Kael's shift, offering a resonant non-literal answer in the dream of roots that reweights the archive's corruption as fertile. Subtext in silence and fractured sounds invites reflection on loss without sentimentality. Final image provides Conceptual Repricing without moralizing, fulfilling 9+ test. Avoids thematic echo, though one overt realization line borders on assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and modest, with perceptual signature biased toward luminous decay and silence, modulating rhythm under pressure like the dune's hum. Prose texture distinct in poetic syntax, teaching patterned elision early for legibility at closure. No dialogue, so policy skips those bullets; free indirect style clean without filter stacks. Fulfills 9+ test with rhythmic control heightening the realization without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose propels with high density, varying rhythm in cerulean pulses and fractured lullabies, avoiding loops except one minor paraphrase in archive descriptions. Figurative language coherent, like "broken glass singing," enhancing momentum without muddle in peak beats. Zero scaffold or template cadence; final line recharges motifs effectively. Minor register drift in "wave functions" feels slightly academic but fits POV lexicon.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-apocalyptic guardianship with bioluminescent evolution transforms tropes through specific details like spore-invaded archives, feeling inevitable at the dream closure. Risk in lyric compression heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry, earning +0.3 bonus. Avoids derivative premises by grounding in emotional complexity. Proximity check clear, though forest-burn echo familiar but personalized.</comment>
