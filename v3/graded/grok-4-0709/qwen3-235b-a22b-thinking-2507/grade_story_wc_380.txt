<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and intensifies compellingly from childhood loss to exhuming the chest, rooted in consistent traits like carrying wildflowers; interiority is concrete and embodied, with trembling hands and breath catching revealing contradictory impulses under pressure. The meaningful change to a heart brimming with light is earned by prior causality, foreclosing clinging to remnants with felt emotional cost. No second character, so relationship dynamics are irrelevant. Quick test passed, but some stock phrasing like "hollow ache" slightly dilutes specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned motifs like wildflowers and gravity pulls, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing closure where pockets are reframed as keepers, with undeniable conceptual cost in releasing physical remnants for luminous memories. Orientation anchors early with the beached whale and Aris's role, no debt applied. Persistent constraint of fluctuating gravity shapes tactics, like tracing coffee grounds, and the final image recharges prior losses. Quick test passed with held lens and on-page cost in the chamber's surge.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The salt crystal growing chamber anchors vividly with pulsing facets and uneven air surges, constraining choices like digging under the largest cluster and charging the final memory release. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, mirroring internal ache through brine sting and humming rhythm. Micro-setting of the chest and crystals evolves causally, guiding the exhume action. Quick test passed as the environment charges the closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reclaiming deleted memories signals early and deepens through gravity's pull, forcing stance crystallization in placing flowers to release memories under Accumulative/Textural lens. One meaningful intensification narrows options at the vortex, with visible cost in surging release and empty hands. Agency drives the exhume and ritual, earning the reconfiguration without coincidence resolving. Quick test passed with protagonist-driven deepening and unmistakable cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of memories as kept rather than stolen emerges organically from wildflowers, whale, and salt wells, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer as fragments shimmer upward, reweighting loss without moralizing. Subtext in fragile remnants and breathing air invites reflection on preservation's complexity. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality through concrete release. Quick test passed with ending reweighting prior material subtly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature biased toward rhythmic clinks and salt scents, modulating rhythm under pressure like surging gravity. Prose texture is distinct in poetic syntax that teaches patterned elision early, paying off in gleaming silence made visible. No dialogue, so irrelevant; no head-hopping or unwarranted certainty. Quick test passed with rhythmic control and taught elision enhancing clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere through vivid images like fracturing glow and swirling grounds without loops or scaffold; rhythm varies naturally, accelerating in the surge. No artifacts obscure closure, with strong verbs and specific details propelling momentum. Figurative language is controlled, like "reality thinned like worn fabric," serving pressure without muddle. Quick test passed with zero loops and clear propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of gravity pockets as memory wells transforms familiar loss tropes through specific whale beaching and coffee ground patterns, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk in lyric, accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, committing to premise's implications. No close echoes; emotional specificity anchors universality. Quick test passed with non-obvious angle and risk elevating coherence.</comment>
