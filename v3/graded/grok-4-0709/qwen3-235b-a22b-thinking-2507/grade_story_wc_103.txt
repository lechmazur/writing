<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aris's motivation to harness time is clear and intensifies through regret, compelling his climactic grasp of the fragment; interiority is concrete with embodied emotions like trembling fingers and hammering heart, revealing contradictory impulses in his desperate crawl. The final renunciation of photographs earns stasis with visible cost of dissolved memories. Minor slip in stock phrasing like "heart hammered" prevents higher band, but flaws don't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, pattern of fading memories and geometric folds builds density to a cadence shift at disintegration, landing resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost of grief; orientation anchors early in the garden trap. Closure is on-page with felt cost in the blank photograph, but slight ellipsis in time-hurl feels under-motivated without stronger causal link.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The living bridge garden constrains choices with shifting hedges and ivy veins, charging the final ruins image; sensory details like crushed mint and ozone are vivid, POV-filtered, and evolve causally. Recurring fragment as micro-setting heightens pressure at hollow reveal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of escaping the time trap tightens through one meaningful deepening at grasping the fragment, narrowing options under textural lens with visible cost in memory loss; agency in crawling and grasping drives escalation. Coincidence of bridge shudder complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of time as grief emerges from fading photographs and disintegration without direct statement, resonating in final realization that reweights the premise; subtext in dissolving images invites reflection on loss. Ending offers non-literal answer through blank watermark, embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in geometric metaphors and sensory bias; prose texture modulates rhythm under pressure, like quaking reverie. No dialogue, so policy skips those bullets; patterned elision in memory surges is taught and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in metaphors like "origami shapes" and "tearing silk"; no major loops or artifacts, though occasional stacked figuratives in peak beats slightly muddle without harming clarity. Information advances atmosphere and stakes; final line recharges motifs effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of hyperbolic geometry and chroniton energy transforms time-loop trope through specific regret and textural realization; risk in lyric disintegration heightens stakes without gimmickry. Non-obvious angle on discovery's cost feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
