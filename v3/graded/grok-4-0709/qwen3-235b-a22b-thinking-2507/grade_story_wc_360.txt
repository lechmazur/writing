<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Aris's motivation to quantify emotions is concretely rooted in their habit of borrowing personalities, shown through embodied actions like tracing type slugs and sketching equations, with contradictory impulses peaking in the manic laughter that reveals self-deception. The final renunciation of solving emotions for carrying them is earned by prior deepenings, foreclosing the analytical path with the visible cost of ongoing emotional vulnerability. Interiority avoids stock phrasing, using specific, ink-stained perceptions to embody flaws and limits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through layered emotional discoveries, with orientation anchored by the first sentence in the workshop at 3:17 AM. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis in the final paragraph, where Aris accepts the current of emotions with the conceptual cost of dissolved mathematics, reweighting their quest. One meaningful deepening—the fragment's shift to collective sigh—tightens the stake without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The topaz workshop is vividly anchored with sensory details like ozone and burnt sugar, filtered through Aris's POV, where objects like the drawer and press constrain choices, such as brushing the fragment. The setting charges the final image, with moonlight bleeding through the window mirroring the emotional current, and the gas lamp's flame symbolizing steady work amid turbulence. Micro-setting of the body and tools evolves causally, enhancing atmosphere without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, the dominant stake of controlling borrowed emotions escalates through a pattern break when the fragment inverts joy into delusion, forcing stance crystallization with the felt cost of disorientation. Agency manifests in Aris's renunciation, foreclosing quantification with a deepening that reweights options. One meaningful intensification suffices, though a secondary moral calculus could sharpen the peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of emotion as an unquantifiable current emerges organically from concrete interactions with the fragment, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer in the final image of setting type amid vanished stars. Subtext in shifting geometries and writhed letters invites ambiguity without confusion, embracing complexity over tidy morals. The collective sigh epiphany is earned through struggle, eliciting honest aftereffect without sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable, with a distinct perceptual signature in indigo-stained fingers and molar vibrations, modulating rhythm under pressure like the gasping double-over. Prose texture is purposeful and lyric, teaching patterned elision early for legibility at closure. No dialogue, but internal voice coheres with idiosyncratic diction, avoiding filter stacks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with vivid, multi-job sentences like "the air thick with lucid turbulence," varying rhythm naturally without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, enhancing propulsion in peak beats like the writhing letters. Zero artifacts obscure clarity, with the final line recharging motifs through concrete action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise of transposed empathy via a halo fragment offers fresh synthesis, transforming trope of emotional absorption through specific workshop ingenuity and ambiguous inversions. Risk-taking in lyric ambiguity heightens stakes, feeling inevitable at the collective sigh, without gimmickry. Originality coheres in voice and theme, avoiding derivatives.</comment>
