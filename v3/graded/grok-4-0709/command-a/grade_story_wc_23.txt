<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to navigate loss is clear and intensifies through her building, rooted in ingenuity and isolation, with embodied emotion in raw hands and swelling heart; however, internal conflict feels summarized rather than simultaneous in scene, lacking contradictory impulses during the cryptic calls that could heighten stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with patterned calls and building accumulating to a Charged Poise closure where Mara finds purpose with felt cost of ongoing chaos; orientation anchors early in the station on the cliff, but ellipsis in migration reversal feels slightly unmotivated without tighter linkage to her final gaze at the stars.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The starlit signal station constrains choices through scavenged parts and windswept isolation, charging the final image of gazing at stars; sensory details like weathered walls and resonant tone are selective and POV-filtered, mirroring Mara's solace, though weather impacts could be more tactile in peak moments.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of restoring balance tightens once through the device's activation and arrivals, deepening under Accumulative lens with cadence shift to community; cost is felt in grueling labor and cyclical reminder, but escalation relies on coincidence of calls without protagonist-driven complication, softening the peak choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of finding purpose amid loss emerges organically from building and beacon's call, with resonant ambiguity in cyclical task avoiding tidy morals; subtext in relic's glow and arrivals reweights isolation to connection, eliciting emotional aftereffect, though final image could deepen counter-readings without more ironic friction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with perceptual signature in Mara's ingenuity and relic focus, syntax modulating rhythm under pressure like humming harmony; dialogue is sparse but natural and subtextual in the traveler's trembling voice, advancing plot without head-hopping, though elision of calls could teach pattern more explicitly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in descriptive beats like "worn smooth by centuries" advancing atmosphere; no major loops or artifacts, strong verbs propel momentum, but occasional stock phrasing like "heart swelled" slightly dulls specificity in emotional peaks without harming closure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of relic and beacon transforms migration trope through Mara's patchwork skills and raw solace, feeling organic with non-obvious cyclical purpose; however, premise echoes familiar redemption arcs without bolder risk in moral ambiguity, as community arrival resolves too symmetrically.</comment>
