<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to mentor resilience is rooted in her scars and habits like backward walking, with embodied emotions shown through trembling fingers and combative tenderness; internal conflict wars effectively in her annotation process, culminating in earned resolve at the end. However, some interiority veers toward stock phrasing, like "risen from the ashes," slightly diluting specificity. The final steady backward walk reveals a hierarchy of values with visible emotional cost, satisfying the 9+ test through contradictory impulses in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds density through reflective shards and motif accrual, leading to a Charged Poise closure where the shadow shimmers and Elara gains resolve, with felt cost in her replaced nervousness; orientation anchors early in the library setting. One meaningful cadence shift at annotation completion reweights the stake effectively. Cost is legible in the final image of the library feeling expectant, but lacks a more decisive physical constraint shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The forgotten library's atmosphere—dust motes, aged paper scent, groaning shelves—vividly constrains Elara's isolation and charges the final twilight image, with sensory details filtered through her bias; it pressures her task by evoking haunting serenity. Micro-setting like the desk and mirror integrates into action, mirroring her internal state without overt symbolism. This recurring environment charges the closure, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reversing exile through annotation tightens via tea leaf analysis, with one deepening shift as leaves form shapes that soften the shadow; under Accumulative lens, pressure accumulates texturally but lacks a sharper agency-driven escalation. Cost is felt in her shallow breath and resolve, but remains somewhat oblique without foreclosing a clearer option. The ending's reconfiguration is earned, yet coincidence in the shadow's response slightly undercuts protagonist-driven intensification.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of resilience amid exile emerges organically from Elara's annotation and mentorship echoes, with subtext in shifting tea leaves and softening shadow implying redemption's complexity; the final portal image offers a resonant, non-literal answer reweighting loss. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality through combative tenderness. However, some direct statements like "chance to reclaim what had been lost" border on thematic echo, slightly reducing ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and biased through Elara's perceptions, with distinct lyrical texture in syntax like curling steam whispers; no dialogue, so policy skips those bullets. Perceptual signature is character-specific in her focus on shadows and leaves, with rhythmic control heightening pressure in annotation beats. Purposeful compression in reflections pays off at closure without elision issues, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in descriptive paragraphs and advancing atmosphere through vivid images like frayed edges; no major loops or artifacts, though some metaphors stack densely in the tea leaf scene without muddle. Information propulsion is strong, with sentences multitasking character and theme. Final line recharges motifs effectively, but occasional elevated diction like "unraveling secrets" feels slightly register-drifted in peak moments.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The premise of a shard-mirror archivist annotating shadows via tea geometry offers fresh synthesis of exile and resilience, transformed through Elara's habits and the library's hush; risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity avoids generics, with the backward walking trait providing a non-obvious inflection. Closure feels inevitable in hindsight, earning a risk bonus.</comment>
