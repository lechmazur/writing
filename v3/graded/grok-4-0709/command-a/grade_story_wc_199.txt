<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to decode messages is clear and intensifies through her discovery, leading to an earned transformation with a felt cost of shifting identity; interiority is concrete via actions like building monuments, revealing contradictory impulses between order and curiosity. However, emotions lean toward stock epiphanies without deep embodiment under stress, and her flaws feel understated, not complicating choices sharply at peak moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through deepening discoveries with a resonant reconfiguration at the end via Elara's realization, landing a conceptual repricing with oblique cost; orientation anchors early in the arbor setting. However, causality feels loose with time jumps that ellipsis key deepenings without motivated linkage, and the closure lacks a sharper on-page cost to foreclose paths more visibly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The ashen skyborne arbor is vividly anchored with sensory details like ancient wood scents and falling leaves, constraining choices by tying prophecies to the environment; details evolve with events, mirroring Elara's internal shift. A recurring object like the moonstone charges the final image, elevating specificity, though some descriptions border on overt symbolism without fully integrating into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of uncovering the speck's secrets signals early and deepens once through research and monument-building, narrowing options toward purpose with a felt internal cost; agency via endurance crystallizes stance under textural lens. However, pressure remains static without a clear reversal or trade-off, and stakes feel abstract rather than viscerally tested on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of hidden magic in small things emerges organically from Elara's arc and motifs like seeds and leaves, culminating in a resonant non-literal reconfiguration without moralizing; subtext in whispers and glows invites reflection on purpose. However, insights border on unearned epiphanies, and ambiguity feels tidy rather than complex, lacking counter-readings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with character-specific perceptual bias in noticing seeds and leaves; prose texture is distinct with rhythmic, flowing syntax that modulates with discovery beats. No dialogue present, so policy skips those bullets; purposeful compression in time jumps is taught and legible, paying off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm through selective sensory images that advance atmosphere; no major loops or artifacts, and metaphors like "mossy delight" cohere without muddle. However, some sentences repeat stems like "she felt" in reflective blocks, slightly dulling propulsion in the middle, though closure remains clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The premise of prophetic leaves and transformative speck offers a fresh synthesis of folklore and personal awakening, transforming trope of discovery through specific arbor details; risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens resonance without gimmickry. However, the arc echoes familiar guardian tales without bold subversion, feeling somewhat derivative in emotional progression.</comment>
