<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The ghost bride's motivation to repay a lifetimes-spanning debt is clear and rooted in betrayal, intensifying through her interaction with the bead to compel a stance of hope amid sorrow. Interiority is concrete in moments like clutching the bead with trembling fingers, revealing embodied contradictory emotions of elation and venom without therapy-speak. However, internal conflict alternates in summaries rather than acting simultaneously in scene, slightly weakening pressure on choices. The final renunciation of isolation feels earned with collective cost, but flaws read as one-note in peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the story builds density through layered whispers and bead resonance, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where the ghost bride steps into the night with reweighted freedom and reckoning, carrying a felt collective cost. Orientation anchors who (ghost bride), where (greenhouse), and when (endless night over winter fields) by the first paragraph. Closure lands on-page with conceptual cost legible in the beacon promising both hope and confrontation. Minor redundancy in bead descriptions doesn't break pattern, holding the lens through to the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The alchemical orchard greenhouse is vividly anchored with petrified blossoms and glass walls, its warmth contrasting frozen fields to mirror the bride's internal sanctuary-prison tension. Sensory details like heavy scents and shimmering air are selective and POV-biased, evolving to pressure her awakening as whispers fill the space. The setting constrains choices, with the central tree as anchor charging the final image of transformation. Spatial coherence tracks her deliberate steps without impossibilities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of repaying the debt for freedom signals early and deepens through bead's glow and whispers, forcing a collective stance crystallization under the Accumulative/Textural lens with one meaningful cadence shift narrowing isolation. Agency emerges in her clutching and standing, foreclosing passive haunting with felt emotional cost. However, pressure feels somewhat static until the surge, lacking a sharper trade-off in mid-beats. Coincidence of other spirits complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of bound debts and resonant freedom emerges organically from bead interactions and collective whispers, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in her mournful elation. Subtext in the lovingly venomous bead connection deepens betrayal's complexity without direct statements. The final image offers a non-literal answer, reweighting personal sorrow as shared, eliciting lingering reflection. Epiphanies earn through struggle, avoiding platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and modest, with perceptual bias in her whisper-like presence and bead harmony, modulating voice with emotional intensity. Prose texture is distinct in rhythmic, atmospheric syntax, though some elision feels untaught. No dialogue present, so policy skips those bullets; free indirect style is clean without filter stacks. Minor register drift into elevated diction under pressure slightly muddles immediacy at the awakening surge.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose advances atmosphere with vivid images like "petrified blossoms" and varied rhythm, but paraphrase loops (e.g., repeating bead's power and connection in adjacent sentences) dull momentum without payoff. Information density is high in sensory layers, yet overwriting in figurative strings like "lovingly venomous" and "mournful elation" mixes metaphors, triggering a -0.6 deduction. Clarity holds with clean grammar, but template cadence in steps and approaches obscures propulsion in the central tree beat. Final line recharges motifs effectively despite artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The premise of a ghost bride repaying spectral debts in an alchemical greenhouse offers fresh synthesis, transforming ghost tropes through resonant bead awakenings and collective spirits. Emotional specificity in her venomous love avoids generics, with the final reconfiguration feeling inevitable from established patterns. Bold atmospheric risk heightens stakes without gimmickry, earning a +0.3 adjustment. No close echoes of famous scenes, committing fully to its visionary coherence.</comment>
