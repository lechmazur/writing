<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to uncover the lens's secret is clear and rooted in his stubborn trait, compelling him to explore the library despite dangers, but interiority relies on stock phrases like "weight of years" without deeply embodied contradictions. The final renunciation of weariness feels earned through his actions, yet lacks visible cost in the closure moment where relief arrives too tidily. Stubbornness enables key choices, such as diving for fragments, but it's labeled more than dramatized with trade-offs.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Under a Causal lens, the plot links events logically from package arrival to lens reconstruction and signal emission, with one meaningful tightening as Elias pieces fragments, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration in the city's illumination. Closure lands on-page with conceptual cost of forgotten histories being heard, but the water parting feels like a convenient ellipsis without fully motivated causality. Orientation anchors early in the library setting, avoiding penalties.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The underwater library is vividly specific, with seaweed-choked aisles and warped shelves constraining Elias's search and charging the final glowing image, serving as micro-setting that mirrors his internal stillness. Sensory details like fogged lantern glass and pulsing pages integrate into action, reflecting POV bias toward haunting comfort. Environment evolves causally, such as algae waterfalls hiding fragments, without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of giving rest to the restless escalates causally through fragment hunts, narrowing options with one meaningful tightening as the lens hums urgently, but coincidence in discoveries undercuts agency. Cost is felt conceptually in Elias's lifted burden, yet remains oblique without a visible trade-off in the climax. Pressure coheres under Causal lens but resolves too symmetrically without forcing a harder stance crystallization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of resilience through unheard voices emerges organically from the lens's signal and city's revival, with the final image offering a resonant, non-literal repricing of rest without moralizing. Subtext in pulsing pages and shattered lens implies complexity, but epiphanies like finding "a way to give rest a permanent address" border on stated insights. Emotional aftereffect lingers through ambiguity of the parting waters, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and modest, with perceptual signature biased toward Elias's weary observations like dancing shadows, and rhythmic prose modulates with pressure in search scenes. No dialogue present, so policy skips those bullets; free indirect style is clean without filter-verb stacks. Elision of fragment details is purposeful and paid off at closure, maintaining legibility under Causal lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose maintains momentum with varied rhythm and concise sentences advancing atmosphere, but paraphrase loops like "chased stillness" repeated without evolution dull the library's description. Figurative language, such as "burden he carried like a second skin," mixes metaphors without muddle, yet stock phrasing in peak beats like the signal moment reduces density. No major artifacts obscure closure, but template cadence in discovery sequences triggers a minor deduction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The premise of an undertaker revitalizing a drowned city's soul via a broken lens offers a fresh synthesis of burial motifs and underwater exploration, feeling organic rather than checklist-driven. However, convenient fragment placements echo stock quest tropes without bold transformation, and the ending's star revelation hedges risk for symmetric satisfaction. Risk-taking in the impossible space heightens stakes slightly but doesn't fully commit to unconventional implications.</comment>
