<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and rooted in her skepticism clashing with her father's beliefs, intensifying to compel her final act of turning the valve; interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions like her heart quickening and recklessness faltering at the climax. However, internal conflict alternates between summary and scene rather than showing simultaneous impulses, and her flaws feel somewhat stock without deep contradiction under pressure. The closure choice is earned by prior causality, foreclosing her doubt with a felt emotional cost in the final peace.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Under a Causal lens, the structure follows because/therefore linkages from entry to discovery to resolution, with orientation anchored early in the tunnel setting; closure is a Decisive Change as Mara turns the valve, freeing souls with a legible emotional cost in her lifted weight. One meaningful tightening occurs as whispers turn to screams, narrowing options and forcing her stance. Minor redundancy in setup descriptions slightly dilutes propulsion, but causality holds without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The abandoned train tunnel is vividly anchored with sensory details like damp earth and rusted metal, filtered through Mara's urgency; it constrains choices by guiding her deeper via sounds and shadows, charging the final image as the chamber awakens. Sensory selection balances visual and auditory, evolving causally with the machine's groan. No white-room issues, but some details mirror internal states overtly without subtlety.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of confronting her father's truth signals early and tightens once as shadows lunge, forcing agency in turning the valve under Causal lens pressure; cost is felt in her faltering recklessness and final peace, with one deepening that narrows options. Tension builds at sentence and beat levels, but stakes remain somewhat abstract until the climax, lacking a secondary accent for depth. Coincidence of finding the valve complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Theme of reconciling skepticism with supernatural truth emerges from events like interpreting calls and freeing ghosts, with subtext in whispers echoing her father's pleas; the final image offers a resonant answer by repricing her swallowed truth without moralizing. However, it borders on tidy resolution, lacking complex ambiguity. Emotional aftereffect is concrete but veers toward sentimentality in the peaceful close.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in Mara's focused urgency amid shadows; prose texture uses rhythmic syntax like echoing boots to heighten tension, and no dialogue appears, so those bullets are ignored. Psychic distance shifts intentionally with stress, but occasional filter verbs like "she felt" dull immediacy slightly. No head-hopping or register mismatches.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose is concise with varied rhythm, advancing atmosphere through images like dancing shadows; however, paraphrase loops appear in descriptions of whispers and shadows, and some stock metaphors like "heart quickened" reduce density. Information propulsion is solid in action beats, but minor scaffold in reflective blocks slows momentum without harming closure clarity. No major artifacts touch the ending.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The premise of a skeptical explorer confronting a factory ghost shift offers a fresh angle on haunting tales through personal familial truth, with ingenuity in the valve as a release mechanism; however, it echoes familiar ghost story tropes without bold transformation, feeling somewhat derivative. Risk-taking in supernatural resolution heightens stakes organically, but lacks a non-obvious synthesis. The core feels organic, not checklist-driven.</comment>
