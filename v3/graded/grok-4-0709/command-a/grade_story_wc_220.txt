<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation from dormant curiosity to active investigation is clear and rooted in his bloodhound past, intensifying to compel his factory visit; interiority is concrete with embodied senses like his twitching nose, but emotions lean toward summary rather than contradictory impulses in scene. The relationship with Lira acts as a crucible, pressuring him back into engagement with visible cost in his rare smile and shared walk. Flaws like stock retirement tropes complicate choices without fully balancing competence with struggle, capping depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through fragmented revelations to a Conceptual Repricing closure where the leaf's transformation reweights the wasteland as connection, with conceptual cost in Elias's shifted solitude; orientation anchors early in the scrapyard cabin. One meaningful deepening occurs as the phonograph hum yields images, changing knowledge without multiple reversals needed at this length. The ending's resonant reconfiguration lands on-page, but the cost feels more oblique than visceral, slightly softening impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The scrapyard and factory settings are vivid with selective sensory details like metallic tang and dust, filtered through Elias's POV to reflect his priorities; the wasteland evolves causally, mirroring his internal shift from loss to connection. Environmental details constrain choices, as the factory's machinery enables the riddle-solving beat. A recurring object like the wax leaf charges the final image, glowing as a beacon across the cracked wasteland.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of unraveling the riddle for personal reconnection signals early via the leaf's map-like veins, with one meaningful deepening in the factory as revelations narrow options to a present-focused insight; under Accumulative lens, pressure coheres through textural buildup. Agency manifests in Elias's endurance and realization, foreclosing isolation with felt emotional cost in his softened face. Stakes remain somewhat abstract, lacking a sharper trade-off or ethical calculus to elevate tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of translating distance into closeness emerges organically from the leaf's transformation and Elias's realization, integrated with the core concept through specific events like the phonograph's glowing symbols; subtext operates in implications of survival whispers and the leaf's pulsing light. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the beacon in darkness, eliciting emotional aftereffect without sentimentality. Ambiguity lingers meaningfully, but the insight borders on platitude, slightly reducing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and apt, with perceptual signature in Elias's scent-focused noticing; prose texture is distinct in rhythmic, wasteland-evoking syntax. Dialogue is natural, subtext-laden, and advances plot, as in Lira's whisper about secrets distinguishing her urgent idiom from Elias's rough voice. No head-hopping or unwarranted certainty, with purposeful compression in revelations paying off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere through vivid lines like "sun bled into the horizon"; rhythm varies naturally, avoiding loops, though some figurative language like "embers catching flame" risks cliché without muddle. Clarity holds with strong verbs and specific details, propelling momentum to the resonant final line. Minor scaffold in descriptive openers exists but doesn't obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The premise of a retired bloodhound solving a wax-leaf riddle in a post-war scrapyard offers fresh synthesis, transforming post-apocalyptic tropes through specific sensory and thematic details like grooves revealing tinted revelations. Risk-taking in the conceptual riddle heightens stakes organically, feeling inevitable in hindsight. However, echoes of familiar mystery-solving arcs limit ingenuity without bolder subversion.</comment>
