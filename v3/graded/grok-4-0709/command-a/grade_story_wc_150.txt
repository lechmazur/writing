<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to rebuild faith is clear and intensifies through discoveries, rooted in her diaspora background, but interiority relies on abstract summaries like "her faith shattered" without embodied contradictions in scene. Emotions are labeled rather than shown through conflicting impulses, though her purposeful wandering reveals values with some cost at the tomb's opening. The final renunciation of doubt feels earned by accumulative reflections, yet lacks a visible micro-choice under peak pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned discoveries and whispers, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration in the tomb chamber where the mural reweights her journey with conceptual cost of past displacement. Orientation anchors early in the catacomb orchard, but causality is soft with wandering replacing motivated turns, though the sundial base's placement provides a meaningful cadence shift. Closure lands on-page with felt belonging, yet lacks a persistent constraint shaping tactics beyond vague guidance from roots.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard is vividly specific, with roots snaking between bones mirroring Elara's intertwined heritage, constraining her wandering and charging the final tomb discovery. Sensory details like soft earth and golden hue are purposeful, filtered through her curious POV, and the setting evolves causally to guide her without static repetition. Environment pressures choices by hiding the tomb, making it indispensable to the closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of restoring faith signals early but escalates mildly through accumulative discoveries under the textural lens, with one deepening at the tomb's opening that reweights options via the mural. Pressure coheres internally yet remains abstract without a clear reversal or visible cost beyond emotional surge, allowing coincidence like root shifts to complicate without resolving. Agency is in endurance and wandering, foreclosing rushed paths with felt caution, but lacks a trade-off that narrows tactics sharply.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of cyclical restoration emerges organically from images like the sundial and mural, resisting tidy morals by embracing ambiguity in Elara's interrupted journey, with the final image offering a resonant, non-literal answer to belonging. Subtext in roots and whispers deepens complexity without confusion, eliciting emotional aftereffect through concrete particulars like tracing the mural. However, occasional abstract statements like "a beacon guiding her" border on thematic echo in the closing lines.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in warmly curious noticing of patterns, and prose texture distinct in rhythmic, lyric compression that modulates with discoveries. No dialogue, so policy skips those bullets; psychic distance shifts intentionally at the tomb for emotional intensity. Some register drift into elevated diction like "diaspora returnee" feels slightly unmotivated for her interior, but overall voice coheres without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose has vivid density in images like roots as veins, but paraphrase loops (e.g., repeating "roots" guidance in adjacent paragraphs) and template cadence in discovery beats dull momentum without payoff. Syntax varies for rhythm, yet overwriting with stacked metaphors in the orchard description obscures propulsion; final line recharges motifs cleanly. No major artifacts touch closure, but synonym churn around "whispers" and "secrets" adds minor drag.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard premise offers fresh synthesis of life-death interplay, transforming discovery tropes through specific wandering and root guidance that feels inevitable in hindsight. Emotional complexity in faith restoration avoids generics, with risk in lyric meandering heightening internal stakes without gimmickry. However, the arc echoes familiar heritage quests without a bold non-obvious inflection at closure.</comment>
