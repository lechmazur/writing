<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to harvest lessons from loss is clear and intensifies through her carving, with embodied emotions like tracing the wood revealing contradictory admiration and fear for Marius; however, some interiority veers into stock phrasing like "tangled threads of her emotions," slightly diluting specificity. The final realization earns stasis by confronting grief's cost, visible in her deliberate movements and the completed lion. Strengths in micro-choices under pressure, such as pausing for tea to ground herself, outweigh minor slips.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through reflective deepening and carving beats, with orientation anchored immediately in the rain-beaded loft; closure lands as Conceptual Repricing in the final image of the lion, reweighting grief with felt emotional cost. One meaningful cadence shift from carving challenges to confident strokes suffices at this length. Minor redundancy in repeated "here and gone" echoes doesn't break pattern but slightly loops without fresh pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The loft's rain-beaded skylight and tools create a diffused, rust-hued atmosphere that mirrors Elara's grief, with sensory details like dripping water and steam curling upward integrated into action; the setting constrains choices by providing a sanctuary for carving, charging the final image of the completed lion. Vivid, purposeful specificity elevates it, though weather's influence could more directly alter a tactic for higher impact.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of embracing grief's impermanence escalates through textural deepening in the mane-carving challenge, forcing stance crystallization with emotional cost felt in her pause and renewed focus; one meaningful intensification suffices, but pressure remains somewhat internal and abstract, lacking a sharper external complication. Agency in carving forecloses avoidance, aligning with Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of impermanence ("here and gone") emerges organically from carving the lion and reflections on Marius, culminating in a resonant final image that reweights loss as enduring imprint without stated moral; subtext in wood's "whisper" and tea's warmth adds complexity. Avoids tidy morals, embracing ambiguity in grief's taming.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and modest, with perceptual bias in Elara's memory-guided noticing; voice texture in rhythmic, figurative prose like "steam curled upward, distorting the light" modulates with emotional intensity. No dialogue, so policy skips those bullets; minor filter-verb use ("felt like a message") is voice-motivated without harm.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere through images like "rust-hued peace," but occasional paraphrase loops (e.g., repeated "hauntingly practical" in paragraphs 1 and 4) and template cadence in reflective blocks slightly drag momentum without obscuring closure. Rhythm varies naturally, and metaphors cohere, though figurative density in peak carving beats borders on overwriting without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lion tamer's widow carving a lion to contain grief transforms trope through specific ash wood and "here and gone" inflection, feeling inevitable in the final reconfiguration; risk in lyric reflection heightens emotional stakes without gimmickry. Avoids stock metaphors, but premise echoes familiar grief narratives without bolder subversion.</comment>
