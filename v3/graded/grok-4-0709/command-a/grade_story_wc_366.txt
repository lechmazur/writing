<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to protect the light builds consistently from his observant traits and sea glass habit, culminating in an earned resolve that forecloses passive endurance with a felt cost in the dawn lighting. Interiority is embodied through tactile interactions like brushing the glass, avoiding stock labels mostly, though the "luminescent ache" edges toward cliché. Contradictory impulses surface in his chill-not-fear reaction, revealing values under pressure without therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through layered discoveries (flickering lamp, sea glass message, stones, letters) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration in Elias's quiet resolve, with conceptual cost legible in the replaced ache. Orientation anchors early in the lighthouse setting, but causality feels loose with convenient appearances like the sudden sea glass and compartment. Closure lands on-page with the lamp relit, reweighting safety, though one tighter causal link could elevate it.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The lighthouse setting is vivid and purposeful, with crashing waves and flickering shadows constraining Elias's discoveries and mirroring his internal ache. Sensory details like gulls crying and sea glass glow are selective, filtered through his observant POV, and the lantern room evolves causally from light to dark, charging the final dawn image. No white-room issues; spatial choreography tracks cleanly, though occupational depth is minimal but apt for length.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, pressure accumulates through intensifying discoveries, tightening to a meaningful cadence shift in resolve, with dominant stake of safeguarding the light signaled early. One deepening occurs via the letters, narrowing options and forcing stance crystallization with felt cost in the anchor-like words. However, coincidences like the appearing sea glass complicate without fully resolving, slightly undercutting agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of bottling safety emerges organically from sea glass motifs and guardian role, culminating in a resonant final image that reweights protection without moralizing. Subtext in etched messages and stones invites ambiguity about the anonymous chain, enriching complexity. Emotional aftereffect feels honest, avoiding sentimentality, though the explicit letter sentence borders on thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and modest, with perceptual signature in Elias's warm observation of waves and glows, modulating rhythm under stress like the pounding heart. Prose texture is distinct in deliberate syntax mirroring his reticence, with no dialogue to evaluate. No head-hopping or unwarranted certainty; elision in mystery elements is taught early and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is concise with good density, advancing atmosphere through vivid images like "luminescent ache" without major loops, though some paraphrase in the final resolve dulls propulsion slightly. Rhythm varies naturally, with strong verbs and specific details; no significant artifacts obscure closure, but occasional stock phrasing like "heart pounding" trends generic. Final line recharges motifs effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The premise of a skipper decoding stacked-stone messages in a lighthouse offers a fresh synthesis of nautical lore and mystery, transformed through Elias's specific ache. However, turns feel somewhat convenient, echoing familiar puzzle narratives without bold risk-taking. Emotional specificity in the safety motivation adds ingenuity, but core frame trends derivative without non-obvious inflection.</comment>
