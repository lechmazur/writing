<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias's motivation for psychological safety is clear and intensifies through his hesitation with the eye, compelling the ritual; interiority shows embodied contradiction when he involuntarily speaks truth, revealing values under pressure. However, emotions lean toward summary labels like "strange calm" without deeper contradictory embodiment in the climax. The final renunciation earns stasis with felt cost, but stock traits like "rational forager" limit individuality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Under the Causal lens, the plot chains logically from discovery to ritual resolution with motivated ellipsis; orientation anchors early in the ravine with Elias foraging. Closure is a Decisive Change as the eye fades and truthfulness lifts, with visible cost in the orchard's restored grace. One meaningful tightening suffices, but the village transition feels slightly outline-like without deeper causal friction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The hanging orchard in the ravine is vivid and purposeful, with storm-battered branches constraining Elias's foraging and mirroring his fractured state; sensory details like damp air and bee hum filter through his POV, evolving to charge the dawn ritual's final image. The environment pressures choices, such as digging near the oak, and its grace restoration reweights the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of involuntary truthfulness escalates causally from discovery to ritual, with one meaningful tightening when Mara reveals the curse, narrowing options to dawn return; agency drives the renunciation with felt cost in calm relief. Pressure coheres but remains somewhat abstract, lacking a sharper trade-off in the climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of psychological safety emerges organically from Elias's confrontation with forced truth, culminating in a resonant final image that reweights truths as choices without moralizing; subtext in the eye's colors and ritual words invites reflection on fractured grace. The ending offers a non-literal answer, embracing complexity, but occasional direct statements like the lesson on truths slightly blunt ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and modest, with perceptual bias in Elias's rational focus on scents and risks; voice texture is distinct in deliberate syntax, modulating with stress like unbidden words. Dialogue is natural and subtextual in Mara's whispers, advancing plot, but minor filter verbs in interiority dull some immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is concise with rhythmic variation, advancing atmosphere through vivid images like swirling iris colors; information density is high in the ritual beat. However, paraphrase loops like repeated "fractured grace" and mixed metaphors in the orchard description create minor scaffold, slightly dulling momentum without harming closure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes a post-virus world with a truth-cursing relic in a fresh way, transforming curse tropes through Elias's rational foraging and psychological safety angle; the ritual's old tongue offers ingenuity in resolution. Risk-taking in thematic ambiguity heightens stakes, but echoes of familiar artifact tales limit non-obvious synthesis.</comment>
