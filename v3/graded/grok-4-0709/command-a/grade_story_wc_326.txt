<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to unravel her existential glitch is clear and intensifies through embodied anxiety like constant heartbeat counting, compelling her defragmentation choice; interiority is concrete with contradictory impulses of survival and ghostly communion, earning the final renunciation of error's hold with felt emotional cost in tears and steady heartbeat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through motif density (shard, ink patterns, ghost) to a resonant Conceptual Repricing at dawn, with legible cost in her reconfigured self-understanding; orientation anchors early in the observatory, but minor ellipsis in radio voice emergence slightly softens causal traceability without breaking closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The snow-blanketed opal observatory constrains Elara's isolation, mirroring her frosted existence and charging the dawn-lit final image; sensory details like aged wood scent and frosted dome are selective, POV-filtered, and evolve causally, with the shard as micro-setting that reflects light and hums to pressure choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of existential unraveling tightens through textural density of patterns and defragmentation, forcing stance crystallization in the radio voice encounter; one meaningful deepening narrows options with felt emotional cost in tears, but pressure feels somewhat abstract without a sharper on-page trade-off under the lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of fetching wisdom from failure emerges organically through motifs like the erroneous certificate and ghostly echo, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer via the dawn reconfiguration without moralizing; subtext in shard's broken promise and ink galaxies invites reflection on fragile existence, avoiding sentimentality with complex ambiguity in her survivor identity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable with perceptual signature in Elara's anxious, detail-oriented noticing, like tracing shard ridges; voice texture is distinct in rhythmic, motif-laden prose that modulates with pressure, and the ghostly dialogue carries subtext of untaken paths without register mismatch.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in sentences like "fingers flew across the keyboard" to propel midnight work; minor paraphrase loops in ghost descriptions slightly dull momentum, but no artifacts obscure closure, and metaphors like swirling ink galaxies are coherent without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of digital ghost and porcelain shard transforms familiar survivor trope into a textural meditation on erased timelines, with non-obvious risk in lyric ambiguity heightening thematic stakes; however, premise echoes common identity-mystery templates without bolder subversion.</comment>
