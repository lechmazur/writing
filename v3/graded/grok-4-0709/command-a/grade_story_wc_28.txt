<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to rebuild through renaming is clear but rooted in abstract labels like "gentle radical" and "retrocognitively trapped," lacking embodied contradictory impulses in scene; emotions are summarized rather than shown through micro-choices under pressure, as in her tracing the tessera without visible internal conflict or cost. No second character appears, so relationship bullets are ignored. The final endurance feels unearned without prior causality building genuine struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through reflective patterns and a cadence shift in the mosaic rearrangement, with orientation anchored early in the plaza; closure is a Conceptual Repricing via the new mosaic image reweighting mercy, but the conceptual cost feels oblique without a pointed on-page sentence making it undeniable, as in the vague "warmth" at the end. No meaningful tightening beyond the shift, fitting scope but lacking motivated ellipsis.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The plaza and shattered sky are vividly specific, with sensory details like acrid tang and dust integrated into Elara's actions, subtly mirroring her internal state; however, while the mosaic constrains her choice to rearrange, it doesn't fully charge the final image beyond symbolism, missing the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is coherent but static.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of renaming for mercy is signaled early but escalates minimally under Accumulative lens via pattern break in rearranging the tesserae; pressure is coherent but static, with no meaningful deepening that narrows options or forces trade-offs, and the cost remains abstract rather than unmistakable on the page, as in the tireless work without dramatized forfeiture.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme of aberrant mercy emerges through images like the gleaming tessera and rearranged mosaic, inviting reflection on empathy without tidy morals; however, it's often stated directly, as in "mercy should not be a rarity," bordering on thematic echo, and the final image offers resonance but doesn't fully reweight prior material non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with perceptual bias toward the past, and prose texture is poetic with rhythmic control; no dialogue, so those bullets ignored, but patterned elision in reflections is taught and pays off at closure. Minor register drift into abstract diction like "cradle empathy in arms of steel" feels unmotivated for the voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Prose has vivid images but suffers from paraphrase loops, like repeated "renaming" and "mosaic" descriptions without added pressure, and template cadence in sentences starting with "She" actions, dulling momentum; information density is low in reflective blocks, with artifacts like mixed metaphors ("heart both warm and cold") obscuring clarity but not touching closure directly. No major grammar issues, but overwriting in peak beats reduces propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The premise of retrocognitive renaming via mosaic offers a fresh angle on post-disaster mercy, with organic synthesis in Elara's transformation; however, it echoes familiar allegorical tropes without bold risk-taking, feeling like a stitched response with low irreplaceability, as the core could swap settings with minor changes.</comment>
