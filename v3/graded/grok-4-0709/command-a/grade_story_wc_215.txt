<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to restore the covenant intensifies through discoveries, rooted in his perceptive traits, but interiority relies on abstract labels like "tranquilly perceptive" without embodied contradictions under pressure. The final ritual choice feels earned by prior accumulations, yet lacks a visible micro-choice hierarchy with contradictory impulses in scene. Flaws complicate without deep internal conflict, as emotions are summarized rather than layered with irrationality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, discoveries build density toward ritual closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration with the oasis awakening and conceptual cost of honoring unspoken weights. Orientation anchors early in the wasteland oasis, but some ellipsis in dream-to-scroll feels unmotivated without tightening knowledge. Closure lands on-page with felt peace, though cost is more thematic than visceral.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The scorched wasteland and abandoned oasis constrain Elias's explorations, with details like weathered stones and dried flower beds mirroring his isolation and guiding discoveries. Sensory specifics, like wind whispers and shimmering box, evolve causally and charge the final awakening image. Environment pressures choices without overt symbolism, though some descriptions border on tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of restoring the covenant escalates through accumulative discoveries, with one meaningful deepening at the ritual that reweights options, but pressure feels low-stakes without strong opposition or foreclosed paths. Cost is conceptual in the ghosts' dissolution, yet lacks visceral trade-offs; coincidence of finding the box complicates without resolving. Moral calculus sharpens at honoring sacrifices, but conflict remains abstract.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of preserving unspoken words emerges from covenant fragments and ritual, with subtext in ghosts' silence and wind whispers, inviting reflection on resilience without tidy morals. Final image offers resonant answer by restoring the oasis, reweighting the premise with ambiguity. However, some direct statements like "tangled covenant" echo thesis overtly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable, with perceptual signature in Elias's attuned senses to light and whispers, modulating rhythm under discovery pressure. Prose texture is poetic and consistent, with purposeful compression in dream sequences. No dialogue present, so policy skips; elision in box opening is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose advances atmosphere with vivid metaphors like "skeletal remnants," but occasional paraphrase loops (e.g., repeated whispers of wind and secrets) and template cadence in discovery beats dull momentum. Information density is high in ritual climax, with syntactic variety, yet some overwriting in descriptive passages muddles propulsion without harming closure clarity. No major artifacts touch the ending.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Premise of recluse restoring a ghostly covenant via artifact offers fresh synthesis in beekeeping oasis, transforming trope through perceptual details, but risks familiarity in destiny-pull discovery. Risk-taking in textural accumulation heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable from patterns, though lacks bold subversion.</comment>
