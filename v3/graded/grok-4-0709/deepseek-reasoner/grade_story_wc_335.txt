<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to mentor resilience is consistently shown through firm guidance without pity, culminating in her commanding Kael not to retreat from the memory, which earns the reversal with visible emotional cost. Kael's nervous backward walking embodies his internal conflict, revealing a hierarchy of values under pressure. Minor weakness in Kael's interiority being more summarized than embodied in contradictory impulses during the annotation. Strength in relationships as crucible, with status dynamics shifting as Elara's tenderness becomes a weapon against despair.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds density through layered images like shards and tea leaves, leading to a Decisive Change in Kael's solidification with felt cost in confronting the memory. Orientation anchors early in the archive setting and Elara's role. Causality holds via motivated steps from arrival to annotation, with one meaningful deepening at the shadow-trace moment. Closure lands on-page with resonant reconfiguration, though cost is more conceptual than visceral.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The forgotten library of shard-mirrors is vividly specific, constraining choices like using the table and window light for analysis, charging the final image of the swing as witness. Atmosphere of poignant stillness mirrors Elara's solitude and evolves with Kael's intrusion. Sensory details are selective, with the grimy windows and drifting swing integrating into action. Recurring objects like the teacup and shard constrain the annotation, satisfying the 9+ test by charging closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reversing exile escalates through coherent pressure in the memory immersion, with one meaningful tightening when Elara identifies the fracture point, narrowing options to annotating the choice not taken. Cost is legible in Kael's flinch and emotional confrontation, driven by agency under the textural lens. No multiple reversals needed; coincidence doesn't resolve. Strength in moral calculus between retreating and staying, though stakes remain somewhat abstract until the climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of reversible exiles and resilience emerges organically from particulars like tea-leaf geometry mapping choices, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in Elara's self-imposed isolation. Subtext in gestures, like Kael's backward steps implying reversal desire, invites reflection on choice points. Final image of the solidified Kael and drifting swing offers a resonant, non-literal answer to exile's reversibility, reweighting the premise without statement. Emotional aftereffect is concrete, avoiding sentimentality through combative tenderness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Single POV (Elara's) is stable with controlled focalization, perceptual signature in sharp eyes analyzing patterns, and rhythmic prose modulating with pressure, like firm commands during immersion. Dialogue is natural, subtext-laden, advancing plot via Elara's corrections and guidance. No head-hopping; elision in memory jump is taught and paid off. Distinct voices: Elara's whetstone firmness vs. Kael's bewildered questions.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, sentences advancing atmosphere and action, like the shadow-arrow superimposition doing double work for analysis and symbolism. No loops or scaffolds; syntactic variety supports rhythm, with vivid verbs and specifics replacing generics. Figurative language is controlled, consistent, and payoff-driven in peak beats. Zero artifacts in closure, satisfying 9+ test with propulsion through the annotation glow.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of exile in shard-mirrors with tea-leaf geometry transforms familiar time-reversal tropes through specific psychic resonance and annotation, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in combative tenderness heightens stakes organically, without gimmickry. Non-obvious angle on mentorship via fractured ghosts avoids templates. Bold commitment to premise's implications, with the swing's reprise charging universality through specificity.</comment>
