<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elvan's reticence and warm observance are embodied through deliberate actions and perceptions, culminating in an earned shift to keeper with felt cost of solitude; interiority avoids stock phrasing, showing contradictory impulses in his solitary nature yielding to protective duty at the relighting moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, discoveries build density through notes, logbook, and cairns, leading to on-page Decisive Change with resonant cost in Elvan's new role; orientation anchors early on the dock, and persistent ghostly constraint shapes the final reconfiguration without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The haunted lantern room and cove details are vivid and purposeful, constraining Elvan's choices via the cairn's warning and charging the final image of the relit lamp and new cairn; sensory hierarchy reflects his observant bias, evolving causally with the wind's sigh of relief.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving the light escalates through accumulative revelations, deepening with the ghost's lament to force Elvan's agency in relighting; cost is legible in his foreclosed solitude, though one more explicit trade-off could sharpen the tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of spectral companionship and preserved safety emerges organically from the letter chain and cairns, culminating in a resonant, non-literal final image that reweights isolation without moralizing; subtext in the sea glass's glow invites lingering ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable with distinct perceptual signature in Elvan's salt-spray world, rhythmic prose modulating under pressure; no dialogue, but elision in discoveries is taught early and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with vivid, propulsion-driven sentences like the wind's moan and lamp's relighting, varying rhythm naturally; zero loops or artifacts, with figurative language enhancing atmosphere without muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghostly letters and stone messages transforms lighthouse trope through Elvan's observant lens, with risk in quiet, accumulative buildup heightening stakes organically; the sea glass's luminous ache feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
