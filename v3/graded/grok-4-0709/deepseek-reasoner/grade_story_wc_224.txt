<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to understand home is clear and intensifies through her ritual and the stone's discovery, with embodied emotions like the "searing brand" of memory showing contradictory impulses in scene. The final renunciation of avoidance is earned by prior visions, foreclosing her old loop with felt cost on the page. Strengths include character-specific interiority avoiding stock phrasing, though minor therapy-speak in pain descriptions slightly flattens peak moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through layered memories and sensations toward a Conceptual Repricing closure where home is redefined as an act, with conceptual cost legible in the reframed thunder as purpose. Orientation anchors early in the bookstore-mountain, and causality holds via textural escalations like the feather's touch. A minor ellipsis in the descent feels unmotivated but doesn't harm closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The labyrinthine bookstore-mountain setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like vellum scent and dust constraining Elara's search and charging the final image of the mountain as her garden. Micro-setting elements, such as the feather and stone, evolve causally and mirror her internal awakening. Environment directly shapes choices, like descending tiers amplifying memory thunder.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reclaiming buried talents tightens through the stone's refusal to be edited and the feather-triggered visions, reweighting options under Accumulative/Textural lens with a meaningful deepening at the eruption of memory. Agency in her decision to seed knowledge forecloses avoidance with felt cost of painful awakening. Coincidence of the feather complicates but doesn't resolve, though stakes occasionally feel abstract until the climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of preservation and remembering emerges organically from Elara's visions and the stone's language, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in pain's reframing as awakening. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer by reconceptualizing home as an act, reweighting prior avoidance. Subtext in images like hidden thunder builds emotional aftereffect without assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in Elara's mercury-glass eyes filtering histories, and rhythmic prose modulates with emotional intensity, like flickering reality. Purposeful compression in visions teaches pattern and pays off at closure without obscurity. No dialogue present, so not evaluated; voice coherence holds under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose features high density with vivid images like "swirling mercury-glass" advancing atmosphere and character, and syntactic variety supports rhythm without loops. Minor overwriting in stacked metaphors, such as "blanket of calm to smother the hidden thunder," slightly muddles a peak beat but doesn't obscure closure. Information propulsion is strong, with final line recharging motifs effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of lost tactile language and memory substitution offers a fresh angle on preservation, transformed through Elara's specific visions and the feather method. Risk-taking in textural, sensation-based revelations heightens stakes organically without gimmickry. Core premise feels inevitable in hindsight, avoiding tropes via non-obvious reconfiguration of pain as purpose.</comment>
