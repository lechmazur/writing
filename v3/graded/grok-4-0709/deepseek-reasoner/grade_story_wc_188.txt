<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to defy personal hopelessness is clear and intensifies through embodied doubt, culminating in the earned choice to ignite the fuse despite silence; interior conflict shows contradictory impulses like hesitation versus remembrance, with the mosaic-traced moment revealing values at cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under accumulative/textural lens, structure builds through rhythmic preparation to a resonant reconfiguration in the final blooming light, with conceptual cost of transformed melancholy legible; orientation anchors early via path and fortress, and closure lands with charged poise as the night shifts.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The blooming fortress at dusk is vividly specific, with stone petals and mosaic constraining Elara's blueprint and charging the final image of radiant rain; sensory details like old rain scent and luminescent tiles mirror internal states, evolving causally to support the thematic lift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of cleansing despair escalates through doubt's tightening pressure, forcing stance crystallization under situational lens with felt cost in overcoming absolute silence; the mosaic-triggered reversal deepens options, though coincidence of the note complicates without resolving.</comment>
