<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyra's motivation is clear and intensifies through her dual allegiance, compelling strategic choices like encoding messages in graffiti; interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions in moments like holding the stone chip, revealing contradictory impulses without stock phrasing. Hem's secondary pressure effectively crucifies her role, forcing a micro-choice that alters their dynamic. The final resolve earns stasis by foreclosing unchecked corporate dominance with the felt cost of fragile trust.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under a Causal lens, the structure links actions through because/therefore progression, from painting graffiti to community adaptation, with orientation anchored early in the canal walk. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration via Charged Poise in the mural viewing, reweighting her role with undeniable conceptual cost of ongoing tension. One meaningful tightening suffices, as her efforts narrow options against OmniCorp, though the ending's ellipsis slightly softens causal finality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The raft-city setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like murky canals and blinking lights filtered through Lyra's bias, constraining choices such as Hem's relocation. It evolves causally, mirroring her internal state in the evolving murals. The environment charges the final image, where the painted chip reconfigures the city's ecosystem, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of navigating gentrification signals early and tightens once through her graffiti method, forcing stance crystallization under Situational pressure from OmniCorp, with agency in renunciation of force for subtlety. Cost is legible in the fragile trust and desperate retreat, reweighting options. Coincidence complicates but doesn't resolve, aligning with the lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of adaptive resistance emerges organically from events like the stone chip exchange and mural encoding, inviting reflection on corporate sanitization without moralizing. Subtext in gestures, like Hem's sigh, and the final image offers a resonant, non-literal repricing of allegiance. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality through complex ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature biased toward artistic codes and community chaos, modulating distance intentionally in reflective moments. Dialogue is natural, subtextual, and goal-driven, as in Hem's question advancing the relocation beat. Prose texture is distinct, with rhythmic control under pressure, no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing through vivid images like "tentacle on a sea monster" without loops or scaffold; rhythm varies naturally, supporting momentum. Minor figurative muddle in "weight of the stone was immense" is voice-motivated but slightly overwrought. No artifacts touch closure, maintaining propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of floating carnival with graffiti-encoded resistance transforms gentrification tropes through specific details like the foundation chip, feeling inevitable in the mural reprise. Risk in subtle method heightens stakes without gimmickry. Avoids derivative echoes, committing to premise with authentic vision.</comment>
