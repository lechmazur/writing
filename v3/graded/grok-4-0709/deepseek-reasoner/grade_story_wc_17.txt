<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her perceptive traits, intensifying from echo mapping to recovering the legacy, with embodied emotion in her reading the diaries and feeling the burden. Interior conflict shows through her shift from absurd charm to crushing pressure, earning the final renunciation of mere cartography. The hierarchy of values reveals in her micro-choice to press the panel, foreclosing detachment with the felt cost of inherited responsibility.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The causal lens holds with because/therefore linkages from finding diaries to clues leading to the hidden compartment, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration where Elara accepts the legacy's burden with conceptual cost in the final line. Orientation anchors early in the profession and manor setting by ~100 words. One meaningful tightening suffices at this length, but the closure cost feels more implied than viscerally dramatized in the ending beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The ivy-veiled passage and manor setting are vivid and purposeful, with dappled green light and acoustic anomalies constraining choices, such as the sighing corner enabling discovery. Sensory details filter through Elara's perceptive bias, mirroring her internal shift from silence to revelation. The environment charges the final image by weaving family ghosts into the architecture, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of recovering the lost legacy signals early via diaries, with one meaningful deepening when clues tie to acoustics, narrowing options under causal pressure. Agency drives the search and panel press, foreclosing ignorance with the burden's cost legible in her shoulders and final carry. Coincidence of finding diaries complicates but does not resolve, fitting the lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of preserving fading legacies emerges organically from Elara's motivation and the negative's superimposed souls, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in Lysander's fear versus her sharing. Subtext in the walls' dreams reweights via the final image, offering a resonant non-literal answer that recharges the premise. Emotional aftereffect lingers through the burden's transfer without sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable third-person close POV maintains perceptual signature through Elara's acoustic focus, with rhythmic prose modulating from still air to frantic script. No dialogue, so policy skips those bullets; elision is minimal and taught via cryptic clues. Diction fits her sensitive idiom without register drift, heightening pressure in the hall scene.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in setups like the thick air and frantic script, advancing atmosphere without loops. Minor scaffold in repetitive "faint" descriptors, but no artifacts obscure closure; strong verbs and specific nouns propel to the final image. Information advances multi-job lines, passing the 9+ test except for one mixed metaphor in "digested by the relentless green."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of echo cartography with legacy preservation transforms tropes via acoustic clues and dreamed walls, feeling inevitable in the negative's ghostly weave. Risk in absurd motivation heightens stakes organically without gimmickry. Avoids derivative premises by grounding in climate shifts and perceptual ingenuity.</comment>
