<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to preserve the color of wonder is clear and intensifies through her patient actions, rooted in her seasonally mute trait that enables solitary focus without explanation. Interiority is concrete via sensations like "muted vigor" thrumming in her chest, revealing embodied determination under pressure. No contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene, limiting depth, but her micro-choices, such as placing the fragment and maintaining momentum, earn the endurance with felt cost of exhaustion over days.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds density through Elara's days-long tending, with a meaningful cadence shift at the seventh day's drops creating a resonant reconfiguration via the symphony's release and restored wonder. Closure lands on-page as Earned Stasis, with visible cost in her short-sleep bursts and the sculpture's fulfilled stilling, reweighting silence with glowing aftermath. Orientation anchors early in the bluff setting, but minor ambiguity in the world's wordless nature persists without fully serving closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The whispering bluff above clouds constrains choices by isolating Elara and enabling the sculpture's wind-driven motion, with vivid sensory details like creaking metal and prismatic light filtered through her attuned perception. Atmosphere evolves causally from storm damage to humming anticipation, mirroring her internal vigor. The environment charges the final image as the light wave flows down mountainsides, restoring wonder below.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving wonder escalates texturally through accumulating anticipation over days, with one meaningful deepening as drops form a harmony that reweights truth's cost. Pressure coheres via the ice's slow melt forcing endurance, culminating in agency-driven release with felt cost of her vigilance. Coincidence of the storm complicates but doesn't resolve, though stakes remain somewhat abstract until the visible restoration in villagers' eyes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of truth and wonder emerging through resonance without words develops via particulars like the ice fragment's melt and symphony, inviting reflection on silence's power. Subtext in gestures like chipping ice and pushing rings implies complexity, with the final image offering a resonant, non-literal answer by repricing silence as filled with glowing truth. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality through honest, quiet peace.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV remains stable and close, with perceptual signature in Elara's sensory focus on glisten and chimes, modulating rhythm from slow grinding to pure tones under pressure. Prose texture is distinct in poetic syntax like "a pure, crystalline note of clarity," teaching patterned elision of words for thematic effect. No dialogue present, so policy skips evaluation; elision pays off at closure without obscurity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere through vivid images like "prismatic shards of light across the cloud floor" without loops or scaffold. Rhythm varies naturally, accelerating in the melt sequence with strong verbs; no artifacts obscure closure, though occasional elevated diction like "symphony of truth" borders on register drift but fits voice. Final line resolves by recharging motifs of silence and resonance cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of wordless world and kinetic sculpture transforms familiar wonder-preservation trope through specific, grounded choices like seasonal muteness enabling action. Core premise offers non-obvious angle on truth via melting ice, with risk in muted tone heightening stakes organically. Emotional specificity in quiet determination avoids generics, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
