<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation as a ghostwriter seeking personal connection is clear and intensifies through embodied whimsy, like seeing metaphors in dew, leading to her earned reconfiguration; interiority shows contradictory isolation and yearning without stock phrasing. The nest discovery moment reveals her values hierarchy with felt cost of prior emotional borrowing. Strength lies in flaws complicating choices, avoiding tidy resolutions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through reflective shards to a Conceptual Repricing closure where Elara reweights her role, with conceptual cost of past haunting made legible in the final lantern image. Orientation anchors early in the pier scene. Minor slip in ellipsis between weeks of preparation, but pattern holds without breaking causality at climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting of the Lotus Temple and pond is vivid and purposeful, with rain-soaked planks and lily pads constraining Elara's wading action and charging the projected words in the final installation. Sensory details like wet earth smell reflect POV bias and evolve causally post-storm. Environment mirrors internal states subtly, enhancing thematic resonance without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><grade>Under Accumulative lens, dominant stake of finding connection tightens meaningfully when the nest fragment returns her words, deepening pressure to expose secrets; cost is felt in her shift from ghost to architect, foreclosing isolation. One cadence shift suffices, with agency in her installation decision. Coincidence of the nest complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of interconnected affection emerges organically from nest metaphor and installation, offering resonant non-literal answer in the collective poem without moralizing. Subtext in projected words like "I am terrified and brave only for you" invites reflection on vulnerability. Final image reweights premise with ambiguity, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with perceptual signature in whimsical filters like prismatic quiet; voice texture is distinct and rhythmic, modulating with emotional intensity. No dialogue, so policy skips those bullets. Elision in time jumps is patterned and pays off at closure without obscurity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm naturally; lines like "a twig spiral held together by mud and hope" advance atmosphere and character without loops or artifacts. Figurative language is controlled, no muddle in peak beats like the installation lighting. Propulsion strong, with zero scaffold touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghostwriting and public art transforms trope of hidden loves into interconnected ecology, feeling inevitable via nest return; risk in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity avoids generics, with non-obvious angle on vulnerability.</comment>
