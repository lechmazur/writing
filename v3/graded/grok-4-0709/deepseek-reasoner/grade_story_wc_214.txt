<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Aris's motivation as a spiritually curious janitor is clear and intensifies compellingly toward higher-stakes empathy, with interiority concrete and embodied in contradictory stillness versus urge to understand; the jolt of feeling the star's death reveals his vulnerability hierarchy with visible soul-cost, earning the final renunciation of mere preservation for active witnessing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through patterned imagery and cadence shifts to a resonant reconfiguration in the ending, with orientation anchored early in the station; closure lands as Conceptual Repricing where Aris reweights his purpose with undeniable conceptual cost of embracing vulnerability, though one minor ellipsis in the jolt feels slightly unmotivated without stronger causal linkage.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The shooting star tracking station is vividly specific, with sensory details like dormant machinery hum and dome beams filtering through Aris's custodial bias; it constrains choices by isolating him for introspection, charging the final image of pooled yellow light on the floor as micro-setting that reconfigures his kingdom.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of finding meaning in stillness escalates texturally through meteor shower pressure, deepening via the empathetic jolt that narrows options to active witnessing with felt soul-cost; one meaningful cadence shift suffices, driven by agency in using the glass, though coincidence of the shower slightly complicates without fully resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of strength in vulnerability emerges organically from Aris's empathetic burn and final reconfiguration, with subtext in glass imagery shifting from captured sunlight to deeper glow; ending offers resonant non-literal answer by repricing stillness as fullness, avoiding moralizing while embracing complexity in sacrificial beauty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in selective noticing of dust motes and whispers, rhythmic control heightening pressure in the jolt without obscurity; no dialogue, but prose texture reflects Aris's meditative mind, with purposeful compression in golden tableau teaching pattern paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in meditative sweeps and jolt acceleration; minor scaffold in repetitive light motifs dulls slightly but pays off in closure image, with clean grammar and strong verbs like "etched" advancing atmosphere without loops touching the ending.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cosmic janitor empathizing via relic glass transforms janitorial trope into primal vulnerability quest, with non-obvious risk in soul-jolt heightening stakes organically; authenticity coheres without hedging, though premise echoes quiet epiphany archetypes without bolder subversion.</comment>
