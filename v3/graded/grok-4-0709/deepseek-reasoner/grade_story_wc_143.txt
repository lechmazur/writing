<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to preserve precious craters through photography is clear and intensifies into urgent endurance, rooted in her purposefully curious trait that drives the discovery; interiority is concrete and embodied, with contradictory melancholy and focus shown in her aching vigil; the final renunciation of leaving accepts the cost of impending loss, earned by her micro-choices under cold and isolation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through observational beats and timed waiting, with orientation anchored early in the moonlit summit; closure is a Conceptual Repricing as the hologram reweights the summit's meaning with undeniable loss for two species; cost is felt in her physical endurance and the vanishing grain, though the persistent miner threat shapes tactics subtly without a sharper decisive turn.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The moonlit summit is vividly specific, with fine grey dust, plummeting cold, and starlit isolation constraining Elara's endurance and charging the final holographic memory; sensory details like recycled breath and amber pulse are filtered through her professional bias, evolving causally as Earth sets and dawn approaches; this micro-setting directly pressures her vigil and reconfigures the closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of outlasting the countdown before miners arrive signals early and deepens through textual accumulation of cold, aches, and slowing pulses, narrowing options to endurance; under the Accumulative lens, this cadence shift forces stance crystallization with felt physical cost; however, coincidence of alignment complicates without fully resolving, and agency leans toward passive waiting over active trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of preserving precious, vanishing beauty emerges organically from Elara's photography and the alien memory, resisting tidy morals through ambiguous loss; subtext in the glyph's map and hologram invites reflection on forgotten civilizations without confusion; the final image offers a resonant, non-literal reconfiguration of her mission, reweighting prior melancholy with shared interspecies cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Close third-person POV is stable and modest, with perceptual signature biased toward geological anomalies and star patterns, modulating rhythm from descriptive hush to urgent focus; prose texture is distinct in syntactic variety and purposeful compression during the vigil; no dialogue present, but elision of time teaches accumulative pattern, paying off legibly at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere through vivid images like "diamond-hard stars" and varying rhythm in the waiting beats; minor scaffold in repetitive silence descriptions creates slight loops, but no artifacts obscure closure; strong verbs and specific details propel momentum, though one mixed metaphor ("sweet sadness") slightly muddles a peak emotional line.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original synthesis of alien chronometer as a sand grain with stellar map transforms sci-fi artifact tropes through Elara's personal melancholy and endurance; risk in quiet, observational structure heightens thematic stakes of loss without gimmickry; the non-obvious hologram as a "last photograph" feels inevitable, committing fully to the premise's implications.</comment>
