<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The statue's motivation as a prisoner of certainty is concretely embodied in its unchanging observations, intensifying to compel the pivotal movement and acceptance of nuance, with contradictory impulses shown in the fissure of its foundational truth. The human's incisively kind trait pressures choices without stock phrasing, and their interaction as crucible alters the statue's state by the end. Interiority is character-particular, avoiding therapy-speak, though the statue's flawless shift slightly hedges emotional cost at closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, cascading revelations build density and break pattern with the statue's movement, leading to a Conceptual Repricing closure where the garden shifts from mourning to guardianship with undeniable conceptual cost in reweighted purpose. Orientation anchors who (statue, human), where (underwater garden), and when (millennia-post-sinking) by ~50 words. One meaningful deepening suffices, with cost legible in the final harmonious hum and gratitude.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The underwater city garden is vividly specific with phosphorescent kelp, cracked pearls, and coralline moss, constraining choices like the column's fracture and charging the final image of patient life. Sensory details reflect the statue's observational bias, evolving causally with events. Environment mirrors internal shift from burden to blanket, heightening atmosphere without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of unchanging certainty tightens through revelations, with one meaningful deepening via the ampoule's crack forcing stance crystallization under Accumulative lens, narrowing options to guardianship with felt cost in fissured truth. Pressure coheres without coincidence resolving; agency in the statue's pointing and the human's threading forecloses mourning path. Moral calculus between certainty and nuance sharpens the peak, though secondary accents are minimal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of welcoming nuance into certainty emerges organically from cascading revelations and the ampoule's memory, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in the city's deliberate sleep. Subtext in gestures like the pointing finger and threaded fracture invites reflection on guardianship without confusion. Final image offers resonant, non-literal answer by reweighting pearls as constellation, eliciting emotional aftereffect of potent life.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person POV stable on statue with telepathic infusions, perceptual signature biased toward precise counts and monochrome thoughts, shifting rhythmically under revelations without head-hopping. Voice texture in grinding plates and silt sighs is distinct, with purposeful compression in mind-voices. Telepathic dialogue carries subtext and advances plot naturally, distinguishing characters.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied rhythm, like the "scream of color" advancing atmosphere and character without loops or scaffold. Figurative language integrates purposefully, such as water as blanket, without muddle in peak beats. High information density in revelations, though minor overwriting in ampoule description slightly pads; clarity holds at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of living statue and deliberate sinking transforms tropes through specific telepathic revelations and threaded fracture, feeling inevitable with risk in conceptual repricing heightening stakes. Perspective on guardianship as lullaby offers non-obvious angle, committing to premise without hedging. Bold risk in statue's first movement charges meaning organically.</comment>
