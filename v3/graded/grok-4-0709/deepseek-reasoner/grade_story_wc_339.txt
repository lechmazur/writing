<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's quietly analytic trait is embodied through her suppression of awe and meticulous untangling of memories, creating contradictory impulses that culminate in her earned realization about release; Mortimer's presence as a secondary character applies pressure, forcing her to confront her hollowness without stereotype. The final choice to place the globe back reveals a hierarchy of values with visible emotional cost. Minor slip in over-articulated interiority at the end slightly hedges the ambiguity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through descriptive beats to a Conceptual Repricing closure where Elara reweights discoveries as complete narratives with felt cost in her melancholy; orientation anchors early in the deep-sea setting. Causality holds with motivated ellipsis in the untangling sequence. Persistent constraint of the underwater environment shapes tactics, charging the final ascent image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The sunken library's ghostly details, like swaying shelves and floating books, constrain Elara's movements and mirror her internal hollowness, charging the final image of the curated exhibit; sensory specificity through headlamp beams and swirling motes reflects her analytic POV. Environment evolves causally with the spirit's release. Recurring snow globe as micro-setting constrains her choice to assist, elevating ingenuity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of resolving personal hollowness through aiding the soul tightens via the untangling, forcing a stance crystallization with emotional cost in the sigh and note's epitaph; under Accumulative/Textural lens, pattern break in the globe's warming reweights options. Agency in her meticulous care drives deepening. Coincidence of finding the globe complicates but does not resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of letting go as a necessary edit emerges organically from the untangling and Earhart parallel, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer via the final realization without moralizing; subtext in the missing figure and sigh invites ambiguity. Emotional aftereffect arises from the note's simplicity contrasting tragedy. No thematic echo or overt symbolism disrupts.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable with perceptual signature in analytic filters like cataloging facts; dialogue carries subtext, with Mortimer's dry voice distinct from Elara's matter-of-fact tone, advancing the soul's release. Rhythmic control in descriptive passages heightens pressure without elision issues. No head-hopping or register mismatch.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose density advances atmosphere and character through vivid metaphors like books as lethargic fish, with varied rhythm avoiding loops; final line resolves by recharging the ascent motif. Minor scaffold in one paraphrase loop during the untangling deducts slightly, but no artifacts touch closure. Information propulsion remains high in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of Earhart discovery with a soul-trapped snow globe and Death as archivist transforms tropes through specific underwater logic and thematic depth; risk in sophisticated melancholy heightens stakes without gimmickry. Non-obvious untangling method feels inevitable, committing to premise implications. No derivative echoes.</comment>
