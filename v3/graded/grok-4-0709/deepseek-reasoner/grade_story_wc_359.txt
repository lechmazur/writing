<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her synesthetic gift and melancholy, driving her quest with consistent interiority shown through embodied perceptions of color and sound; however, internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses, trending toward summary rather than dramatized tension in the singing sequence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, with density building through layered descriptions of notes and colors leading to a cadence shift at the pillar's explosion; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration via the mandala and world's awakening, with felt cost in Elara pouring her being, though orientation anchors early via the Sanctum setup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The ice cavern is vividly rendered with purposeful sensory details like glassy walls and stalactites that constrain and enhance the song's resonance, charging the final mandala image; micro-setting of the pillar directly shapes the climax without generic clichés.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of certifying wonder escalates through accumulative pressure of the song's building colors and emotions, with one meaningful deepening at the pillar's transformation; cost is legible in her exhaustive pouring of self, but agency feels more ritualistic than conflicted under pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of wonder as essential emerges organically from Elara's synesthetic song and the world's awakening, with resonant ambiguity in the final chord without moralizing; the mandala's reprise reweights the premise non-literally, embracing complexity over tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature through synesthetic colors, and prose texture modulates rhythmically with emotional intensity; no dialogue present, so policy skips those bullets, but elision in backstory anchors effectively without withholding for suspense.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density in vivid, multi-job sentences like the indigo spear striking the pillar, varying rhythm without loops; minor overwriting in stacked color metaphors during the song slightly muddles propulsion, but closure image remains clear and propulsive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of synesthesia and mythic quest transforms familiar tropes through specific auroral colors and primordial unfettering, with risk in poetic density heightening stakes organically; the cavern's transformation feels inevitable without echoing famous scenes.</comment>
