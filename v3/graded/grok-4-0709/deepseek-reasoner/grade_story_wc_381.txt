<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The summoner's motivation to hush the prophecy is clear and rooted in his traits as a cartographer of silence, intensifying to compel the high-stakes channeling into the wing; interiority is concrete and embodied, with contradictory impulses shown in his flinch and rejection of visions during the prophecy's backlash. Emotions are contradictory and embodied, as seen in his weariness and return to core hush amid despair. The single-POV focus excels in revealing hierarchy of values through micro-choices, like letting the wing go, with visible cost in bone-deep fatigue. Flaws complicate choices without safety-hedging, earning high marks despite poetic abstraction occasionally nearing stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through layered silences to a resonant reconfiguration where the prophecy is unraveled, with felt cost in the summoner's weariness and the wing's release; orientation anchors who (summoner), where (brookside haven), and when (nocturnal) by the first paragraph. Closure lands on-page as Conceptual Repricing, reweighting the quiet from absence to healed presence, with the final image of the wing sailing to stars charging the reconfiguration. Persistent constraint of silence-mapping shapes tactics throughout, elevating the score.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The nocturnal haven beside the brook is vividly specific, with sensory details like whispered wind and moss hush filtered through the summoner's POV, constraining choices by providing silence strands for weaving. Atmosphere supports the tranquil tone, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism, as in the brook's flow over stone becoming a mapped silence. The micro-setting of the brook and willow directly charges the final image of healed quiet, meeting the 9+ test. Spatial coherence is maintained, with environment evolving causally as silences still the air.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of hushing the prophecy is signaled early and deepens through one meaningful intensification when it fights back with visions, narrowing options and forcing stance crystallization under Accumulative/Textural lens; agency in channeling silence forecloses the noisy future with visible cost in weariness. Pressure coheres and grows via woven silences until the flash reweights the stake. The tightening is driven by protagonist agency, with unmistakable cost on-page in the exhale and bone-deep fatigue. Moral calculus between quiet and ruin sharpens the peak, though secondary accents are minimal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of profound silence countering chaotic noise emerges organically from images like the origami wing absorbing the prophecy, inviting reflection on peace amid ruin without tidy morals. Subtext operates in implications of the wing's ascent as ascent's promise, with the final image offering a resonant, non-literal answer by reweighting quiet as healed presence. Emotional aftereffect is concrete through the summoner's weary exhale and the dreaming quiet. Coherent without false equivalence, it resists abstraction via particulars like moth-thin paper.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable and apt, with distinct perceptual signature in silence-mapping and biased noticing of hushes; no dialogue present, so policy skips those bullets. Narrative voice has rhythmic control, modulating with intensity in the blinding flash, and prose texture is purposeful with patterned diction taught early in cosmic hush. Psychic distance shifts intentionally during the backlash, serving emotional beats. No head-hopping or elision issues, meeting 9+ test with control under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with vivid metaphors like "tranquil blaze" advancing atmosphere without loops; sentence variety supports rhythm, as in the long exhale contrasting prior hush. Some figurative density in peak beats risks muddle, like "terrestrially cosmic" and "psychic scar," but coherence holds without clarity loss at closure. Information density is high, with lines multitasking, and final line resolves by recharging the wing motif. Minor scaffold in synonym pairs like "hush" repetitions, but no artifacts touch closure, keeping it strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality shines in synthesizing summoning via silence-mapping and origami wing, a non-obvious angle on prophecy tropes transformed through specific choices like incomplete crane for focused quiet. The premise commits fully, with risk-taking in lyric accumulative structure heightening stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity in the weary release feels inevitable in hindsight. Fresh inflection in the wing's cosmic ascent reconfigures familiar magic into tranquil ingenuity.</comment>
