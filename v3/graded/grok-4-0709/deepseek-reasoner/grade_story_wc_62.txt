<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to discover collective grief is clear and rooted in her carver traits, intensifying through the spectral guide to compel her journey; interiority is concrete with embodied sensations like the cool pressure on her neck, revealing character under pressure. However, internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses, trending toward smooth epiphanies rather than genuine struggle. The final renunciation of prior dormancy is earned with felt cost in the settled peace, but flaws feel somewhat abstracted without raw embodiment in peak moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through patterned sensations and realizations with coherent orientation by the first paragraph; closure is a valid Conceptual Repricing where Elara reweights grief as dialogue, with conceptual cost in the thundering calm made legible in the final image. One meaningful deepening occurs via the family vision, reconfiguring knowledge without causality breaks. Minor elision in the spectral guide's origin is functional, paying off at closure without disorientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting anchors early in the shop and evolves consistently to the greenhouse, with vivid, purposeful sensory details like nectar-scented air and butterfly wings mirroring internal states; the greenhouse constrains choices by providing the vision site, charging the final image. Details are POV-filtered through Elara's meditative bias, integrating into action without stalling. For 9+ gate, the recurring ribbon object charges the closure, but environmental pressure could more directly alter tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, dominant stake in discovering grief's shape signals early and deepens once through the vision, reweighting with conceptual cost in the final reconfiguration; pressure coheres via spectral guidance, forcing stance crystallization without coincidence resolving. One meaningful cadence shift narrows options at the family apparition, with visible cost in withdrawn presence. Agency via meditative retracing forecloses dormancy, but escalation feels more textural than agency-driven in peaks.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of grief as poetic dialogue emerges organically from images like the ribbon's stanzas and family poems, inviting reflection through ambiguity without confusion; subtext in silences and implications enriches complexity. Final image offers resonant, non-literal answer reweighting prior material, avoiding moralizing. Epiphanies are earned via specific experiences, but some abstractions like "thundering calm" border on pseudo-profundity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with controlled focalization, perceptual signature selective via carver's bias like chisel whispers; prose texture distinct in rhythmic, poetic syntax modulating with intensity. No dialogue, so ignore those bullets; purposeful compression in visions is taught and legible at closure. Minor register drift into elevated diction fits voice without jarring, but peak stress could degrade perception more.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm and syntax for propulsion, like the chisel's whisper opening; clarity strong, but occasional paraphrase loops (e.g., repeated "thundering calm" in final lines) dull momentum slightly without touching closure. Figurative language integrates without muddle, though some metaphors like "dragonfly wings" border on stock. No major artifacts obscure cause/effect, but template cadence in descriptive runs reduces to -0.4.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Core premise of spectral mentorship in grief carving offers fresh synthesis of supernatural and artisanal, transformed through specific details like ribbon patterns; emotional specificity in meditative retracing feels inevitable, with risk in lyric structure heightening stakes. Tropes like ghostly guidance are grounded organically, avoiding echoes. Minor hedging in abstract calm slightly tempers boldness.</comment>
