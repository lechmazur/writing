<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to capture the spark is clear and rooted in her traits as a beautician to the dead, intensifying through her meditative process to compel the infusion; interiority is concrete, with embodied emotion in her stillness and weariness at the end. Internal conflict is subtle but present in the tension between her watchful grace and the hollowing cost, shown in the final sigh and her peace. The meaningful endurance earns stasis with felt cost, as her hierarchy of values prioritizes preserving the geomancer's joy over her own vitality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned imagery and deepening stillness, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where the infusion reweights the stake with conceptual cost (the chip's dulling and Elara's hollowness). Orientation anchors early in the skyborne grotto under aurora, serving the meditative closure. Closure lands on-page with felt cost in her weariness, and persistent constraint of the emerald's fading energy shapes tactics toward the final sigh.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The skyborne grotto under aurora is vividly specific, with sensory details like flickering citron and violet light constraining Elara's method of finding patterns in static. This micro-setting charges the final image, as the aurora pulses in rhythm with the infusion, mirroring her intent and the geomancer's preserved spark. Details evolve causally, integrating into action without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the dominant stake of capturing the spark escalates through density increase in psychic impressions, culminating in a cadence shift during the infusion that reweights the cost (Elara's hollowness). One meaningful deepening narrows options, driven by her agency in sifting chaos, with unmistakable on-page cost in her weariness. Pressure coheres without coincidence resolving it.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of preserving beauty before oblivion emerges organically from Elara's process and the geomancer's memory, with subtext in the aurora's silent dance and the chip's transformation. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer by infusing joy into the body, reweighting prior chaos without moralizing. Emotional aftereffect lingers through purposeful ambiguity in the ghost smile.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV remains stable and close, with distinct perceptual signature in Elara's lucidly watchful interiority, filtering details like green noise through her bias. Prose texture is purposeful, with rhythmic syntax modulating in meditative beats, and no dialogue to evaluate. Elision is minimal and taught, paying off in the closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in sentences like the aurora's pulsing to propel the meditative flow without loops or scaffold. Figurative language, such as "radiant hush," is controlled and coherent, enhancing atmosphere in peak moments like the infusion. No artifacts obscure closure, though minor synonym proximity in early descriptions slightly dulls propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise of a skyborne beautician infusing a dead man's spark via emerald patterns offers fresh synthesis of mortuary and mystical elements, feeling inevitable through Elara's method. Risk-taking in lyric, accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, transforming tropes of death and memory via specific details like the boy's wonder. No close echoes of familiar scenes, with authenticity in the singular vision.</comment>
