<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to protect the seeds is clear and intensifies compellingly, driving her deliberate actions like decoding the keys under pressure; interiority is concrete and embodied, with contradictory urgency and steadiness shown in her steady hands despite a hammering heart. The final endurance forecloses her freedom with a felt cost, earning the stasis. Minor slip in label-like phrasing ("patiently strategic grace") but it doesn't undermine the hierarchy of values revealed in micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under the Causal lens, the plot advances through tight because/therefore linkages, from decoding the keys to jamming the door, culminating in an Earned Stasis closure where Elara seals herself in with the visible cost of imprisonment. Orientation anchors early in the carnival center, and the single scene maintains coherence without disorientation. The arrow's use as a jam provides a persistent constraint shaping the final tactics and image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The abandoned carnival setting is vivid and purposeful, with details like the piano and mural constraining choices and charging the atmosphere; sensory specifics, such as grit-strewn concrete and mildewed toys, filter through Elara's urgency, mirroring her defiance. The micro-setting of the piano bench directly enables the decoding, and the vault's earthy air contrasts the scorched world, evolving causally to the sealed door. Environment charges the final image of shelves in dim light, but some details like the skee-ball lanes feel slightly ornamental.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Under the Causal lens, the dominant stake of impeding the militia to protect the seeds tightens meaningfully when the engine roar forces the door jam, narrowing options with the cost of self-imprisonment legible on the page. Protagonist agency drives the escalation through the decoding and arrow use, crystallizing her stance without coincidence resolving it. One deepening suffices at this length, but the internal-external weave could interweave more tightly for peak tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of planting resilience emerges organically from Elara's defiant actions and the seed vault imagery, culminating in a resonant final image that reweights the barren world without moralizing. Subtext in the paper-fletched arrow and piano keys adds complexity, inviting reflection on hope amid desolation. Emotional aftereffect is concrete, avoiding sentimentality, but the direct statement of motivation slightly undercuts implicit emergence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable and apt, with perceptual signature biased toward strategic details like key patterns, modulating rhythm under pressure without elision issues. Prose texture is distinct in graceful syntax reflecting Elara's poise, and no dialogue present avoids evaluation pitfalls. Psychic distance shifts intentionally during the militia arrival, heightening intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere through vivid images like the "grinning clown" mural without loops or scaffold; rhythm varies naturally, accelerating in the climax with strong verbs. Figurative language, such as "song of resistance," is controlled and payoff-driven, but occasional modifiers like "staggering grace" border on overwriting without muddling clarity. Final line recharges motifs effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes post-apocalyptic defiance with puzzle-solving in a carnival vault freshly, transforming tropes through Elara's arrow use and seed motivation; risk in the self-sealing closure heightens stakes organically. Originality shines in the paper-fletched arrow's ingenious jam, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Minor familiarity in the chased-liberator arc slightly tempers ingenuity.</comment>
