<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of proving gardens know gardeners signals early and deepens through the ritual reveal, narrowing options with the official's pressure; under Accumulative/Textural lens, cadence shift in the marble's light reweights stakes with felt cost of deception's endurance. Agency in polishing forecloses relocation, crystallizing stance with undeniable presence. Moral calculus sharpens in choosing conversation over metrics, with visible price in the garden's recognition.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of endurance over quantified luck emerges from ritual and garden response, with subtext in polishing cracks as mended deceptions; final image offers resonant, non-literal answer reweighting premise without moralizing. Emotional aftereffect arises from particulars like the dazzling blue stars, embracing complexity in blooming-withering ambiguity. Motif of marbles charges closure without tokenism, inextricable from arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in Elara's soil-scarred bias and rhythmic prose modulating with quiet fire; dialogue carries subtext, advancing plot through indirection like "The metrics measure chance." Distinct idiom distinguishes Elara's rustle-like voice from official's crisp statements. No head-hopping, with purposeful compression in ritual description taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
