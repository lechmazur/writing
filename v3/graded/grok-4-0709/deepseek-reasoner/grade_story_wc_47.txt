<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lyra's watchful dreamer traits drive concrete micro-choices, like misting moss and proffering the plant, revealing embodied contradictions in her vulnerability and proactivity; the amber pendant anchors her interiority without stock phrasing. Leo's arrival tests her motivations, forcing a relational crucible that earns the shared endurance with felt cost. Strengths in flawed, individual portrayal elevate, but minor therapy-speak in wound-grafting motivation slightly flattens emotional progression.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through patterned images like drip patterns and moss growth, leading to a Charged Poise closure where they watch the thawing, reconfiguring vulnerability into shared recovery with conceptual cost legible in the final image. Orientation anchors early in the data center; causality holds via textural density increase from solitude to connection. Minor ellipsis in Leo's arrival feels motivated, but no persistent constraint shapes tactics beyond the garden.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The abandoned data center turned moss garden constrains choices, supplying moss for the proffering action and charging the final drip-pattern image with thematic resonance; sensory details like humid air and gentle drip are selective, POV-filtered, and evolve causally. Micro-setting of server racks and icicles mirrors internal thawing, guiding the closure without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reclaiming wounds escalates texturally through Leo's arrival, deepening vulnerability into shared refuge; one meaningful cadence shift in proffering the moss narrows isolation options with felt relational cost. Agency in Lyra's proactive gesture drives the reconfiguration under the lens. Coherent pressure crystallizes stance without coincidence resolving it.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of grafting new meaning onto wounds emerges organically from moss imagery and drip patterns, culminating in a resonant final image that reweights recovery without moralizing; subtext in gestures like proffering carries ambiguity. Emotional aftereffect lingers through complexity, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable, with perceptual signature in Lyra's pattern-noticing bias; voice texture in rhythmic, image-dense prose modulates with hush, teaching patterned elision early. Dialogue is sparse, natural, subtextual, advancing connection; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose density advances atmosphere and character through vivid, multi-job sentences like the drip-map description; rhythm varies naturally, avoiding loops, though occasional figurative stacking in "honeyed hush" borders overwriting without muddling clarity. No artifacts obscure closure; strong verbs and specificity propel momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of data center as moss sanctuary transforms abandonment tropes into a specific recovery premise; risk in quiet, textural buildup heightens vulnerability stakes organically. Emotional specificity in shared wounds avoids generics, with drip-pattern ingenuity recharging motifs.</comment>
