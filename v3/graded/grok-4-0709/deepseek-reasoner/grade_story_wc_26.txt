<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to preserve hope is clear and intensifies through her discoveries, rooted in consistent traits like sharp observation and deliberate focus, culminating in an earned endurance that forecloses passive dreaming with felt spiritual cost. Interiority is concrete and embodied, with contradictory impulses shown in her luminous regret during video comparison, avoiding stock phrasing. The river stone grounds her thoughts, revealing character under pressure without therapy-speak. No second character, so relationship dynamics are irrelevant.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through patterned observations and realizations with coherent density increase, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration in the shadow's emergence and stone's transformation, with legible mental/spiritual cost in her exertion. Orientation anchors early in the Aerie and library, no disorientation debt. One meaningful deepening occurs via anomaly discovery, sufficient for length, though ellipsis between nights slightly softens causality without breaking it. Final image reweights hope's shape effectively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The Blooming Library setting is vivid and purposeful, with crystalline spires and flowering vines constraining Elara's choices and charging the final image as she imagines its brighter version, functioning as micro-setting that evolves causally. Sensory details are selective, filtered through her POV bias, mirroring internal regret via pulsing light. Environment affects action, like the terminal and wall where the shadow appears, with coherent spatial choreography. Recurring vines and stone integrate into pressure without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving hope signals early and deepens through anomaly discovery, narrowing options to summon the shadow, with one meaningful cadence shift under Accumulative/Textural lens forcing stance crystallization at climax. Agency via her deliberate dream-building forecloses borrowed dreams with felt exertion cost, legible on-page. No multiple reversals needed; pressure coheres without coincidence resolving. Moral calculus between individual creation and collective languor sharpens the peak choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of hope's erosion emerges organically from video comparisons and shadow's absence, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in the stone's transformation inviting reflection on reversal's possibility. Subtext in images like dying star regret and unbound shadow enriches complexity without confusion. Final image offers resonant, non-literal repricing of dream-sharing's cost, reweighting premise. Emotional aftereffect arises from particulars, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable and apt, with distinct perceptual signature in Elara's sharp-eyed noticing and softly deliberate focus, modulating rhythm under pressure like during exertion. Prose texture is purposeful, with syntactic variety and voice-motivated diction; no dialogue, so ignore those bullets. No elision or head-hopping; perceptual bias consistent. Final beats maintain control without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere through vivid images like fiery hues and pulsing vines, varying rhythm naturally without loops or scaffold. No artifacts in peak beats; metaphors coherent and purposeful, like dying star sorrow, enhancing propulsion. Strong verbs and specific nouns dominate, with clean grammar and sequence clarity. Opening anchors voice; final line recharges stone motif effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original synthesis of dream-sharing's societal impact with unbound shadow as hope's manifestation feels fresh and inevitable, transforming trope of fading creativity through Elara's specific video method and stone transformation. Core premise offers non-obvious angle on collective languor, with emotional specificity avoiding generics. Risk in lyric, accumulative build heightens stakes without gimmickry. No close echoes of famous scenes; authenticity coheres.</comment>
