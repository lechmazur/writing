<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to trade certainty for curiosity is clear and intensifies through her actions, culminating in the earned choice to complete the sculpture rather than merely repair it, with a felt cost of embracing a legacy. Interiority is concrete, embodied in her playful methodology and reactions to the vision, showing contradictory impulses between preservation and resurrection. The single-POV focus reveals her values through micro-choices, like placing the nickel and chipping the sculpture.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under a Causal lens, the structure builds through because/therefore linkages from discovery to vision to decisive action, with orientation anchored early in the sound wave garden. Closure lands as a Decisive Change when Elara taps the sculpture, resurrecting the garden with a legible cost of shifting from restorer to heir. One meaningful tightening suffices, as the vision narrows options and forces her stance crystallization.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The sound wave garden is vividly specific, with brass blooms and sonic alchemy constraining choices, like the breeze through the fracture activating resonance. Sensory details are purposeful, filtered through Elara's POV, and the setting evolves causally, charging the final symphony image. Environment directly shapes the closure by supplying the fractured sculpture as a key constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of resurrection escalates causally through the vision's pressure, tightening options with the creator's legacy and forcing Elara's agency in completing the fracture, with a felt cost of boundless curiosity over certainty. One meaningful deepening via the nested awakenings narrows paths under the Causal lens. Coincidence of the breeze complicates but does not resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of exchanging certainty for curiosity emerges organically from Elara's actions and the nested awakenings, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in the legacy's cost. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer by repricing her role from restorer to heir. Subtext in the fox's sly glint and vision deepens complexity without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in Elara's curious, methodical bias toward the mural and sounds. Prose texture is distinct, rhythmic, and modulates with pressure, like the liquid jewel note. No dialogue, so policy skips those bullets; elision in the vision is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere through vivid images like "ghost in the machine of pigment and limewash," without loops or scaffold. Rhythm varies naturally, though some figurative density in the awakening beat borders on overwriting but pays off in momentum. Clarity holds at closure, with strong verbs and purposeful syntax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise of a sonic garden with nested awakenings via reflected sound offers fresh synthesis, transformed through Elara's curiosity and the hobo nickel's role. Risk in the visionary shard heightens stakes organically, feeling inevitable at the symphony's eruption. No close echoes of familiar tropes; authenticity coheres in voice and concept.</comment>
