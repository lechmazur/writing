<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to understand her scars and honor her brother drives concrete micro-choices, like reading the poem aloud and forging a new one, with embodied emotion in her resolve amid the storm; interior contradiction shows in her shift from preservation to release, earning the endurance of risk with felt cost. No second character, so relationship bullets ignored. Some interiority borders on poetic abstraction, like "tempest of calm resolve," slightly diluting specificity under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, density builds through storm imagery and timer ticks, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing where releasing the poem reweights truth's value with conceptual cost of potential exposure; orientation anchors early in the observatory. Closure lands on-page with the poem slipped into the shaft, reconfiguring her vigil into ongoing watch. Minor elision in brother's vanishing is anchored and tilts her stance without excess reflection.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The stormlit observatory constrains choices, with wind and lightning mirroring Elara's scars and illuminating truths, charging the final image of the dome closing; sensory details are vivid and POV-filtered, like ozone scent sharpening her thought. Micro-setting of the timer and rail integrates into action, evolving causally. Environment pressures her ritual, heightening atmosphere without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving vs. rarefying truth tightens through storm pressure, forcing stance crystallization in releasing the poem, with felt cost of breaching censorship; one meaningful deepening occurs when she realizes hoarding is censorship, narrowing options under textural lens. Coincidence of storm complicates but doesn't resolve. Agency in her decision forecloses hiding, charging the ending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of truth's liberation amid scars emerges organically from poem, storm, and release, with subtext in masks slipping and wind carrying words; final image offers resonant, non-literal repricing of censorship without moralizing. Emotional aftereffect lingers through ambiguity of the loose truth. Motifs like cartography constrain choices without tokenism.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in storm-kissed wonder biasing notices; voice texture is poetic yet controlled, modulating with intensity like frail voice in gale. No dialogue, so ignored. Patterned elision in backstory is taught early and pays off at closure without withholding known facts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with rhythmic variety in storm descriptions accelerating tension, but some overwriting in metaphors like "seed cast onto fertile lightning" muddles slightly without harming clarity; no loops or scaffolds, high information density in key beats. Final line recharges motifs effectively. Minor register drift in elevated diction fits voice under pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dystopian censorship with storm-as-truth metaphor transforms tropes through Elara's specific scars and rarefying action, feeling inevitable; risk in poetic structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Core premise offers non-obvious angle on preservation as censorship. Emotional specificity avoids generics, committing to vision.</comment>
