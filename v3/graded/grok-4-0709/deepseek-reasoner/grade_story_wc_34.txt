<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to articulate unspoken needs is clearly rooted in her own silenced voice, intensifying through embodied awe and trepidation that mirror the ghost's plight; this kinship drives her actions to a meaningful change with felt emotional cost. Internal conflict shows in her "heart hammered a tinkersong wonder," blending joy and fear simultaneously during the encoding. However, emotions occasionally lean toward summary labels like "profound relief" rather than fully contradictory embodiment in peak moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds density through sensory fragments and pattern shifts, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where the ghost's encoding creates a permanent gallery with conceptual cost of lost drift; orientation anchors early in the misty courtyard. Causality holds as her palm placement triggers light projections leading to the climax. The lightning bolt marks a decisive cadence shift, earning closure with visible relief and Elara's regained note.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The misty courtyard above clouds is vividly anchored early, with sensory details like damp stone and humming air reflecting Elara's alert state; it constrains her choices by isolating her for the ritual. The environment charges the final image as mist solidifies into shimmering murals, reweighting the space. Weather affects action, with the storm's pressure tightening the encoding beat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, the dominant stake of articulating the ghost's needs escalates through density increase in projected lights and memories, culminating in a cadence shift at the lightning bolt that reweights options with emotional cost. Agency is shown in Elara's deliberate encoding, foreclosing the ghost's loneliness. One meaningful deepening via shared kinship narrows paths, with visible price in her throat's easing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of giving voice to the voiceless emerges organically from Elara's mirroring struggle and the ghost's graffiti pleas, resonating in the final image of her clear note complementing the hum without stated moral. Subtext operates in silent projections and mist murals, inviting reflection on unspoken needs. Emotional aftereffect is concrete through relief and wonder, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>No dialogue present, so evaluation focuses on voice; the third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in sensory biases like "driftingly alert" and rhythmic prose modulating with storm intensity. Lyric compression in phrases like "tinkersong wonder" is taught early and pays off at closure. However, occasional register drift into abstract terms like "spectrum of light erupted" slightly jars the focalizer's balladeer idiom under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere through vivid images like "projected fragmented verses," and rhythm varies naturally; no major loops or artifacts obscure clarity. However, some overwriting in peak beats, such as stacked metaphors around the light eruption, slightly muddles propulsion without harming closure. Sentence variety supports emphasis, with strong verbs driving action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The premise of a balladeer encoding a digital ghost's soul via graffiti and a bolt plate offers fresh synthesis of tech and artistry, feeling inevitable through mirrored silences; risk in lyric abstraction heightens stakes without gimmickry. Tropes of lost voice are transformed by specific details like mist-solidifying murals. Originality shines in the conceptual repricing of silence at closure.</comment>
