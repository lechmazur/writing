<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas's motivation to shape a new dawn is clear and intensifies through the storm, with his uncontrollable laughter embodying contradictory impulses in the climax; the helmsman's brief presence applies secondary pressure effectively. Interiority is concrete, as in the "dread-tinged thrill" during ascent, revealing flaws under stress without stock phrasing. The final renunciation of old ways earns stasis with felt cost in his purified elation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under the Causal lens, because/therefore linkages build from wick discovery to storm peril and prophetic laugh, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing where Silas reweights his role with conceptual cost in the glowing wick and new dawn. Orientation anchors early with Silas's role and lighthouse setting by ~100 words. Closure lands on-page with the wick's enduring glow, foreclosing old light-only ways.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The lighthouse and storm setting vividly constrain choices, with the glass palace and ozone air pressuring Silas's actions; the reef and shadow channel directly charge the closure by enabling salvation. Sensory details like crashing waves and black mountains are POV-filtered and purposeful, mirroring internal shadowed elation. Micro-setting of the wick evolves causally, reweighting the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of guiding ships escalates causally through storm pressure, tightening with the failed beam and forced laugh that narrows options, forcing agency in embracing shadow; cost is legible in Silas's breath-caught throat and role shift. One meaningful deepening suffices, with the laugh as reversal testing commitment. Coincidence of the wick complicates but does not resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of balancing light and shadow emerges organically from events like the shadow channel salvation, offering a resonant non-literal answer in the final wick glow that reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext in laughter's joy amid peril invites reflection on prophecy and control. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality through complex ambiguity in Silas's purified elation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and poetic, with rhythmic control in phrases like "waves like black mountains," but unmotivated head-hop to the helmsman's perspective disrupts POV stability mid-storm. Perceptual signature is strong in Silas's arc, yet the shift introduces unwarranted certainty. No dialogue present, so those bullets are ignored.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere in lines like "air tasted of ozone and impending violence," but minor paraphrase loops appear in storm descriptions, slightly dulling momentum without touching closure. Rhythm varies naturally, and metaphors like "waking god" are coherent without muddle. Information propulsion holds through the laugh's peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Original synthesis of prophetic laughter and shadow salvation transforms lighthouse tropes through specific wick transmutation and role shift, feeling inevitable in the closure. Risk in blending joy with peril heightens stakes organically. Premise avoids derivative templates with fresh emotional truth in accidental prophecy.</comment>
