<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kaelen's motivation is clear and rooted in empathy overriding duty, with interiority shown through contradictory impulses like recoiling shadows versus cradling the fragment; this intensifies to compel her high-stakes descent and action. The final renunciation of orders is earned with visible cost, as her conditioning is overridden on-page. Strength lies in embodied emotions during the mirror glimpses, revealing values under pressure. Minor weakness in stock phrasing like "deep-seated need" slightly abstracts the internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under the Causal lens, the plot follows clear because/therefore linkages from the sky fracture to investigation to preventive action, with orientation anchored in the first paragraph via Kaelen's watch in the lighthouse orchard. Closure is a Decisive Change as the valve is secured, reconfiguring the future with felt cost of breaking orders. Strength in the meaningful tightening when she chooses empathy over reporting, narrowing options. Weakness in slight predictability of the chain, but causality holds without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and purposeful, with the lighthouse orchard's frost-bitten apples and groaning ice floes constraining Kaelen's vigilance and charging the final image of settled possibilities. Sensory details like dust and lavender in the vintage store filter through her POV, mirroring internal tension. Environment evolves causally, as the descent from perch to city affects choices. It constrains the climax by providing mirrors for glimpses, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under the Causal lens, the dominant stake of preventing the ice catastrophe escalates through tightenings like the fragment's plea overriding orders, narrowing options with the cost of defying conditioning. Agency drives the deepening as Kaelen reconstitutes truth via mirrors, leading to the earned resolution. Strength in the moral calculus at the garrison, forcing a trade-off between duty and empathy. Cost is unmistakable in her urgent, myth-like burst into the corps.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of empathy mapping onto action emerges organically from Kaelen's choices and the fragment's diagnostic glimpses, resisting tidy morals by embracing the anomaly’s plea without false equivalence. Subtext in mirrors' fractured visions invites reflection on overlooked pressures. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer by repricing the future as mended, reweighting prior vigilance. Strength in thematic complexity tied to her internal arc, avoiding abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with a distinct perceptual signature in shadowy, intuitive filtering like recoiling from radiance. Prose texture is poetic and rhythmic, modulating with pressure in phrases like "weighted breath before reply." No dialogue, but voice coherence holds under stress without register drift. Meets 9+ test with rhythmic control and no elision issues, enhancing immersion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied syntax and rhythm accelerating in the run to the corps; information density shines in multi-job sentences like the orchard's creaking world. No loops or scaffold, and figurative language like "silhouette of woven darkness" is coherent without muddle. Strength in the final line's resonant image, meeting the 9+ test with zero artifacts. Minor overwriting in repeated "weighted breath" is purposeful and taught early.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Originality in synthesizing a diagnostic crystal fragment with a shadow-laced peacekeeper, transforming prophecy tropes through empathetic action in a frost-bitten orchard. Fresh inflection in reconstituting truth via mirrors feels inevitable, heightening stakes without gimmickry. Strength in the non-obvious angle on anomalies as pleas, committing to the premise. Minor hedging in predictable resolution slightly limits boldness.</comment>
