<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael's motivation for a silent revolution is clear and rooted in observed greed, intensifying through inventive actions like using the quill holder; interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure revealing values, though contradictory impulses are subtle rather than simultaneous. The meaningful endurance forecloses complacency with a felt conceptual cost in the ember's waiting flame. No stock phrasing mars the specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under a Causal lens, the plot advances through motivated linkages from blackout to diversion, with orientation anchored by the first sentence in the fort at twilight; closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration via Charged Poise, reweighting the fort's illumination with the conceptual cost of ignited change, evident in the knowing look and waiting ember. One meaningful tightening suffices, though ellipsis in the chamber could be tighter.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The luminous fort's quartz-veined stones and sun-stones vividly anchor atmosphere, with twilight deepening the urgency; the environment constrains choices, like using the half-painted sundial for navigation, and charges the final image of the glowing ember. Sensory details are selective and POV-biased, mirroring Kael's vigilance without excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of sparking revolution escalates causally from blackout to energy diversion, with one meaningful tightening narrowing options at the chamber door; agency drives the renunciation of status quo, foreclosing greed's path with legible conceptual cost in the waiting sparks, though physical risk feels understated. Coincidence complicates but does not resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of illumination as truth against greed emerges organically from events like the diverted spark powering presses, with subtext in the winking hush; the final image offers a resonant, non-literal repricing of fidelity without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers meaningfully in the ember's potential.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person close POV on Kael is stable, with distinct perceptual signature in inventive focus on tools like the quill holder; prose texture modulates rhythmically under pressure, teaching patterned elision early for legibility at closure. No dialogue present, so not evaluated; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density and propulsion, with vivid sentences like "the twilight was not a dimming but a deepening" advancing atmosphere without loops; zero artifacts, syntactic variety, and rhythmic control heighten the closure's ember image. No overwriting or scaffold dulls momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original synthesis of sentinel duty with light-as-revolution transforms tropes through specific ingenuity, like the sundial cipher; risk in subtle intrigue heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in the ember's cradle. No derivative echoes mar the fresh angle.</comment>
