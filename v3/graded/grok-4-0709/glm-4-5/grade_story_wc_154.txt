<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kaelen's motivation to graft meaning onto wounds is clear and intensifies through his careful tracing of the cast, revealing contradictory impulses of shrewd innocence and war-scarred patience; interiority is embodied in his reverent touches, though Lina remains more symbol than fully motivated character. Emotions layer contradictorily in his lotus-hearted ache, aligning actions with traits under pressure. The final whisper and placement of the coral earn a credible endurance with felt cost of ongoing loss.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, with density building through patterned reflections on war objects and loss, holding through closure; orientation anchors early in the atrium at twilight. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration via Charged Poise in the whisper and coral placement, reweighting hope with conceptual cost of transformed absence, though linkage feels more thematic than tightly causal. Persistent constraint of the child's sleep shapes the quiet tactics effectively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium at twilight is vividly sensory, with weeping plants mirroring internal grief and charging the final image; details filter through Kaelen's POV, subtly guiding his reflective choices. Environment evolves with fading light, constraining the decryption to a tactile, lived-in navigation. Recurring brain coral as micro-setting constrains meaning-making and elevates resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of helping Lina process loss signals early but escalates minimally under Accumulative lens via pattern of smudged notes and coral tracing, with one deepening in the whisper that reweights hope; cost is felt conceptually but lacks a sharper trade-off. Pressure coheres internally without a strong reversal, relying on accumulation rather than agency-driven tightening. Coincidence of the sleeping child complicates but does not resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of translating loss into meaning emerges organically from images like the brain coral and smudged cast, with subtext in silences and implications; final image offers resonant, non-literal repricing of absence without moralizing. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality through complex ambiguity in "he will come back." Insights earn from specific war fragments, integrating with the core concept.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Stable third-person close POV with perceptual signature biased toward war-tinged innocence, modulating rhythm with emotional intensity; sparse dialogue feels natural and subtextual, like Lina's earlier explanation. Prose texture is distinct in lyrical syntax, though some elision in reflections could be tighter taught. No head-hopping, but occasional register drift into abstract phrasing under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical with high density in images like labyrinthine coral grooves, advancing atmosphere; however, paraphrase loops (e.g., repeated unknotting fears and tracing patterns) and template cadence in reflective blocks dull momentum without payoff. Rhythm varies but figurative stacking in peak moments like the lotus-hearted ache muddles clarity slightly. Final line resolves with resonant image, but minor scaffold in redundant war references applies -0.4.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of translator's war skills applied to child's grief via coral and cast, transforming trope of healing objects through specific, non-obvious details like smudged dialect notes; originality in quiet risk of conceptual repricing heightens stakes subtly. Avoids stock sentiment with authentic vision, though premise echoes familiar loss narratives without bolder subversion.</comment>
