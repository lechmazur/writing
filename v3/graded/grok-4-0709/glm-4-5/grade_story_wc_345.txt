<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The ghost Elion's motivation to aid the colonists is clear and rooted in altruism, driving his chalked messages effectively, but interiority remains surface-level with stock traits like "quiet satisfaction" lacking embodied contradiction. Aris's "strangely trustworthy" nature enables key actions, yet her conviction feels label-only without on-page internal conflict or cost during the discovery. Relationships evolve from strangers to family, but this is summarized rather than shown through pressured choices, weakening character depth. The community's collective effort shows endurance with felt hope, but flaws like generic emotions cap nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural, with density building through repeated messages and pattern breaks like the watering bell discovery leading to renewal; closure is a Conceptual Repricing where history blossoms with conceptual cost of interconnected roots, legible in the final image. Orientation anchors early on Veridia's orchards, avoiding penalties. Causality holds loosely via guided events, but some ellipsis like generations-later thanks feels unmotivated without tighter linkage. The ending reweights the premise effectively, though cost is more oblique than visceral.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Setting vividly anchors the orchard planet with floating rock arches and violet sunsets, selectively integrated to mirror communal hope, as in arches becoming monuments etched with script. Sensory details like glowing nebula and mist from the watering bell enhance atmosphere without overload, reflecting POV bias toward renewal. Environment constrains choices, such as rediscovering the eastern fields, charging the final image of thriving orchards. Minor generic elements like "celestial doorways" slightly dilute specificity, but overall purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of saving the barren soil escalates through accumulative pressure of failing orchards and repeated messages, tightening to the watering bell's revival with a meaningful deepening that reweights community purpose. One reversal occurs when Aris discovers the device, narrowing options and forcing collective action with felt cost of prior uncertainty. However, pressure feels static in summaries of generations, and coincidence of the buried bell complicates without protagonist agency driving it fully. Stakes remain somewhat abstract, lacking visceral trade-offs under the lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of trust and collective renewal emerges organically from messages and the watering bell's miracle, resonating through images like brambled hope without direct statements. Subtext in the ghost's unseen guidance invites reflection on unseen bonds, with ambiguity in Elion's binding adding complexity. The final image offers a non-literal answer by repricing strangers-to-family with lingering interconnection. However, occasional platitudes like "strangers became family stronger than blood" border on tidy morals, slightly undercutting depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Third-person omniscient POV is stable, with perceptual signature biased toward ethereal observation, as in Elion watching "with quiet satisfaction," modulating rhythm to build texture. Voice has distinct texture in elegant script descriptions, but lacks rhythmic variation under pressure, with some uniform syntax. No dialogue present, so policy skips those bullets; elision in generational jumps is patterned but not fully taught. Minor register drift into abstract terms like "brambled hope" feels unmotivated for the focal ghost's perspective.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Prose advances atmosphere with vivid images like "floating rock arches pierced the sky," but paraphrase loops appear in repetitive descriptions of messages and hope, such as "brambled hope" echoed without progression, triggering -0.6 artifact penalty. Sentence rhythm varies somewhat, but template cadence in summaries like "The messages always contained..." dulls momentum. Information density is moderate, with some overwriting in figurative stacks like "nebula of respite shimmered," muddling clarity without payoff. Final line recharges motifs effectively, but loops in the closing paragraph cap propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The premise of a ghost orchestrating revival via chalked messages offers a fresh synthesis of sci-fi elements with communal themes, transforming trope of ghostly guidance through specific orchard revival. Ingenuity shines in the watering bell's symbiotic larvae, feeling inevitable from soil barrenness, with risk in generational scope heightening stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity in evolving from strangers to family avoids generics, but echoes familiar savior-ghost arcs without bold subversion. Overall, authentic vision coheres, earning +0.3 risk bonus.</comment>
