<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to uncover deleted files is clear and intensifies through her actions, rooted in attentiveness that reveals patterns like 731, compelling high-stakes choices like lying for access. Interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions in moments like feeling static electricity, showing contradictory impulses under pressure. However, some stock phrasing in emotional descriptions slightly flattens complexity, as in the whispered mantra that borders on cliché.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Under a Causal lens, the plot advances through because/therefore linkages, from noticing patterns to breaching access and downloading files, culminating in a Decisive Change as Elara disappears with evidence, foreclosing her old life with felt costs like alarms and lost freedom. Orientation anchors early with Elara's role in the archive. Minor redundancy in pattern descriptions creates slight drag, but closure lands with legible cost in the final disappearance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The digital archive setting is vividly evoked as a necropolis with sensory details like flickering static and glowing warnings, filtered through Elara's POV to mirror her growing unease. It constrains choices, such as navigating restricted sectors, and charges the final image of streaming deleted files. However, some metaphors like malevolent eyes feel slightly overwrought without deeper constraint on tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of uncovering the truth escalates causally through tightening pressure, from pattern recognition to breaching security with a 90-second window, narrowing options and raising costs like detection. One meaningful deepening occurs in the video fragments' revelation, forcing stance crystallization with alarms as immediate price. Coincidence in discoveries complicates without resolving, but stakes remain somewhat abstract until the climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of undeletable truth amid absence emerges organically from events like the recurring 731 and patch, reweighting human knowledge via Conceptual Repricing in the realization that files go "everywhere." Subtext in whispers and echoes invites reflection on deception without tidy morals. The final image of Elara disappearing resonates non-literally, answering the central question with ambiguity that lingers effectively.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and character-bound, with perceptual signature in Elara's detail-oriented noticing, like tracing numbers on the screen. Prose texture is distinct with rhythmic metaphors, but some elevated diction drifts from her corporate role, as in "digital necropolis." No dialogue present, so policy skips those bullets; minor elision in transitions is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose advances with high density in metaphors like constellations and symphonies, but overwriting in peak beats, such as stacked similes in the patch description, creates muddle without payoff, triggering -0.6. Rhythm varies, yet paraphrase loops appear in recurring number explanations, dulling momentum. Clarity holds at closure, but template cadence in investigative beats reduces propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes digital archives with cold cases and time-defying artifacts like the post-crash patch, offering a fresh angle on truth's persistence through Elara's bold risk in breaching security. Tropes of conspiracy are transformed via specific details like 731 coordinates. However, echoes of sci-fi mysteries feel familiar without fully non-obvious ingenuity.</comment>
