<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The copyist's motivation to liberate stories is clear and rooted in her traits as a meticulous yet rebellious figure, intensifying through her risky broadcasts with a felt cost of danger. Interiority is concrete, showing embodied emotion in her precise actions and quiet determination, though some reflections border on summary. The final endurance earns stasis by foreclosing safety for profound joy, revealing values with visible trade-offs. No secondary characters, so relationship bullets are ignored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density increasing through layered reflections and details, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing where dust's storytelling reweights narrative control with undeniable social cost. Orientation anchors who (copyist), where (alcove/apartment), and when (nightly, post-famine) by ~100 words, waiving any penalty. Structure fits two-shard default with one transition from alcove to home, and closure lands on-page via her satisfied walk, reconfiguring imagination's value. Minor redundancy in famine backstory slightly flattens causality but doesn't touch ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The ember alcove in mist-shrouded hillside constrains choices by providing hiding and responding to her voice, charging the final image as dust dances in moonlight. Sensory details are vivid and purposeful, with mist swirling in response to vibrations, reflecting her subversive calm through POV bias. Setting evolves causally, from glowing dial to fading transmitter, mirroring internal resolve without static repetition. Micro-setting of radio and dust integrates action, guiding her broadcast tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of defying narrative control signals early, with one meaningful deepening during the broadcast that narrows options by embedding stories in dust, forcing a trade-off of risk for hope. Under Accumulative lens, pressure coheres via pattern of preparation and release, crystallizing stance in the ending poise with felt danger cost. Agency is in her renunciation of safety, though coincidence of dust discovery complicates without resolving. Stakes feel visceral but could tighten more viscerally in peak moment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of narrative freedom emerges organically from her dust-animated stories challenging censorship, with subtext in elusive lyrics implying resistance without direct statement. Final image offers resonant, non-literal answer by reweighting silence's cost, inviting reflection on imagination's revival. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality through concrete risks, embracing complexity in her flawed yet heroic stance. No overt moralizing, though famine reflections slightly echo thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature biased toward musical and dusty details, modulating rhythm from whispery broadcast to reflective calm. Prose texture is distinct in poetic syntax and word choice, like "thistled calm," consistent under stress without head-hopping. No dialogue, so those bullets ignored; free indirect style clean, with purposeful compression in lyric descriptions taught early. Minor register drift in abstract reflections but paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, sentences advancing atmosphere and character through vivid images like ink-stained fingers and swirling mist, varying rhythm naturally. No significant loops or artifacts; figurative language is coherent and purposeful, enhancing momentum without muddle in peak broadcast beat. Strong verbs and specific nouns propel the accumulative flow, with final line recharging dust motif effectively. Read-aloud test passes with visual paragraph rhythm, though one paraphrase loop in famine description deducts slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Core premise of dust as undetectable storyteller synthesizes pirate radio with post-famine world in non-obvious way, feeling inevitable through her orchestral cover and accidental discovery. Risk-taking in experimental dust mechanics heightens stakes organically, transforming trope of rebellion via specific, grounded ingenuity. Emotional complexity avoids generics, with fresh inflection in nature's participation charging closure. No derivative echoes; authenticity coheres as singular vision.</comment>
