<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Cyrus's motivation to negotiate with his ghost is clear and rooted in eroded ambitions, intensifying through micro-choices like collecting story fragments, but interiority relies on poetic summaries rather than embodied contradictions under pressure. The final negotiation reveals a hierarchy of values with felt cost, earning stasis through forgiveness, though emotions feel performed in stock phrasing like "newfound determination." Relationships are minimal, with overheard fragments applying secondary pressure effectively for this scope.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds density through fragmented images and overheard stories, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where the carousel restarts with conceptual cost of merged identity. Orientation anchors early in the kinetic lagoon, avoiding penalties. Closure lands on-page with felt cost in the ghost's sorrowful acceptance, though some ellipsis feels unmotivated without stronger pattern teaching.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The surreal lagoon setting is vivid and purposeful, with iridescent debris and shimmering waters constraining Cyrus's search and enabling the word-bridge, charging the final image of aligned currents. Sensory details are selective, reflecting POV bias toward temporal magic, and the environment evolves causally from halted to turning carousel.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of negotiating with the ghost to reclaim past tightens meaningfully when Cyrus steps onto the story-bridge, deepening pressure under Accumulative lens via pattern of fragments coalescing. Cost is legible in the wheel's dissolution and merged spirit, but coincidence of the carousel restarting complicates without fully resolving agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of eroded ambitions and temporal regret emerges through concrete images like the camera wheel and ghost negotiation, offering resonant ambiguity in the final reconfiguration without moralizing. Subtext in overheard stories and the child's tune enriches complexity, though some direct statements like "profoundly chronologically confused" border on assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with perceptual signature biased toward mystical fragments, and prose texture is distinct in rhythmic, poetic syntax that modulates with intensity. Brief dialogue feels natural and subtextual, advancing the incantation method; patterned elision in time-warps is taught early and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical with high density in metaphorical layers, but paraphrase loops like repeated "fragments" and "shimmered" dull momentum in descriptive beats. Rhythm varies, yet overwriting in peak moments, such as the wheel's snap and dissolution, muddles clarity without payoff; no major artifacts touch closure, but template cadence in setup reduces propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The surreal premise of a kinetic lagoon and ghost negotiation offers fresh synthesis of time-travel regret, transformed through specific details like the camera wheel's temporal lens. Risk-taking in mosaic story fragments heightens stakes organically, feeling inevitable in the merging climax without gimmickry.</comment>
