<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to salvage purity drives her actions consistently, but interiority relies on summary rather than embodied contradictions, as in the shrine scene where emotions are declared without simultaneous impulses clashing on the page. The captain's spirit feels underdeveloped, serving more as a plot device than a crucible for her flaws. Strengths include her micro-choices in exposing truth gently, revealing values with some cost in the dream visitations.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Under a Causal lens, the structure links events through because/therefore progression from dive to discovery to exposure, but compression into summary shards creates ellipsis without always motivating cost. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with the captain's thanks and glowing globe, reweighting the premise with conceptual peace, though the cost feels oblique. Orientation anchors early in the dive, avoiding penalties.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The glacier shrine and ocean wreck provide vivid, sensory details that mirror Elara's isolation and chill, with the altar of frozen tears constraining her ritual choices. Specificity like "candle-lit shrine carved into glacier ice" charges the final image, evolving causally from the dive's chill to the warmed globe. Tone tensions support theme without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of exposing truth tightens once through dream analysis, narrowing options with ethical care, but escalation feels accumulative rather than causal, with pressure from spirits' patterns not forcing a stark trade-off. Agency in gentle dream visits crystallizes stance, yet cost is conceptual rather than visceral, legible but not unmistakable in the climax. Coincidence in discoveries complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of salvaging purity from wreckage emerges through Elara's actions and the globe's role, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in justice versus revenge. Subtext in dream fragments invites reflection, but the final image states resonance overtly, as in "the most powerful truths are those we discover ourselves." Emotional aftereffect arises from particulars like the captain's whisper, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and modest, with perceptual bias in Elara's ghost-sensing, though some sentences drift into omniscient summary like "the spirits tied to the object." Prose texture is distinct with rhythmic, poetic diction like "borrowed starlight," modulating under pressure without obscuring clarity. Minimal dialogue is natural, but voice convergence in the captain's whisper feels generic.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Prose advances with concise imagery like "frigid waters... borrowed starlight," but paraphrase loops appear in repetitive motifs such as "salvage something pure from the wreckage," dulling momentum in the exposure sequence. Information density is high in dive and shrine beats, yet figurative muddle in "windows of connection" mixes metaphors without payoff. Rhythm varies, but template cadence in summary passages like "night after night" triggers minor drag without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes wreck-diving with ghost whispering via a melted snow globe, transforming tropes through specific ethical weaving of truth, feeling inevitable in the dream exposures. Risk in gentle, non-accusatory revelation heightens stakes organically, avoiding gimmickry. Fresh inflection in the two-way connection reweights the ending without late rule changes.</comment>
