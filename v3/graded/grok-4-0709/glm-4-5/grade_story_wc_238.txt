<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Eloise's motivation rooted in guilt drives consistent choices, with embodied emotion in tears and trembling hands during the apology; interior conflict shows through her whispered mantra for courage, revealing contradictory impulses of fear and resolve. Beatrice's ethereal presence applies pressure, forcing Eloise's renunciation of full closure with felt cost in the incomplete music sheet. Strengths in micro-choices under pressure, like adjusting the rheostat while addressing the apparition, earn high marks, though some stock phrasing in reflections slightly limits depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under a Causal lens, the structure links ritual setup to apparition and apology via because/therefore causality, with orientation anchored early in the attic and orchard. Closure as Resonant Reconfiguration lands with Charged Poise in Beatrice's fading and the left-behind music, carrying felt cost in Eloise's tears and the imperfect reconciliation. One meaningful tightening in the energy arc bridges worlds effectively; minor slip in unmotivated scent release timing doesn't break causality but caps perfection.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, purposeful sensory details like amber resin scent and dust motes integrate into action, with the attic archive constraining choices by housing the piano for the duet memory. The orchard's impending destruction mirrors thematic hush, charging the final image as tremors signal the end. Micro-setting of the perfume bottle and piano as tools constrain the ritual, elevating specificity; no white-room issues, with POV-filtered details reflecting Eloise's priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of delivering the overdue apology signals early and tightens causally through the ritual's electromagnetic field, narrowing options to a temporary bridge with visible emotional cost in tears and merged fingers. One meaningful deepening in Beatrice's forgiveness reweights stakes, forcing Eloise's endurance of imperfection. Agency in Eloise's actions drives escalation under Causal lens; coincidence of orchard tremors complicates without resolving, but stakes remain somewhat abstract beyond personal regret.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of imperfect miracles emerges organically from the ritual's partial success and incomplete composition, with subtext in metaphors like "time tiptoes on broken glass" inviting reflection on regret and healing. Final image of the sealed bottle and music sheet offers resonant, non-literal reconfiguration without moralizing. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality through gritty ethereal tone; minor thematic echo in Beatrice's scissors metaphor slightly dilutes subtlety.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and modest, with perceptual signature in Eloise's biased noticing of scents and dust motes tied to memories. Distinct voice texture through rhythmic, metaphor-infused prose modulates with intensity, like shortened sentences during the arc of energy. Dialogue carries subtext and advances plot, with Beatrice's layered amusement distinguishing her idiom; no head-hopping or register mismatch.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose density advances atmosphere and character via multi-job sentences, like the perfume's "jasmine and regret" blending sensory and thematic work. Rhythm varies naturally, with syntactic variety supporting momentum, though occasional figurative muddle in stacked metaphors like "melodies slept dormant in their paper coffins" risks overwriting in setup. No major loops or artifacts obscure closure; final line resolves with resonant image, but minor template cadence in ritual description deducts slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of gossip-column exorcism with supernatural journalism transforms tropes through specific details like induced currents and perfume as key, feeling inevitable in the apology's charged poise. Risk-taking in ethereal grit tone heightens stakes without gimmickry, with fresh inflection in the incomplete music reprising their duet. No derivative echoes; authenticity coheres in bold commitment to imperfect miracles premise.</comment>
