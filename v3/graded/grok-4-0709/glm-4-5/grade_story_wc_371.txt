<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Eliza's motivation as a "creeping normality noticer" is clear and intensifies through her reflections, leading to earned absolution with felt cost in her guilt; interiority is concrete and embodied, showing contradictory impulses in her patient uncovering versus past inaction. However, some label-speak like "heuristically gentle" feels diagnostic rather than dramatized under pressure. The final renunciation of bread reveals her values with visible emotional trade-off.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned reflections and images, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing where the letter's revelation reweights Eliza's guilt with undeniable conceptual cost; orientation anchors early in the abandoned neighborhoods. Closure lands on-page with the absolution and bread-leaving, foreclosing her isolation via shared forgiveness. Minor ellipsis in bakery disappearance feels motivated but could tighten causality slightly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The overgrown palace courtyard and secret tea house are vividly specific, with wild sages and mint constraining Eliza's gentle approach and charging the final image of thriving gardens; sensory details like rain on the tin roof and herb scents integrate into action, mirroring her internal renewal. Micro-setting of the tea house pressures her revelation beat effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of uncovering truth for personal absolution tightens through the letter-reading, deepening via a cadence shift that forces stance crystallization with felt guilt-cost; under Accumulative lens, pressure accumulates texturally but lacks a sharper on-page reversal. Agency in reading aloud and leaving bread forecloses inaction with visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of finding sacred in ordinary emerges organically through guerrilla gardening and bread motifs, culminating in resonant absolution without moralizing; subtext in the letters and vanished bakers invites ambiguity about protection versus loss. Final image of thriving garden reweights the premise non-literally, embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with perceptual bias toward subtle changes, and prose texture reflects Eliza's gentle heuristic via rhythmic, accumulative sentences; whispered dialogue carries subtext effectively. Minor register drift in abstract terms like "tenuous absolution" jars slightly against the embodied voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Prose has good density with vivid images like "wild sages and mint pushing through cracked flagstones," but artifacts include a name inconsistency ("Elima" for Eliza) obscuring clarity and paraphrase loops in reflection blocks that dull momentum without payoff. Syntax varies, but some template cadence in descriptive runs slows propulsion; final line recharges motifs well despite slips.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of guerrilla gardening and creeping normality as tools for absolution transforms disappearance trope through specific emotional calculus; risk in quiet, reflective structure heightens stakes organically. Core premise feels inevitable via Eliza's particular sensitivity, avoiding stock echoes.</comment>
