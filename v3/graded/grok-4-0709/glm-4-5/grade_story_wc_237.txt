<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to transform scars is clear and rooted in her affliction and memories, with embodied emotions like trembling fingers and prickling skin showing contradictory impulses under stress. The internal conflict peaks effectively when panic triggers crystallization, halted by whispering grandmother's words, earning the final endurance with visible cost. Some stock phrasing in interiority, like "racing thoughts," slightly dilutes specificity, but micro-choices reveal values without therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds density through ritual and memory layers, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration where scars become wisdom with conceptual cost in the final hushed image amid the storm. Orientation anchors early in the floating platform and misty void, with no disorientation debt. Closure lands on-page with the quill shedding as a pattern break, reweighting prior pain; one meaningful deepening suffices at this length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The floating rock platform in the misty void is vividly specific, with moss, steaming tea, and storm vibrations constraining Elara's timing and charging the final image of saturated hush against lashing winds. Sensory details like dew smells and soil memories integrate through POV bias, mirroring internal calm. Environment pressures choices, such as the tilt triggering panic, meeting the 9+ test by shaping the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of completing the rune before storm or crystallization tightens meaningfully when the platform tilts, forcing agency in halting the affliction with cost of near-failure. Under Accumulative lens, pressure accumulates via memories and ritual, reweighting options at the end; cost is felt in the prickling fingers. No multiple reversals needed, but the deepening is driven by protagonist choice, though coincidence of tilt slightly complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of transforming pain into protective wisdom emerges organically from ritual actions and scar-channeling, with subtext in superstitions and quill shedding implying earned resilience. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer by repricing scars as stories, avoiding moralizing. Some ambiguity lingers purposefully, but emotional aftereffect feels honest without sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV on Elara remains stable and modest, with perceptual signature in selective noticing of ink shimmer and dew smells biased by her scholar's focus. Voice texture is distinct and rhythmic, modulating with stress through concise syntax; no dialogue present. Purposeful compression in memory fragments is taught early and pays off at closure without elision issues, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with vivid images like "vapors coiling like miniature dragons," varying rhythm naturally without loops or scaffold, though some metaphors border on overwriting in peak beats. Clarity holds with strong verbs and specific details advancing atmosphere; final line recharges motifs effectively. Minor template cadence in ritual descriptions deducts slightly, but no artifacts touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The premise of a rune scholar crystallizing under stress while transforming scars via superstitions offers fresh synthesis in a magical void setting, with ingenuity in the quill shedding as a scholar's sign. Risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens stakes organically without gimmickry. Tropes like grandmother's wisdom are transformed through specific garden shed details, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
