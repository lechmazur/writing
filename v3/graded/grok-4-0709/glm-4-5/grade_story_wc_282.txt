<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maya's motivation to voice the unknown is clear and intensifies through her descent and discovery, rooted in her unique sensitivity; interiority is concrete via tingling fingers and emotional readings, with embodied emotions like whispering to the fossil. However, internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses, relying on summary rather than dramatized tension. The final renunciation of ignorance earns stasis with felt responsibility, but flaws feel somewhat balanced without complicating choices deeply.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, emotional imprints build density toward resonant reconfiguration in the fossil's visions and Maya's realization, with conceptual repricing of hibernation knowledge carrying undeniable social cost. Orientation anchors early with Maya at the cliff after hibernation. Closure lands on-page as Charged Poise with the fossil in her pouch, reweighting her purpose; one meaningful deepening suffices, but causality feels elliptical in the fossil's sudden response.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The coastal cave network is vividly sensory with cool stone walls and ancient imprints, filtered through Maya's POV bias; it constrains choices by depth and darkness, charging the final climb with purpose. Micro-setting like the altar and floating fossil evolves causally, mirroring her internal awakening. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly during descent; environment pressures discovery without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of understanding hibernation escalates texturally through deepening emotional signatures, tightening to the fossil's visions that narrow ignorance; one meaningful deepening forces stance crystallization with felt cost of responsibility. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, but coincidence of the fossil waiting for her complicates without fully resolving via agency. Moral calculus between rebuilding and exploring sharpens choice, yet stakes remain somewhat abstract until the end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of bridging unknown pasts emerges organically from emotional mapping and the transitional fossil, inviting reflection on awakening without tidy morals; subtext in the fossil's heat signatures implies guardianship complexity. Final image of the fossil in her pouch offers resonant, non-literal answer to voicing the unknown, reweighting premise with conceptual cost. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality through specific visions, but some direct statements like "she finally understood" border on assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in sensory details like tingling fingers and thermal colors, modulating rhythm under pressure in the cave. Voice texture is distinct in rhythmic, introspective prose fitting Maya's sensitivity; brief dialogue like whispering feels natural and subtextual. No head-hopping or register mismatch; purposeful compression in visions pays off at closure without obscurity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere through vivid lines like "rope creaking with each movement"; rhythm varies naturally, but some paraphrase loops in emotional descriptions, such as repeating imprint age, dull momentum slightly. No major artifacts obscure closure, though figurative elements like "visions flooded her mind" feel stock in peak beat. Clarity and propulsion hold, with strong verbs driving action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-hibernation sensory mapping with a factually mystical fossil transforms exploration tropes through specific emotional heat signatures and guardianship purpose. Emotional specificity in visions avoids generics, but premise echoes familiar discovery arcs without bold risk-taking. Turns feel earned from her skills, heightening stakes organically.</comment>
