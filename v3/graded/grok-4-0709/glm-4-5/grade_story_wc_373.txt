<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Eliza's motivation to capture the sound of trust breaking is clear and rooted in her inheritance, intensifying through calculated actions that reveal contradictory impulses under pressure, such as her false starts building to the climax. Interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions like gripping the fob showing stress degradation. The final endurance forecloses safer paths with felt relational cost in the broken truce. Voice distinction shines in her idiosyncratic pursuit, avoiding stereotypes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under a causal lens, the plot links actions with because/therefore causality, from false starts to the decisive betrayal note that triggers closure. Orientation anchors who, where, and when by the first paragraph, with no disorientation debt. Closure lands as a Decisive Change with the fob capturing the sound, carrying conceptual cost in the shattered trust. One meaningful tightening suffices, with no redundant moves.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The pirate market under the rotting pier is vividly anchored early with sensory details like creaking wood and damp air, filtered through Eliza's POV to reflect urgency and familiarity. Setting constrains choices, such as positioning near the door for the climax, charging the final image as she emerges at sunrise. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly, with environment evolving causally from hush to broken truce.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of capturing the sound signals early and tightens through false starts that narrow options, forcing a high-stakes direct approach to Malachi. Escalation under causal lens builds via motivated choices, with one reversal in the lieutenant's hardening face crystallizing stance. Cost is felt in the immediate violence risk, though coincidence in timing complicates without resolving. Agency drives the peak, but internal-external interweave is optional and lightly present.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of pursuing intangible betrayal emerges organically from Eliza's actions and the fob's role, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in her "stranger" motivation. Subtext in silences and implications, like the "silence that screams," invites reflection without confusion. Final image offers resonant repricing of trust's fragility, tied to her arc, though epiphanies are understated and earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with controlled distance, perceptual signature biased toward shadows and sounds fitting Eliza's world. Voice texture in rhythmic prose modulates with intensity, teaching purposeful compression in hushed negotiations. Dialogue is natural, subtext-driven, and advances plot, with distinct idioms like casual whispers pursuing goals. No head-hopping or elision issues, with stress compressing diction effectively.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose maintains high density with varied rhythm and syntax, advancing atmosphere through selective images like "silence that screams" without loops or scaffold. Clarity is strong, with strong verbs and specific details propelling beats, though one mixed metaphor in "time slipping like damp air" slightly muddles without harming closure. No artifacts touch the final image, and paragraph structure varies purposefully for momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of moonshine legacy with sound-capturing fob transforms smuggling tropes through Eliza's non-profit motivation, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Fresh angle on trust via auditory capture heightens stakes organically, with bold risk in the abstract goal cohering without gimmickry. No derivative echoes, and specificity in false starts personalizes the arc.</comment>
