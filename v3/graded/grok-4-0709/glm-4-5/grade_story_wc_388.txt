<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Maya's motivation to debunk conspiracies evolves credibly into protecting truth, rooted in her observant trait, but interiority relies on summary labels like "determination unwavering" rather than embodied contradictions; the final choice feels earned yet lacks a visible micro-choice under peak stress, as in the dust storm moment where hope emerges without layered irrationality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Under a Causal lens, the structure progresses logically from discovery to revelation and decision, with orientation anchored early in the orchard; closure lands as a Charged Poise with conceptual cost of corporate threat, but exposition-heavy letters summarize causality rather than dramatizing key linkages, weakening the because/therefore chain at the revelation beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The wasteland orchard's vivid, sensory details—like glowing soil and leaning trees—constrain Maya's investigation and charge the final image of the pulsing diamond amid the storm; specificity mirrors her internal shift without overt symbolism, though occupational depth is absent as unneeded for this scope.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of uncovering truth escalates causally through the letter reassembly, tightening to a meaningful deepening at the revelation, with legible cost of potential liquidation; however, pressure feels declarative rather than viscerally narrowing options, as the storm complicates but doesn't force a trade-off in the climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of truth excavating lies emerges organically from Maya's arc and the stillpoint's repricing, culminating in a resonant final image of hope amid deception without moralizing; subtext in the diamond's warmth invites ambiguity, though some direct statements like "humanity's salvation or destruction" border on abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and modest, with perceptual bias in Maya's observations like tracing bark; prose texture is distinct in rhythmic descriptions, but occasional filter verbs like "she felt drawn" dull immediacy without voice motivation, and no dialogue to assess.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is evocative with high density in images like "gnarled bark" and "shimmering leaves," but repetitive stems (e.g., "Maya [action]" openings) and paraphrase loops around her observance create minor momentum drag; no major artifacts obscure closure, though elevated diction like "conduit for the stillpoint's energy" feels slightly register-drifted.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes post-apocalyptic sci-fi with dimensional stillpoints in a fresh way, transforming cursed-object tropes through Maya's debunker lens; ingenuity shines in the letter reassembly enabling revelation, but echoes familiar wasteland motifs without bolder risk-taking to heighten stakes uniquely.</comment>
