<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Silas's motivation to save the garden is clear and rooted in his attachment to his past life, intensifying through his synesthetic perceptions and memories that compel his sacrificial song; interiority is concrete with embodied emotions like tasting thunder or petals like laughter, showing contradictory impulses of nostalgia and resolve. However, some traits feel stereotypical for a ghost tenor, slightly reducing individuality, though micro-choices under pressure, such as pushing his voice higher while flickering, reveal a hierarchy of values with felt cost at the climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under a Causal lens, the structure builds through motivated actions from entering the maze to singing echoes that repair the timeline, with clear because/therefore linkages; closure is a Decisive Change as Silas dissolves after restoring the garden, with visible cost in his flickering form and final rest. Orientation anchors who (Silas), where (hedge maze/orchard), and when (after closing, moonlit) by the first sentence, serving the narrative without debt. A minor slip in redundant memory echoes doesn't break causality at the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The mystic orchard and hedge maze are vividly anchored with synesthetic details like colors singing hope or scents painting memories, filtered through Silas's POV bias; the setting constrains choices by providing the stone stage and temporal ribbons, charging the final image as the garden glows renewed. Sensory selection reflects urgency, narrowing to notes as golden threads during the climax, and details evolve causally with the healing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of saving the fractured timeline from despair is signaled early and tightens meaningfully as Silas pours his essence into the song, narrowing options with his flickering form as cost; under Causal lens, pressure escalates via because/therefore links from singing to intertwining ribbons, forcing stance crystallization at dawn. Agency is in his decision to perform, with one reversal as echoes grow stronger, but coincidence of the coin's magic slightly complicates without fully resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of enduring hope amid loss emerges organically from Silas's song weaving memories and possibilities, with subtext in the tarot coin's shifting images and nostalgic echoes; the final image of the dissolving ghost and renewed garden offers a resonant, non-literal reconfiguration without moralizing. Emotional aftereffect is concrete through his sacrificial peace, embracing complexity in his lingering attachment.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, with perceptual signature in synesthetic biases like tasting thunder or hearing colors; prose texture is distinct and poetic, modulating rhythm with emotional intensity in the song's buildup. No dialogue present, so policy skips those bullets; however, some elision in timeline jumps feels untaught, slightly obscuring closure legibility under Causal lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose has rhythmic variety and high density in synesthetic images, but paraphrase loops like repeated nostalgia washes and memory scents create minor scaffold in mid-beats; figurative language is dense without muddle, yet template cadence in "He saw... He remembered..." runs briefly dull propulsion. Clarity holds at closure with the glowing garden image, avoiding major artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The premise of a synesthetic ghost repairing a timeline via operatic echoes and a tarot coin offers fresh synthesis on familiar ghost tropes, transformed through specific sensory details and nostalgic tone; risk-taking in lyric, accumulative memories heightens stakes organically, feeling inevitable at the dissolving end without gimmickry.</comment>
