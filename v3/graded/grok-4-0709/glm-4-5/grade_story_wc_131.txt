<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dweller's motivation to preserve and reveal knowledge is clear and rooted in backstory, intensifying through the tape discovery to compel a subtle intervention; interiority is concrete via sense memories, but emotions feel summarized rather than embodied in contradictory impulses during the peak moment of recognition. Flaws complicate choices authentically, with the hidden life as a persistent cost, yet the final renunciation lacks a sharper visible trade-off. The solitary POV limits relationship crucibles, but micro-choices under isolation reveal values effectively.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through reflective shards to a Charged Poise closure where the dweller resolves indirect intervention, reconfiguring their role with the conceptual cost of perpetual hiddenness legible in the final image. Orientation anchors who (dweller), where (library crawl spaces), and when (pre-dawn post-outage) by the first paragraph, avoiding penalties. Causality holds in memory-triggered discovery, but some ellipsis feels unmotivated, slightly softening the pattern break at the tape find.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The shadowed library at dawn is vividly rendered with purposeful sensory details like cool pipes and sapphire hush, filtered through the dweller's familiarity to mirror internal solitude; the micro-setting of pipe chases constrains movement and enables discovery, charging the final caching moment. Tone tensions the hush with humming energy, supporting theme without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly, evolving causally from crawl space to pipe chases.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the dominant stake of becoming visible to those in need deepens through the tape's historical value, culminating in a cadence shift toward intervention with the cost of anonymity; however, pressure remains low-key without a sharp tightening that narrows options, as the discovery complicates but doesn't force a high-stakes trade-off. Agency is in renunciation, but coincidence of finding the tape resolves more than it escalates.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of hidden knowledge emerging when needed arises organically from the dweller's routine and the tape's reprise, inviting reflection on visibility without tidy morals; subtext in images like the warm fragment reweights solitude's cost in the final bridge to the future. Emotional aftereffect is honest but oblique, avoiding sentimentality yet lacking sharper ambiguity. The core concept integrates via sense memory, but epiphanies feel slightly asserted rather than fully earned through struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature biased toward tactile memories and library infrastructure, modulating rhythm from methodical grace to humming energy under discovery; no dialogue present, so policy skips those bullets. Purposeful compression in reflective blocks anchors in present cues like the metallic touch, but some diction drifts into abstract register ("sapphire hush") without full POV motivation. Elision of direct emergence pays off in closure without confusion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose advances atmosphere with vivid images like "delicate as a butterfly wing," but paraphrase loops (e.g., repeating "kindly methodical" and motivation phrasing) create redundancy, deducting for momentum drag without touching closure. Information density is high in sensory details, yet template cadence in routine descriptions (e.g., trailing fingers, sense memory) triggers minor artifact penalty. Rhythm varies, but overwriting in peak beats muddles propulsion slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The premise of a laid-off preservationist dwelling in library walls to cache forgotten knowledge offers fresh synthesis, transforming solitude tropes through specific archival details like the 1950s tape; risk in indirect intervention heightens stakes organically. Originality shines in the non-obvious angle on visibility, feeling inevitable via sense memory, without close echoes of familiar scenes.</comment>
