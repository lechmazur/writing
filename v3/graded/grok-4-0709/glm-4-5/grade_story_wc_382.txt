<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Clara's motivation to understand buildings is clear and intensifies through sessions, rooted in her intuitive connection, but interiority relies on summary rather than embodied contradictions, as in her hesitation during the interrogation that lacks simultaneous impulses. Mr. Abernathy's traits, like patient nimbleness, enable relational pressure but feel label-like without deep flaws complicating choices. The final recognition of heritage earns a credible endurance with emotional cost, yet lacks micro-choices revealing value hierarchies under stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the story builds through patterned sessions and symbolic accrual to a Conceptual Repricing closure where Clara gains the seal and heritage fluency, reweighting her world with emotional cost legible in the dawn descent. Orientation anchors early in the neighbor introduction, with no disorientation debt. Causality holds via motivated ellipses, like the spark of recognition, though the family reveal feels slightly pat without a tighter pattern break earlier.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The rooftop garden during the meteor shower constrains and charges the closure by illuminating symbols and facilitating revelation, with sensory details like streaking meteors mirroring ephemeral words. Settings evolve consistently, from cluttered study to glittering skyline, integrated into action without stalling. However, some details, like potted plants, remain postcard-like without sharper POV bias under pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of uncovering building language and heritage tightens once via the rooftop interrogation, deepening knowledge and forcing stance crystallization under Accumulative lens, with conceptual cost in protected truths. Pressure coheres but lacks a visible trade-off, as the lies enable without on-page complication. Coincidence of relatedness complicates without resolving, fitting the lens, yet agency feels more receptive than driving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of inherited secrets and architectural language emerges organically from sessions and symbols, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in protected truths, culminating in a resonant final image of buildings as old friends. Subtext in gestures like the spark of recognition enriches without direct statement. However, the core concept of lies echoes thematically but doesn't fully interweave with internal arc complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV stays stable and modest, with perceptual bias in Clara's building observations, but dialogue occasionally flattens into exposition, as in Mr. Abernathy's reveal of grandmother's role. Voice has rhythmic control, modulating with meteoric intensity, yet some filter verbs dull immediacy in reflective blocks. No head-hopping or unwarranted certainty, with subtext in indirect lines like "Why the agreed upon lies?"</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is concise with momentum, varying rhythm in meteor descriptions, but occasional paraphrase loops, like repeating familiarity motifs, reduce density without payoff. Information advances through integrated details, like the seal's carvings, with clean grammar and strong verbs. No major artifacts obscure closure, though some stock phrasing in emotions, such as "voice thick with emotion," trends generic.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The premise of buildings' language tied to blood heritage offers fresh synthesis, transforming trope of old structures via specific symbols and lies, with risk in quiet revelation heightening emotional stakes. Details feel particular, like the desk seal's role, avoiding generics. However, the distant relatives twist echoes familiar plots without bolder subversion.</comment>
