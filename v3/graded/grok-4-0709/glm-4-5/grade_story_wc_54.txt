<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Maya's motivation to resurrect the terminal for hope is clear and rooted in her creative traits, compelling her actions like rerouting circuits; interiority is concrete in moments like pocketing the sextant with racing thoughts, but emotions lean toward labels like "stoic wonder" without deep embodiment or contradictory impulses under pressure. No second character, so relationship dynamics are irrelevant. The final realization feels earned by her efforts, though flaws complicate choices minimally with little visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Under a Causal lens, the structure follows clear because/therefore linkages from exploration to discovery to resurrection, with orientation anchored early in the abandoned spaceport; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration via Charged Poise as Maya realizes the terminal's potential for hope, with conceptual cost in the weight of past journeys, but the ending lacks a sharper on-page cost proof in the final image. One meaningful tightening occurs in throwing the switch, narrowing options to success or failure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport is vividly anchored with dusty consoles and echoing halls, filtered through Maya's engineering bias; sensory details like flickering lights and gleaming brass integrate into action, constraining her choices in the power center, and the setting charges the final image by resurrecting lights like awakening stars. No occupational depth required beyond her intern role.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of resurrecting hope through the terminal signals early and tightens once via the power rerouting under Causal lens pressure, forcing a trade-off in hours of effort; agency is in her decision to throw the switch, with legible cost in isolation and labor, but escalation feels static without a deeper reversal or compounded complication. Coincidence of finding the sextant complicates but doesn't resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of navigating hope amid abandonment emerges organically from events like discovering the sextant and illuminating the terminal, with subtext in the maze of intentions; the final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer by repricing the spaceport as a tool for sustainable equations, avoiding moralizing, but ambiguity is mild without strong counter-readings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in Maya's engineering focus on consoles and circuits; prose texture is distinct in rhythmic descriptions like "lights began to flicker... like stars awakening," modulating with intensity, but some filter verbs like "she noticed" dull immediacy slightly. No dialogue present, so those bullets are ignored.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose is concise with momentum, advancing through vivid images like "sleeping giants" for transformers, but paraphrase loops appear in repetitive phrasing around "maze of intentions" and "redirected flows," dulling propulsion; syntactic variety is good, yet stock metaphors like "mind racing" and minor scaffold in reflective blocks reduce density without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The premise of resurrecting an abandoned spaceport for hope offers a fresh synthesis of sci-fi decay and engineering optimism, transformed through Maya's specific actions like using the sextant inscriptions; risk in the quiet, conceptual closure heightens stakes organically, but echoes familiar discovery tropes without bold subversion.</comment>
