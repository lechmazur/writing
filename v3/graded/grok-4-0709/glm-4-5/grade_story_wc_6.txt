<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maya's motivation as the arsonist's daughter turned firefighter is clear and intensifies through her actions to protect the grafts, rooted in unyielding compassion and proving scars can sing; interiority is concrete with embodied contradictions, like touching the coin while shielding plants amid embers. However, some emotional progression feels slightly tidy, lacking deeper irrationality under stress. The final affirmation of her legacy shows credible endurance with felt cost from her father's past.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through motif recurrence like the coin and sand, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration in the dawn garden scene where grafts survive, reweighting her legacy with conceptual cost. Orientation anchors early with Maya in smoke-choked streets, but some reflective blocks exceed BRR allowance without always tilting present stance via micro-choices. Closure lands on-page with the sun mirroring renewal, though causality feels more textural than tight linkage.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon and dunes provide vivid, purposeful sensory detail that mirrors Maya's internal shifts, constraining choices like descending for peace amid fire; recurring elements like black sand integrate into action, charging the final image of renewal. Atmosphere evolves with cloud migration affecting light and fire, supporting tone without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography tracks coherently from streets to garden to lagoon.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of transforming legacy through compassion escalates texturally via advancing flames and embers landing, with one meaningful deepening when Maya shields grafts, narrowing options and forcing endurance with felt cost. However, pressure feels somewhat static, resolved by external fire control rather than protagonist-driven reversal under the lens. Coincidence of weather complicates but doesn't fully resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of transformation from destruction emerges organically through grafts and scars singing, with subtext in motifs like the coin and sand reweighting meaning at closure without direct statements. The final image of the lagoon mirroring the sun offers a resonant, non-literal answer to legacy's paradox. Emotional aftereffect lingers through complexity, avoiding tidy morals.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable with perceptual bias in Maya's graceful alertness, modulating voice with stress like murmuring about wind shifts; prose texture is distinct in rhythmic, motif-laden syntax. Minimal dialogue is natural, but some elision in reflections is taught via patterns and pays off at closure. No head-hopping, though occasional filter verbs dull immediacy slightly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density in images like embers landing, but paraphrase loops appear in repetitive affirmations of "scars can sing," dulling momentum in reflective beats. Rhythm varies, yet some sentences overuse similar stems, like starting with Maya's actions. No major artifacts obscure closure, but overwriting in motif echoes touches the final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The premise of an arsonist's daughter as firefighter offers a fresh paradox, transformed through specific motifs like grafting with black sand, feeling organic and inevitable in hindsight. Emotional specificity in compassion amid fire heightens stakes without gimmickry. However, some elements echo familiar redemption arcs without bolder risk-taking.</comment>
