<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maya's motivation to help Dr. Thorne is clear and rooted in her honest traits contrasting her father's deception, intensifying to compel the high-stakes forgery; interiority is concrete with embodied emotions like steady hands despite racing heart, showing contradictory impulses in the breach scene. However, some emotional progression feels slightly tidy, with hypocrisy underexplored in peak moments. The final renunciation of abuse for good is earned with visible cost of risking her job.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Under a Causal lens, the plot advances through because/therefore linkages from observation to breach and forgery, with orientation anchored early in the prep room; closure is a Decisive Change as Maya forges documents, reconfiguring her path with felt cost of breaching trust, evident in the safe-opening tremble. One meaningful tightening suffices at this length, though the ending explain-everything ties threads mechanically without deeper ellipsis.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The funeral home prep room is vividly anchored with sensory details like refrigeration hum and chemical scents, filtered through Maya's POV to mirror her philosophy of transitions; it constrains choices by providing blind spots and tools, charging the final image of the ink pot's reflection with redemption. Sensory selection reflects urgency, evolving causally without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><grade>Under Causal lens, the dominant stake of saving Thorne versus personal risk escalates through one meaningful tightening at the 2:17 AM breach, narrowing options with legible cost like trembling fingers and job loss; agency drives the forgery as a stance crystallization. Coincidence in guard timing complicates but does not resolve, though stakes occasionally feel abstract rather than viscerally tested in the climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of redeeming deception for justice emerges organically from Maya's actions and the ink pot motif, culminating in a resonant final image that reweights her father's legacy without stated moral; subtext in gestures like tracing the pot invites reflection on ambiguity. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality through complexity, though some direct statements like "mathematics of a fair trade" border on thematic echo in the ending.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV on Maya is stable with perceptual signature biased toward transitional philosophy, modulating rhythm under pressure like swift movement in corridors; no dialogue present, so policy skips those bullets. Prose texture is distinct in syntax and diction, with purposeful compression in reflections tilting present stance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere through vivid images like swirling ink patterns, but minor paraphrase loops appear in reflective blocks, such as repeating "power" and "deception" concepts adjacently without added pressure. Rhythm varies naturally, though some figurative language in the ink pot description muddles slightly with "liquid thoughts." No major artifacts touch closure, maintaining propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes forgery with asylum in a funeral home for a fresh angle on redemption, transforming tropes through specific details like the ink pot's attribute; risk-taking in moral ambiguity heightens stakes organically. However, the core frame echoes familiar honest-thief arcs without fully non-obvious inflection at closure.</comment>
