<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Arion's motivation to discover resilience is clear and rooted in his pilot traits, intensifying to compel his navigation choices during inversion, but interiority relies on stock phrasing like "filled with both dread and wonder" without embodied contradictions in scene. The arrow tip revelation shows a meaningful change earned by causality, yet flaws like unearned epiphanies in the echoes weaken the emotional progression. No second character, so relationship bullets ignored; overall, competence balances struggle but lacks genuine blind spots complicating the closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Under Causal lens, the plot links preparation to inversion navigation and discovery via because/therefore causality, with orientation anchored early in the orchard planet setting by ~120 words. Closure lands as a Decisive Change with Conceptual Repricing when Arion understands the arrow tip's purpose, imprinting wisdom with felt cost of the inversion's chaos, though the cost is more conceptual than visceral. One meaningful tightening suffices at this length, but the echoes' exposition slightly softens the earned irony at the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The orchard planet with floating arches and inverting gravity is vividly specific, constraining Arion's navigation choices and charging the final reset image as trees settle. Sensory details like twisting rivers and singing rocks integrate into action, reflecting POV urgency, but some repetition of shadows and sparkle borders on static. Environment evolves causally with the inversion, pressuring tactics without anachronisms.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of discovering resilience signals early and tightens once through the narrow arch passage under Causal lens, narrowing options with inversion pressures, but coincidence in the glowing arrow tip complicates without fully resolving. Agency via navigation forecloses safer paths with visible risk cost, yet stakes feel somewhat abstract until the echoes. One deepening suffices, but lacks a sharper moral calculus at peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme of adaptation and resilience emerges from inversion events and the arrow tip's growth acceleration, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer as Arion smiles knowing Verdantis will thrive, avoiding tidy morals. Subtext in the glowing necklace and echoes invites reflection on survival without confusion, but the final whispers verge on explicit thematic statement. Emotional aftereffect is concrete yet borders on sentimentality in the transformative knowledge.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with controlled focalization, perceptual signature biased toward pilot skills like scanning horizons, but elision of deeper stress degradation feels unmotivated. Prose texture in rhythm modulates with inversion chaos, though some syntactic monotony in action sequences dulls peaks. No dialogue, so those bullets ignored; overall voice coherent but lacks rhythmic distinction under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Prose has momentum with varying rhythm, but paraphrase loops like repeated "whirling silence" and template cadence in navigation beats (e.g., "steered his ship... navigated beneath it") obscure propulsion, deducting -0.6 for artifacts not touching closure. Information density is functional, with strong verbs like "tore free" advancing atmosphere, yet overwriting in crystal sparkles muddles peak beats without payoff. Clarity is maintained, but final line resolves mechanically without recharging motifs sharply.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The premise of gravity inversion on an orchard planet offers a fresh angle on survival tropes, transformed through specific navigation by water flow and the arrow tip's evolving role, feeling organic. Emotional complexity in dread-wonder mix adds ingenuity, with the echoes' visions synthesizing ideas memorably, but echoes famous sci-fi discovery scenes without full transformation. Risk in conceptual closure heightens stakes without gimmickry, earning +0.3.</comment>
