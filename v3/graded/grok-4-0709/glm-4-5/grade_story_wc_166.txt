<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The motivation to preserve memories against the nostalgia ban is clear and intensifies through Lira's dance and transformation, culminating in an earned renunciation of mobility for cosmic vision with visible cost. Interiority is embodied in her movements and anchoring, revealing contradictory impulses between exile's solitude and transcendent possibility. However, some stock phrasing like "obsidian grace" slightly flattens her individuality, though it doesn't undermine the hierarchy of values shown in the final inscription.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through layered imagery of tides and gaps to a Resonant Reconfiguration in Lira's anchoring and inscription, with felt cost of mobility sacrificed on the page. Orientation anchors early in the twilight garden, supporting comprehension without disorientation. Causality holds via patterned elision, but minor redundancy in descriptive beats slightly dilutes propulsion toward closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The twilight garden is vividly specific with forbidden flowers and scents evoking pre-ban times, constraining Lira's exile and charging the final image of her anchored transformation. Sensory details are purposeful, filtered through her POV, and evolve with her dance, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism. The setting pressures choices by anchoring her roots, making it indispensable to the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, the dominant stake of transcending the nostalgia ban escalates through density increase in magical observations, culminating in a meaningful deepening via the moonstone speck that narrows options and forces the anchoring cost. Agency manifests in Lira's focused dance and inscription, with legible trade-off of mobility for vision. However, pressure feels somewhat abstract until the final reconfiguration, slightly softening the intensification.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of preserving memory against enforced forgetting emerges organically from Lira's exile and transformation, with the final image of her inscribed skin offering a resonant, non-literal reconfiguration of mortal-divine bridges. Subtext in gaps and tides invites reflection on possibility without tidy morals. The cosmic verse on skin reweights prior material effectively, though occasional direct statements border on thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person close POV on Lira remains stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature in tidal and lunar imagery that modulates rhythm under transformative pressure. Prose texture is purposeful and lyric, teaching patterned diction early for legibility at closure. No dialogue present, so policy applies; elision in gaps is paid off without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high information density, varying rhythm and syntax to propel the accumulative build, especially in the anchoring and inscription beats. Figurative language like "threads of luminous ink" enhances without muddle, though minor paraphrase loops in descriptive passages slightly drag momentum. No major artifacts obscure closure, and sentences advance atmosphere effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes tide dancing, nostalgia ban, and cosmic inscription into a fresh, non-obvious fantasy with organic ingenuity, transforming familiar exile tropes through specific magical gaps and skin-as-manuscript. Risk-taking in lyric transformation heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable at the anchored closure. Emotional complexity in memory's cost avoids generics, committing fully to the vision.</comment>
