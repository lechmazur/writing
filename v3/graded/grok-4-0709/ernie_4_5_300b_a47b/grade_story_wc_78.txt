<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Leeward's motivation to harmonize chaos is clear and intensifies through persistent actions, with embodied emotions like trembling hands and aching arms revealing character under pressure; interiority is concrete, avoiding stock phrasing, and her micro-choices, such as adjusting grip on the mallet, show a hierarchy of values with visible cost in sweat and raw fingers.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds density through layered sounds and cloud interpretations, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where chaos becomes order with felt cost in physical exhaustion; orientation anchors early in the floating orchard, and causality holds via motivated sound-building, with the final silence crashing like a wave charging the closure image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The floating orchard setting is vivid and purposeful, constraining choices like pivoting in the narrowed circle and supplying resources such as planks for striking; sensory details, filtered through Leeward's bias, evolve causally with events, mirroring her internal state, and the environment charges the final mosaic image with glistening leaves and humming air.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of transforming chaos into harmony tightens through accumulating sound layers under Accumulative/Textural lens, with one meaningful deepening when the seabird's screech is incorporated, narrowing options and raising cost in her aching arms; agency via endurance forecloses paths with legible physical price, though coincidence like the rogue current is backstory, not resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of turning obstacles into instruments emerges organically from events and images like the mallet's grooves aligning with clouds, inviting reflection on chaos and harmony without tidy morals; the final image of the humming air offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question, reweighting prior chaos with conceptual cost in accepted struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable and apt, with perceptual signature in fractal rhythms and cloud melodies; prose texture is distinct in rhythmic syntax mirroring dubbing, and limited dialogue like muttered obstacles feels natural and subtextual, advancing her goal without register mismatch.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in sound blooms and thuds, though minor paraphrase loops like repeated striking descriptions slightly dull momentum; clarity holds with strong verbs and purposeful metaphors, such as clouds frayed like sheet music, advancing atmosphere without overwriting in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tidal prophecy and sound dubbing transforms familiar chaos-to-order trope through specific details like kelp ropes and fractal generating, feeling inevitable with risk-taking in lyric accumulation that heightens stakes; the mallet's warm handle from earth's core offers a non-obvious angle, cohering as a singular vision.</comment>
