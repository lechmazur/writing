<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lila's motivation to seek stillness is clear and rooted in her survivor traits, intensifying through embodied emotions like trembling hands and flinching at wind; internal conflict shows in contradictory impulses during the flashback, earning the final renunciation of fragility with felt cost. Mrs. Voss applies secondary pressure effectively, forcing a micro-choice in dialogue. Some diagnostic label-speak like "PTSD" and "somatic markers" slightly abstracts emotions, but it doesn't undermine the hierarchy of values revealed in her painting resumption.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned sensory details and reflections, with orientation anchored early in the arboretum setting; closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) in the final walk home, reweighting grief with undeniable conceptual cost shown in the pearl cradled like a promise. One meaningful cadence shift occurs via the wind-triggered flashback, changing knowledge without redundancy. Reflection adheres to BRR, tilting present stance via the stone-pressing micro-choice.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The arboretum's seaside cliff is vividly specific, with salt-bleached roses and wind-twisted pines constraining choices like kneeling by the stone bench; sensory details like ocean roar and gull cries reflect Lila's urgency, charging the final image where the setting becomes her somatic markers. Micro-setting of the bench and lavender integrates into action, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism. No white-room issues; spatial choreography tracks cleanly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of anchoring peace amid grief signals early and tightens once under Accumulative lens via the wind gust forcing stance crystallization, narrowing options with felt cost in the flashback's emotional void. Agency shines in Lila's deliberate freezing, foreclosing escape while embracing brokenness; moral calculus between hope's fragility and realism sharpens the peak. Coincidence of Mrs. Voss's arrival complicates without resolving, but stakes occasionally feel abstract until the photo-smoothing moment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of resilience through anchored realism emerges organically from somatic cues and the pearl motif, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer when Lila realizes the pearl as a lens, reweighting prior grief without moralizing. Subtext in silences and implications, like the photo's frayed edges, invites reflection on loss's tenderness. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality via concrete particulars, though the final "promise" line borders on tidy insight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and modest, with perceptual signature biased toward sensory anchors like lavender scent; voice texture distinct in rhythmic, reflective syntax that modulates with stress, as in the deep breath during flashback. Dialogue is natural, subtext-laden, and advances plot, distinguishing characters idiomatically without convergence. No head-hopping or unwarranted certainty; elision in reflection is taught early and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm and syntax to propel beats, as in the gust rattling gates leading to embodied flinch; information advances character and atmosphere without loops, though minor synonym churn appears in "freeze" repetitions. Figurative language like "pearl of stillness" is controlled without muddle, and opening/closing lines anchor effectively. One template cadence in reflection blocks slightly drags momentum but doesn't obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of trauma recovery via somatic markers transforms grief tropes through specific details like the drone strike and lavender sprig, feeling inevitable in the photo-smoothing turn; risk in quiet, accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity avoids generics, but premise echoes familiar healing arcs without bolder subversion. Core elements cohere organically, passing transformation test.</comment>
