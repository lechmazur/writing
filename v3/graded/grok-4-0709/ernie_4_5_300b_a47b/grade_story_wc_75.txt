<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lila's motivation to rescue dying arts is clear and intensifies through concrete actions like baking and planning a festival, with embodied emotions in her "rosewater dread" and resolve hardening; interior contradictions show in her frayed voice versus fierce drive, culminating in an earned stasis where she accepts the cost of neglect but commits to revival. The baking scene reveals her hierarchy of values through micro-choices, like shaping dough as tribute. Flaws complicate without hedging, but secondary characters like the child and tourists apply light pressure, fitting the single-POV scope.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned motifs like thaw and bread, leading to a resonant reconfiguration in the final gathering where hope rises with conceptual cost of lingering absence; orientation anchors early in the grotto city and tour. Closure lands on-page as Charged Poise, with felt cost in the beekeeper's ache and arts' fragility, reweighting the stake. Minor ellipsis in transitions feels motivated, but no decisive physical change slightly limits causal traceability.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The grotto city behind the waterfall is vividly anchored with sensory details like mist-filtered sunlight and echoing chambers, evolving causally with spring's trickle mirroring the thaw motif; it constrains choices, as the damp cold contrasts dough's warmth, charging the final image of torch-flickered lens. POV filters details through Lila's historical bias, with the pool and hives guiding action. Micro-setting like the lens and oven integrates purposefully without excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of rescuing dying arts signals early and deepens through textural accumulation, with one meaningful cadence shift in the baking and teaching scene that crystallizes her stance; pressure coheres situationally from neglect's taste and bees' vanishing, forcing resolve with felt cost in persistent dread. Agency in renunciation of despair forecloses passivity, but escalation lacks a sharper reversal, relying on motif density over narrowed options. Coincidence doesn't resolve, fitting the lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of art's revival amid displacement emerges organically from motifs like the lens filtering grief and bread rising, culminating in a resonant final image that reweights preservation as active practice without stated moral; subtext in implications of thaw and initials invites reflection on memory's cost. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality through honest ambiguity in tempered dread. The lens' return in the ending offers a non-literal answer to exile's plight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable with perceptual signature in Lila's historical lens, modulating rhythm from reflective to purposeful; dialogue is natural and subtextual, like the child's question revealing curiosity, advancing the tour without excess. Prose texture is distinct with poetic diction, but occasional register drift into elevated phrasing like "rosewater dread" feels slightly unmotivated under stress. Elision in transitions is patterned and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in sentences like the waterfall's roar contrasting dough's warmth, advancing atmosphere without loops; figurative language like "footprints in snow" integrates without muddle, but some synonym churn in thaw descriptions (trickle, yield, begun) slightly dulls propulsion in the middle. Clarity is strong, with clean mechanics and purposeful syntax. No major artifacts touch closure, maintaining momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of displacement with art preservation through specific motifs like emerald lens and initialed bread feels inevitable, transforming tropes of exile into a bold, non-obvious angle on revival; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity in dread tempered by purpose avoids generics. Core premise commits fully, with the festival resolve arising from particulars.</comment>
