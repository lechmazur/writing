<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and rooted in her grandmother's letters, intensifying through psychometry to compel her emotional release; interiority is concrete with embodied ache and tears, showing contradictory impulses like grief and hope in the final whisper and smile. No second character on-page, so relationship bullets ignored. The realization earns stasis by foreclosing isolation with felt cost in tears, avoiding stock epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, holding through density of visions building to cadence shift in the crystal's flare and lilac scent; orientation anchors early in the booth with Mara and rain. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration via Conceptual Repricing, reweighting unused love as noticeable with emotional cost in tears and light steps. One continuous scene fits scope, with motivated ellipsis in visions advancing knowledge without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with dust, decayed film, and rattling window mirroring Mara's ache; the booth constrains her psychometry by providing the canister and film, charging the final image with lilac scent and creaking approval. Sensory details are selective, filtered through her bias, and evolve with the storm's rhythm. Micro-setting of table and crystal integrates into action, guiding her choice to release the love.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of finding unused love signals early and deepens through visions, with one meaningful tightening as Elise's story reweights Mara's grief; under Accumulative/Textural lens, pattern of emotional density forces stance crystallization in her whisper. Agency in psychometry drives the realization, foreclosing despair with felt cost in tears. No multiple reversals needed; coincidence of finding the film complicates but doesn't resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of unused love waiting for notice emerges organically from visions and letters, with subtext in silences and images like the crystal's hum; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer by reweighting grief into hope without moralizing. Emotional aftereffect is honest, avoiding sentimentality in the tears and lilac scent. Purposeful ambiguity lingers in her whisper's target, enriching complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in spatial imagination biasing details like lattice of memories; voice texture is distinct in rhythmic, image-rich prose modulating with intensity, as in the thickening air. No dialogue on-page beyond visions' ghosts, so ignored; elision in visions is patterned and pays off at closure. No head-hopping or register mismatch.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere in lines like "rain began to fall in a hushed thunder"; rhythm varies naturally, avoiding loops, though minor synonym churn in "ache" and "tightened" repeats without dulling closure. No major artifacts obscure the final flare and scent; strong verbs and specifics propel, with clean mechanics. Overwriting is minimal, serving textural lens without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of psychometry, old theater, and unresolved love feels organic, transforming tropes through specific visions like the 1947 marquee; emotional specificity in Mara's tears avoids generics. Risk in lyric visions heightens stakes without gimmickry, committing to premise. No close echoes of famous scenes, with authenticity in singular stance.</comment>
