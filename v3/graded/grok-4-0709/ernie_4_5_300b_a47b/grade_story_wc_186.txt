<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies through her retrocognitive visions, compelling high-stakes persistence; interiority is concrete with embodied emotions like trembling hands and bleeding fingers revealing contradictory impulses of doubt and hope. The final renunciation of needing full star return shows earned stasis with visible cost. Strength in how her gift constrains choices, as in the storm alignment scene. Minor slip in secondary characters feeling underdeveloped, but they don't harm closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through patterned visions and alignments to a resonant reconfiguration at the light eruption, with conceptual cost in the persistent void; orientation anchors early in the pavilion post-collapse. Closure lands on-page with the shard slam and survivor arrival reweighting stakes. One meaningful deepening in the storm flicker tightens pressure effectively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid, purposeful details like rattling panes and the mosaic constrain choices, as when Elara uses the floor for alignments; atmosphere of thistle-blown hope mirrors internal states through humming glass. Micro-setting of the shard charges the final image of rekindled light. No orientation debt applied.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of rekindling for meaning tightens through accumulative efforts, culminating in agency-driven alignment during the storm; cost is felt in bleeding fingers and emotional weeping. Coincidence of moonlight complicates without resolving. Enters high band with visible price charging the ending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of meaningful coincidences emerges organically from visions and alignments, with the final image offering a resonant, non-literal answer by reweighting chaos into hope without moralizing. Subtext in silence and shards deepens complexity. Earned through particulars like the mosaic dialogue with the past.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-person close POV with distinct perceptual signature in sensory details like ghostly vibrations; prose texture rhythmic and voice-motivated, with purposeful compression in visions. No head-hopping or elision issues; psychic distance shifts serve emotional beats effectively.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density and propulsion in metaphors like "skeletal wind chimes" advancing atmosphere without loops or artifacts; syntactic variety supports rhythm, especially in the storm climax. Zero scaffold, with final line recharging motifs cleanly. Exceptional control under pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of retrocognition and post-apocalyptic hope transforms familiar collapse tropes through specific elements like the humming pavilion; risk in lyric accumulations heightens stakes organically. Non-obvious angle on meaning in chaos feels inevitable.</comment>
