<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is rooted in her childhood guilt, intensifying to compel her entry into the firmware with embodied emotion shown in trembling hands and hitched breath. Internal conflict reveals contradictory impulses, like escaping the past via tattoos yet confronting it here. The closure choice feels earned by prior causality, with visible emotional cost in the nursery scene. Voice distinction holds in dialogue, but secondary character Elara applies pressure somewhat generically.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with because/therefore linkages, from amber's pulse leading to Elara's explanation and Lira's decision to tether, culminating in on-page decisive change as cries soften and dissonance fades. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration with felt emotional cost in confronting her mother's voice. Orientation anchors early in the laboratory setting by ~50 words. One meaningful tightening suffices at this length, though the digital labyrinth transition feels slightly elliptical without breaking causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The laboratory of lost sounds is vividly anchored with sensory details like humming walls, ozone taste, and crackling machines, filtered through Lira's POV. Setting constrains choices, as machines amplify letters and enable firmware entry, charging the final image of faded amber glow. Atmosphere supports theme through haunted frequencies mirroring guilt. Micro-setting of amber and letters evolves causally, enhancing specificity without excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of dissonance consuming all is signaled early and tightens causally when Lira enters the firmware, forcing stance crystallization against her past. One meaningful deepening occurs in the nursery, narrowing options with visible emotional cost. Pressure coheres under causal lens, but coincidence of the amber's sudden pulse slightly complicates without fully resolving. Agency in reading the letter earns the resolution, though stakes feel somewhat abstract until the cries manifest.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of confronting guilt for forgiveness emerges organically from Lira's actions and the firmware's translation of cries, with subtext in unspoken goodbyes and the mother's letters. Final image offers resonant, non-literal reconfiguration without moralizing, reweighting silence as understanding. Emotional aftereffect lingers through complexity, avoiding tidy binaries. Purposeful ambiguity in the wasp's glow invites reflection, tied to particulars like the empty crib.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and modest, with perceptual signature in Lira's star-mapping bias and stress-degraded thoughts like paused needle. Dialogue is natural, subtext-laden, and advances plot, distinguishing characters through Elara's curator idiom. Prose texture is distinct with rhythmic metaphors, modulating under pressure. No head-hopping or unmotivated elision, though some compression in the labyrinth shift is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere through vivid images like "silver quill against the canvas of flesh," but occasional overwriting in peak beats, such as stacked metaphors in the amber description, muddles clarity slightly. Rhythm varies naturally, with strong verbs and syntactic variety; no major loops or artifacts touch closure. Information propels forward, though one paraphrase loop in Elara's explanation ("guilt… guilt") dulls momentum minimally. Final line resolves with charged image, free of scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes haunted tech with personal guilt in a fresh, non-obvious way, transforming tropes like trapped fossils into keys for emotional dissonance. Originality shines in the firmware's baby-cry translation, feeling inevitable through Lira's tattooist worldview. Risk-taking in the digital nursery confrontation heightens stakes organically. Details are particular, avoiding stock echoes, with conceptual integrity committed to its implications.</comment>
