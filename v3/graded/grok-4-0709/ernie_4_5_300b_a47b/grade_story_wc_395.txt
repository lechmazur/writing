<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to uncover the truth is clear and intensifies through discoveries, rooted in her role and personal haunting, with embodied emotions like trembling fingers showing under pressure; however, internal conflict feels somewhat summarized rather than simultaneous in scene, and Hale's oily demeanor borders on stereotype without deeper status dynamics in their confrontation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Under a Causal lens, the structure builds through motivated discoveries linking transmissions to the video and coordinates, with orientation anchored early in the archive; closure lands as a Decisive Change via Lira's upload and mental escape, foreclosing safety with felt cost of drones advancing, though the final "gone" feels slightly elliptical without fuller causal payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The archive setting is vivid with humming servers and holographic interfaces constraining Lira's actions, integrated into her discoveries and charging the climax with alarms and drones; sensory details like cold light and rough patch fabric reflect POV urgency, though spatial choreography in the confrontation could track distances more precisely.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of uncovering Elara's truth escalates causally through restricted files and the video reveal, tightening options with Hale's confrontation; one meaningful deepening occurs via cracking encryption, narrowing to the coordinates with visible cost of alarms, but coincidence of numbers guiding feels convenient without fully forcing agency-driven reversal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of corporate erasure versus remembrance emerges organically from Lira's hunt and Elara's message, with subtext in numbers and voids inviting reflection on forgotten echoes; the final resolve offers resonant reconfiguration without moralizing, though ambiguity in Elara's fate leaves some counter-readings underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person close POV stays stable with Lira's perceptual signature in attentive scans and recurring numbers, voice modulating rhythmically under stress; dialogue carries subtext in Hale's lies and advances plot, though some lines like "Some truths aren’t meant to be found" feel slightly on-the-nose without deeper indirection.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is concise with strong verbs and varied rhythm, advancing atmosphere through images like frayed patch edges; however, minor paraphrase loops appear in descriptions of numbers repeating in logs and codes, and some simultaneity in action sequences slightly muddles propulsion without harming closure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The premise ingeniously synthesizes corporate archives with space mystery via recurring numbers as a guiding code, transforming missing-person tropes through digital echoes; risk in the mental escape heightens stakes organically, though the gateway concept echoes familiar sci-fi without fully non-obvious inflection.</comment>
