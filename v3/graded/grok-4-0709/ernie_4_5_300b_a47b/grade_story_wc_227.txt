<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to conjure meaning from the statue is clear and intensifies through embodied uncertainty, with contradictory impulses shown in her trembling hands and respirator removal; interiority is concrete via fragmented memories that tilt her stance, culminating in an earned renunciation with felt cost in facing the fumes. Strengths include character-specific flaws like doubt driving micro-choices, such as pressing the charm despite fear. Minor slip in stock emotional phrasing ("tears stinging her eyes") slightly flattens embodiment but doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through patterned imagery and cadence shifts, leading to a Conceptual Repricing closure where Lira's realization reweights the premise with conceptual cost in surviving cracks; orientation anchors early with the workshop on the acid sea. The final stillness and understanding provide resonant reconfiguration with felt cost in her raw laughter and burned lungs. Minor ambiguity in lens dominance at midpoint holds without contradiction, supporting strong causality via motif accumulation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The acid sea and gears-and-cogs workshop are vividly specific, with sensory details like fumes and whirring constraining Lira's choices and charging the final image of stillness; the environment mirrors her internal mending through purposeful contrasts, such as the sea as a mirror. Micro-setting of the statue and charm integrates into action, evolving causally to form constellations. Exceptional integration where setting pressures the closure without ornamental excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of conjuring meaning tightens through accumulative pressure, with a meaningful deepening when the statue speaks and scars rearrange, narrowing options and forcing stance crystallization; cost is legible in her physical exposure to fumes and emotional clarity. Agency via renunciation (removing respirator) drives the Charged Poise ending under the lens. Minor issue with stakes feeling abstract until the surge, but escalation coheres with one decisive intensification.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of kintsugi as survival emerges organically from images like quilts and shattered flasks, culminating in a resonant, non-literal reconfiguration in the final realization without stated moral; subtext in gestures like pressing the charm invites reflection on mending flaws. Emotional aftereffect is concrete via her laughter and tears, embracing complexity. Strength in thematic resonance tied to particulars, charging the closure image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in Lira's alchemical bias, like tracing pockmarks; voice texture via rhythmic, poetic syntax modulates with pressure, teaching patterned elision early. Dialogue is sparse but subtextual, as in the statue's rumble advancing the arc. Minor register drift in elevated metaphors fits the enchanted tone without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in sentences like the acid sea's roar accelerating momentum; metaphors are purposeful without muddle, such as "million teeth grinding." Minor paraphrase loop in memory fragments slightly drags, but no artifacts touch closure; strong propulsion in the final stillness image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemy and kintsugi in a dire, enchanted world feels inevitable, with risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightening stakes via the sea's mirror; transforms tropes through specific details like the charm's grooves. Originality in conceptual integrity, committing to the premise without retreat. Minor familiarity in relic motif, but non-obvious angle elevates.</comment>
