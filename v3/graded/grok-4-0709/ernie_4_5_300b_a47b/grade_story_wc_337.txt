<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to mend broken echoes roots consistently in her escape from her past, intensifying through embodied fear during the unraveling, with contradictory impulses shown in her admission of afraid yet persistent work; Elias as secondary character applies pressure via riddles, forcing her stance crystallization. Interiority is concrete, like fingers aching amid whispers, revealing values with felt cost in the weight lifting from her chest. However, some emotional progression feels slightly tidy, lacking deeper irrationality in her final lucidity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through layered silences and knots, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where the net's unraveling releases light and a key, reweighting Mara's stance with felt cost of awakened unrest; orientation anchors early in the prism sanctuary under starlight. Causality holds via pattern of accumulating whispers leading to the burst, with one meaningful deepening in her faster work post-fear admission. Minor ellipsis in the net's disappearance feels motivated but could tighter link to her choice.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary's refracting starlight vividly anchors the mystical atmosphere, with sensory details like cold floor and shifting colors mirroring Mara's internal hush; it constrains her work, charging the final image as starlight brightens post-release. Details evolve causally, from humming walls to illuminated glow, integrated into action without stalling. Micro-setting of the net as tactile object enhances specificity, though occupational depth for mask restoring remains light but apt for length.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of unraveling silence to ground spirits tightens accumulatively as knots loosen whispers, deepening with her fear and faster work, narrowing options to a burst that forecloses the hush with felt cost of lifted burden; agency in her persistent needle use drives the Charged Poise ending under the lens. Pressure coheres but coincidence of star alignment slightly complicates without resolving. One meaningful cadence shift suffices, though ethical calculus between silence and kindness could sharpen the peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of breaking interlaced hushes to release truths emerges organically from Mara's unraveling, with subtext in the net's accumulated silence mirroring her buried past; final image of brighter starlight and humming conversations offers resonant, non-literal repricing of silence as prison, embracing complexity without tidy morals. Emotional aftereffect lingers through her lucid unrest, earned via struggle. However, Elias's riddle-like statements verge on overt thematic echo, slightly reducing ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person close POV stays stable and modest, with perceptual signature in Mara's tactile focus on threads and embodied fear; voice texture distinct in rhythmic, poetic syntax like "knots tight as forgotten secrets," modulating under pressure without drift. Dialogue carries subtext and advances plot, with Elias's riddles pursuing persuasion naturally. Patterned elision in mystical elements is taught early and pays off at closure without confusion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose advances with high density in images like "threads falling away like old skin," varying rhythm purposefully, but minor paraphrase loops appear in repeated hush descriptions (e.g., "accumulates silence" and "interlaced hush" churn synonyms without new pressure). Clarity holds, with strong verbs and concision, though one template cadence in needle actions ("needle slipping through," "needle darting") slightly dulls propulsion. No major artifacts touch closure, and final line recharges motifs effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mask restoring with mystical net-unraveling transforms trope of buried secrets via specific, non-obvious angle on silence as accumulating prison, feeling inevitable in hindsight; risk in lyric mysticism heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity in Mara's awakening avoids generics. Core premise commits fully, though proximity to folklore echoes (drowned fisherman) could use bolder subversion.</comment>
