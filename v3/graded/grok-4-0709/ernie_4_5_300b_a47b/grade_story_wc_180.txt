<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to persist and mend is clear and rooted in traits like feistiness, intensifying through her actions on the branch; interiority is concrete with embodied emotions in handling the ribbon and quartz eye. Internal conflict shows in contradictory impulses between grief and defiance, revealed in micro-choices like humming Mara's tune while sealing the crack. The endurance is earned with felt cost of the breach, foreclosing easier abandonment. Some reflections border on summary but anchor in present cues without excess.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through patterned reflections and images leading to resonant reconfiguration in the bloom and ribbon catch, with conceptual cost of adapted vows legible at closure. Orientation anchors early in the orchard and cathedral, passing the test without penalty. Causality holds in her mending causing the shift, but some ellipsis in backstory feels unmotivated, slightly weakening linkage before the final image. Closure lands as Earned Stasis with visible persistence cost, though not a decisive physical change.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The orchard in cathedral rafters is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like crunching fruit and whispering leaves filtered through Lira's bias, constraining her climb and charging the final bloom image. Atmosphere supports tone of quiet persistence, evolving causally with the mending. Micro-setting of the branch and moss nest guides choice, mirroring internal states subtly. No orientation debt from Q2, and recurring objects like the quartz eye charge closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of bridging wisdom through persistence signals early and deepens via the mending act, narrowing options with the crack's depth under Accumulative/Textural lens; one meaningful tightening suffices, but pressure feels static until the bloom. Cost is felt in emotional grief but oblique, not fully forcing stance crystallization. Agency in endurance forecloses abandonment with visible trade-off in the ribbon slip. Coincidence of wind complicates without resolving, but escalation lacks a sharper reversal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of enduring wisdom through mending emerges organically from images like the ribbon and quartz eye, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in "accidental wisdom." Subtext in gestures like catching the ribbon invites reflection on persistence's cost. Final image offers resonant, non-literal answer to vows' adaptability without stating it. Some direct statements like "wisdom wasn’t found in grand contracts" border on thematic echo, slightly reducing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with perceptual signature in Lira's biased noticing of orchard secrets and ribbon flutter; voice texture distinct in rhythmic, reflective prose modulating with climb's intensity. Patterned elision in memories is taught early and pays off at closure without confusion. No dialogue present, so policy skips those bullets; free indirect style clean. Psychic distance shifts intentionally serve emotional beats like the hum and seal.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is concise with momentum, sentences advancing atmosphere and action; rhythm varies naturally, as in the climb's crunch and breeze. Some paraphrase loops, like repeated vows mentions, dull density slightly without touching closure. Information high in mending scene with strong verbs; no major artifacts obscure cause/effect. Final line resolves by recharging ribbon motif effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Premise of mending quartz eyes in a cathedral orchard offers fresh synthesis of fantasy and persistence, transforming abandonment tropes through specific details like liquid starlight. Emotional complexity in feisty endurance feels authentic, with non-obvious angle on vows. Some echoes of familiar redemption arcs without bold risk, hedging in safe reflections. Turns arise from character choice, but ingenuity moderate without transformative subversion.</comment>
