<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong motivation to translate lost languages intensifies through her dedication, with embodied interiority in tracing cracks and humming; contradictory impulses peak in her laugh and shout confronting fear, earning the final renunciation with visible cost in the searing palm.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, density builds via echoes and patterns to a resonant reconfiguration in hurling the diamond; closure lands on-page with felt cost in the burning heat and conceptual repricing of silence, anchored early without orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid canyon echoes and bone towers constrain her ledge positioning and bird-watching, charging the final silent descent; sensory details filtered through her bias mirror internal states, evolving causally to support the resonant end.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of harnessing the diamond escalates via textural density in bird patterns and throbbing vein, tightening to force her agency in humming and hurling; cost is legible in the searing palm and fear confrontation under the lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of language as felt resonance emerges from diamond's curse and echoes without direct statement; final lingering song offers a non-literal reconfiguration of oblivion, inviting reflection through ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Consistent third-person close POV with distinct perceptual signature in copper-shimmering skin and echo perceptions; rhythmic prose like "whisper fractured into a thousand" holds under pressure, with purposeful compression taught early.</comment>
