<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Clara's motivation to carve as a way to process grief is clear and intensifies through micro-choices like the tentative first cut, revealing embodied contradictions between resistance and yielding; interiority is concrete without stock labels, though the "hollowed her" echo feels slightly generic. The final renunciation of closure for transformation earns cost via the serene lion, foreclosing raw grief with visible emotional trade-off. Single-POV focus excels in perceptual bias under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through reflective shards in one continuous loft scene, with orientation anchored early in the rain-beaded skylight; closure as Conceptual Repricing reweights grief via the carved lion's placement, with legible conceptual cost in accepting transformation over resurrection. One meaningful deepening via carving progression suffices, though ellipsis in backstory feels slightly unmotivated without stronger present cue. No orientation debt; lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The loft's rain-beaded skylight and rust-hued peace constrain Clara's reflective process, with sensory details like damp wool and steam curling integrated into action; the environment charges the final image as fractured light casts over the lion, mirroring internal reconfiguration. Micro-setting of the workbench and wood blank evolves causally, guiding choices without static repetition. Vivid, purposeful specificity elevates atmosphere, with weather affecting mood and tone subtly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of harvesting lessons from loss tightens accumulatively through carving beats, with one deepening shift as wood yields shavings like "discarded seconds," narrowing options toward understanding; cost is felt conceptually in the non-perfect lion as a vessel for lingering absence. Under Textural lens, cadence shift at candle burnout reweights grief without coincidence resolving. Agency in endurance forecloses raw mourning with visible trade-off, though pressure remains internal without external complication.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of loss as transformation emerges organically from carving particulars, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in "not closure, but understanding"; subtext in the lion's serene form offers resonant, non-literal repricing of "here and gone" without statement. Final image reweights premise via the ash wood monument, eliciting emotional aftereffect through earned wisdom. No overt symbolism or moralizing; complexity lingers plausibly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable with perceptual signature in sensory biases like steam curls and wood texture, modulating rhythm under grief's pressure; no dialogue, so policy skips those bullets. Prose texture distinct in lyrical compression, with purposeful elision of time taught via loft's "bubble" and paid off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift; free indirect style clean without filter stacks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in sentences like the rhythmic knife scrape echoing a removed clock; no loops or scaffold, though some metaphors like "silver threads" border on ornate without muddle. Information propels via integrated details, with strong verbs and specificity; final line recharges motifs effectively. Minor overwriting in peak reflective beats slightly dulls momentum but doesn't touch closure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of widow's grief through wood carving transforms trope of artistic healing via specific "hauntingly practical" blank and crystallized time method, feeling inevitable with risk in quiet, internal arc heightening stakes. No derivative echoes; emotional specificity anchors universality without hedging. Core premise offers non-obvious angle on absence, committing fully without retreat.</comment>
