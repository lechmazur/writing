<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong motivation from trauma compels high-stakes choices, with embodied emotions in the geode's bite and contradictory impulses in grief-fueled exhilaration; interiority is concrete but occasionally slips into stock phrasing like "raw, unfiltered edge of survival."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with because/therefore linkages from console activation to node entry, landing a resonant reconfiguration in the eruption with felt cost of the shattered geode and lost observatory; orientation anchors early in the hovering setup, though the final transmission feels slightly tacked on.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, purposeful details in the glass observatory and crater veins constrain descent choices and charge the final image of shimmering ground; sensory hierarchy reflects Elara's urgency, mirroring internal chaos without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of awakening escalates under causal pressure through alarms and instability, with one meaningful tightening in the vortex entry forcing stance crystallization; cost is legible in the observatory's loss, though coincidence in the node's scream slightly complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of grief as untapped potential emerges organically from events and images like the pulsing crystal, offering a resonant non-literal answer in the final awakening without moralizing; subtext in silence and implication deepens complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Consistent close third-person POV with distinct perceptual signature in trauma-biased observations; rhythmic syntax modulates with pressure, and dialogue with Orion carries subtext and advances the hunt naturally.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density and propulsion in vivid lines like "edges biting into her palm like a promise," with varied rhythm; minor overwriting in stacked metaphors like "intangibly tangible" slightly muddles peak beats without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sci-fi perturbation theory with personal grief transforms familiar loss tropes into a bold, authentic vision; risk in the node's unleashing heightens stakes organically, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
