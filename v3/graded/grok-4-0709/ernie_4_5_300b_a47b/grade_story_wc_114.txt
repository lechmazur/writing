<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lirael's motivation as a fault-tolerant oracle fraying after fever is clear and intensifies through embodied contradictions, like tracing the illustration while questioning certainties, compelling her descent with felt cost of abandoning her role. Interiority is concrete, with emotions embodied in actions like smudging roots, revealing hierarchy of values where survival trumps quantification. The final renunciation earns stasis by prior accumulation, foreclosing her old life with visible anchoring in the village. Minor slip in over-articulated self-awareness mid-story, but it doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the story builds through patterned images like the bearberry and aurora, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Lirael sways into wholeness with conceptual cost of swallowed truth anchoring her. Orientation anchors early in the station with wind and pines; causality holds via motif accrual without breaks. Closure lands on-page with the herbalist's nod and her smile, reweighting certainties. One hairline ambiguity in dream's causal link, but lens holds through ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The mountain weather station constrains choices, with rattling windows and storm tremors mirroring Lirael's fraying, charging the final auroral sorrow as she descends. Sensory details are selective and POV-biased, like metallic tang of truth and damp earth scent, evolving causally to anchor her village arrival. Recurring illustration as micro-setting charges the closure image. Exemplary integration without slips.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of swaying certainties tightens accumulatively through discoveries like the quarantine folder, deepening to force her stance crystallization in descent, with felt cost of leaving the station. One meaningful intensification via smudging roots narrows options, reweighting survival over certainty. Agency in renunciation forecloses paths under textural pressure. Minor abstraction in stakes mid-story, but escalation holds to closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of occupying margins and swallowed truths emerges organically from particulars like the frayed illustration and aurora, inviting reflection on certainty's lies without moralizing. Final image of anchored wholeness offers resonant, non-literal repricing of her oracle role. Subtext in gestures like pressing forehead to glass deepens complexity. Strong without overt statements, though one near-echo of thematic phrasing in "sway."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in Lirael's biased noticing of margins and tremors, modulating rhythm under pressure like pacing echoes. Prose texture distinct in syntax blending lyric compression with concrete cues, teaching pattern early. Minimal dialogue natural and subtextual, like director's frown advancing conflict. No head-hopping or elision issues; holds under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in sentences like wind's howl dipping like a question, advancing atmosphere without loops. Figurative language purposeful, like steel barnacle and bleeding berries, without muddle or overwriting in peaks. Minor scaffold in one paraphrase of truth's weight, but doesn't touch closure; propulsion strong to final line. Clean mechanics and varied structure support momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of oracle premise with botanical motifs and auroral sorrow transforms tropes through specific choices like smudged roots clawing paper, feeling inevitable in her descent. Risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity avoids generics, though premise echoes familiar internal crisis arcs slightly. Coherent vision with non-obvious angle on resilience.</comment>
