<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lirael's motivation to understand home intensifies compellingly, rooted in her mercury skin and borrowed memories, leading to an earned endurance with felt pain as the stone embeds in her skin. Interiority is concrete and embodied, with contradictory impulses shown in her hesitation before using the feather. The relationship with Orin applies secondary pressure effectively in the final moment, though his wide-eyed reaction feels slightly stock.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds density through recurring symbols like the stone and feather, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration where Lirael reprices home as the act of remembering, with visible cost in pain and the stone's shards. Orientation anchors early in the bookstore, and causality holds via textural linkages without breaks. The ending's conceptual repricing lands on-page with undeniable pressure, though the cavern shift feels like a minor elision paid off well.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The labyrinthine bookstore setting is vivid and purposeful, with shelves spiraling like roots constraining Lirael's movements and mirroring her internal maze of memories. Sensory details, like dust motes as galaxies and bioluminescent fungi, are selective and POV-filtered, charging the final image where the mountain glows silver. The environment evolves causally, from attic to cavern, and a recurring object like the feather constrains her choice at the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of understanding home tightens meaningfully when Lirael seeds the stone, deepening pressure via the vision and cavern shake, forcing stance crystallization under Accumulative/Textural lens. Agency in whispering "I want to remember" drives the escalation, with felt cost in pain and foreclosed forgetting. One reversal narrows options effectively, though coincidence in the mother's echoed voice slightly complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of home as carried memories emerges organically from particulars like the shifting symbols and feather's dissolution, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer in the final line about seeding truth. Subtext in gestures, like tracing the stone, invites reflection on borrowed lives without confusion. Emotional aftereffect is concrete, avoiding sentimentality, though the mother's voice stating "Home isn’t a place" borders on direct thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and close, with perceptual signature in Lirael's shimmering reflections and memory fragments, modulating rhythm under pressure like the low hum. Prose texture is distinct and lyrical, teaching patterned elision in visions that pays off at closure. Dialogue is sparse but natural, with subtext in Orin's "You did it," advancing the reconfiguration; no head-hopping or register mismatch.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere through vivid images like shadows sharp as knives, but occasional overwriting in stacked metaphors, such as dust motes as galaxies, slightly muddles peak beats without harming clarity. Rhythm varies naturally, with strong verbs and specific nouns, though one paraphrase loop in describing the stone's pulsing edges triggers a minor deduction. No major artifacts touch closure, and final line resolves with charged image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Original synthesis of mercury-glass seer and lost language stone transforms familiar fantasy tropes through specific emotional complexity in borrowed memories, feeling inevitable at the feather's stardust dissolution. Risk-taking in textural visions heightens stakes without gimmickry, offering a fresh angle on identity and home. Core premise commits fully, avoiding derivative echoes.</comment>
