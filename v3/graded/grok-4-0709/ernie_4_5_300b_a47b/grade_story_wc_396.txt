<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to reconstitute the fragment for empathy is clear and rooted in her intuitive trait, intensifying through mirror glimpses to compel the final placement; interiority is concrete, with embodied calm weaving into actions like brushing the stone. However, internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses in scene, relying on steady heart instead of simultaneous tensions. The resolution's endurance feels earned but without visible cost beyond implied collective fear, scaling appropriately for length. Voice distinction is strong in single-POV, with perceptual bias toward aurora and ice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through patterned mirror glimpses that deepen empathy, leading to a Conceptual Repricing closure where the fragment's glow transforms the storm with conceptual cost of shared humanity; orientation anchors early in lighthouse orchard. Causality holds via textural density increase from fragment to mended light, with one meaningful deepening sufficient. Persistent constraint of storm's fear shapes tactics, charging the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting of lighthouse orchard above ice floes is vivid and purposeful, with frost-heavy branches and groaning ice constraining Elara's actions and mirroring internal calm amid chaos; sensory details like crunching boots and aurora glow are selective, filtered through her bias. Environment pressures choices, as shifting floes threaten and the attic mirrors integrate into action. Recurring crystal fragment as micro-setting charges the final image by mending cracks with light.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of quieting the fear-storm via empathy tightens through mirror weaving, deepening to reweight options with one intensification sufficient under textural lens; agency in reconstitution forecloses inaction, with felt cost in transforming terror to resilience. Pressure coheres but lacks a sharper trade-off, as warmth spreads without personal forfeiture shown. Escalation driven by her intuitive acts, cost legible in the stilled floes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of courage through empathy emerges from mirror glimpses and fragment mending, resisting tidy morals by embracing fear's transformation without elimination; subtext in images like sailor's terror implies complexity. Final image offers resonant, non-literal answer to mapping empathy onto action, reweighting premise with conceptual cost. Emotional aftereffect lingers via shared humanity's warmth, earned through particulars without assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in aurora-sheened skin and midnight eyes biasing notices toward calm in chaos; prose texture distinct in rhythmic, lyric syntax like "silence felt like a language." No dialogue, so policy skips those bullets; elision purposeful in image flow, taught early and paid off at closure. Rhythmic control heightens pressure without obscurity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere through vivid images like "branches heavy with frost," but occasional paraphrase loops, such as repeating calm intuition, dull momentum slightly without touching closure. Rhythm varies naturally, with syntactic variety supporting beats; no major artifacts obscure cause/effect. Final line resolves by recharging motifs effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Originality in synthesizing lighthouse orchard with empathy-mending via shipwreck mirrors offers fresh angle on courage, transforming anomaly trope through grounded, intuitive choices; emotional specificity in weaving terror to resilience feels memorable. Core premise commits without retreat, with risk in lyric accumulations heightening stakes organically. No close echoes of famous scenes, but synthesis feels somewhat familiar in fantasy elements.</comment>
