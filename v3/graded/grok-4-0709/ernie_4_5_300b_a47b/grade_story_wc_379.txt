<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clara's motivation is clear and rooted in her curator traits, intensifying through curiosity to compel her investigative choices, with embodied emotions like trembling hands and tears showing under pressure. Interior conflict emerges in her racing mind and pulse, though internal contradictions could be more simultaneous in key beats.

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The accumulative/textural lens holds with lore building to a resonant reconfiguration at closure, where opening the mailbox reweights the mystery with conceptual cost of enduring love's tragedy. Orientation anchors who, where, and when by the first paragraph, with no disorientation debt. Multiple shards over a week fit Track B mosaic allowance, taught early via routine and lore-gathering pattern, with legible transitions and coherent closure.

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The courtyard setting is vividly anchored early with sensory details like damp earth and cobblestones, evolving purposefully at dawn to mirror Clara's awakening curiosity. Details filter through her POV, with the mailbox and locket constraining choices and charging the final image of opened letters.

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of unraveling the mailbox mystery signals early and tightens accumulatively through lore-gathering, culminating in the opening with emotional cost of tears and fate's weight.

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of love's endurance through listening emerges organically from events and locket motif, reweighting the premise in the final unfinished letter without moralizing. Subtext in silences and implications, like ghostly figures, invites reflection on loss's complexity. Emotional aftereffect lands concretely via tears, avoiding sentimentality, with the core concept integrating via mystery-solving. Final image offers resonant, non-literal answer to separation's cost, though ambiguity could linger more provocatively.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable third-person close POV maintains controlled distance, with perceptual signature in Clara's history-spotting bias and no head-hopping. Voice texture is distinct in rhythmic, descriptive prose modulating with intensity, like quickened pulse sentences. Dialogue feels natural and subtextual, advancing plot via lore-sharing with distinct idioms for characters.

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere and character via vivid images like frayed chain and yellowed letters, without loops or scaffold. Rhythm varies naturally, with syntactic variety accelerating in discovery beats and no figurative muddle. Strong verbs and specific nouns propel momentum, though minor redundancy in "pulse quickened" and "eyes filled" echoes stock phrasing without harming closure clarity. Opening anchors stakes effectively, and final line recharges the listening motif cleanly.</comment>
