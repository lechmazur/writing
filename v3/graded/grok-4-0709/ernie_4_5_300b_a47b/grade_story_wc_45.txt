<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mara's skepticism and curiosity drive consistent, embodied choices like using the tooth as a key, revealing internal contradictions under pressure; Elias's return tests her flaws with felt emotional cost in their dialogue. Interiority is concrete, avoiding stock phrasing, but secondary character pressure feels slightly underdeveloped in status dynamics during the climax. The final renunciation of avoidance earns stasis with visible relational cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under a Causal lens, the structure links actions like placing the teeth to the fountain's flow and garden's revelation, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost of reframed certainty; orientation anchors early in the garden. One meaningful tightening occurs with Elias's appearance and tooth reveal, narrowing options without redundancy. Closure lands on-page with felt cost, but ellipsis in Elias's disappearance backstory slightly softens causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The secret garden's labyrinthine details, like ivy-overgrown walls and moss-choked fountain, constrain Mara's actions and charge the final image of flowing water mirroring forgiveness; sensory specifics reflect POV bias under curiosity. Atmosphere hums with whispers, evolving causally to shuddering hedges. Micro-setting of the fountain directly shapes the climax choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of unraveling the garden's magic tightens causally with Elias's return, forcing a deepening that reweights identity and sacrifice; one reversal narrows options, earning the reconfiguration with emotional cost. Pressure coheres under Causal lens, but coincidence of Elias's appearance complicates without fully resolving via agency. Moral calculus between skepticism and belief sharpens the peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of forgiveness as mending broken certainties emerges from particulars like the teeth and fountain, offering a resonant non-literal answer in the final image without moralizing; subtext in dialogue implies deeper losses. Emotional aftereffect lingers through ambiguity, avoiding sentimentality. The core concept integrates via events, but one platitude-like line ("mistakes are just constellations") edges toward explicitness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable with character-specific perceptual bias, like thorns testing reality; voice texture is lyrical and consistent, modulating with intensity. Dialogue carries subtext and advances plot naturally, distinguishing characters. Some filter verbs dull immediacy in reflective moments, and elision of Elias's full backstory is taught but pays off mildly at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm and syntax to propel beats; metaphors like "cleft in certainty" integrate without muddle. Overwriting in descriptive openings creates minor loops, such as repeated hedge imagery, slightly dragging momentum. Clarity is strong, with no artifacts touching closure, but one paraphrase loop in the fountain scene reduces propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of changeling lore with personal sacrifice transforms secret garden trope through specific emotional complexity; the tooth-bridge revelation feels inevitable, heightening stakes organically. Risk in blending nostalgia with innovation coheres without gimmickry. Core premise offers non-obvious angle on identity, but echoes familiar fairy-tale elements slightly hedge boldness.</comment>
