<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and rooted in her dock worker background, intensifying through the scrimshaw's symbolism to compel her detachment; interiority is concrete with embodied emotions like clutching the carving tightly amid the island's shudder. However, the epiphany about the island as a mirror feels slightly stock and diagnostic, lacking contradictory impulses in the peak swim scene. The final renunciation earns a felt cost of losing her home, but flaws complicate choices more through summary than simultaneous on-page conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned imagery of detachment and the whale's call, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration in the scrimshaw's dissolution and island's fracture, with legible conceptual cost in Lira's liberating calm. Orientation anchors early with Lira at the sublittoral fringe post-violence. Closure lands on-page with the whale's nudge clarifying freedom, though the sudden whale emergence feels like a minor coincidental complication rather than pure accumulation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The sublittoral fringe is vividly specific as a liminal space with swaying kelp and bioluminescent fish, constraining Lira's choice to swim into the deep and charging the final image of the vanished island. Sensory details are purposeful, filtered through her POV, evolving causally as the tide retreats and island crumbles. Micro-setting of the scrimshaw as a recurring object enhances atmosphere without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of escaping the disappearing island tightens meaningfully through the whale's call, deepening to force detachment with felt cost of the island's loss under the textural lens. However, pressure feels somewhat static until the climax, with the resolution relying on symbolic recognition rather than protagonist-driven agency narrowing options. Coincidence of the whale's appearance complicates but borders on resolving the conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of detachment for true freedom emerges organically from the scrimshaw's etching and island's crumble, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer via Lira's laughter through tears, reweighting prior reluctance without moralizing. Subtext in the whale's eye meeting hers invites reflection on guarded hearts. However, the final realization veers close to explicit statement, slightly tidying the complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and modest, with perceptual signature in Lira's graceful movements and selective noticing of salt and blood scents. Prose texture is distinct with rhythmic, fluid syntax mirroring the sea, and no dialogue present avoids evaluation there. Purposeful compression in the swim sequence pays off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere through vivid images like "eyes like moonlit pools," but occasional paraphrase loops, such as repeating "detaching" and "freedom" in the ending, dull momentum slightly. Rhythm varies naturally, and sentences propel forward, though some figurative language in the climax mixes metaphors without muddle. No major artifacts obscure closure, but synonym churn around "call" in the swim beat triggers a minor deduction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes pirate scrimshaw with a disappearing island in a fresh, non-obvious way, transforming detachment trope through Lira's specific dock worker lens and the whale's call, feeling inevitable at the triumphant cry. Risk in the symbolic dissolution heightens stakes organically without gimmickry. However, echoes of mythic sea tales feel familiar without full subversion.</comment>
