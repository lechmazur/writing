<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to decode her scar as a map of grief is clear and intensifies through visions, with embodied emotions like the throbbing scar revealing contradictory impulses of pain and pursuit; the final renunciation of chained grief feels earned with visible cost in relived trauma. Interiority is concrete, avoiding stock phrasing, but minor therapy-speak in the epiphany slightly dilutes specificity. Relationships are absent, fitting single-POV scope.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, visions build density through patterned memory shards to a Conceptual Repricing closure where scars become bridges, with felt cost in tears and burning pain on-page; orientation anchors early in the tower at dawn. One meaningful deepening via tunnel descent suffices, holding the lens without contradiction. Fantastical shifts like the sudden tunnel feel taught through the hourglass hum, charging the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The tower's damp stone, ivy, and coffee-ring mosaic vividly anchor atmosphere, with sensory details like frost crackling and breath fogging filtered through Mara's hyperaware POV; the tunnel as micro-setting constrains choices and charges the shattering hourglass climax. Details evolve causally, mirroring internal grief without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of seeking closure amid reopened wounds tightens through accumulating visions, narrowing options to endurance with legible cost in scar pain and tears; under Accumulative lens, cadence shifts to clarity via protagonist agency in examining rings. One deepening suffices, but coincidence of plant whispers complicates without fully resolving, slightly softening pressure crystallization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of scars as readable stories emerges organically from visions and mother's words, culminating in a resonant non-literal reconfiguration without moralizing; subtext in plant whispers and sand images invites reflection on grief's bridges. Emotional aftereffect feels earned through embodied struggle, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable with distinct perceptual signature in hyperaware details like vibrating hum and ivy whispers; prose texture modulates rhythmically, with italicized telepathy adding subtext. No dialogue or elision issues, but minor filter-verb use in visions slightly dulls immediacy under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in visions and avoiding major loops, though scar-pain repetition borders on template cadence without payoff; vivid images like swirling sand propel momentum without artifacts touching closure. Opening anchors voice strongly, final line recharges motifs effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of telepathic plants, coffee-ring portals, and scar-reading transforms grief tropes into a non-obvious fantastical journey; risk in mosaic visions heightens stakes organically, feeling inevitable at the hourglass shatter without gimmickry.</comment>
