<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Clara's motivation to unravel the ghost's code is clear and intensifies compellingly, rooted in her obsession with in-between spaces and embodied in trembling hands and quickened breath; interior conflict shows through her dismissal of skeptics and promise to finish the symphony, earning a meaningful endurance with felt cost of commitment. Strengths include concrete interiority avoiding stock phrasing, with emotions embodied contradictorily during the water surge. No major flaws, but secondary characters are absent, fitting single-POV scope without penalty.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through pattern accrual of symbols and ripples, leading to resonant reconfiguration in Clara's whispered promise and thrumming drums, with conceptual cost of unfinished legacy made undeniable; orientation anchors early in the flooded opera house. Closure lands as Charged Poise, reweighting her stance with felt pressure. Minor slip in ellipsis of pipe surge's full causality, but it serves textural intensification without breaking lens coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting of flooded opera house with flickering lanterns is vivid and purposeful, constraining choices like wading and dipping the program, while water hums with melody to charge atmosphere; micro-details like floating sheet music and rippling water mirror internal states, evolving causally with the surge to heighten urgency. Environment directly charges final image of thrumming drums. Exceptional specificity filters through Clara's POV, with no generic placeholders.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of unraveling the code to prove the ghost tightens meaningfully through symbol emergence and water surge, deepening knowledge and forcing memorization with visible cost of drenching and conceptual burden of promise; under Accumulative lens, cadence shift reweights options via pattern break. Agency in her commitment crystallizes stance without coincidence resolving. Strong but lacks a secondary accent for fuller escalation at this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of in-between spaces and unfinished legacies emerges organically from events like dipping the program and imagining the ghost's frustration, culminating in resonant final image of thrumming drums without stated moral; subtext in rippling water and floating bow implies wordless conversation. Avoids tidy morals with ambiguity in ghost's existence. Strong emotional aftereffect through promise, but could deepen counter-readings for higher resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and modest, with perceptual signature biased toward musical metaphors like humming water and unstruck chords; prose texture distinct in rhythmic, lyrical syntax that modulates with pressure, teaching patterned elision early. No dialogue present, so policy skips those bullets. Elision of full backstory pays off in closure commitment without withholding for suspense.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere through vivid images like "sheet music floating like lost confessions" without loops or scaffold; rhythm varies naturally, accelerating in surge moment. Minor overwriting in stacked metaphors during symbol tracing, but no clarity loss at closure. Strong propulsion and clarity, with no artifacts touching peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of haunted theater trope through water-damaged code and timpanist's promise transforms familiar ghost story into personal commitment to unfinished art; risk in accumulative structure heightens stakes organically. Avoids stock echoes, but premise echoes classic tales without bolder subversion. Strong authenticity in voice and specifics like October 31 date.</comment>
