<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Kael's motivation to unyoke the viaduct is clear and rooted in traits like vigilance, intensifying through failed attempts that compel patient adjustments; interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions in his cursed breath and aching back during the night's work. Internal conflict shows contradictory impulses, as haste leads to failure but persistence earns success, foreclosing impatience with felt physical cost. The acolyte's brief interaction applies secondary pressure, revealing Kael's evolved values without stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned descriptions and gradual alignments, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where the viaduct's surge reweights the sanctuary's energy with conceptual cost of sustained patience; orientation anchors early in the frost-etched sanctuary. Closure lands on-page with the dawn shudder and later hum as lullaby, showing earned stasis and visible cost in Kael's tiredness. Minor redundancy in filing descriptions slightly dilutes density without breaking the pattern.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The basalt sanctuary and frozen lake are vividly specific, with sensory details like crunching frost and vibrating ice integrated into action; the environment constrains choices, as the moon's refraction through ice enables alignment and charges the final hum. Atmosphere amplifies the patient revolution theme through absorbed silence and lichen-pocked walls. Recurring viaduct as micro-setting shapes tactics and the closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of unyoking the viaduct signals early, with meaningful deepening in the failed attempt and overnight adjustments that narrow options under textural pressure; cost is legible in physical ache and foreclosed haste. Under Accumulative/Textural lens, density increases via filing spirals and vibrations, forcing stance crystallization in success. Agency drives the surge through Kael's persistence, though coincidence of the moon beam slightly complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of sculpting patience from impatience emerges organically from Kael's struggles and the viaduct's alignment, with subtext in gestures like brushing the surface and the filings' "debate"; the final image of the thawed lake with enduring hum offers a resonant, non-literal repricing of revolution as reorientation. Ambiguity lingers meaningfully in the acolyte's confusion, inviting reflection without confusion. No overt moralizing, though elder echoes border on statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and character-specific, with perceptual bias in Kael's focus on vibrations and moon paths; voice texture is distinct through rhythmic, purposeful syntax like "his gloved hands tracing the magnetic viaduct’s arc." Dialogue is natural, subtextual, and advances theme, as in Kael's advice to the acolyte pursuing goal of teaching patience. No head-hopping or unmotivated elision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in sentences like the frost-etched opening and resonant tone at dawn; metaphors are controlled and purposeful, avoiding muddle in peak beats. No significant loops or artifacts, with strong verbs and specific details propelling momentum. Final line recharges motifs effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The premise of harnessing magnetic power via moon paths in a basalt sanctuary offers fresh synthesis, transforming potential tropes through specific details like iron filings and fractal patterns; risk in lyric restraint heightens stakes without gimmickry. Originality shines in the non-violent "patient revolution," feeling inevitable from Kael's choices. No close echoes of familiar scenes.</comment>
