<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and rooted in curiosity and legacy, intensifying through micro-choices like activating the vial, with embodied emotions in trembling gloves and fogged visor; internal conflict shows in her renunciation of indifference, earning stasis with felt cost of obsolescence; the archivist's brief POV shift adds relational crucible without confusion, but some reflections verge on stock epiphanies, slightly softening specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Structure fits Accumulative/Textural lens with multi-shard mosaic (summit, base, future) taught early via reflective pattern and legible time jumps; orientation anchors quickly on the summit; closure lands as Conceptual Repricing with the photo's lingering truth reweighting humanity's fleeting presence, cost felt in melancholy indifference; one meaningful deepening via dawn's arrival tightens stakes, though final archivist shard risks diluting causal focus.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting vividly anchors the moonlit summit with purposeful details like dust, visor glow, and Earth's horizon, constraining choices (e.g., airless chill seeps through suit, pressuring timing); sensory hierarchy reflects Lira's urgency, narrowing to chronometer and gas spiral; micro-setting of vial and crater charges final image, mirroring internal melancholy without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of capturing the dawning hush signals early and deepens via drone arrival, forcing stance crystallization under textural lens; agency in vial activation forecloses indifference with felt cost of obsolescence; one meaningful tightening narrows options as dawn approaches, though coincidence of drones complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of outlasting time emerges organically from vial's dissolution and photo's archival linger, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in Lira's unknowing legacy; subtext in gas spiral and shadow reweights premise without statement; final image offers resonant non-literal answer, repricing conquest as mirror with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person close POV on Lira is stable with clean multi-POV shift to archivist at section break, maintaining coherent textural lens; perceptual signature biases toward curiosity in chemical details; prose texture distinct in rhythmic reflections, with purposeful compression in time jumps taught early; no dialogue, so policy skips those bullets.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, sentences advancing atmosphere and interiority (e.g., "Her gloves trembled as she positioned the vial"); rhythm varies naturally, avoiding loops or scaffold; figurative language like "spiral of golden gas" is selective without muddle, propelling to closure; zero artifacts touch peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Originality in synthesizing lunar inspection with chemical messaging offers fresh angle on legacy, transforming Space Age tropes through Lira's melancholy stance; risk in mosaic structure heightens stakes via archival payoff, feeling inevitable; avoids stock metaphors, committing to premise without hedging.</comment>
