<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's kindly methodical traits are shown through precise actions like mapping pipe chases and caching supplies, with embodied emotions in her sense memory reactions, but interiority occasionally slips into stock phrasing like "heart raced" without deeper contradiction. Motivation intensifies credibly to compel her basement exploration, earning the final renunciation of full invisibility with a felt cost of newfound visibility. No second character, so relationship bullets ignored; quick test met with contradictory impulses in her patience versus urgent hunch.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds with pattern of sense memory fragments building to resonant reconfiguration in the ending, where Mara's stance crystallizes as guardian with conceptual cost of reweighted invisibility. Orientation anchors who (Mara), where (library crawl space), and when (dawn after outage) within first paragraph, no penalty. Closure lands as Charged Poise with undeniable pressure in her feeling "seen" and planning to uncover more, shaped by persistent constraint of the library's hidden spaces.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The shadowed library at dawn is vividly specific with sapphire hush and pipe chases constraining Mara's movements, selectively filtered through her wiry familiarity, and it charges the final image of her returning to the crawl space with evolved meaning. Sensory details like metallic scent and mildew evolve with action, mirroring her internal shift without overt symbolism. Quick test met as the setting directly constrains her choices in the pipe chase and basement discovery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of tracing the reel's origin signals early and deepens through accumulating sense memories, forcing stance crystallization under Accumulative lens, but pressure remains mostly internal with low external opposition, making the single tightening (hearing voices) functional yet not fully narrowing options with visible cost. Agency in her decision to pry the grille and play the tape earns a trade-off in risking exposure, though coincidence of finding the decoder complicates without resolving. Quick test partially met with agency-driven deepening, but cost is more conceptual than unmistakable on page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of visibility and guardianship emerges organically from Mara's discoveries and the tape's message, with subtext in silences and implications like the chilling voices, inviting reflection on hidden lifelines without tidy morals. Final image offers resonant, non-literal answer by reweighting her invisibility as strength, tied to concrete particulars like the decoder cache. Quick test met, though some ambiguity borders on vagueness in the patrons' dependence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person close POV stays stable and modest, with perceptual signature in Mara's selective noticing of scents and hums biased by her dweller life; prose texture distinct in rhythmic, condensed syntax that modulates with urgency. No dialogue, so ignored; elision in sense memory fragments is taught early and pays off at closure without obscurity. Quick test met with rhythmic control under pressure in the basement scene.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in dawn's hush to the machine's hum, but minor paraphrase loops like repeated "sense memory" in adjacent lines dull momentum slightly without touching closure. Figurative language like "brittle as glass" is controlled, avoiding muddle; opening anchors voice strongly, final line recharges motifs cleanly. Quick test met with zero major loops and clear propulsion, though peak beats have occasional filter-verb stacks like "she’d noticed."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of crawl space dweller with ferromagnetic tape mystery transforms hidden-world trope through specific sense memories and library guardianship, feeling inevitable in hindsight without close echoes. Risk in textural accumulation heightens stakes organically, though premise borders on familiar urban fantasy without bolder subversion.</comment>
