<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael's motivation to transform scars into stories is clear and intensifies through embodied emotions, with contradictory impulses shown in his trembling hands and childhood rhyme recitation despite knowing superstitions are nonsense. Interiority is concrete, like scars itching as a map of failures, and the final endurance forecloses doubt with felt lightness as cost. Strength lies in micro-choices under pressure, such as dipping the quill and whispering "Shed," revealing values with visible transformation. No second character, so relationship bullets ignored; overall strong but caps at 8.7 per high-band gate without two-feature standard fully met.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure accumulates density through recurring motifs like breath and scars, leading to a Conceptual Repricing closure where scars shift to symbols with undeniable conceptual cost in the final image of thruming runes. Orientation anchors who (Kael), where (floating platform), and when (present ritual) by first paragraph, no penalty. Closure lands on-page with felt lightness and reshaped scars as cost, but lacks a persistent physical constraint shaping tactics beyond the quill. Strong pattern hold, but minor ellipsis in descent feels slightly unmotivated, holding below 9.0.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting vividly anchors with mist like spilled milk and moss-choked forest, constraining choices as the platform shudders during the rune flare, charging the final image of mist parting to reveal a path. Sensory details are selective and POV-biased, like humming air making ribs ache, mirroring internal tension without overt symbolism. Environment evolves causally, with trees roaring to life post-transformation, and the floating rock directly pressures the ritual. Meets 9+ test by constraining the climax and charging closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of transforming scars signals early, with meaningful deepening when ink crystallizes and scars glow, narrowing options to shedding fear under Accumulative/Textural lens. Agency in carving the sigil drives escalation, with felt cost in chest tightening and lightness, but coincidence of platform steadying slightly complicates without resolving. Pressure coheres to force stance crystallization at closure, but lacks a second visible trade-off for higher band. Strong but capped per lens guardrail without dominant hybrid shift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of transforming pain into power emerges organically from scars shifting to stories and the "breath between storms" reweighting fear as courage, without direct statements. Subtext in quill as relic and childhood rhyme invites reflection on rituals' validity, with resonant final image offering non-literal answer to shedding lies. Emotional aftereffect is concrete via gasping clarity, embracing ambiguity without confusion. Strong resonance, but minor thematic echo in mentor's quoted lesson trends it below 9.0.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in ink-stained fingers and scar-itching bias, modulating rhythm under stress like hitched breath during crystallization. Prose texture distinct in rhythmic metaphors, with purposeful compression in ritual sequence taught early and paid off at closure. No dialogue, so ignored; no head-hopping or elision issues. Meets 9+ test but caps at 8.8 per global gate without full two-feature elevation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with vivid images like liquid starlight ink advancing atmosphere and character, varying rhythm in short sentences during tension peaks. Minor overwriting in stacked metaphors (e.g., mist as spilled milk, edges softened) but no clarity loss at closure; no loops or artifacts touching ending. Information density high, with sentences multitasking, like quill glinting to build relic significance. Strong craft, but figurative density in high-pressure beats deducts slightly per check.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Originality in synthesizing rune magic with personal superstitions for scar transformation feels fresh, with non-obvious angle on mentor's metaphor becoming literal breath-held ritual. Tropes like relics and forests transformed through specific choices, like quill as extension of hand, committing to premise without retreat. Risk in lyric introspection heightens stakes organically, but proximity to familiar fantasy growth arcs holds below 9.0. Memorable perspective via scars as language elevates.</comment>
