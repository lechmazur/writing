<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira's motivation as a defiant, realistically imaginative skeptic is clear and intensifies through her breadcrumb-gathering choices, with embodied emotions like trembling hands under pressure; internal conflict between skepticism and imagination persists credibly, culminating in an earned endurance that accepts the cost of raw fingers and persistent doubt at closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned item collection with density increasing toward the marble's discovery, leading to a Decisive Change in the box's eruption and city's revival; orientation anchors early in the city's description; closure lands with visible cost in scraped fingers and conceptual repricing of doubt, though one more persistent constraint could elevate tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The city of forgotten fountains is vividly specific, with moss-covered mosaics and rusted gears constraining Lira's searches and charging the final gushing waters; sensory details like crunching boots and humming box integrate into action, mirroring her internal defiance; the setting evolves causally, pressuring choices like prying the drain to shape the closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of freeing memories escalates accumulatively through seven breadcrumbs plus the marble, with a meaningful deepening as the hum sharpens and options narrow to the central fountain; agency in her defiant persistence forecloses doubt with felt cost in raw fingers, though coincidence in the vision slightly complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of sidereal patience and defiant hope emerges organically from Lira's breadcrumb pursuit and skepticism, resonating in the final image of revived fountains without moralizing; subtext in the box's pulsing and her murmurs invites reflection on unseen echoes, with ambiguity in her lingering doubt adding complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable with perceptual bias in Lira's shadow-dissecting gaze; voice texture is distinctively poetic, with rhythmic syntax like "eyes like fractured starlight" modulating under pressure; brief self-dialogue advances her goal subtly; elision in the vision is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density in metaphorical layers like "bruised sky" and "ashen residue," advancing atmosphere without loops; some overwriting in stacked similes during the library scene muddles momentum slightly, but rhythm varies naturally and closure lines propel with clear propulsion; no major artifacts obscure the final eruption.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of fantastical memory-freeing via breadcrumbs in a silent city transforms trope of lost histories through Lira's skeptic-imaginative lens; risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes organically, feeling inevitable at the marble's clink without gimmickry.</comment>
