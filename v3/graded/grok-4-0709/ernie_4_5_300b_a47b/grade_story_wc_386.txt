<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Characterization is strong in Kael's interiority, with embodied emotions like his breath catching and chest aching under pressure, revealing contradictory impulses of caution and revelation; motivation roots in consistent traits, compelling the final renunciation of reckless exposure for woven truth, earning stasis with felt relational costs. Secondary characters, though off-page, apply pressure via dreams, but their status dynamics remain abstract, slightly limiting crucible depth. The sailor's ghost murmur stands out as a pivotal moment where Kael's flaw of careful weaving constrains his choice, heightening authenticity without stereotypes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through dream shards with patterned elision, teaching the mosaic early and landing a resonant reconfiguration via the globe's placement and shrine's hum, with conceptual cost of enduring connections made legible in the final image. Orientation anchors who, where, and when by the first paragraph, waiving any test penalty. One meaningful deepening suffices, as dream fragments tighten toward closure without causality breaks, though ellipsis between dreams risks minor ambiguity resolved at the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting vividly integrates the glacier's icy wall and candle-lit shrine, with sensory details like flickering shadows and humming ice constraining Kael's communion and charging the final flare; micro-setting of the globe as object-as-setting evolves causally, mirroring internal states through warped glass without overt symbolism. Tone tensions the ethereal with tactile cold, supporting theme organically. The shrine's glow in the penultimate paragraph most influences the score, as it reweights the environment's role in closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of exposing truth without shattering illusions signals early and deepens through dream analysis, forcing stance crystallization in the decision to weave rather than shout, with felt emotional cost in Kael's ache; under Accumulative lens, pattern of dreams escalates pressure coherently, though coincidence in dream access complicates without resolving. Agency via micro-choices like closing eyes and reaching out narrows options authentically. The third dream's clarity stands out, layering moral calculus between love and grief to sharpen the peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of fragile connections emerges organically from dream particulars and globe motif, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in the sailor's blame and widow's loss, eliciting resonant aftereffect through the final image's non-literal repricing of love's endurance. Subtext in gestures like placing the globe invites reflection on living-dead bonds without confusion. The core concept integrates via events, avoiding abstraction, with the ghost's murmur reweighting prior illusions powerfully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and apt, with perceptual signature biased toward whispers and ice, modulating rhythm under pressure like drifting mind and stirring presence; purposeful compression in dream shards is taught early and pays off at closure. Ghost's dialogue feels natural, carrying subtext of forgiveness, advancing plot via revelation. The voice's distinct texture in syntax like "windows, he often mused, were fragile things" heightens ingenuity without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with vivid, propulsion-driven sentences like "the ice around him seemed to hum," varying rhythm naturally without loops or scaffold; figurative language integrates purposefully, avoiding muddle in peak dreams. Minor synonym churn in "warped and... reduced to a silver smear" slightly dulls momentum but doesn't touch closure. The final line's image resolves with clear, resonant cadence, anchoring voice effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Originality shines in synthesizing wreck-diving with dream analysis for ghost communion, transforming tropes like haunted relics through specific glacier shrine and cameo method, feeling inevitable via Kael's careful weaving; risk in mosaic structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity in the widow's mirror-dream avoids generics, offering fresh angle on grief's endurance. The globe's reprise in the altar moment exemplifies non-obvious synthesis charging closure.</comment>
