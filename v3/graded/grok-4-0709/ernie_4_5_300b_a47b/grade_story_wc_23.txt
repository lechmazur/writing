<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to navigate loss is clear and intensifies through her building actions, rooted in consistent traits like reliance on the censer foot; interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions in her trembling hand and tears at the climax. Internal conflict shows in her steady hands despite "raw solace," revealing contradictory impulses under pressure. The final endurance earns a meaningful reconfiguration with felt emotional cost, as in her smile amid dirt-smudged tears.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the story builds through patterned phone calls and instructions, with density increasing toward a Resonant Reconfiguration in the spinning censer foot and chorus of voices; orientation anchors early in the signal station setting. Closure lands on-page with Charged Poise, reweighting options via summoned routes, and felt cost in Mara's tears and certainty amid vast loss. One meaningful cadence shift at dawn tightens the arc sufficiently for this length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The abandoned coast and starlit signal station are vividly anchored with sensory details like rusted antennae and salt air, filtered through Mara's POV; the environment constrains choices, as scrap metal from the hull enables building. Atmosphere supports the mystical tone, with the moon's phases mirroring internal shifts. The recurring censer foot as micro-setting charges the final spinning image, constraining and reweighting closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of summoning lost routes signals early and deepens through accumulative phone instructions, narrowing options with each cryptic directive; one meaningful intensification at the antenna's completion forces stance crystallization with felt emotional cost in tears. Pressure coheres under the Textural lens via pattern breaks like the foot's spin. Coincidence in the calls complicates but does not resolve, maintaining agency in Mara's obedience.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of reclaiming loss through memory emerges organically from images like the fluctuating censer foot and drowned coasts, with subtext in silences and implications of the grandmother's voice. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to navigating grief, reweighting the premise without moralizing. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality, embracing complexity in "raw solace."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and character-specific, with perceptual bias in Mara's focus on the foot's etchings; voice texture is distinct in rhythmic, patched descriptions like "skeletal fingers." Dialogue is minimal but subtextual, advancing via cryptic instructions that pursue the goal of building. Elision in the calls is patterned and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere through vivid images like "moon’s breath," but occasional figurative muddle in peak beats, such as stacked metaphors around the antenna, slightly dulls propulsion. Rhythm varies naturally, with strong verbs and specificity, though one paraphrase loop in the building sequence ("she began to build... she crafted") triggers minor drag. No major artifacts touch closure, preserving clarity in the final hum and spin.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The premise of reverse migration via a mystical censer foot offers a fresh synthesis of loss and navigation, transforming tropes like ghostly voices through specific details like hair-weaving tradition. Risk in the accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in the charged final image. Originality shines in the non-obvious angle on memory as geography, coherent as a singular vision.</comment>
