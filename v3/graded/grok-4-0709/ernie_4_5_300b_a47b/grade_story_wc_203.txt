<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to engage with ghosts over mere repair work is clear and rooted in his observant trait, intensifying to compel the climactic discovery; interiority is concrete, with embodied emotion in his shaking legs and tight chest, showing contradictory impulses like fear and empathy. However, the emotional progression feels somewhat tidy, lacking deeper irrationality or self-deception under stress. The final renunciation of isolation carries a felt cost, but secondary ghost characters apply pressure unevenly, trending functional rather than crucible-like.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the story builds through patterned details like dust swirls and cracks leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration in the ghosts' fading and Elias's understanding, with a felt emotional cost in his tight chest; orientation anchors who, where, and when by the first paragraph without debt. Causality holds via textural density increase, but the reveal feels slightly elliptical without a sharper pattern break at closure. The ending reweights knowledge effectively for this length, though one more tightening could elevate it.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The abandoned circus ticket office is vividly anchored with sensory details like cool metal and peeling laminate, filtered through Elias's observant POV; the setting constrains choices, as he climbs the counter to access the ceiling compartment, charging the final image of flickering light. Atmosphere supports the ghostly tone through dim haze and dust patterns, with coherent spatial choreography. Micro-setting like the elevator doors and counter evolves causally, mirroring internal discovery without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of acknowledging trapped ghosts signals early and deepens through the ceiling discovery, narrowing options to emotional repair with a felt cost in Elias's shaking legs and burden; under Accumulative lens, pressure accumulates via details, forcing stance crystallization in the thank-you whisper. One meaningful tightening suffices, but coincidence in the clown's pointing complicates without fully resolving, keeping agency internal. Stakes remain visceral, though internal conflict could interweave more sharply.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of hidden grief and emotional façades emerges organically from dust analysis and the hidden papers, culminating in a resonant final image that reweights repair without moralizing; subtext in ghostly whispers and the weightless burden invites reflection on unspoken stories. Emotional aftereffect is concrete via Elias's tight chest, avoiding sentimentality. However, ambiguity lingers mildly without stronger counter-readings, and the core concept integrates well but resists deeper complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and modest, with perceptual signature in Elias's dust-pattern noticing; voice texture is distinct in rhythmic, atmospheric prose, modulating with intensity like the whirring barrel. Dialogue is minimal but natural in the ghost's whisper, carrying subtext of gratitude. Some filter verbs dull immediacy in peak moments, like "he felt them," but no head-hopping or register mismatch occurs.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose advances atmosphere with vivid images like shadows as thin hands, maintaining momentum through concise sentences; information density is high in dust analysis, but occasional paraphrase loops, such as repeated "cracks" emphasis, create minor scaffold without obscuring closure. Rhythm varies naturally, though some metaphors mix slightly, like "weightless burden" recurring without evolution. No major artifacts touch the ending, but template cadence in action sequences deducts mildly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The premise of a ghost-seeing technician uncovering circus grief offers a fresh synthesis of occupational detail and supernatural elements, transforming tropes through specific dust patterns and the mainspring barrel; emotional specificity in the family's photo feels authentic. A non-obvious turn in the ceiling reveal heightens stakes organically. However, echoes of familiar ghost-story arcs limit boldness without stronger risk-taking.</comment>
