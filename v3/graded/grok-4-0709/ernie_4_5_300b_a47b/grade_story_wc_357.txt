<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to discover the planet's resilience is clear and rooted in her pilot traits, intensifying through the arrow tip's guidance to compel her cavern choice; interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions like clutching the tip and murmuring "Echoes," revealing contradictory impulses of exploitation versus protection. However, the epiphany at the climax feels slightly unearned, with therapy-speak in her realization of symbiosis reducing emotional contradiction to tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Under a Causal lens, the plot advances through because/therefore linkages, like the arrow tip warming to guide Lira to the cavern, culminating in an on-page Conceptual Repricing where inserting the tip reveals symbiosis with a felt cost of shifting from exploitation to guardianship; orientation anchors early with Lira in her glider over arches. A minor redundancy in vine descriptions slightly softens escalation without breaking causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The orchard planet's floating rock arches and inverting gravity vividly anchor the setting, with sensory details like crunching gravel and glowing water spheres filtered through Lira's pilot bias; the environment constrains choices, as the massive arch houses the cavern, charging the final image of golden vines. Micro-setting of the arrow tip functions as a recurring object that guides and reweights the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake of discovering resilience escalates causally through gravity's waver tightening options, forcing Lira's insertion of the tip; one meaningful deepening occurs as the tip vibrates, narrowing her path to the pedestal with a visible cost in the forever-seeming inversion. However, coincidence in the tip fitting perfectly resolves pressure too neatly without protagonist-driven complication.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of resilience as symbiotic adaptation emerges organically from events like vines thrashing yet strengthening, culminating in a resonant final image of Lira guarding echoes without stated moral; subtext in the arrow tip's warmth implies stored energy, inviting reflection on bending to chaos. The core concept integrates well but risks tidy moralizing in the symphony metaphor at the end.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable, with perceptual signature in Lira's biased noticing of vines and water flows; voice texture is distinct through rhythmic descriptions like "whirling silence," modulating with pressure. Minor register drift into elevated diction, such as "gathering of echoes," feels slightly unmotivated for her pilot idiom.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere through vivid images like vines coiling like serpents; rhythm varies naturally, but minor paraphrase loops in vine growth descriptions (e.g., pulsing, rapid, forming lattice) dull momentum slightly without obscuring closure. No major artifacts touch the climax, and strategic telling compresses navigation effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The premise of a symbiotic orchard planet with gravity inversions offers fresh synthesis, transforming sci-fi tropes through Lira's shift from machine-hunter to guardian; risk-taking in the conceptual repricing heightens stakes organically. Details like the arrow tip's alloy feel particular and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
