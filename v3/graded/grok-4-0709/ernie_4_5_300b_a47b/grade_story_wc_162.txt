<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and rooted in her traits, intensifying through embodied interiority like tracing the wood grain to reveal resolve; internal conflict shows in her featherly determination amid regret, with the final step through the door earned by prior micro-choices. Father as secondary character applies pressure but lacks depth in his brief appearance. Some emotions feel slightly stock, as in the mosaic of relief and regret, but contradictions act in scene without therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through patterned elisions of codes and grains toward a Conceptual Repricing closure where Lira reweights thresholds with felt cost in the wavering door and lingering hush; orientation anchors early in the prism terrace above the cornfield. One meaningful deepening suffices, as the hum reveals the path, but causality feels elliptical in the door's materialization without stronger linkage to her writing. No orientation penalty applies, as disorientation serves the maze theme and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the drifting prism terrace and cornfield constraining choices, like the refracted light revealing paths and mirroring Lira's fractured memories; sensory details are selective, biased through her POV, and the environment charges the final image of the gone terrace. Micro-setting of the wood grain functions as setting by guiding her navigation. No white-room issues; details evolve causally, supporting theme without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of mapping necessary distances tightens through one meaningful deepening when the prisms align to reveal the path, narrowing options under Accumulative/Textural lens; agency in her intuition and writing the code forces stance crystallization with visible cost in stepping through, foreclosing revisitation. Pressure coheres but coincidence in the door's appearance complicates without fully resolving, trending mid-high. Moral calculus sharpens in choosing to walk away to see closeness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of sacred thresholds emerges organically from images like spiraling grains and wavering doors, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in the butterfly effect's ripples; subtext in silences and implications, like the father's regret, invites reflection. Ending offers resonant, non-literal answer via her new codes, reweighting distances as prayer without statement. No thematic echo penalty, as insights arise from particulars like analyzing the grain.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable and apt, with distinct perceptual signature in Lira's biased noticing of grains and codes; prose texture is lyrical and rhythmic, modulating with pressure, as in the humming floorboards. Brief dialogue feels natural and subtextual, advancing reunion without exposition. No head-hopping or register mismatch; purposeful compression in reflections pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied rhythm in lines like "fractured hush that muffled even the wind," advancing atmosphere without loops; metaphors are coherent, though some like "mosaic of relief and regret" border on mixed. No major artifacts or scaffold, but minor synonym churn in "hush" repetitions slightly dulls momentum in the final third. Clarity high, with strong verbs and purposeful syntax supporting the lyrical mode.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Originality shines in synthesizing maze lore with prisms, codes, and drifting architecture, transforming tropes through Lira's specific intuition and grain analysis; fresh angle on butterfly effect as change ripples feels inevitable. Risk in elliptical structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. No derivative premise, as emotional complexity avoids generics.</comment>
