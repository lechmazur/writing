<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to restore sacred order is clear and intensifies through her curse-driven visions, compelling rearrangements with embodied emotion like trembling hands and tears; interior conflict shows contradictory impulses in her adjustments, earning the final renunciation of control with felt cost. Strengths include concrete interiority rooted in her eel herder traits, avoiding stock phrasing. A minor slip is the somewhat diagnostic self-talk in "her curse twisting the promise into a knot," but it doesn't undermine the closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned visions and rock sequences, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing where Lira reweights the promise as honoring patterns, with legible cost in her tears and the fraying visions; orientation anchors early with Lira on the tidal bluff under aurora. The final image reconfigures meaning effectively, though one ellipsis in vision shifts feels slightly unmotivated without stronger textural linkage.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The tidal bluff under aurora is vividly specific, with damp sand and frictionless tide constraining Lira's actions and charging the final eels' movement; sensory details like salt spray and pulsing light are purposeful, mirroring her interior state. The setting evolves causally, such as rocks bleeding into sand, and directly shapes the closure by enabling the pattern revelation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of restoring sacred order tightens through accumulating visions and rock adjustments, with a meaningful deepening when the storm vision forces reconfiguration, narrowing options under the Accumulative lens; cost is felt in her terror and tears, charging the final poise. Coincidence in eel responses complicates without resolving, but the escalation relies slightly on passive visions rather than pure agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of honoring chaotic patterns over controlling them emerges organically from Lira's failed sequences and final realization, with subtext in the space between eels and rocks; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal repricing without moralizing. Emotional aftereffect lingers through her tears mingling with salt spray, embracing ambiguity without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in Lira's curse-tangled visions and embodied details like boots sinking; voice modulates rhythmically with pressure, using purposeful compression in vision shifts. Minimal dialogue is natural and subtextual, like her muttered "Understand the patterns." No head-hopping or unwarranted certainty, though one register drift into elevated diction like "sacred geometries" feels slightly unmotivated for her herder voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in lyrical sentences like the aurora's "liquid green and violet" advancing atmosphere; no major loops or artifacts, though one paraphrase near-duplicate in vision descriptions slightly dulls momentum. Information propels forward, with strong verbs and specific imagery, but a mixed metaphor in "star dust screamed" muddles briefly without harming closure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of eel herding with mathematical sequences and precognitive curse feels inevitable, transforming fantasy tropes through specific details like Fibonacci spirals and collapsed star dust; risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, as in the Möbius strip pattern charging the closure. No close echoes of familiar scenes, with authenticity in the herder's worldview.</comment>
