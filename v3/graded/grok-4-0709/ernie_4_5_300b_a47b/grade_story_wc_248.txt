<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clearly rooted in her grandmother's promise, intensifying through her actions to compel the climactic painting that reveals the truth, with embodied emotions like tears providing felt cost. Interiority is concrete and particular, showing contradictory impulses in her "volcanic tenderness" as she tends with fire and ink. However, some stock phrasing, such as "heart pounding," slightly dilutes specificity under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned motifs and symbolic additions, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration in the healing portrait that reweights the archive as a living garden with emotional cost in Mara's tears. Orientation anchors early in the shadowed halls, with no disorientation debt. One meaningful cadence shift at the revelation suffices for this length, though causality feels more textural than strictly motivated in spots.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The lost civilization archive is vividly specific, with humming air and shivering walls that constrain Mara's choices and charge the final image of the healing portrait. Sensory details are purposeful, filtered through her analytical intuition, and the setting evolves causally as she moves rooms. A recurring object like the self-portrait constrains the closure, elevating this to high strength.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of rescuing the forgotten promise tightens through accumulative pressure in the chambers, with one deepening in the portrait's healing that reweights options via conceptual cost. Agency manifests in Mara's deliberate artistic acts, foreclosing paths with felt emotional price in her tears. However, escalation feels somewhat static, lacking a sharper trade-off under the textural lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of knowledge as alive and revisitable emerges organically from Mara's actions and the garden metaphor, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer in the final realization without stated moral. Subtext operates through symbols like the serpent and keyhole, inviting reflection on generational stories. Emotional aftereffect is concrete, avoiding sentimentality in the tearful closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable and apt, with perceptual signature biased toward analytical details like brushstrokes and symbols. Voice has distinct texture in rhythmic, poetic syntax that modulates with intensity, such as in the murmuring dialogue. Minor elision in backstory is taught and paid off, enhancing closure legibility.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere through vivid images like "charred edges" and "obsidian ink," but occasional overwrought metaphors, such as "volcanic tenderness," create minor muddle without harming closure clarity. Rhythm varies naturally, though some paraphrase loops in reflective blocks slightly drag momentum. No major artifacts touch the peak revelation beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Original synthesis of arson as translation and archive as garden offers a fresh angle on preservation, transformed through Mara's specific choices like painting symbols that lead to the hidden message. Risk-taking in the textural structure heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry. The premise feels inevitable in hindsight, with emotional complexity avoiding tropes.</comment>
