<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to collect wall stories is clear and intensifies through discoveries, rooted in his perceptive traits, with embodied emotions like trembling fingers showing internal conflict; the final acknowledgment feels earned by prior piecing of clues, foreclosing indifference with a conceptual cost of releasing silence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through layered discoveries with coherent orientation by the first paragraph; closure lands as Conceptual Repricing with the dragons unfurling and stories rising, reweighting ignored dreams with undeniable conceptual cost in the final hum, though one more persistent constraint could elevate it further.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The reclaimed silo library anchors early and constrains choices, with rusting walls and fireplace debris pressuring Elias's probing; sensory details like ash scent and lantern glow evolve to charge the final image of vibrating walls, mirroring his perceptual shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving lingering stories tightens through accumulating insights from diaries and tapestry, deepening via the axis realization that forces stance crystallization; under Accumulative/Textural lens, pattern break in the dragons stirring escalates with legible conceptual cost, though agency feels more recognitive than decisive.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of ignored stories shifting reality emerges organically from Elias's discoveries, with subtext in the fleeing dragons and Clara's entries; the final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to listening versus indifference, reweighting the premise without moralizing, though some direct statements like "the displaced axis had shifted back" border on explicit.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person close POV stays stable with Elias's perceptual signature in sensitive tracing and transcribing, voice modulating rhythmically under dusk's pressure; no dialogue, but prose texture distinct in curved walls and rust scent, with purposeful compression in diary fragments paying off at closure without elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in discoveries like sifting ashes, though occasional figurative stacks like "bones of a forgotten god" and "dying leaves" risk muddle but serve texture; no loops or artifacts obscure closure, propulsion strong to the humming chorus.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of silo as story repository with perceptual axis shift transforms familiar lost-knowledge tropes through Elias's particular probing; risk in supernatural unfurling heightens stakes organically, feeling inevitable from embedded clues without gimmickry, though premise echoes archival fantasy slightly.</comment>
