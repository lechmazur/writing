<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lirael's motivation to catalog and investigate is clear and rooted in her softly deliberate nature, intensifying to compel the high-stakes choice of speaking "Bloom" with emotional cost in her tears; interiority is concrete but occasionally stock, as in her mind racing without deeper contradictory impulses. Thalos as secondary character applies pressure effectively through dialogue and the second stone, forcing her stance crystallization. The final renunciation of alerting the council earns credibility via prior micro-choices like pausing to compare footage.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Under Causal lens, because/therefore linkages hold from the shadow's appearance to Lirael's investigation and the word "Bloom" triggering transformation, with one meaningful tightening in superimposing footage; closure is a Decisive Change with Resonant Reconfiguration as the shadow dissolves into motes reshaping books, carrying felt emotional cost in her tears and hope's growth. Orientation anchors who (Lirael), where (blooming library above clouds), and when (third day after dreams shareable) by ~120 words without disorientation. Persistent constraint of the stone's symbol shapes tactics leading to the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The blooming library above clouds is vividly specific with petrified petal shelves humming magic and glass dome tracing dusk, constraining choices like accessing vaults for footage; it charges the final image as petals brighten and books rearrange, mirroring hope's bloom. Sensory details are purposeful, filtered through Lirael's sharp eyes, with environmental evolution from dimming lights to resonant hum supporting the metamorphosis without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving hope's shape escalates causally from the shadow's hunt to comparing footage, tightening meaningfully when stones align and she speaks "Bloom," narrowing options with visible cost in the shadow's fragility and her hesitant swallow; agency drives the reversal through her deliberate action, though coincidence of Thalos's timely arrival complicates without resolving. Moral calculus between reshaping hope or shattering it sharpens the peak choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of hope's mutable shape emerges organically from the shadow's metamorphosis and stones as keys, culminating in a resonant final image of motes settling on shelves without stated moral, reweighting prior footage and symbols; subtext in whispers and regret adds complexity, inviting reflection on diffusion post-dream-sharing. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality through her tears and the library's transformation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person close POV to Lirael is stable with distinct perceptual signature in sharp-eyed noticing of dusk and pulsing stone, modulating rhythm under pressure like her hesitant swallow; dialogue carries subtext and advances plot naturally, distinguishing voices with Thalos's luminous regret. Some filter verbs dull immediacy in reflective moments, but elision of the word's discovery is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose advances momentum with varied rhythm and specific verbs like "cradled" and "pulsed," but occasional paraphrase loops (e.g., shadow as glitch then real) and mixed metaphors (e.g., robes of spider silk and starlight) create minor density issues without obscuring closure; information is dense in the footage superposition beat, with clean grammar overall. Final line resolves by recharging the bloom motif effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dream-sharing tech with magical library and hope's metamorphosis transforms familiar artifact tropes through specific details like petrified petals and timeline footage, feeling inevitable at the spiral's dissolution; risk in conceptual repricing of hope heightens stakes without gimmickry. Avoids derivative premise by committing to implications of shared time.</comment>
