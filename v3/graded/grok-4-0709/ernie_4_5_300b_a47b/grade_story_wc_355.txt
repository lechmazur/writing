<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lirael's motivation to catalog silences is clear and intensifies through her persistent humming and device assembly, revealing embodied contradictions like flinching at fireworks yet continuing; interiority is concrete and particular, avoiding stock phrasing, with micro-choices under pressure earning the final renunciation of force. Strengths include consistent traits shown through actions, such as intuitively rummaging tools, and a credible endurance that forecloses forceful methods with felt emotional cost in the kinship realization. No second character, so relationship bullets ignored; single flaw is minor over-articulation in one reflective moment, but it doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds density through layered silences and vibrations, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing closure where the diary's opening reweights silence as a bridge with conceptual cost in carrying it forward; orientation anchors who (Lirael), where (workshop), and when (before fireworks) by paragraph two, no penalty. Strengths: pattern of resonance taught early and paid off at the clasp click, with one meaningful deepening in the humming sequence; minor slip in ellipsis of reading details, but closure lands on-page with undeniable pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the shadowed workshop's clutter constraining choices like rummaging for tools, and the stars/fireworks framing urgency that charges the final image of walking into celebration; sensory details are selective, biased through Lirael's attuned perception, integrating into action without stalling. Micro-setting of the diary and oscilloscope functions as environment that directly enables the climax; no anachronisms, spatial choreography coherent in her movements to the window.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of decoding silence tightens through the humming escalation, deepening via resonance that narrows options from force to vibration, with agency in her pitch adjustments forcing stance crystallization under fireworks pressure; cost is felt in the emotional reconfiguration of family grief. Under Accumulative lens, one decisive intensification suffices, with coincidence of fireworks complicating but not resolving; strength in moral calculus between force and patience, but stakes remain somewhat abstract until the entry quote.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of silence as a resonant language emerges organically from particulars like the tuning fork and diary entries, culminating in a non-literal resonant answer that reweights empathy without moralizing; subtext in gestures like palm-pressing and humming invites reflection on unspoken grief. Emotional aftereffect is concrete through her kinship and bridge metaphor, embracing complexity without tidy resolution; strength in the final image repricing silence, avoiding platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in Lirael's attuned noticing of vibrations and static, modulating rhythm under pressure like shortening sentences during humming; no dialogue, so those bullets ignored. Prose texture distinct in lyrical syntax reflecting her eclectic mind, with purposeful compression in reflective blocks anchored by cues like the clasp; no head-hopping or register drift, elision of some entries paid off in realization.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied rhythm in sentences like the humming sequence accelerating tension, and high information density in integrated descriptions; minor artifact in one paraphrase loop around silence ("silence was not emptiness but a language"), but it doesn't obscure closure. Strengths: clean grammar, strong verbs, and final line recharging motifs without redundancy; no major overwriting, though figurative language borders thick in workshop description, yet serves atmosphere.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Originality shines in synthesizing diary-unlocking with frequency tuning, transforming trope of inherited secrets through Lirael's pacifist vibration method, feeling inevitable via setup like grandmother's radio; risk in theatrical sincerity heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity in cataloging silences avoids generics, with fresh inflection in the resonance climax; no close echoes of famous scenes, premise committed fully.</comment>
