<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to prove her theory is clear and intensifies through embodied emotions, with contradictory impulses evident in her creeping doubt during visions; the final renunciation feels earned by prior causality, foreclosing her path of validation with the visible cost of bitter laughter and peace. Interiority is concrete and particular, avoiding stock phrasing. No second character on-page, so relationship bullets are ignored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned images and emotional density to a Conceptual Repricing closure where Mara realizes the quartz mirrors emotions, with felt cost in her shattered assumptions and freeing laugh; orientation anchors early at the quartz arbor. One meaningful cadence shift at the shattering frost suffices for length. Causality holds without breaks, though some visions feel elliptical but pay off at ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The quartz arbor and mist are vividly specific, with sensory details like cold veined stone and swirling mist constraining Mara's choices and charging the final image of the clearing mist and silent sentinel; the car window's frost evolves causally, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism. Micro-setting of the prism and frost integrates into action, enhancing atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of proving objects absorb emotions signals early and deepens through visions, forcing stance crystallization under Accumulative/Textural lens with the cost of distorted assumptions legible in the shattering frost and revelation; one tightening at intensified visions narrows options, though coincidence of the crack complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of projected emotions versus absorbed truths emerges organically from Mara's experiences and the arbor's mirroring, with subtext in images like frost patterns inviting reflection; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal repricing without moralizing, reweighting her yearning for validation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Consistent close third-person POV with Mara's perceptual signature in storm-cloud eyes and pattern-noticing; voice texture is distinct in rhythmic, lyric prose modulating with intensity, like whispering to the frost. Brief dialogue advances plot subtextually; no head-hopping or untaught elision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm and syntax to propel beats, as in the pulsing arbor light; no loops or artifacts obscure closure, though some similes like "frozen lightning" border on ornate but serve atmosphere without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mysticism and emotional projection transforms familiar tropes through specific details like the prism-channeling method, feeling inevitable in the revelation; risk in the mirroring twist heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
