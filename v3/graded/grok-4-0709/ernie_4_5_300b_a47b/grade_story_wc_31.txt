<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in grief over Lila, intensifying through embodied memories like the key tag's burn, compelling his quest; interiority is concrete and contradictory, showing his hiding behind truth as a flaw that compounds until the library realization forecloses denial with felt emotional cost. The single-POV focus excels in revealing values through micro-choices, such as entering the water despite cold, but minor stock phrasing in emotional labels slightly dulls specificity at peak moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned images and elisions toward a Conceptual Repricing closure where Elias reweights his grief via the color of sound, with undeniable conceptual cost in the final whisper and walk home; orientation anchors early in the docks scene. One meaningful cadence shift in the library suffices, but a slight elision in transitioning to the pristine room feels under-motivated, though it pays off at closure without breaking causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The harbor and sunken library are vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like groaning planks and brine-thick air filtered through Elias's bias, constraining his choices (e.g., wading into cold water) and charging the final image of parting waves; the micro-setting of the desk and books directly enables the resonant reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of discovering the color of sound tightens through accumulative pressure in the library, forcing a stance crystallization with felt cost in releasing the vow; one deepening via the book's hum narrows options, but coincidence of the key fitting perfectly complicates without resolving, slightly softening agency at the peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of luminous vows as heart's language emerges organically from images like sky lanterns and the book's light, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer at the desk that reweights memory without moralizing; subtext in silences and implications enriches ambiguity, avoiding sentimentality through complex grief.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in Elias's light-focused noticing, and rhythmic prose modulates with pressure (e.g., short sentences in the water); purposeful compression in reflections is taught early and pays off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied rhythm and strong verbs, advancing atmosphere through metaphors like "groaned like old bones"; minor synonym loops in descriptive openers (e.g., repeated wind and glow motifs) appear but do not obscure closure, and high information density shines in the library beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes grief with magical realism in a non-obvious way, transforming tropes like sunken treasures into a fresh quest for sound's color; risk-taking in lyric density heightens stakes organically, feeling inevitable at the desk reprise without gimmickry.</comment>
