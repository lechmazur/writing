<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to thresh meaning from cosmic signals is clear and intensifies through embodied uncertainty, with contradictory impulses shown in her confident hesitation before editing; interiority is concrete and particular, avoiding stock phrasing, and her final edit reveals a hierarchy of values with felt cost in the station's dimming lights.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned images like seeds and filaments toward a Resonant Reconfiguration in the editing scene, with orientation anchored early via the viewport and anomaly; closure lands as Charged Poise with conceptual cost in propagated echoes, though one minor elision in cause-effect for the pen's vibration slightly softens linkage.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The gravitational anomaly constrains choices by twisting light-cones and pressuring the edit, charging the final image of realigned starlight; sensory details are vivid and POV-filtered, like recycled air tasting of regret, with micro-setting of the pen and scroll integrating into action purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of interpreting signals escalates through anomaly flares and pen vibrations, deepening via one meaningful tightening in the editing act that narrows options with visible cost in borrowed power and floating; pressure coheres under textural lens, forcing stance crystallization on uncertainty, though coincidence in the burst slightly complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of embracing uncertainty in interpretation emerges organically from images like pruning branches and contingent filaments, culminating in a resonant final image that reweights the premise without moralizing; subtext in the pen's dryness as metaphor for contingency adds complexity, inviting reflection on editing one's narrative.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single-POV third-person is stable with distinct perceptual signature in poetic, metaphor-rich texture; syntax and rhythm modulate with pressure, like fragmented breaths during editing, and purposeful compression in anomaly descriptions is taught early and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied rhythm, strong verbs, and integrated metaphors like "garbled lullabies" advancing atmosphere; no loops or artifacts obscure clarity, though one mixed metaphor in "confidence flickered; uncertainty steadied" is minor and doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sci-fi editing history with poetic gardening metaphors transforms tropes through specific details like meteoric iridium pen and contingent relationships, heightening stakes in a non-obvious way; risk in nonlinear causality pays off in resonant ambiguity without gimmickry.</comment>
