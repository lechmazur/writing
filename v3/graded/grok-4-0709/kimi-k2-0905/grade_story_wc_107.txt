<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to craft safe zones from grief is clear and intensifies through micro-choices like narrating tasks and repurposing objects, revealing embodied emotions and internal contradictions without stock phrasing; her final renunciation of carrying the dome forecloses fleeing with visible cost in emotional realignment, though single-POV limits relationship crucibles.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure anchors early in the thawing control room and builds through patterned imagery to a Resonant Reconfiguration in leaving the dome, with felt cost in thawed heart; one meaningful deepening suffices, but lacks a persistent constraint shaping tactics beyond thaw metaphor.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The abandoned control room and thawing ice vividly anchor and constrain choices, with sensory details like dripping rivulets and metallic scents mirroring internal melt; recurring objects like the bookmark charge the final image, evolving causally to reinforce atmosphere without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of crafting emotional sanctuary tightens through deepening imagery of thaw and narration, culminating in stance crystallization with felt cost of realigned sorrow; one meaningful cadence shift reweights options under textural lens, though agency leans toward endurance without sharp reversal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of thawing grief into hope emerges organically from images like melting ice and glass dome, offering resonant ambiguity in the final invitation without moralizing; subtext in narration and objects reweights premise with conceptual cost, avoiding abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-person close POV filters perceptions through Mara's bias, with distinct rhythmic texture in playful narration modulating under emotional intensity; purposeful compression in lyric mode teaches pattern early, paying off at closure without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with vivid, propulsion-driven sentences varying rhythm naturally, weaving metaphors like "ice sliding off the roof like a defeated army" without muddle; minor synonym churn in thaw descriptions avoids touching closure, maintaining clarity and concision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of glassblowing, narration, and thaw transforms familiar grief tropes through specific details like mercury dreams and magnetic tape reinforcements, committing boldly to weighty lightness without hedging; risk in lyric structure heightens resonance organically.</comment>
