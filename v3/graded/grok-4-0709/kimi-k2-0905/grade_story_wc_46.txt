<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation to share light without fire is clear and intensifies through embodied interiority, with contradictory impulses in memories driving micro-choices like the polishing ritual; the weighing moment where her heartbeat matches the grotto's drip reveals a hierarchy of values with felt cost, earning a meaningful renunciation as the pearl dissolves.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through patterned reflections and ritual beats to a Resonant Reconfiguration in the pearl's dissolution, with conceptual cost legible in the absence-as-fullness; orientation anchors early in the grotto, and one meaningful deepening via the seawater drop pays off at closure without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The serpentine grotto's mist and calcite veins vividly constrain and enable Lira's ritual, with sensory details like the salt-sweet breath mirroring her internal hush; the setting charges the final mirror image, evolving causally as walls smooth and light scatters, making it indispensable to the reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of sharing non-burning light tightens through the polishing and weighing, with agency in Lira's choices forcing a trade-off as the pearl gains weight and dissolves; under the textural lens, cadence shifts at the seawater drop deepen pressure with felt cost, though coincidence in the drop slightly complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of quiet reflection as a shareable light emerges organically from images like the pearl's vortex and dissolving sigh, offering a resonant non-literal answer to fear of darkness; subtext in memories and grotto hum invites ambiguity without confusion, reweighting the premise in the final rooftop image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable with a distinct perceptual signature in Lira's biased noticing of pulses and glimmers; prose texture in rhythmic, patterned diction teaches lyric compression early, paying off at closure without head-hopping or elision issues, modulating under emotional intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with varied rhythm and syntactic propulsion, free of loops or artifacts; figurative language like "zephyr bloom cool" integrates purposefully without muddle, advancing atmosphere in peak beats like the flare, with the final line recharging motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of star-watching and ritual alchemy transforms familiar memory tropes through specific grotto constraints and non-burning light premise; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes organically, feeling inevitable in the dissolving pearl without gimmickry or derivative echoes.</comment>
