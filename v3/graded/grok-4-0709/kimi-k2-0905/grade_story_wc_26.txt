<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to preserve hope is clear and intensifies through embodied choices, like rubbing the stone and comparing footage, revealing contradictory impulses in her final renunciation with felt cost. Interiority is concrete and particular, with emotions embodied in her chest's shadow stir and pulse-recording. The daughter's promise crucible drives inevitable mistakes, compounded by the shadow's whisper, leading to earned stasis in locking the vault.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through image density and cadence shifts, from dusk-watching to vault-locking, with resonant reconfiguration in Mira becoming the violet afterimage with conceptual cost of vanishing. Orientation anchors early with Mira on the balcony, and one meaningful deepening via footage comparison pays off at closure. Minor elision in dream pollen release doesn't break lens coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The blooming library above clouds is vivid and purposeful, with orchid-walls exhaling perfume and shelves opening petals, constraining choices like carrying the stone to the vault and charging the final image of dimming petals. Sensory details reflect Mira's urgency, filtered through her sharp-eyed bias, mirroring internal hope via glowing pollen. Micro-setting of the stone as evolving object heightens atmosphere without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving unshareable hope signals early and deepens via stone's warming and metamorphosis, forcing stance crystallization with felt cost in Mira's vanishing. Pressure accumulates texturally through shadow's press and dream pollen, narrowing options without coincidence resolving. One meaningful intensification in the projection beam dance charges the charged poise ending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of hope's unshareable shape emerges organically from stone's evolution and footage comparison, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in luminous regret. Subtext in silence and images, like the shadow's tenderness, invites reflection on loss and lightness. Final image offers resonant, non-literal repricing of hope as folded wings without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable and apt, with perceptual signature in Mira's violet-shade cataloguing and pulse-recording, modulating rhythm under pressure like the trembling library. Prose texture is distinct in poetic syntax and diction, teaching patterned elision in dream interleaving without head-hopping. No dialogue, so policy skips those bullets; elision pays off in closure's afterimage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in sentences like "the stone warmed, which it had never done," advancing atmosphere without loops or artifacts. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, like "oceans of gold hope," heightening propulsion in peak beats. Final line recharges motifs with clear, integrated imagery; zero scaffold or muddle touches closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise of shareable dreams and unshareable hope offers fresh synthesis, transformed through specific details like the stone's tiny planet and vault heartbeat. Risk in lyric mosaic heightens stakes organically, feeling inevitable in hindsight via mother's promise. No trope echoes; authenticity coheres in bold, singular vision of luminous regret.</comment>
