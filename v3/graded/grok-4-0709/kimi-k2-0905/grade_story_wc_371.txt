<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mila's motivation as a "creeping normality noticer" is clear and intensifies through her gentle handling of the bread, revealing contradictory impulses in her fear of sealing amnesia versus planting it for resurrection. Interiority is concrete and embodied, with emotions like tears salting the crust showing realistic layering without therapy-speak. The gardener applies secondary pressure effectively, forcing choices that alter relationships by the end. Final endurance forecloses forgetting with felt cost, but minor stock phrasing in early traits slightly limits distinction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds with pattern breaks like bread planting reweighting stakes across shards; closure lands as Conceptual Repricing with undeniable cost in ongoing liturgy against forgetting. Orientation anchors who (Mila), where (city/palace), and when (after birds fly south) by ~100 words, waiving any penalty. Mosaic structure with ~4-5 shards taught early via drifting city, legible transitions, and coherent ending lens. Minor ellipsis in time jumps feels motivated but could tighten causality slightly more for peak band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting vividly anchors in the overgrown palace courtyard and narrowing alleys, with sensory details like soil under nails and tea-steam sighs filtered through Mila's bias, constraining choices like guerrilla planting. Environment evolves causally, mirroring internal resurrection as mosaics brighten and shops uncloak. Recurring courtyard charges the final image, meeting 9+ test by reweighting absolution. Tone tensions the hush with subtle hope, avoiding overt symbolism while supporting theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><grade>Under Accumulative lens, dominant stake of cultivating absolution tightens through pattern break of planting bread, forcing stance crystallization with felt cost in tears and tenuous ongoing effort. One meaningful deepening via crumbs on lips changes knowledge, narrowing options against forgetting. Agency in renunciation of eating the loaf forecloses amnesia with visible price, charging final image. Coincidence of finding bread complicates but doesn't resolve, though escalation could deepen one more layer for higher band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of sacred in the ordinary emerges organically from bread as resurrection and guerrilla gardening, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in tenuous absolution. Subtext in gestures like whispering erased names invites reflection through complexity, eliciting emotional aftereffect via final reconfiguration. Ending offers resonant, non-literal answer by revealing continuity, reweighting premise without statement. Minor risk of pseudo-profundity in "private liturgy" slightly tempers resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-person close POV with clean free indirect style; perceptual signature selective via Mila's noticing drift, with rhythmic control in poetic syntax heightening pressure without obscurity. Dialogue natural and subtextual, like "Guilt rises like yeast; plant it," advancing plot via implication. Patterned elision in lyric mode taught early and paid off at closure, no head-hopping. Distinct texture in word choice like "heuristically gentle" fits voice, meeting 9+ test.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose dense with propulsion, varying rhythm in sentences like "bread is daily resurrection" advancing atmosphere without loops; zero scaffold or synonym churn, high information density. Figurative language coherent, no muddle in peak beats like frost night uncloaking. Clarity and concision strong, with strategic telling compressing weeks effectively. Minor template cadence in early descriptions slightly limits to under 9.0, but closure image clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of urban decay with magical realism via guerrilla gardening feels inevitable, transforming tropes like vanishing city through specific choices like bread-born herbs spelling names. Bold risk in lyric mosaic heightens stakes without gimmickry, offering fresh angle on memory and absolution. Emotional specificity avoids generics, with authenticity in voice. Proximity to famous motifs (e.g., bread as symbol) transformed organically, but could push one more non-obvious inflection for higher.</comment>
