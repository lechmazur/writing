<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to survive by transforming the temple's hush is clear and intensifies through embodied guilt and micro-choices, like uncorking the vial despite fear of wasting her last anchor; interior conflict shows contradictory impulses in her reluctance to flee versus diving deeper; the final endurance forecloses solitude with felt cost in burning lungs, earning high marks for single-POV depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through resonant images and a cadence shift at the organ's activation, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost in adopted memories; orientation anchors early in the flooded nave; one meaningful deepening via the vial suffices, though causality feels more poetic than strictly motivated in the scent-to-frequency translation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The forgotten underwater temple is vividly specific with cracked lapis tiles, coral-grown organ, and peeling murals that constrain Mira's choices and charge the final image of broadcasting lilac blossoms; sensory details are purposeful and POV-filtered, evolving causally as tendrils loosen; this micro-setting pressures tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><grade>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, the dominant stake of survival amid shrinking air tightens through one decisive intensification when the vial activates the organ, forcing stance crystallization with felt cost in burning lungs; agency drives the deepening via Mira's choices, though coincidence in the reply's timing slightly complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of transforming loneliness into resonant memory emerges organically from particulars like the lilac drop and temple's adoption of Mira's past, offering a non-literal answer that reweights solitude without moralizing; subtext in images like startled glassfish invites ambiguity; the final image elicits emotional aftereffect through earned wisdom, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable with distinct perceptual signature in Mira's scent-memory bias and rhythmic prose that modulates under stress; purposeful compression in lyric mode is taught early and pays off at closure; no head-hopping, and the faint reply functions as subtext-driven action without dialogue issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with varied rhythm, specific verbs like "unsnarl" advancing atmosphere without loops or artifacts; metaphors are coherent and pressure-tuned, as in the organ "inhaling the scented signal"; final line recharges motifs cleanly, with zero scaffold in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes underwater cartography with perfumed signals in a non-obvious way that feels inevitable, transforming solitude tropes through specific details like the lilac-tinged beacon; risk in poetic structure heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry, committing fully to its visionary coherence.</comment>
