<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The orderly records chief's gently meticulous nature is embodied in her precise measurements and recordings, revealing internal contradictions through her grief-tinged actions, such as coughing blood yet persisting; this trait compels the final renunciation of preservation into meaningless sap, earning a visible cost in the tablet's integration with the tree.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through layered projections and measurements with pattern breaks in each vow's dissolution, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing where data becomes sap; orientation anchors early in the climb, but minor ambiguity in the descent's ellipsis slightly softens causality without harming closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The frozen library above clouds constrains choices through its quartz hush and subzero air, charging the final image of sap integration; sensory details like crystallized breath and warming alcove are selective and POV-biased, mirroring her internal decay while evolving causally with the lantern's heat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of measuring vanishing virtues tightens through each vow's frequency sampling, deepening to a cadence shift in wonder's golden chord stretching thin; agency in her endurance forecloses direct preservation with felt cost in blood and tears, though coincidence of the slide's fracture slightly complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of translating grief into data emerges organically from images like fractured glass and dissolving threads, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in wonder's warmth amid oblivion; the final sap image offers a resonant, non-literal repricing of human aspiration as sweet yet meaningless, eliciting lingering melancholy without assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable with perceptual signature in selective, poetic noticing like frost-laced gloves and spectral layers; prose texture in rhythmic, image-dense syntax reflects her meticulous mind under stress, with purposeful compression teaching patterns that pay off in the hush-swallowed footsteps.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with vivid, propulsion-driven sentences like "light poured through the glass and scattered into spectral layers," varying rhythm without loops; minor overwriting in stacked metaphors during measurements muddles briefly but doesn't obscure closure, maintaining clarity and ear-test flow.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes fantasy elements like frequency-sampling vows into a fresh angle on cultural forgetting, with ingenuity in the sap transformation feeling inevitable; risk in lyric abstraction heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry, transforming potential tropes through specific, voice-driven details.</comment>
