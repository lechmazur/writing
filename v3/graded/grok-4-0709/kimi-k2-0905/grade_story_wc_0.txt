<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Strong interiority with concrete, contradictory impulses in Mara's grief and scientific drive, embodied through actions like brushing dust and ignoring thunder; motivation intensifies compellingly to a credible endurance that reframes her loss with felt cost, as in the final realization about her brother's death mirroring gradual change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with pattern-building through data accrual leading to a Conceptual Repricing closure where the overlay match reweights her worldview with conceptual cost; orientation anchors early in the greenhouse, and one meaningful deepening suffices, though ellipsis in time compression slightly softens causality at the ping moment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, purposeful sensory details like rotting orchids and sluicing water integrate into action, constraining choices and charging the final image of slow collapse; micro-setting of the wing fragment and synchrotron tool evolves causally, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake in calibrating the algorithm tightens through accumulating patterns, forcing stance crystallization under storm pressure with visible cost in her grief's reconfiguration; one deepening via data convergence suffices, though coincidence of the storm complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of gradual change emerges organically from images like scale laminations and neutron star decay, culminating in a resonant final image that reweights the premise without moralizing; subtext in humility and drama's optionality invites reflection through ambiguity, avoiding platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable third-person close POV with distinct perceptual signature in scientific idiom and sensory bias; prose texture modulates rhythmically under pressure, with purposeful compression in data unfurling that pays off at closure without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density and propulsion with varied syntax and rhythm, though occasional figurative density like "kindled humility" borders on muddle in peak beats; zero loops or scaffolds, strong verbs, and clean mechanics support momentum, elevating the final line's image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of astrophysics and lepidoptery in a post-flood setting transforms tropes of loss into non-obvious insights on change; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes organically, feeling inevitable at the wing's "quiet thesis."</comment>
