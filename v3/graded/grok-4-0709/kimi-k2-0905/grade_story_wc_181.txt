<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to pursue forbidden knowledge is clear and intensifies through her contradictory impulses, shown in her racing back to the pod while pages tear away, embodying internal conflict without stock phrasing. Interiority is concrete in moments like vomiting the envelope, revealing embodied emotion under pressure. However, flaws feel more conceptual than complicating choices with genuine struggle, slightly limiting depth in the final merging with the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the mosaic structure with nonlinear shards builds through patterned images like the cameo and orchard, leading to a Conceptual Repricing closure where Mara becomes the catalog with conceptual cost of erased then regained memories. Orientation anchors early in the astral orchard on asteroid K-77, with deliberate disorientation paying off at closure. One meaningful deepening suffices, but causality feels elliptical in transitions like stepping through the mirror.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The surreal astral orchard setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like chiming petals and zero-g roses filtered through Mara's bias, constraining choices like entering the bathroom pod for refuge. It charges the final image where the pistachio shell germinates into a new asteroid, reweighting the inheritance premise. Micro-setting of the pod's plumbing evolves causally, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of pursuing forbidden knowledge versus losing past pages signals early and deepens through the second breakthrough, forcing stance crystallization with felt cost in erased kindnesses. Under textural lens, pattern break in the sapling door narrows options, driven by agency in inscribing the question. Coincidence complicates but doesn't resolve, though moral calculus could sharpen the peak choice more viscerally.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of nonlinear inheritance as self-authored love emerges organically from images like galaxy-fruits and the blank page, inviting reflection through ambiguity without confusion. Subtext in silences and implications, like trees' rustling, builds resonance, culminating in a non-literal final image repricing the premise. Epiphanies earn through struggle, avoiding platitudes, but thematic complexity embraces counter-readings subtly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable with distinct perceptual signature in poetic, image-dense voice, modulating rhythm under pressure like the swirling drain. Patterned elision in nonlinear jumps is taught early and pays off at closure without head-hopping. No dialogue present, so not evaluated; psychic distance shifts intentionally serve emotional beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied rhythm, like the folding time origami, advancing atmosphere without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is controlled, though dense in peaks like the mirror corridor without muddle. Clarity holds with strong verbs and purposeful syntax, but minor register drift in philosophical terms slightly jars in high-pressure moments.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of nonlinear inheritance with surreal sci-fi elements feels inevitable, transforming tropes through specific details like the self-opening envelope in the stomach. Risk-taking in mosaic structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, committing to premise implications in the final footnote warning. Fresh inflection in the bathroom as chrysalis reconfigures familiar refuge motifs organically.</comment>
