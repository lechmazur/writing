<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marco's motivation to nurture intersubjective understanding is clear and intensifies through concrete interiority, culminating in the earned decision to regraft vines and write a new note, with visible emotional cost in the rediscovered letter's "we are impossible." Contradictory impulses—regret versus hope—act simultaneously in the pavilion scene, embodied in his fingertip drawing parallels on the table. Flaws like lingering family verdicts complicate choices without safety-hedging, and the single-POV interiority remains character-specific without stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density increasing through layered memories and metaphors, leading to a Conceptual Repricing closure where Marco reweights destiny via the regrafting decision, with conceptual cost in overturning "impossible." Orientation anchors who, where, and when in the opening sentence, waiving any test penalty. Single continuous scene fits defaults, with one meaningful deepening in the pavilion monologue that reconfigures options without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details like crushed leaves' scent and saffron curtains filter through Marco's POV, mirroring internal states organically; the amber pavilion and autumn vines constrain choices and charge the final image of swelling stars. Atmosphere builds passionate subtlety without overt symbolism, and spatial choreography tracks cleanly from hill to pavilion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reconciling destined mismatch signals early and deepens once through the letter's rediscovery, forcing stance crystallization in the regrafting choice under Accumulative lens, with felt emotional cost in the ghost heat. Agency via renunciation of old verdicts forecloses passivity, though coincidence of finding the letter complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of destiny as revisable through choices emerges organically from vine-grafting parallels and the letter's reprise, offering a resonant non-literal answer in the final image of idling bus engine without stated moral. Subtext in silence and implication enriches ambiguity, eliciting emotional aftereffect via conceptual repricing of "impossible."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable third-person close POV with distinct perceptual signature in sensory metaphors like bruised herbs, modulating rhythm under emotional pressure without head-hopping or elision issues. Prose texture reflects Marco's mind, with purposeful compression in reflective mode taught early and paid off at closure. No dialogue present, so policy skips those bullets.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High information density with varied rhythm and syntactic propulsion, free of loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; metaphors like "destiny is only a vintner's guess" advance atmosphere and theme concisely. Opening anchors voice, final line recharges motifs with zero artifacts touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of vineyard grafting as metaphor for mismatched love feels inevitable, transforming trope through specific details like tempranillo-chardonnay pairing, heightening stakes with bold risk in regrafting without gimmickry. Originality in passionate subtlety avoids stock lost-love arcs, committing to premise with non-obvious emotional truth.</comment>
