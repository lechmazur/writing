<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The beautician mortician's motivation to capture sparks before oblivion is rooted in personal loss, with concrete interiority shown through embodied actions like brushing patterns with her hair wand; contradictory impulses peak in the realization that it's her own spark, earning the closure's self-sacrifice with visible cost in her dispersal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through reflective shards to a resonant reconfiguration in the protagonist's dispersal, with orientation anchored early in the skyborne grotto; closure lands with conceptual cost via her surrender, though one shard-like transition feels slightly elliptical without stronger causal linkage.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The skyborne grotto's vivid, sensory details—like dripping stalactites and aurora-fed pool—constrain choices and charge the closure's dispersal into ice orchids, with micro-setting elements like the mirror pool directly enabling the infusion and transformation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving sparks against oblivion tightens through the infusion ritual, culminating in agency-driven dispersal with felt cost of her life; under Accumulative lens, pattern accumulation escalates pressure effectively, though coincidence in aurora's response slightly softens resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of beauty as a ferryman against forgetting emerges organically from images like static patterns and the emerald chip, with the final dispersal offering a resonant, non-literal reconfiguration of life and memory without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable with a distinct perceptual signature in poetic, rhythmic prose that modulates under emotional intensity, like the hushed aurora; patterned elision in reflections is taught early and pays off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with vivid, propulsion-driven sentences like "shoes dissolving into color," free of loops or artifacts; rhythmic variety and coherent metaphors heighten momentum, especially in the closure's radiant dispersal.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mortuary art and mythical elements transforms familiar loss tropes through specific details like dragon tear ducts, with risk-taking in lyric structure heightening stakes in the self-dissolution without gimmickry.</comment>
