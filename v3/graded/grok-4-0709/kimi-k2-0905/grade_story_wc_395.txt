<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation is clear and intensifies through personal loss and recurring dreams, compelling her high-stakes choice to open the file with a felt cost of erasure. Interiority is concrete and embodied, showing contradictory impulses in her decision to press the crystal despite the bargain. The single-POV focus reveals character through micro-choices, like lying to security, without needing secondary characters for pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned motifs like numbers and the lullaby, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration closure where she becomes the living archive with conceptual cost of her identity. Orientation anchors who, where, and when early via the archive scrolling, with no disorientation debt. The single continuous shard with one transition to the server farm maintains coherence, though the holographic reveal feels slightly expository without breaking causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The social network archive and polar server farm are vividly specific, with sensory details like humming crystals and rattling trains filtering through POV bias to constrain choices, such as the biometric bargain. Atmosphere builds a tone of echoing absence that mirrors internal states, and the micro-setting of the patch and crystal directly charges the final image of etched numbers. Environmental evolution, like the melting crystal, causally affects the closure without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake of uncovering deleted truths versus corporate erasure tightens through a meaningful deepening when she touches the crystal, forcing a trade-off with visible cost to her identity. Pressure accumulates texturally via motifs, crystallizing in her stance to sing and broadcast, though coincidence in the auto-completing hashtag slightly complicates without resolving. Agency in her renunciation forecloses her old life, with ethical calculus sharpening the choice between memory and forgetting.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of absence and undeletable memory emerges organically from images like ghost posts and melting crystals, culminating in a resonant final image that reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext in silences and implications, such as the AI's grief auction, invites reflection on corporate exploitation. Emotional aftereffect arises from particulars like the mother's hologram, embracing complexity without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature in poetic, patterned diction that teaches compression early and pays off at closure. Narrative voice modulates rhythmically with pressure, using non-standard punctuation purposefully for lyric effect without opacity. No dialogue present, so no evaluation needed; focalization remains character-bound with biased noticing of motifs like numbers.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied syntax and rhythm, advancing atmosphere through metaphors like pulsing timestamps without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, heightening momentum in peak beats like the crystal touch. High information density integrates details idiomatically, with the final line recharging motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes corporate data erasure with sci-fi mystery in a fresh, non-obvious way, transforming tropes through specific motifs like the lullaby chord birthing a map. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes organically, feeling inevitable in hindsight without gimmickry. Emotional specificity in the mother's reveal avoids generics, committing fully to the vision.</comment>
