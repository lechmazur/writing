<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to reconcile the till and thaw mistrust drives consistent, intensifying choices, with embodied emotions like her pulse stumbling and contradictory impulses in nearly confronting but choosing absolution. Interiority is concrete and particular, revealing flaws through her refusal to accuse, and relationships with Rico and Jun act as crucibles forcing a resonant endurance with felt cost of letting go resentment. The final renunciation is earned by prior causality, foreclosing suspicion with visible relational reconfiguration in sweeping together.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through layered revelations from the ticket to eavesdropping and projector use, with one meaningful deepening at overhearing the plan that reweights knowledge toward absolution. Orientation anchors who (Mira), where (forecourt/concert hall), and when (night after rain) by ~50 words, serving the resonant hush. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration via the film projection and shared sweeping, with conceptual cost of thawed mistrust made legible in the open lock doodle and dawn's indifference.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The crystal whispering forecourt after rain is vividly sensory, with wet stone smell and rainwater threading pillars constraining Mira's quiet movements and charging the final image of sweeping under emergency lights. Details like dust in the torch beam and resonant hush evolve with events, mirroring internal thawing, and the setting pressures choices by enabling eavesdropping through the grate. Micro-setting of the projector and lens directly constrains the absolution beat, charging closure with the film's light on wet marble.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of thawing mistrust signals early via the unaccounted ticket and suspicion's freeze, with one meaningful deepening when overhearing Rico and Jun forces stance crystallization toward forgiveness. Under Accumulative/Textural lens, pressure accumulates through cryptic doodles and hidden lens, narrowing options to absolution with felt cost of releasing resentment, evident in the funeral march drum of her heart. Agency in fitting the lens and projecting the film earns the reconfiguration, with coincidence of lingering coworkers complicating but not resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of honesty freeing from mistrust emerges organically through particulars like the doodles, eavesdropped plan, and film's silent apology, with subtext in sewn-shut mouth and open lock reweighting secrecy's cost. The final image of sweeping together offers a resonant, non-literal answer to frozen relationships, embracing ambiguity without tidy morals. Emotional aftereffect lingers via the cloak of trust, avoiding sentimentality through concrete struggle like tracing warm ink.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and character-bound, with perceptual signature in Mira's biased noticing of warm paper and upward-falling snow hush, modulating rhythm under stress like short sentences at pulse stumble. Voice texture is distinct in poetic syntax and word choice, such as "ambiguously clear" riddles and "unbutton the sky," teaching patterned elision that pays off at closure. Dialogue is natural, subtext-laden, and advances plot, distinguishing characters like Rico's mutter and Mira's soft gravel voice, with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with vivid, purposeful images like dust as plankton and rain washing walls apart, varying rhythm from lyrical breaths to propulsive actions without loops or scaffold. Syntax propels momentum, as in the concise eavesdropping reveal, with strong verbs and specific nouns avoiding overwriting in peak beats. Minor register drift in elevated metaphors like "chord resolved" is voice-motivated and legible, not muddling closure; final line recharges motifs effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The premise of a scavenger hunt absolving pranksters via cryptic ticket doodles offers a fresh angle on workplace mistrust, transformed through specific details like the burned reel and staff film. Risk-taking in lyric, accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, synthesizing familiar reconciliation with non-obvious ingenuity in the silent film's apology. Originality shines in the ambiguously clear riddles constraining choices, feeling inevitable at the resonant hush closure.</comment>
