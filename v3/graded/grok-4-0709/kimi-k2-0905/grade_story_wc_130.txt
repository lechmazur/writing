<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation is deeply rooted in grief and inventive traits, with embodied emotions shown through actions like reciting primes during vulnerability; internal conflict layers contradictory impulses, such as stillness versus motion, culminating in an earned renunciation of certainty with visible emotional cost. The realization that "emotion is not a number but a locus of possible intersections" exemplifies concrete interiority that intensifies choices without stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned images and deepenings, with orientation anchored immediately in the cavern orchard; closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing via the astrolabe and seedlings, reweighting ambiguous loss into motion with undeniable conceptual cost in the persistent uncertainty. The final image of stepping into the desert, with the orchard resuming its song, provides a resonant reconfiguration shaped by prior constraints like the glass eyes and mosaic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The cavern orchard is vividly specific, with sensory details like chiming droplets and calcite trunks filtering through the protagonist's biased perception; the setting constrains choices, such as climbing the fossilized tree, and charges the final image of sprouting seedlings, mirroring internal renewal without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake of resolving ambiguous loss tightens through a meaningful deepening when the mosaic opens, narrowing options and forcing agency in harvesting seedlings; cost is felt in the enduring ambiguity, though coincidence in the drop's timing slightly complicates without resolving. Protagonist's micro-choices, like aligning the eyes, drive escalation under the textural lens, crystallizing stance with ethical weight between grief and invention.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of grief as an solvable yet ambiguous equation emerges organically from images like the astrolabe and dripping stalactites, inviting reflection on loss without tidy morals; the final image offers a resonant, non-literal repricing of emotion's mathematics, reweighting prior motifs with lingering ambiguity. Subtext in gestures, such as pressing eyes to stone, deepens complexity through purposeful uncertainty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable and character-specific, with perceptual signature biased toward mathematical metaphors like "vectors of longing"; voice texture is distinct in rhythmic, lyric syntax that modulates with emotional intensity, teaching patterned elision early and paying off at closure without head-hopping or register drift. No dialogue present, so ignored; psychic distance shifts intentionally serve beats like the moonlight fracture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied rhythm and syntactic variety accelerating through actions like the drop's oscillations; figurative language is coherent and purposeful, avoiding loops or muddle, as in the seamless integration of "liquid starlight" pooling to sprout seedlings. High information density advances atmosphere and character without scaffold, and the final line recharges motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of surreal elements like a coat of starling feathers and brass astrolabe transforms grief tropes into a fresh, non-obvious premise of mathematical magic; risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes organically, feeling inevitable in the seedlings' sprouting, without gimmickry or echoes of familiar scenes.</comment>
