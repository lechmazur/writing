<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lyra's motivation to outwit cosmic tricksters is clear and rooted in her cautiously hopeful traits, driving adaptive choices like switching from sine waves to glacier recordings that reveal her values under pressure. Interiority is concrete and embodied, with emotions like sweat-salting lips showing stress without therapy-speak. The single-POV focus excels in showing internal contradictions, such as trusting charts while embracing half-known chaos, culminating in an earned stasis where she accepts temporary harmony with ongoing vigilance. Minor slip in over-articulated mentor maxim, but it doesn't undermine the closure's felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under a Causal lens, the structure anchors who (Lyra), where (radio station), and when (midnight to dawn) by the first paragraph, with because/therefore linkages from signal discovery to counter-interference plan and adaptive retuning. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration via the feedback howl's collapse into hush, reweighting community divides with a felt cost of paused but not permanent harmony. One meaningful tightening suffices, with the tricksters' frequency hops narrowing options and forcing her glacier-recording pivot. Orientation is solid, and the single continuous scene fits scope without needing Track B or C exceptions.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The university radio station setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like burnt solder and vinyl dust filtering through Lyra's POV, constraining choices via the antique tower and generator. Atmosphere builds ethereal grit through moonlight-braided exhaust and subsonic tremors felt in kneecaps, mirroring internal pressure. The recurring astronomical charts function as a micro-setting object that charges the final image, constraining her tactics and repricing interference as love. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly, with no white-room issues or inconsistencies.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of interfering with cosmic signals to calm community divides is signaled early and tightens meaningfully when tricksters adapt, forcing Lyra's chaotic counter-shift that narrows options and raises adaptation costs. Under Causal lens, escalation reads as motivated linkages, with agency in her renunciation of certainty leading to closure's reconfiguration. Cost is legible in the temporary pause and her ongoing vigilance, though coincidence of ionospheric timing complicates without resolving. One deepening suffices, but lacks a second visible price for higher bands.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of interference as potential love emerges organically from Lyra's actions and the tricksters' deceit, with subtext in images like braided exhaust and unballing fists inviting reflection on borrowed hatred. Resonance arises from particulars like the glacier recording's chaos meeting chaos, repricing cosmic power plays without moralizing. The final image offers a non-literal answer to division, reweighting harmony as fragile yet achievable. Avoids sentimentality, though mentor maxim borders on platitude without deeper friction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable and apt, with perceptual signature in Lyra's astronomical bias noticing subsonic tremors and constellation anagrams. Prose texture distinct through rhythmic, image-dense syntax that modulates with pressure, like shortened sentences during retuning. No dialogue present, so policy skips evaluation; free indirect style clean without filter-verb stacks. Elision of off-page events is purposeful and paid off in livestream observations, holding under Causal lens without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere and pressure through vivid images like "velvet migraine" without loops or scaffold; rhythm varies naturally, accelerating in peak beats like the feedback howl. Figurative language coherent and purposeful, avoiding muddle in closure with lines like "interference, when practiced with humility, might yet be another word for love." No artifacts obscure cause/effect, though occasional elevated diction like "ethereal hush" borders on register drift but fits voice. Information propulsion strong, with every sentence serving the arc.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality shines in synthesizing sci-fi cosmic tricksters with subsonic community interference, transforming familiar division tropes through Lyra's signal-jamming ingenuity and ethereal grit tone. Non-obvious angle of charts as "newspaper of possible futures" feels inevitable, with risk-taking in lyric compression heightening stakes without gimmickry. Core premise commits fully, avoiding middle-ground hedging. Fresh inflection in adapting chaos to outwit chaos recharges the closure without echoing famous scenes.</comment>
