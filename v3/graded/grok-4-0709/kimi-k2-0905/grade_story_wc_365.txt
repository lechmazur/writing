<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The sensory map maker's motivation to chart withheld truths is clear and intensifies through embodied sensory details, like the shard's vibration compelling her to weave worlds, revealing internal contradictions in her longing and guilt. Interiority is concrete, with emotions embodied in physical aches and pulses, culminating in an earned renunciation of her past complicity with visible emotional cost at the ending. A strength is the micro-choice to swallow the data cube, layering grief and trust in a character-specific way. Minor slip in over-articulated self-awareness mid-story slightly flattens peak crisis authenticity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned shards of parallel bays with legible transitions, teaching the weaving motif early and holding to a Conceptual Repricing closure where the truth's revelation reweights her life's premise with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation anchors who (map maker), where (abandoned spaceport bay), and when (night to dawn) by the first 120 words, with deliberate disorientation paying off in the loom's payoff. The final image of redirecting commissions toward revelation provides a resonant reconfiguration with felt cost in her "engines roar anew."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport repair bay is vividly sensory with rust dust, cracked deck, and evolving scents like ozone or lilac rain, filtered through the protagonist's biased perception and constraining choices, such as the bulkheads bending to redirect balance. Micro-setting elements like the green glass shard and locker function as setting extensions, charging the final image where dawn's bruised gold mirrors her reweighted truth. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly across worlds, with environmental details evolving causally to mirror internal longing and absence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake of discovering withheld truths tightens through a meaningful deepening in the loom's weaving, narrowing options as strands tighten around her ankles and force confrontations with parallel selves, culminating in a stance crystallization under the textural lens. Agency manifests in decisions like pressing the shard to the deck or swallowing the cube, foreclosing paths with felt costs like encrypted grief. Coherent pressure from the shard's pulses forces the final reconfiguration, though coincidence in finding the locker slightly complicates without fully resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of weighing truths through sensory mapping emerges organically from concrete events like the shard's singing and the note's mass metaphor, inviting reflection on complicity without tidy morals, with ambiguity in her role as instrument lingering resonantly. Subtext operates in silences and implications, such as the lover's disassembled ship mirroring buried grief, leading to an emotional aftereffect of charged poise. The final image offers a non-literal answer to mapping consequences, reweighting the premise without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The third-person close POV remains stable and character-bound, with perceptual signature in sensory biases like vibration and light, modulating rhythm from murmuring dreams to roaring engines under pressure. Prose texture is distinct with purposeful compression and patterned diction like "cyclically spontaneous," taught early and paid off legibly at closure without head-hopping. No dialogue present, so not evaluated; free indirect style is clean, with syntax reflecting her mapping mind.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, sentences advancing atmosphere and character through vivid images like "lungs full of dust tasting of rust," varying rhythm naturally without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is controlled, with metaphors like the loom braiding worlds coherent and payoff-driven, though one mixed vehicle ("swallows the cube like a seed") borders on muddle but resolves in context. Clarity and propulsion are strong, with the final line recharging motifs effectively; minor overwriting in peak beats slightly dulls momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise of a sensory map maker weaving parallel universes via a singing shard offers fresh synthesis of sci-fi and lyric elements, transforming tropes like lost lovers and cover-ups through specific sensory details and thematic complexity. Originality shines in the non-obvious reconfiguration of her gifts toward revelation, feeling inevitable with risk-taking in mosaic structure heightening stakes without gimmickry. Emotional truth in measuring absence avoids generics, with the note's quote providing a memorable, transformed inflection.</comment>
