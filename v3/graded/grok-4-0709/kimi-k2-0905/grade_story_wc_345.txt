<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's altruistic motivation is clear and intensifies through her ghostly actions, with embodied emotions like chilling dew into letters revealing contradictory impulses of love and doubt. The community's collective response shows relationships as crucible, forcing choices that alter their state by the end. Strengths include concrete interiority and micro-choices under pressure, such as knocking fruit only when hands are ready, proving her ongoing care. A minor weakness is the somewhat archetypal ghost figure, but it doesn't undermine the earned endurance with visible cost in her farewell.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The accumulative/textural lens holds with patterned elision and density increase through recurring images like chalk messages and the bell, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration where Mara becomes the nebula with conceptual cost of her release. Orientation anchors who (Mara's ghost), where (Orchard Planet), and when (post-death seasons) by ~120 words, with deliberate mosaic shards taught early and paying off at closure. One meaningful deepening suffices, as the tilting arches tighten pressure toward collective harvest. Strength lies in the final image reweighting survival as collective, with persistent constraint of her intangibility shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The orchard planet with floating rock arches constrains choices, as tilting arches pressure the harvest and supply anti-grav seeds that affect outcome. Sensory details are vivid and purposeful, like violet nebula tasting on tongues mirroring internal respite. Micro-setting of the butterfly garden and watering bell charges the final image of release. Strength is in environmental details evolving causally, such as arches sighing and righting, heightening thematic resonance without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of orchestrating collective effort for harvest tightens through deepening chalk messages and fruit-catching, narrowing options under the accumulative lens with one meaningful cadence shift at the iridescent final message. Agency via Mara's balancing and the community's chains forecloses isolation with felt cost of her tether loosening. Coincidence like breeze-rung bell complicates but doesn't resolve. Strength is in moral calculus between fear and trust, with visible price in labor and farewell gust charging the ending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of collective survival as brambled hope emerges organically from images like frosted whispers and violet nebula, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in ghost trust. Subtext in gestures, such as Kai's coffee-sharing and children's doodles, invites reflection on altruism's cost. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer by repricing death as shared life without stated moral. Strength is emotional honesty in the pure, unbrambled bell note, avoiding sentimentality through concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Omniscient POV is stable with clean focalization on Mara and community, no head-hopping, and perceptual signature biased toward altruistic observation like chilling stars into arrows. Prose texture is distinct with rhythmic, poetic syntax that modulates with pressure, teaching patterned diction early for legibility at closure. Non-standard punctuation and compression serve voice, heightening emotional beats. Strength is in subtext-heavy "dialogue" via messages, pursuing goals indirectly with any elision paid off in the harvest.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, every sentence advancing atmosphere or theme through vivid images like "clang like berries caught in wire." Rhythm varies naturally, avoiding loops or scaffold, with syntactic variety accelerating in harvest beats. No figurative muddle; metaphors like "brambled hope" cohere and propel without overwriting. Strength is in the final line's resonant cadence, recharging motifs with zero artifacts touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of ghost altruism on a sci-fi orchard planet transforms familiar tropes through specific details like dew-frosted messages and nebula respite, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Bold risk in mosaic structure heightens stakes via patterned shards without gimmickry. Emotional specificity in collective grief avoids generics, with fresh inflection in repricing survival as a verb. Strength is the non-obvious angle on community, committing to premise implications like iridescent pigment permanence.</comment>
