<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's persistent curiosity drives concrete micro-choices, like prying the archive door and lying to Hask, revealing embodied contradictions under pressure; her motivation intensifies credibly to compel the upload, earning the stasis of letting the hearing aid die with visible cost. Hask's secondary pressure sharpens her values hierarchy in the confrontation. Flaws complicate without hedging, but interiority occasionally slips into stock phrasing like "pulse steadied."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Causal linkages propel the plot from hearing pulses to investigation and confrontation, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration where headlines credit Lila and Mira retires the aid, with felt cost in Hask's collapse; orientation anchors early in the atrium at twilight. One meaningful tightening suffices, but minor ellipsis in the upload feels convenient without fuller causal trigger.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium constrains choices, like guiding Mira sideways to the pond during confrontation, charging the final image of mist shapes as donors; sensory details are vivid and POV-filtered, evolving causally with twilight thickening and mist condensing into ribbons. Micro-setting of the hearing aid functions as a tool that shapes perception and action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of assuring Lila's credit tightens through the confrontation, forcing Mira's agency in uploading proof and offering the postcard, with visible cost in Hask's crumpling; one meaningful deepening narrows options under causal lens. Coincidence of the photo discovery complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of incidental heroism emerges through Mira's pursuit of faint pulses, reweighting the premise in the final image of pinning the photograph as a relic; subtext in silences and implications, like Hask's trembling fingers, invites reflection on stolen valor without moralizing. Emotional aftereffect lingers via the city's heartbeat syncopating with hers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable with distinct perceptual signature in Mira's filtered sensory details, like pulses as trapped moths; prose texture is rhythmic and purposeful, modulating with pressure in short, urgent sentences during confrontation. Dialogue is goal-driven and subtextual, distinguishing voices naturally.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with vivid metaphors like vines mimicking heart valves, advancing atmosphere and momentum without loops; syntactic variety supports rhythm, though occasional overwriting in peak beats like the mist shapes slightly muddles clarity. Final line resolves by recharging the heroism motif effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original synthesis of hearing dead via hearing aid for heart-tracing offers fresh angle on heroism, transforming tropes through specific details like the 1973 ledger; risk in poetic compression heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in the charged poise of Mira's whisper to Hask.</comment>
