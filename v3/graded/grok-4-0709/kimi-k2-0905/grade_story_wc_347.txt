<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation as a reluctant caretaker is clear and intensifies through micro-choices like pressing her palm and crushing the nut, revealing contradictory impulses of hatred for the orchard yet dutiful saving of strangers. Interiority is concrete and embodied, with emotions like frozen breath-holding under stress showing genuine struggle without stock phrasing. The final endurance forecloses personal freedom with a felt cost of isolation, evident in her walk back to the orchard as prisoner. This earns high marks for a single-POV piece where flaws complicate choices organically.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned images and escalating time pressure in one continuous scene, with orientation anchored early via Mara's position at the cliff's edge. Closure lands as Earned Stasis with visible cost—Mara saves the travelers but remains cursed, reweighting her duty in the final image of crystal fossils and her regretful walk. One meaningful deepening occurs as frost approaches, narrowing options and forcing the nut's use, though a minor ellipsis in traveler progression slightly softens causality without breaking the lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The cliffside labyrinth with mechanical birds and cursed orchard is vividly specific, constraining Mara's choices by preventing entry and pressuring tactics like warmth-ghosts. Sensory details, filtered through her urgency, evolve causally—wind erases scent, frost seals impressions—mirroring her internal isolation. This micro-setting charges the final image of settling birds and her unchanging duty, meeting the 9+ test by directly shaping the closure's resonant cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of guiding travelers before frost tightens once through time pressure, forcing agency in adaptive methods like the handprint, with cost legible in her perpetual imprisonment. Under the Accumulative lens, pattern breaks like cracking the nut deepen options, crystallizing her stance without coincidence resolving. The ethical calculus between duty and resentment sharpens the peak, earning high marks as the tightening forecloses escape and charges the ending image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of graceless beauty in cursed duty emerges organically from images like sap-formed faces and warmth-ghosts, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in Mara's regretful salvation. Subtext in gestures like spitting the kernel invites reflection on isolation without confusion, culminating in a resonant final image that reweights the premise non-literally. This meets the 9+ test by offering a non-literal answer to obligation's cost, drawn from particulars without assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and character-specific, with perceptual signature in selective noticing like brass wings clicking and frost nooses. Prose texture is distinct, with rhythmic syntax modulating under pressure—short, urgent sentences during the bird encounter heighten tension without elision issues. No dialogue or head-hopping, and purposeful compression in blueprint vision pays off at closure, satisfying the 9+ test for rhythmic control and bias.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with vivid, purposeful metaphors like "tiny white nooses" advancing atmosphere without muddle or loops; syntax varies for propulsion, accelerating in time-thinning beats. No artifacts obscure closure—final lines recharge motifs cleanly with strong verbs and concrete images. This meets the 9+ test with zero scaffold, clear propulsion, and rhythmic variety heightening the ending's poise.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes cursed duty with mechanical fantasy in a fresh, non-obvious way, transforming tropes through specific details like the nut's ridges and warmth-ghosts that feel inevitable. Risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes without gimmickry, as the final reconfiguration grows from established patterns. This elevates via bold ingenuity, with emotional specificity avoiding generics.</comment>
