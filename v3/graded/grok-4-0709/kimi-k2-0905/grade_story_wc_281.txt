<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to restore mental privacy is clear and rooted in her skeptical traits, intensifying through discoveries to compel her feverish work and community aid. Interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions like aching teeth and somatic markers revealing contradictory impulses under pressure. The shift from affectionate skepticism to willowglass hope is earned by causal events, foreclosing isolation with the cost of her private refuge becoming public. Flaws like initial resistance complicate choices without artificial balance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Under a causal drive lens, the structure features because/therefore linkages from static shock to breakthrough and aid, with one meaningful tightening at dawn's resonance discovery narrowing options toward shields. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration, with Mira's solidified belief reweighting the premise of technological healing at the felt cost of her transformed studio. Orientation anchors who, where, and when early via the shock in the studio, with legible transitions across mosaic shards holding the lens. Minor ellipsis in community spread feels motivated without breaking causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The light painting studio anchors spatially and evolves causally, constraining choices like projector arrangements that mirror mental pathways and charge the final geode reflection. Sensory details are vivid and purposeful, with refracted light and vibrating mica embodying urgency and discovery. Micro-setting of the geode as tool constrains actions, such as tracing patterns, and charges the closure image. Tone tensions skepticism with hope through environmental mirrors like glowing threads.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of illuminating pathways to block telepathy signals early, with one meaningful deepening at the resonance discovery tightening pressure by narrowing options to portable shields. Escalation reads as causal linkages raising costs, like losing her private refuge, forcing stance crystallization in aiding others. Agency in devising and testing forecloses paths with visible relational costs, such as Mrs. Chen's transformation. Coincidence of the shock complicates but does not resolve, with luck balanced by protagonist effort.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of healing technological disasters through intuition and science emerges organically from geode activations and light mappings, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in "unwanted connection" costs. Subtext in the geode's "betrayal" and somatic markers implies deeper mind connections, inviting reflection on privacy without confusion. Final image of the geode on the workbench offers a resonant, non-literal repricing of hidden pathways' power. Emotional aftereffect arises from particulars like Mrs. Chen's wonder, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and apt, with clean focalization through Mira's biased perceptions like affectionate muttering to objects. Prose texture is distinct in rhythmic syntax blending scientific and intuitive diction, modulating with intensity in feverish work. Limited dialogue, like muttering, feels natural and subtextual, advancing plot via character revelation. Perceptual signature selects details like fractally precise patterns, with purposeful compression in time jumps taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, sentences advancing discovery like "the geode wasn't just reflecting light—it was mapping something" propelling momentum. Rhythm varies naturally, avoiding loops, though minor synonym churn in "fractally precise" repetitions slightly dulls peaks without obscuring closure. Strong verbs and specific nouns dominate, with clean grammar and no artifacts touching the final image. Opening shock anchors stakes; final line recharges motifs effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Core premise synthesizes telepathy recall with mineral activation for a fresh angle on mental privacy, transformed through Mira's specific light-painting tactics and somatic cues. Risk-taking in mosaic structure with intuitive leaps heightens stakes organically, feeling inevitable in hindsight without gimmickry. Emotional complexity in skepticism-to-hope arc avoids generics, with geode as non-obvious crucible. No close echoes of famous scenes; authenticity coheres as singular vision.</comment>
