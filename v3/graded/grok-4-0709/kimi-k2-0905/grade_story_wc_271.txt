<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to anchor optimism in realism is clear and intensifies through embodied grief, with interior contradictions shown in somatic mapping and micro-choices like pressing the photo to the tree, earning a resonant endurance with felt cost. Emotions are embodied contradictorily, avoiding therapy-speak except for one justified mention, and flaws like survival guilt complicate choices without hedging. The single-POV interiority is concrete, with perception degrading under stress, as in the freeze exercise dissecting pain for mercy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through reflective shards anchored early in the arboretum at dusk, with patterned elision teaching disorientation that pays off in closure's conceptual repricing of grief as a coastline. Closure lands as Charged Poise in the final covenant to live like the trees, with undeniable conceptual cost in releasing the photo and carrying somatic maps. One meaningful deepening suffices, with persistent constraints like the cliff and resin shaping the final image without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The arboretum on a seaside cliff anchors vividly early, with sensory details like salt, eucalyptus, and resin filtered through POV bias, constraining choices like the railing stare and photo transfer. Micro-setting of the body via somatic markers and recurring objects like the dragon’s-blood pine charge the final image, mirroring internal states through tactile navigation. Tone tensions grief with green oxygen, evolving causally without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the dominant stake of anchoring optimism amid grief signals early and deepens through pattern breaks like the freeze exercise and photo release, forcing stance crystallization with felt cost in tears and shrapnel memory. One meaningful intensification suffices, narrowing options via somatic anchors, though coincidence of wind ripping the photo complicates without resolving. Agency in renunciation forecloses fleeing grief, with moral calculus between memory and tomorrow sharpening the peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of grief as a coastline to map emerges organically from images like the pearl of stillness and somatic markers, inviting reflection through ambiguity without confusion, with the final image offering a resonant, non-literal repricing of survival. Subtext in gestures like tucking lavender and resin transfer elicits emotional aftereffect, embracing complexity over tidy morals. Insights earn from specific struggles, avoiding platitudes, though one thematic echo in the covenant line trends slightly overt.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with controlled distance, perceptual signature biased toward botanical naming under grief, and rhythmic syntax reflecting mind-state, like tearing paper wind. Prose texture is distinct in lyric compression, teaching patterned diction early and paying off at closure without head-hopping. No dialogue, so policy skips; elision of backstory anchors to present cues, modulating with intensity purposefully.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm and syntax to propel accumulation, like short sentences in the freeze thawing to tears. No loops or artifacts obscure closure; metaphors cohere without muddle, as in drone as heron and blast as chrysanthemum. Strong verbs and specific nouns drive propulsion, with final line recharging motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The premise of somatic mapping grief to plants offers fresh synthesis on survival guilt, transforming tropes through specific details like resin-sealed photo and pearl of stillness. Risk in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, committing to implications boldly. Emotional specificity avoids generics, with non-obvious reconfiguration feeling inevitable.</comment>
