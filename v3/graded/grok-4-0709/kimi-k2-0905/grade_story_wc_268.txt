<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The titan's motivation for precision and balance is clear and consistent, driving micro-choices like whispering clues and flicking the droplet, with embodied traits like regally unpretentious air constraining actions without stock phrasing. Internal conflict shows through subtle contradictions in mercy versus sundering, earning the stasis of forgetting the man's face with felt conceptual cost. The pretender's secondary pressure is immediate and relevant, forcing the climax without overwhelming the single-POV focus.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned marginalia and celestial pauses, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing where the glamour's sundering reweights the throne's illusion with undeniable balance-cost in the final image. Orientation anchors who (titan), where (temple library), and when (shifting constellations) by the first sentence, with deliberate temporal elision paying off at closure. One meaningful deepening occurs via the ink's activation, holding causality without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The ancient temple library is vividly anchored with purposeful details like leaning shelves and dust motes that constrain choices, such as the titan creeping along balustrades, and charge the final image of shelves bowing. Atmosphere evolves causally, mirroring the graceful collapse through rafters leaning and stone lions roaring silently, with sensory hierarchy biased toward tactile and olfactory cues like rust scent. Micro-setting of the codex and ink pellet functions as a tool that directly shapes the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><grade>The dominant stake of restoring balance tightens once through the ink's activation, forcing a stance crystallization under textural pressure with visible cost in the pretender's unraveling identity. Agency via the titan's whisper and flick forecloses illusion, with coincidence (thumb-licking) complicating but not resolving. Moral calculus between mercy and precision sharpens the peak, though secondary stakes feel optional and understated.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of truth's drift emerges organically from images like dissolving ink and unraveling glamour, offering a resonant non-literal answer in the final message without moralizing. Subtext in gestures like the titan's palm-lift and dust coronet invites ambiguity on thrones and illusions. Emotional aftereffect lingers through complexity, avoiding tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with a distinct poetic texture in syntax and rhythm, modulating under pressure like softer footfalls during descent. Perceptual signature biases toward celestial and textual details, with minimal dialogue feeling natural and subtextual in the titan's declaration. Patterned elision in temporal pauses is taught early and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose density is high with vivid, multi-job sentences like "voice calm as closed winter," varying rhythm naturally without loops or scaffold. Figurative language coheres without muddle, accelerating in the climax via strong verbs and specific nouns. No artifacts obscure closure, though dense metaphors in peak beats risk overwriting but pay off in resonance.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original synthesis of diminutive titan and rune-ink premise transforms fantasy tropes through poetic specificity, with risk in textural accumulation heightening stakes organically. Fresh angle on unmasking via marginalia feels inevitable, committing to implications without hedging. Emotional complexity in mercy adds ingenuity without gimmickry.</comment>
