<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Jin's motivation to discover the color of sound is clear and intensifies through concrete actions like diving and opening the safe, revealing embodied emotions in moments like the vermilion flare from the lily's sigh; internal conflict shows in his cautious breathing in air pockets, balancing curiosity with risk; however, the woman's brief appearance lacks crucible pressure on his choices, slightly limiting relational depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The accumulative/textural lens holds with patterned imagery building to a conceptual repricing in the final realization that sound is light seeking an eye, with felt cost in Jin's transformation; orientation anchors early in the harbor setting; closure lands on-page with the cylinder's message guiding him back, though the woman's vanishing feels like a minor unkept setup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The underwater library setting constrains choices, like careful breathing in air pockets, and charges the final image with bioluminescent plankton trailing Jin; sensory details are vivid and POV-filtered, such as the brass key cold like a muted bell; atmosphere of meteor hush evolves consistently, mirroring internal discovery without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of discovering sound's color tightens through deepening revelations, like the cylinder's voices igniting colors, forcing a stance crystallization under the textural lens; one meaningful deepening suffices, with conceptual cost in reweighting his lifelong hunt; however, low external opposition keeps pressure internal and somewhat abstract.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of luminous vows as enduring light emerges organically from images like the plankton cloud and final lantern tints, offering a resonant non-literal answer that reweights sound as seeking perception; subtext in silences and implications, like the woman's salt-stained uniform, invites reflection without confusion; earned insight avoids platitudes, tied to specific experiences in the safe.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in synesthetic details, like the click tasting green; voice texture is lyrical and consistent, with rhythmic control in phrases like "meteor hush thickened into velvet"; brief dialogue carries subtext and advances plot, such as the woman's whisper compelling Jin's dive.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied rhythm, like the opening's hush-to-match sequence; metaphors are coherent and purposeful, though occasional stacking in the plankton bloom slightly muddles in peak beats; no loops or artifacts obscure closure, with high information density advancing atmosphere and revelation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Synesthetic premise of sound's color synthesizes fresh with nautical folklore, feeling inevitable in the cylinder's crescendo; risk in dense lyricism heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry; transforms tropes like sunken treasures into a conceptual archive, with originality in vows as light searching for eyes.</comment>
