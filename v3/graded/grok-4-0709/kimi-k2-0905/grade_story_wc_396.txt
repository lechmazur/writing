<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's characterization shines through her courageous anomaly and calmly intuitive trait, with embodied emotions and contradictory impulses (suppressed feelings vs. feeding sorrow) driving micro-choices like swallowing empathy, earning the final renunciation of detachment with visible cost in her unhidden heart.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through image shards and emotional density to a Resonant Reconfiguration closure, with conceptual cost in the thickened border as bridge; orientation anchors early in the lighthouse orchard, but minor ellipsis in the harbor transition slightly softens causality without breaking the lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The lighthouse orchard above shifting ice floes is vividly specific, constraining choices like stepping through mirrors and charging the final image of locked floes and ripe apples, with sensory details filtered through Mara's POV to mirror her emotional thawing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of mapping empathy onto action escalates through a meaningful deepening when Mara swallows her surplus empathy, driving agency in confronting the Keeper with unmistakable felt cost in his dissolution and her regained compassion, coherent under the textural lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of empathy countering detachment emerges organically from particulars like bottled emotions and the reconstituted sphere, offering a resonant non-literal answer in the final image of dripping empathy without moralizing, enriched by subtext in mirrors and crates.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable with distinct perceptual signature in Mara's intuitive glimpses, rhythmic prose modulating with pressure; dialogue is minimal but natural in the revocation phrase, with no head-hopping and purposeful compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density and propulsion with varied rhythm, vivid metaphors like "emotions flew home like startled gulls," and zero loops or artifacts; every line advances atmosphere and theme, culminating in a charged final image without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of memory-harbor, empathy crates, and fractured Keeper transforms familiar anomaly tropes into a fresh premise, with risk-taking in lyric structure heightening stakes through inevitable reconfiguration, feeling singular and inevitable.</comment>
