<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to reclaim her erased identity through collecting fragments is clear and intensifies compellingly, rooted in consistent traits like her rhythmic namelessness; interiority is concrete and embodied, with contradictory impulses shown in her pocketing the burning poison label while questioning her own dissolution. The final renunciation of her death certificate is earned by prior causality, foreclosing official nonexistence with the felt cost of persistent anonymity, visible in the braille-like memories rising beneath her skin. A brief dying man interaction applies secondary pressure relevant to her conflict without overwhelming the single-POV focus.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through layered discoveries in a continuous shard across tides, with orientation anchored by dawn in the port's container labyrinth; closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing when Mara stamps the container and feeds her certificate to the tide, reweighting erased histories with undeniable conceptual cost. One meaningful deepening occurs via the captain's revelation and recorder, shifting cadence to invert the poison's purpose. Persistent constraints like fog and drones shape tactics, charging the final image without contradiction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The port city's towering container labyrinth anchors setting vividly and selectively, with sensory details like brine cadence and sodium halos filtered through Mara's urgency; the environment constrains choices, such as climbing tiers to find the archive, and charges the final image where tagged containers echo voices. Micro-setting of the poison label and recorder evolves causally, mirroring her internal blurring. Tone tensions the thematic erasure through salt shadows and groaning whales, supporting the accumulative lens without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reclaiming identity from erasure signals early and tightens once through the captain's revelation, forcing stance crystallization under the textural lens; agency via renunciation forecloses official death with felt cost in her nameless integration into the crowd. Escalation reads as density increase in layered voices, with one deepening that reweights options via the recorder. Coincidence of finding the hatch complicates but does not resolve, though cost could be more viscerally embodied in the climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of resisting erased histories emerges organically from particulars like the poison label and captain's recorder, inviting reflection through ambiguity in Mara's nameless survival; the final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer by reprinting dissolved memories, reweighting the premise without moralizing. Subtext in gestures like gluing voice scraps carries implication over declaration. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality, embracing complexity in her textured reclamation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable third-person close POV maintains controlled distance, with perceptual signature biased toward rhythmic, auditory fragments like wave slaps and phantom whistles; prose texture in syntactic variety and purposeful compression teaches a lyric pattern paid off at closure. Brief dialogue with the dying man feels natural, subtextual, and goal-driven, distinguishing his rasped whispers from Mara's internal voice. No head-hopping or elision obscures clarity under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with rhythmic propulsion, varying sentence structures and paragraph lengths to accelerate through discoveries without loops or scaffold; figurative language like "groaned like whales" and "braille-like memories" is selective, coherent, and payoff-driven in peak beats. Clarity shines in concise advancement of atmosphere and action, with strong verbs and specific nouns replacing generics. No artifacts dull the closure image, and read-aloud rhythm feels natural.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The premise of inverting erasure poison through layered voices offers a fresh synthesis on identity and memory, transforming trope of forgotten workers via specific port details and rhythmic tides; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Emotional specificity avoids generics, with the final reconfiguration arising organically from particulars. Minor familiarity in labyrinth motif slightly tempers ingenuity but doesn't echo famous scenes directly.</comment>
