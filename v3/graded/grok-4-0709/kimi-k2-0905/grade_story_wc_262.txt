<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to recover her mother's lost lyrics and unused love is clear and intensifies through embodied actions like handling the film strip, revealing internal conflict via contradictory impulses in her whispers and tears. Interiority is concrete, with emotions embodied in tingling fingertips and glowing warmth, avoiding stock phrasing. The resolution earns a meaningful change by confronting her flaw of holding onto the past, with felt cost in the blurred ink and hatched love. Voice distinction is strong in her singular, imaginative perception, though secondary characters like the mother appear only in visions without on-page pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned imagery like film strips and thunder, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing where love is reframed as projectable, with conceptual cost in releasing the stored emotion. Orientation anchors who (Mara), where (projection booth), and when (stormy night) by the first paragraph, with no disorientation debt. Closure lands on-page with the final image of humming passerby reweighting the premise, though causality is more elided than linked. One meaningful deepening suffices, as the film's self-threading tightens the visionary reveal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The abandoned Orion Palace projection booth is vividly specific, with dust, rusted reels, and velvet seats constraining Mara's choices, such as descending stairs drawn by the beam. Sensory details like nitrate smell and hushed thunder are purposeful, filtered through her imaginative POV, mirroring internal gloom-to-brightness. The setting evolves causally, with the projector activating and rain breaking, charging the final image of pigeons fluttering like sprocket holes. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly, from booth to aisle, with the environment pressuring the climax by pushing the balcony door ajar.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of finding stored love escalates texturally through density of visions and self-moving film, with one meaningful deepening as the projector activates, narrowing options to confrontation. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, forcing stance crystallization in singing the tune, with felt cost in tears and release. Agency via renunciation forecloses holding onto blank letters, though coincidence in the film's movement complicates without resolving. Moral calculus sharpens in choosing to project love forward, reweighting the stake at closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of unused love as stored and projectable emerges organically from images like coiled film and hatching warmth, inviting reflection on inheritance without tidy morals. Subtext in silences and implications, like the blank paper becoming inscribed, elicits emotional aftereffect through complexity. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer by turning the letter into film threading into Mara's chest, reweighting prior material. Epiphanies earn through struggle, avoiding platitudes, though some abstraction lingers in the postscript.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in spatially imaginative noticing like overlaid brightness on gloom. Prose texture distinct in rhythmic, metaphorical syntax, modulating with intensity, as in shortened sentences during the project's cough. No dialogue present, so policy skips evaluation; elision in visions is patterned and taught early, paying off at closure. Psychic distance shifts intentionally for emotional beats, with no head-hopping or register mismatch.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, sentences advancing atmosphere and arc, like "dust floated like slow film frames" doing double work. Rhythm varies naturally, avoiding loops, though some figurative stacking in visions risks muddle but pays off without clarity loss. No artifacts obscure closure; strong verbs and specific nouns propel, with final line recharging motifs effectively. Minor scaffold in repetitive "love unused" phrasing deducts slightly, but information density remains high under pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of psychometry and film as vessels for stored emotion feels inevitable, transforming tropes like abandoned theaters through specific, mystical ingenuity. Risk-taking in lyric, metaphorical density heightens stakes without gimmickry, as in the self-threading film arising from character choice. Core premise offers fresh angle on loss and inheritance, with emotional specificity avoiding generics. Bold commitment to premise, with the passerby's hum a non-obvious reprise charging universality.</comment>
