<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The whispering advisor's motivation to translate silence into music is clear and rooted in a quietly charismatic trait that compels his actions, with embodied gestures revealing character under the pressure of mapping; however, interiority remains somewhat abstract, lacking contradictory impulses in scene, as seen in the final arc where his dissolution feels more poetic than personally costly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned elisions and image accrual to a Resonant Reconfiguration in the harbor's exhaled note, with orientation anchored early in the luminous harbor; closure lands with conceptual cost as the town relearns listening, though one more tightening could deepen the cadence shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The luminous harbor by moonlight constrains and charges choices, with sensory details like phosphor trails and vibrating buildings mirroring the advisor's mapping, culminating in the water as sheet music that elevates the final image; micro-setting of the camera integrates tactilely without overwhelming momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of disrupting hush escalates texturally through subtracted noises, deepening to a single chord with felt cost in evaporated grief; agency via signing forecloses silence's dominance, though coincidence in awakenings slightly complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of silence as potential music emerges organically from gestures and images, culminating in a resonant final reconfiguration that reweights the premise without moralizing; subtext in afterglows and lingering notes invites reflection on unspoken losses, avoiding sentimentality through complex joyful sorrow.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person voice maintains stable, lyric distance with perceptual signature in sailor signs and rust tastes, teaching patterned diction early; no dialogue, but prose rhythm modulates with pressure, heightening the climax without head-hopping or elision obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with vivid, propulsion-driven sentences like "phosphor trail only visible where moonlight kissed salt," varying rhythm purposefully; zero loops or artifacts, though some metaphors stack densely in peak beats without muddle, serving the textural lens cleanly at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sign language and empty camera transforms silence-mapping trope into a non-obvious ritual, with risk in lyric abstraction heightening thematic stakes; the advisor's dissolution feels inevitable, avoiding stock echoes through specific harbor idioms.</comment>
