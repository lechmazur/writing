<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Aurelia's motivation to preserve arts evolves credibly from detachment to active participation, with embodied emotions like her cracked composure revealing internal conflict; the pivotal moment of shaping "H" for home earns the change through prior interactions, foreclosing her old role with felt cost. Relationships with the Chen family act as a crucible, forcing her renunciation of cataloguing for shared creation. Interiority avoids stock phrasing, showing contradictory impulses in her dream and awakening.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the mosaic structure with legible transitions builds to a resonant reconfiguration in the final image of shared bread and fading lens tint, with conceptual cost of Aurelia's shifted worldview legible on-page. Orientation anchors early with Aurelia scanning the grotto, and pattern of shards teaches disorientation payoff at closure. One meaningful deepening suffices, but minor ellipsis in thaw's arrival slightly softens causal linkage without breaking lens coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The grotto city behind the waterfall constrains choices, pressuring isolation and resource use, while the opera glass lens as recurring object charges the final image by fading to clear, reweighting Aurelia's perception. Sensory details like waterfall roar and flour-dusted hair are selective, POV-filtered, and evolve with events, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly across spiral walkways and chambers.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of rescuing dying arts tightens through accumulative pressure, culminating in Aurelia's stance crystallization when she joins baking, foreclosing detachment with felt emotional cost. One deepening via the Chen family's kitchen takeover forces her trade-off, under Textural lens, with coincidence of thaw complicating but not resolving. Agency in her decision to distribute archives and shape dough drives escalation authentically.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of culture as living, shared survival emerges organically from images like shaped bread and woven bees, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in the beekeeper's absence; the final image of flowers growing from cracks offers a resonant, non-literal repricing of preservation. Subtext in gestures, like Mei's "A" loaf, deepens complexity without confusion. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality through concrete particulars like rosewater dread dream.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable, with perceptual signature in Aurelia's historical cataloguing bias; prose texture distinct through rhythmic, image-rich syntax that modulates with emotional intensity. Dialogue, like the old woman's line about rescuing from forgetting, carries subtext and advances theme naturally, distinguishing voices. No head-hopping, and purposeful compression in dream shard pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm and syntax to propel momentum, as in the cascading descriptions of tapestries like frozen waterfalls; no loops or artifacts obscure clarity, with metaphors coherent and purposeful. Final line resolves by recharging motifs like bread and opera glasses without redundancy. Information advances character and atmosphere efficiently.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of displacement and cultural preservation through baking customs and grotto isolation transforms familiar tropes, with non-obvious angle in Aurelia's self-rescue; risk in mosaic structure heightens stakes organically. Emotional specificity in her renunciation avoids generics, cohering as singular vision. Key turn of kitchen takeover feels inevitable from established patterns.</comment>
