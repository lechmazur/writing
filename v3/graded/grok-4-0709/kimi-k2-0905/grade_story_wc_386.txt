<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The protagonist Marrow's motivation to salvage purity from wreckage intensifies compellingly through her careful truth-weaving, revealing internal contradictions in her interactions with ghosts; emotions are embodied in tactile sensations like skin sticking to ice, and her final renunciation of the mirror forecloses a path with felt cost. Secondary characters like the drowned passengers apply pressure without overwhelming the single-POV focus. A minor slip in over-articulated self-awareness during the shrine scene slightly flattens authenticity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through mosaic shards with legible transitions, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing where the pure globe's weight as a second heart reweights memory and connection with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation anchors early in the glacier dive, and the pattern of dream windows pays off at closure. One meaningful deepening in the corridor revelation tightens pressure effectively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The glacier setting constrains choices vividly, with crevasse-blue ice and air pockets mirroring internal fragility, charging the final image of meltwater footprints reflecting the future. Sensory details like cold-burning candles and salt-tasting hymns are selective and POV-biased, evolving causally as the glacier cracks. Micro-setting of the snow globe functions as an object that charges closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of salvaging purity tightens through analyzing cameos, forcing a deepening in the shrine that narrows options with visible cost in the glacier's closing. Pressure accumulates texturally via pattern breaks like the crack revealing memories, crystallizing stance at the intact globe's discovery. Coincidence of the dream globe's appearance complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of fragile connections emerges organically from images like melting globes and cameo faces, offering a resonant non-literal answer in the final tapestry understanding without moralizing. Subtext in ghosts' whispers and the glacier's silence invites ambiguity about memory's cost. The ending reweights the premise of wreckage cradling light through particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable third-person close POV maintains perceptual signature through Marrow's selective noticing of ice groans and starlight, with rhythmic prose modulating under pressure like shortened sentences in the upward swim. Patterned elision in dream sequences is taught early and pays off at closure. No dialogue present, so policy skips evaluation; voice texture is distinct and purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with vivid, propulsion-driven sentences like "footprints filling with meltwater that reflects not the past but the future," varying rhythm naturally without loops or artifacts. Figurative language integrates seamlessly, avoiding muddle in peak beats such as the shrine crack. Minor scaffold in one repetitive "window" mention doesn't obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost-whispering in a glacial wreck with dream cameos feels inevitable, transforming tropes through specific details like rime-stiff formalwear. Risk-taking in lyric mosaic heightens stakes without gimmickry, committing to the premise's implications in the self-reflective globe. Emotional specificity avoids generics, creating memorable ingenuity.</comment>
