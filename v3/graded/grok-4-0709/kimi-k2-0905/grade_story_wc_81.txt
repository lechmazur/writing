<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to trace honest origins intensifies compellingly, rooted in her traits as a logical indexer, leading to contradictory impulses like doubt and resolve that culminate in her decision to rewrite the index. Interiority is concrete and embodied, with emotions like "dappled resolve" shown through actions such as extinguishing the lantern, revealing character under pressure. The meaningful change—embracing remembrance—forecloses the path of compliance with felt internal cost, evident in the "private pressure keeping the false history at bay." Flaws like her initial blindness to suppression complicate choices without safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned elisions and deepening revelations, with orientation anchored by the first sentence in the sunken city's library during blackout. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing via the glyph's revelation mirroring the city's grid, reweighting the catalogue's origins with conceptual cost of forgotten history, felt in Mara's warm wrist mark. One meaningful deepening occurs when darkness reveals the glyph, shifting knowledge without causality breaks. Minor orientation waiver not needed as anchors are clear early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The forgotten library in a sunken city is vividly specific, with sensory details like cold seawater and dripping chandeliers constraining Mara's choices, such as wading to drawers and working by touch. Atmosphere evolves causally, from blackout stillness to pumps restarting, mirroring her internal shift and charging the final image of surfacing into dawn. Micro-setting of the catalogue drawers and lantern integrates into action, guiding her tactile discoveries. Tone tensions the submerged erasure theme through purposeful contrasts like phosphorescent plankton outlining the glyph.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of tracing origins signals early and tightens through one meaningful deepening when darkness reveals the glyph, narrowing options and forcing her stance crystallization to rewrite the index. Internal conflict interweaves with external pressure from rising water and dimming lantern, creating authentic tension between forgetting and remembering. Agency via renunciation of false history forecloses compliance with visible cost in her "dappled resolve," charging the final image under the Accumulative lens. Coincidence of plankton aids complication but not resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of erasure versus remembrance emerges organically from images like bruised cards and the glyph's map, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer as Mara heads "Pre-Submergence Topography," reweighting the premise without moralizing. Subtext in silences and implications, such as the stamp "listening" to her pulse, invites reflection on knowledge's suppression. Emotional aftereffect arises from particulars like the warm fading mark, embracing complexity without tidy morals. No thematic echo or explicit statements disrupt resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and character-specific, with perceptual signature in Mara's selective noticing of indentations like braille, modulating with stress as thoughts degrade into neural static. Prose texture is distinct in rhythmic, purposeful syntax like "hours dripped past," teaching patterned compression that pays off at closure. No dialogue present, so not evaluated; free indirect style clean without filter-verb stacks. No head-hopping or elision issues, with uncertainty in hypotheses serving emotional beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, sentences advancing atmosphere and revelation, such as "phosphorescent plankton briefly outlined the glyph" doing double duty in action and theme. Rhythm varies naturally, avoiding loops or template cadence, though some figurative density in the atrium description borders overwriting without muddling clarity. No artifacts obscure closure, with strong verbs and specific nouns propelling momentum. Final line recharges motifs like the wrist mark effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise of a sunken library's catalogue suppressing pre-submergence history offers fresh synthesis, transformed through specific details like the glyph mirroring streets, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyric, accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, committing to submerged world's implications. No trope echoes; emotional complexity in Mara's resolve avoids generics. Bold unconventional choices, like working in darkness, cohere as singular vision.</comment>
