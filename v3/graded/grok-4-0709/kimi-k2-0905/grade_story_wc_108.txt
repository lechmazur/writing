<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation as a phobia-ridden stunt double intensifies compellingly, rooted in traits like fear of unscripted audiences that drive choices, such as kneeling to decrypt the girl's cast despite trembling. Interiority is concrete and embodied, with contradictory impulses shown in scene, like phobia flaring yet choosing to stay and project footage. The meaningful endurance earns closure by foreclosing self-doubt with felt cost, visible in tears and quaking heart. Relationships with the girl and guards apply pressure, revealing values through micro-choices like slipping away while they watch reflections.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under a Causal lens, the structure anchors who (Leo), where (rusted library), and when (night after DNA revelation) early, with because/therefore linkages from DNA test to library search to shell discovery and projection. One meaningful tightening suffices, as the guards' arrival forces the decisive reconfiguration of projecting raw footage, earning closure with conceptual cost of vulnerability's power. Orientation is clear without disorientation, and the single-POV, two-shard scope fits defaults with legible transitions. The shell's whisper looping to guide the non-run choice exemplifies motivated causality shaping the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The rusted library under stars anchors vividly with purposeful sensory details like groaning iron shelves and starlight leaking through roof holes, constraining choices such as using the skylight for reading the cast. Atmosphere builds tone through metallic creaks folding into hush, mirroring internal hush upon hearing the shell. Micro-setting like the drainage alcove and projector gears directly charges the closure by enabling the projection of raw footage onto the ceiling. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly, with the shell on the feed reel evolving causally to affect the guards' hesitation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of proving vulnerability as power signals early via the DNA revelation and shell hunt, tightening meaningfully when guards arrive, forcing stance crystallization under Causal lens without coincidence resolving. Agency in projecting footage and slipping away forecloses hiding fear, with visible cost of phobia flaring yet earned reconfiguration. Want (proof of heritage) conflicts with fear (unscripted confrontation), creating tension that interweaves internal and external pressures. The shell's message reweights options, making the leak decision a trade-off with ethical calculus between personal truth and family brand.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of vulnerability as power emerges organically from events like decrypting the cast and hearing the shell's message, inviting reflection through ambiguity in "trembling certainty" without tidy morals. Subtext in the girl's giggle and sticker, plus the shell's whisper, elicits emotional aftereffect via concrete images like tears blurring rust into galaxies. The final image of walking toward the studio with the shell's voice as his own offers a resonant, non-literal answer to identity betrayal. No overt symbolism or moralizing; complexity arises from flawed endurance without false equivalence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable and apt, with perceptual signature biased toward stunt metaphors like "counting heartbeats like stunt beats," modulating rhythm under pressure without head-hopping. Voice texture in syntax and diction, like "knees already knocking" and "stride firmly adaptive," reflects the focalizer's mind, with purposeful compression in lyric moments taught early. Dialogue is natural, subtextual, and advances plot, as in the girl's "Only to people who listen scared" pursuing implication. No elision obscures; psychic distance shifts intentionally serve emotional beats like phobia clamping the throat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing through vivid images like "stars spilled through the holes like unpaid extras" without loops or scaffold; rhythm varies naturally, accelerating in the confrontation. No overwriting or mixed metaphors; strong verbs and specific nouns propel, as in "pried one open" revealing the shell. Clarity shines in sequence, with final line recharging motifs like trembling without redundancy. Minor filter verbs are voice-motivated, and no artifacts dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of stunt double identity crisis with whispering artifact transforms betrayal trope through specific details like decrypting a child's cast, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in embracing "trembling certainty" heightens stakes organically, avoiding gimmicks. Emotional specificity in phobia versus daredevil life offers non-obvious angle on vulnerability without derivative echoes. Core premise commits fully, with ingenuity in projecting raw footage as outwitting.</comment>
