<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to preserve small gestures is rooted in her crisis actor past, intensifying through embodied actions like walking patterns and tying the noose, revealing contradictory impulses of benevolence and ruthlessness; the final shared walk earns a renunciation of violence with visible relational cost. Kestrel's secondary pressure forces her micro-choices, shifting status dynamics from threat to alliance. Interiority is concrete, avoiding stock phrasing, with flaws complicating her archival vow.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds with patterned elision of walking spells building to a Resonant Reconfiguration in the final shared sentence, reweighting memory with conceptual cost of unbound truths; orientation anchors who (Mara), where (gallery), and when (interregnum) by line 3. Closure lands on-page via Charged Poise, with the gallery's satisfaction charging the image, though one more explicit tightening could elevate. No causality breaks, but mosaic-like whispers teach pattern early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The whispering gallery constrains choices by echoing names and sighs, charging the final image as stone mouths close, with sensory details like iron-lilac air filtered through Mara's nomadic bias; micro-setting of the chessboard evolves causally, mirroring the pawnless city. Tone tensions luminous absence with purposeful whispers, supporting theme without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography tracks boots and footsteps cleanly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving histories tightens through Kestrel's arrival, deepening via the shared game that forecloses violence with felt relational cost, under textural lens; one meaningful cadence shift in the final walk crystallizes stance. Agency in Mara's unbinding and spelling reweights options ethically. Coincidence of Kestrel's recognition complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of memory's benevolent ruthlessness emerges from particulars like the queen's noose and walking spells, offering a resonant non-literal answer in the final eclipse image that reweights the interregnum without moralizing. Subtext in gestures like kicking the knight invites ambiguity on hierarchies. Emotional aftereffect lingers through small gestures' complexity, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable third-person close POV on Mara with distinct perceptual signature in wingbone letters and lilac air; patterned diction teaches compression, paying off at closure without head-hopping. Prose texture modulates rhythm under pressure, with purposeful fragments like "heel-toe-pause-toe-heel." Dialogue is subtextual and goal-driven, distinguishing voices—Kestrel's unrehearsed line advances alliance naturally.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with sentences advancing atmosphere and character via vivid images like "stone mouths shaping vowels"; no loops or scaffold, syntactic variety breathes with pressure, as in the slowing walk. Figurative language coheres without muddle, propulsion clear to final line. Zero artifacts in closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chess as interregnum metaphor transforms tropes through specific walking alphabet and pawnless board, feeling inevitable with risk in surreal whispers heightening stakes organically. Emotional specificity in small gestures avoids generics, committing to premise without retreat. Bold lyric structure elevates coherence.</comment>
