<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The tuner's motivation to preserve wonder is clear and intensifies through her silent adjustments, culminating in the earned stasis of leaving the sculpture; interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions like her heart synchronizing, though secondary characters like the boy feel underpressured in their brief appearance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned images to a resonant reconfiguration in the final descent and gift, with conceptual cost in her continued silence; orientation anchors early with the bluff and tuner, and closure lands with the symphony preserving awe.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The whispering bluff above clouds constrains choices, pressuring the calibration amid thin air and wind, charging the final image of the after-glow; sensory details like clacking pockets and glistening droplets are vivid and POV-filtered, mirroring her mute wonder.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving wonder tightens through the comet's approach and calibration, with a deepening in the iceberg's light-singing that reweights options; cost is felt in her mute season cracking yet persisting, though escalation relies on poetic accumulation rather than sharp reversals.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of wonder as a preservable frequency emerges organically from images like the iceberg and comet, culminating in a resonant final image that reprices silence as a cavity for future voices without moralizing; subtext in gestures like giving the wedge invites lingering ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single-POV voice is distinct with poetic rhythm and perceptual bias toward oscillations and shimmers, stable without head-hopping; purposeful compression in lyric mode teaches patterns early, paying off in closure, though no dialogue appears to evaluate.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied rhythm, like "droplets glistened like newborn stars," avoiding loops; some metaphors stack in peak beats but cohere without muddle, supporting momentum to the resonant end.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of kinetic sculpture, comet, and mute tuner transforms familiar wonder motifs into a non-obvious preservation ritual; risk in lyric structure heightens stakes, feeling inevitable in the boy's upward stare and gifted wedge.</comment>
