<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to preserve forgotten names is clear and rooted in his past as a lost wax caster, with interiority concretely embodied in actions like threading the rope, revealing contradictory impulses of guilt and forgiveness; the meaningful change of shedding guilt feels earned through the ritual, with a felt cost in the tears freezing into lenses that crack upon smiling.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through layered reflections and ritual actions to a Resonant Reconfiguration in the final resonance of voices, with orientation anchored early in the aurora-lit sanctum; closure lands with a conceptual repricing of preservation as vibration, carrying a felt cost in the protagonist's lightened guilt and heavier cargo of voices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The icebound sanctum under the aurora is vividly specific, with sensory details like petrified incense and fractured lavender light filtering through POV bias; the environment constrains choices, such as warming the frozen ropes, and charges the final image of snowmelt carrying names southward.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake of preserving forgotten names tightens through the ritual reconfiguration, deepening via the sub-audible hum and aurora flare, forcing a stance crystallization under the Accumulative lens; the felt cost is legible in the emotional release and ongoing vibration, though external pressures remain minimal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of preservation as continuing vibration emerges organically from images like the punched card dissolving into air and names tasted on the tongue, offering a resonant, non-literal reconfiguration without moralizing; subtext in gestures like lacing the "wound" shut deepens complexity, inviting reflection on memory's fragility.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature in poetic, image-rich diction like "frost-lensed skylight" modulating rhythm under emotional intensity; purposeful compression in reflections is taught early and pays off at closure, with no dialogue to evaluate.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied syntax and rhythmic control in lines like "tears freezing into delicate lenses that cracked when I smiled," avoiding loops or artifacts; figurative language is coherent and purposeful, heightening atmosphere without muddle, though density borders on overwriting in peak beats without harming clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes lost wax casting with glacial memory preservation in a fresh, non-obvious way, transforming tropes through specific details like threading ropes through punched cards; risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes, feeling inevitable in the final image of names sung to the sea.</comment>
