<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation to negotiate with their ghost is clear and intensifies through poetic interiority, revealing contradictory impulses like ambition's erosion versus youthful contempt, culminating in an earned stasis of shared decay with felt cost in the dissolving images. Emotions are embodied in tactile regrets and cold ribs, avoiding stock phrasing, though the ghost's status dynamics feel slightly underdeveloped despite pressuring choices. The line "regret is just empathy traveling backwards" exemplifies character-specific embodiment under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned image accrual and cadence shifts, leading to a resonant reconfiguration in the fractured stillness where negotiation becomes shared erosion, with conceptual cost legible in the dissolving dreams and ghost's departure. Orientation anchors who (scavenger), where (lagoon), and when (03:17 halt) early via deliberate surreal disorientation that pays off at closure. One meaningful deepening suffices, as the wheel-breaking tightens the stake without needing causal turns.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The surreal setting of the kinetic lagoon with cloudwater and mirrored tiles is vivid and purposeful, constraining choices like walking beside one's past and anchoring on the obsidian mare, charging the final image of the dissolving bench. Sensory details like hissing steam and burnt sugar are selective, filtered through the narrator's bias, and evolve causally with rising cloudwater. The environment mirrors internal erosion, heightening atmosphere without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, the dominant stake of eroded ambitions escalates via density increase in story fragments and pattern break at the wheel-breaking, reweighting options with felt cost in emulsified dreams. One meaningful deepening through projections forces stance crystallization on shared erosion. Agency in renunciation forecloses unchosen paths, though coincidence in materializations slightly complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of temporal regret and shared erosion emerges organically from images like undeveloped squares and dissolving tickets, inviting reflection through ambiguity without confusion, culminating in a resonant final image that reprices ambition's cost non-literally. Subtext in ghostly interactions and fragment readings adds complexity, avoiding tidy morals. The core concept integrates via specific projections, eliciting emotional aftereffect of weary acceptance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in surreal noticing, like backward names and wrong-order reflections; voice texture in rhythmic, patterned diction teaches elision and pays off at closure. Dialogue is subtextual and goal-driven, with the ghost's flickering accusation advancing negotiation. Syntax reflects the focalizer's confusion, modulating under pressure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied rhythm, free of loops or scaffolds; metaphors like "grains sing, guiding me" cohere without muddle, accelerating in peak beats like wheel-breaking. Information density is high, with lines multitasking atmosphere and advancement, and no artifacts obscure closure. Final line resolves by recharging carousel motif imagistically.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The surreal premise of negotiating with one's ghostly youth via a camera wheel offers fresh synthesis of time, regret, and erosion, feeling inevitable through patterned fragments; risk in lyric nonlinearity heightens stakes without gimmickry. Tropes like ghostly reflection are transformed via specific, idiosyncratic details like obsidian mare and emulsified dreams. Core ingenuity lies in conceptual integrity, committing to implications with bold ambiguity.</comment>
