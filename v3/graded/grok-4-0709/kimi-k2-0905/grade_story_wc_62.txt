<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The carver's motivation to understand collective grief is clear and rooted in her meditative traits, intensifying through patient observation to compel a resonant shift in her craft; interiority is concrete via embodied interactions with butterflies and headstones, revealing contradictory impulses in her reluctance to feel the weight she carries. However, emotions sometimes lean toward abstract summary rather than raw embodiment, as in the cross-legged sitting moment where feelings are declared more than dramatized. The final renunciation of traditional carving feels earned with visible cost, foreclosing old paths. Relationships are absent, so those bullets are ignored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned revelations in one continuous greenhouse scene, with orientation anchored by the first sentence in who (carver), where (greenhouse), and when (dusk). Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing in the chrysalis burst, reweighting grief as transformation with undeniable conceptual cost in her changed memorials. One meaningful deepening suffices, via the butterfly swarm spelling poems that reconfigure her understanding. No orientation penalty applies as anchors are immediate and serve the resonant ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The ancient greenhouse at dusk is vividly anchored with rattling glass panes and shadows like wings, sensory details balanced and purposeful, reflecting the carver's meditative urgency in selective focus on pots and chrysalises. Setting constrains choices, as the oak tree through the ceiling supplies headstones that force her confrontation with sleep-carved memorials, charging the final image of emergence. Atmosphere of thundering calm tensions the surreal tone, mirroring internal grief without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly, evolving causally with butterfly emergences.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of discovering collective grief's shape is signaled early and tightens accumulatively through deepening revelations, narrowing options from tracing migration to undergoing transformation, with agency in her endurance crystallizing stance. One meaningful deepening via the chrysalis enclosure forces trade-offs, reweighting the stake with felt cost in acknowledging unspoken losses. Pressure coheres under the textural lens until the dawn burst reconfigures meaning. No multiple reversals required; coincidence in butterfly patterns complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of grief as transformative process emerges organically from butterfly motifs and poem fragments, integrated with the core concept through specific events like the chrysalis enclosure, inviting reflection via purposeful ambiguity in the unsaid. Subtext operates in wingbeat language and glowing lines, eliciting emotional aftereffect without sentimentality, as the final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer reweighting carving as living memorials. No overt moralizing; complexity embraces counter-readings in poems as "small deaths." Epiphanies are earned through dramatized struggle, avoiding platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and apt, with perceptual signature in meditative noticing of patterns like ribbon-matching wings, modulating rhythmically with emotional intensity in thundering calm. Prose texture is distinct in poetic syntax and word choice, purposeful and consistent, teaching patterned elision early for legibility at closure. No dialogue present, so ignored; free indirect style is clean, with psychic distance shifting intentionally during the swarm. No head-hopping or unreliability issues; diction fits the carver's contemplative lexicon without register shifts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with rhythmic variety in sentence lengths and purposeful repetition like "thundering calm" that accelerates atmosphere without loops; information advances character and theme, as in wings spelling poems. Figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated, avoiding muddle in peak beats like the chrysalis crescendo. No significant artifacts or redundancies; clarity is high, with strong verbs and specific nouns enhancing momentum. Opening anchors stakes poetically, final line recharges motifs with integrated grace.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The surreal synthesis of gravestone carving, butterfly migration, and poem-trading as grief processing offers a fresh angle on loss, feeling inevitable through organic combinations like sleep-carved headstones titled with poems. Risk-taking in lyric, accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, transforming tropes like spectral guidance into a singular vision of lived memorials. No close echoes of famous works; authenticity coheres in bold commitment to thundering calm tone. One fresh inflection in the ribbon's transformation charges the closure indelibly.</comment>
