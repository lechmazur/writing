<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to discover meaning drives consistent, intensifying choices like creating and destroying the mandala, revealing contradictory impulses in her refusal against eternity; interiority is concrete and embodied, with emotions like lilac unease felt on her skin, culminating in an earned renunciation with visible cost in the scattered grains.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through patterned imagery and deepening hush, leading to a Conceptual Repricing closure where meaning reweights as motion with felt cost in the mandala's dispersal; orientation anchors early in the grotto at twilight, and one meaningful deepening suffices for scope without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The whispering grotto and mist create vivid, sensory atmosphere with lilac unease tinting the air like watercolor, constraining Mira's choices and charging the final image of scattered grains seeding new hushes; details evolve causally, mirroring her internal state through tactile navigation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake in discovering meaning tightens through mandala creation and the tile's whisper, culminating in a deepening cadence shift that reweights impermanence with felt cost in erasure; agency via renunciation forecloses eternity, though coincidence in the grotto's response slightly softens pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of impermanence and meaning in mess emerges organically from mandala's creation and destruction, offering resonant ambiguity without moralizing; final image of scattered grains provides non-literal answer, reweighting prior erasure with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable third-person close POV with distinct perceptual signature in Mira's chalk-stained hands and lilac-tinted senses; lyrical voice modulates rhythm under pressure, teaching patterned elision early and paying off at closure without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with vivid metaphors like mist folding into a pearl, varying rhythm purposefully; minor figurative density in peak beats avoids muddle, but one paraphrase loop in hush descriptions slightly dulls momentum without touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chalk art and emergent hush transforms tropes of impermanence through specific, inevitable turns like the mandala's radial storm; risk in lyric structure heightens stakes organically, feeling singular without gimmickry.</comment>
