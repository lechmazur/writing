<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The lantern maker's motivation to transform grief is clear and intensifies through embodied actions like folding the dream into cranes, revealing contradictory impulses of sorrow and release in the ritual. Interiority is concrete and particular, with emotions shown through physical sensations like glowing ribs and evaporating tears, avoiding stock phrasing. The final renunciation earns stasis by foreclosing unprocessed grief with visible emotional cost, as in the cranes becoming shared lanterns. Flaws are minimal, with competence balanced by genuine struggle in the paradox of ascent-descent.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds with patterned imagery building to a resonant reconfiguration in the crane-folding ritual, where the moonstone's crumbling reweights grief with conceptual cost. Orientation anchors early via the levitating stones and basilica, teaching deliberate surreal disorientation that pays off in the paradoxical stair, waiving any penalty. Structure fits Track A defaults with one continuous shard-like sequence and meaningful deepening in the transformation beat. Closure lands on-page with undeniable pressure, as the smoke's neutral departure crystallizes earned stasis.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The floating island tea garden and glass basilica are vividly specific, with sensory details like chiming leaves and stored starlight filtered through the maker's grief-biased perception, constraining choices like pocketing a leaf for fuel. Atmosphere supports the luminous torment tone, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism, and the environment evolves causally, as cranes perch in bushes becoming lanterns. Micro-setting of the moonstone and stairs charges the final image of smoke rising. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly, with weather-like dawn replays affecting the emotional cadence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of transforming grief tightens accumulatively through the ritual, with one meaningful deepening in breathing the dream into lungs, narrowing options and forcing emotional trade-offs. Agency shines in the maker's deliberate folds, each crease a day of regret, culminating in resonant reconfiguration with felt cost in evaporated tears and luminous torment. Pressure coheres under textural lens without coincidence resolving it. Minor slip in abstract stake declaration early, but escalation drives to charged poise in the final smoke.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of grief as transformable flame emerges organically from recurring images like lanterns and cranes, reweighting the premise in the final non-literal answer of smoke leaving without ascent or descent. Subtext operates in implications of stolen leaves and detached shadows, inviting reflection on loss's paradoxes without confusion. Emotional aftereffect is concrete, avoiding sentimentality through complex ambiguity in the "luminous torment." Resonance arises from particulars, with the ending repricing grief's containment.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable and apt, with perceptual signature biased toward lantern-making idioms like polishing methods and fuel habits, modulating rhythm under grief's pressure. Prose texture is distinct in poetic syntax and patterned elision, teaching surreal compression early and paying off at closure without head-hopping. No dialogue present, so ignored; free indirect style is clean, with psychic distance shifting intentionally during the ritual. Elision of direct daughter memories imposes cost, changing emotional tactics.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied rhythm in sentence lengths and paragraph breaks accelerating through the folding beat, free of loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddle. Information density is high, each line advancing atmosphere and character via concrete images like "ribs glowed from within" without redundancy. Clarity shines in purposeful non-standard punctuation and syntax that heighten textural lens, with no artifacts touching closure. Opening anchors voice in kerosene smell; final line recharges motifs with smoke's scent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality synthesizes surreal elements like oneiric engines and dream ribbons into a fresh grief metaphor, feeling inevitable through the maker's crafty worldview. Risk-taking in paradoxical structure and lyric compression heightens stakes without gimmickry, transforming familiar loss tropes via specific details like seven-stroke polishing. Core premise offers non-obvious angle on mourning, with authenticity in singular artistic stance. One fresh inflection in cranes as shared lanterns reconfigures theme organically.</comment>
