<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The archivist's motivation to preserve memories is clear and intensifies through micro-choices like sketching and leaving the locket, revealing contradictory impulses of gentleness and urgency with embodied emotion. Interiority is concrete, with flaws like haunted attachment complicating her renunciation, earning the final stasis with felt cost in the locket's absence. Relationships with the daughter and indirect figures apply pressure, though secondary characters remain somewhat peripheral.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned shards with legible transitions, anchoring orientation early at the jetty and culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration via the locket's relocation, with conceptual cost legible in the final waltz image. One meaningful deepening suffices, as motifs like ink and covenants accumulate to reweight memory's rhythm. Minor elision in the boy's backstory pays off without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The blooming jetty at twilight is vividly specific, with sensory details like salt-rimmed planks and gulls' laughter filtering through the archivist's bias, constraining her choices and charging the final image of planting memories. Environment evolves causally with wind and headlights, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism. Micro-setting of the locket and tube functions as a tool that alters tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving small moments tightens once through the locket's steep sacrifice, foreclosing personal attachment with felt cost, under the textural lens via cadence shift. Pressure coheres accumulatively but lacks a sharper reversal or ethical calculus to force stance crystallization. Coincidence like the guard's arrival complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of memory outlasting decay emerges organically from images like walnut ink and regenerated covenants, inviting reflection through ambiguity without confusion, culminating in a resonant final waltz that reweights the premise non-literally. Subtext in gestures and silences, like pressing the photo to the sketch, elicits emotional aftereffect. Avoids moralizing, embracing complexity in haunted euphoria.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in selective, poetic noticing, like ink blooming as bruised violets, and rhythmic control heightens pressure without obscurity. Dialogue is sparse but natural, subtextual, and goal-driven, as in the guard exchange advancing her gentle urgency. Patterned diction and syntax reflect the focalizer's mind, teaching lyric compression early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm and syntax to propel momentum, as in the hush where gulls pause, avoiding loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, integrated into action without muddle in peak beats like the locket's steeping. Zero artifacts obscure clarity, with strong verbs and specific nouns enhancing propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archival preservation with haunted motifs transforms familiar loss tropes through specific details like walnut ink and proximate causes, feeling inevitable in the locket's relocation. Risk in lyric structure heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry. Avoids derivatives, committing to a singular vision of memory as rhythm.</comment>
