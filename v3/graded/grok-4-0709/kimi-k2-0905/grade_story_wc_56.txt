<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to unravel her father's lies intensifies compellingly, rooted in consistent traits like restlessness and instinct-training, leading to an earned renunciation with felt emotional cost in the final crate-closing moment. Interiority is concrete and embodied, with contradictory impulses shown in her serene upheaval, though secondary character Riga applies pressure effectively but could deepen status dynamics further. The hierarchy of values reveals through micro-choices, such as asking to beach the barge, balancing competence with genuine struggle without stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned shards with legible transitions, anchoring orientation early via the barge and sundial, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration where hindsight clarity reprices her worldview with undeniable emotional cost on the deck. One meaningful deepening suffices, as logbook discrepancies and coordinate discovery tighten toward revelation without causality breaks. Minor ellipsis in the journey feels motivated, serving the closure image of turning toward open river.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The twilight barge canal anchors vividly early, with sensory details like fog pooling and lanterns swinging constraining choices, such as climbing to the bow for revelation, and charging the final sunrise image that mirrors internal healing. Details evolve causally, reflecting POV bias in Mara's legend-seeking gaze, with the bunker as a tactile micro-setting that pressures the salvage action. Atmosphere supports the serene upheaval tone without overt symbolism, integrating into action purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of understanding lies signals early via the sundial, with one meaningful deepening through logbook discrepancies forcing the beaching choice, narrowing options under textural lens with felt cost in crumbling justifications. Agency via renunciation forecloses her old path, crystallizing stance without coincidence resolving; ethical calculus sharpens at the ambush confession, though a secondary stake could braid tighter. Pressure coheres until the final reconfiguration reweights with undeniable tide-like clarity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of dismantling lies emerges organically from particulars like erased logs and journals, inviting reflection through ambiguity in her father's heroism without tidy morals, culminating in a resonant final image of the barge's wake as a spoken sentence. Subtext in gestures like sharing cigarettes and closing the sundial reweights the premise with conceptual cost, avoiding sentimentality. Emotional aftereffect lingers via complexity, with the core concept integrating via specific events rather than statements.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and apt, with perceptual signature biased toward salvage and myths, modulating rhythm under pressure like in the trembling pages without head-hopping. Prose texture distinct in syntax and imagery, teaching patterned elision early for lyric effect paid off at closure. Dialogue minimal but natural, subtext-driven in Riga's commands and nod, advancing plot; free indirect style clean, with diction matching Mara's thoughtful clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose propels with high density, varying rhythm in sentences like the fog pooling and wake spreading, free of loops or scaffold, advancing atmosphere and character without redundancy. Figurative language coherent and purposeful, such as serene upheaval made visible, with strong verbs and specific nouns enhancing clarity. Opening anchors voice stakes, final line recharges motifs; no artifacts obscure closure, maintaining momentum through concise, multi-job lines.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of legend-seeking with wartime lies via sundial and barge transforms tropes through grounded emotional complexity, feeling inevitable in the coordinate revelation and renunciation. Risk in mosaic structure heightens stakes organically, committing to premise without hedging, though proximity to forgotten-war motifs echoes familiar ground but personalizes via particular flaws. Core premise offers non-obvious angle on inheritance of silence, with bold final reconfiguration elevating ingenuity.</comment>
