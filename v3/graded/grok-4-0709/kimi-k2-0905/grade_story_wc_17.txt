<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The protagonist Mira's motivation evolves compellingly from professional mapping to personal inheritance, rooted in concrete interiority like the name rising in her throat like a swallowed stone, revealing contradictory impulses of curiosity and dread. Her sensitively perceptive trait drives micro-choices, such as holding the negative to the light, culminating in an earned stasis where she accepts the legacy's cost by becoming the echo. Flaws are minimal, with embodied emotions under pressure enhancing authenticity without stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned discoveries like diaries and negatives, leading to a resonant reconfiguration where Mira becomes the corridor, with conceptual cost legible in the final breathing room image. Orientation anchors early with the ivy-veiled passage and post-climate shift setting, serving closure without disorientation debt. One meaningful deepening suffices, as the tunnel walk reweights knowledge accumulatively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The post-climate shift university wing is vividly rendered with purposeful sensory details like moss lungs and dripping pipes, filtered through Mira's perceptive bias, constraining her descent into the tunnel and charging the final negative strip image. Micro-setting elements like the film strips brushing her face evolve causally, mirroring internal reversal without overt symbolism. Atmosphere supports the surreal tone, with ivy as both decorative and structural, heightening thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of uncovering the echo/legacy tightens accumulatively through deepening discoveries, forcing stance crystallization in the final frame where Mira's scream forecloses her autonomy with felt cost of eternal looping. Pressure coheres without coincidence resolving it, with one meaningful cadence shift narrowing options as she becomes negative space. Moral calculus between inheritance and self sharpens the peak, though secondary accents are absent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of legacy's burden emerges organically through recurring images like reversed negatives and dreaming walls, culminating in a resonant, non-literal final image of the breathing room that reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext in silences and implications, such as the building's sigh, invites reflection on inheritance's cost via character complexity. Emotional aftereffect lingers through purposeful ambiguity, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and character-specific, with perceptual signature in acoustic sensitivities and patterned diction like "dripping memory" teaching the lyric mode early. Prose texture is distinct, with rhythmic control modulating under pressure, such as shortening in the tunnel descent, without head-hopping or elision obscuring closure. No dialogue present, so policy skips evaluation; purposeful compression pays off in the final reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with vivid, multi-job sentences like "light became shadow and laughter a hollow skull," varying rhythm naturally without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, accelerating momentum in peak beats like the tunnel walk, with zero artifacts touching closure. Clarity and propulsion are exemplary, integrating details into action without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The premise of a building as a camera capturing legacies in negatives offers fresh synthesis, transforming tropes of abandonment through specific surreal elements like reversed aging in strips, feeling inevitable at the scream frame. Risk-taking in mosaic structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, committing to implications of becoming the echo. Originality shines in non-obvious emotional complexity of inheritance as burden.</comment>
