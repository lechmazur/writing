<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Garnet's motivation is vividly rooted in the "cradle of sparks" as an embodied impulse, driving her inventive choices under pressure with contradictory emotions of fear and resolve shown in micro-choices like tracing the sundial. Luce provides secondary pressure as an ally, with their status dynamic legible in silent exchanges that force tactical shifts. The resolution earns Garnet's endurance through prior causality, foreclosing obedience with felt relational cost in the conspiracy's risk.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density increasing through patterned images like sparks and shadows, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where the fort's unlocking reweights stakes with conceptual cost of tyranny's end. Orientation anchors early via Garnet at the gate during blackout, with two shards transitioning legibly via separation. Closure lands on-page with the dawn image, though one ellipsis in the chain-room slightly softens causality without breaking the lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The luminous fort at twilight, with its blackout and gear-driven lanterns, constrains choices by guarding conspirators and enabling the plot via hidden rooms and aether valves, charging the final image of unlocked gates and drifting barges. Sensory details are selective and POV-biased, mirroring Garnet's urgency through cool iron and moth-wing footsteps. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly, evolving causally as lights return.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of sparking silent revolution tightens accumulatively through the sundial decoding and generator bridging, deepening via Voss's interruption that forces a deceptive micro-turn with felt risk of discovery. Pressure coheres under textural lens, with one meaningful intensification narrowing options as barges drift free. Cost is legible in the opportunity forfeiture of obedience, though coincidence of the blackout complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of invention overthrowing tyranny emerges organically from images like the cradle of sparks and drifting swans, resisting tidy morals through ambiguous costs in the fort's neutral banners. Subtext in silent winks and coded angles invites reflection on obedience's price without confusion. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal repricing of darkness as possibility, reweighting the premise with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable third-person close POV with Garnet's perceptual signature in poetic, spark-infused noticing; psychic distance shifts intentionally during the generator glow to heighten emotional intensity. Voice texture is distinct in rhythmic, image-dense syntax that modulates with pressure, teaching patterned elision early for legibility at closure. Minimal dialogue feels natural and subtextual, advancing the intrigue via Luce's whisper without direct declaration.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with every line advancing atmosphere and momentum through vivid, multi-job images like "bruised violet" sky and "winking hush," varying rhythm naturally without loops or artifacts. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, accelerating in peak beats like the lock-picking without muddle. No scaffold or redundancy; final line recharges motifs with propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fantasy elements like aether cages and half-painted sundial transforms rebellion tropes through specific, poetic ingenuity, feeling inevitable in hindsight as the blackout enables the hinge moment. Risk-taking in lyric compression heightens stakes without gimmickry, committing to a singular vision of silent revolution. No derivative echoes; emotional complexity in Garnet's reflection avoids generic arcs.</comment>
