<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's prosopagnosia is deeply integrated as a core trait that drives her motivation and fractal precision in painting, revealing contradictory impulses through her compulsion to craft despite impending loss; interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices like tracing the coin building to an earned renunciation of the familiar space. Flaws complicate choices without hedging, and the final realization confronts her limits with visible emotional cost in the library's destruction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through layered reflections and actions to a Conceptual Repricing closure where the artist reweights her limitation as strength, with felt cost in the library's demolition; orientation anchors early in the hush before demolition. One meaningful deepening suffices, but the ellipsis of off-page discovery slightly softens causality without breaking the lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The tree-trunk library is vividly specific, with curved shelves and root systems constraining the artist's urgent painting and charging the final image as explosions shower leaves; sensory details like candlelight and vibrations evolve causally, mirroring her internal state. Micro-setting of the coin and wall integrates purposefully without excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving the sky's memory tightens meaningfully as demolition vibrations force faster strokes, culminating in agency through her painting and renunciation; under the textural lens, cadence shifts reweight cost legibly in the final absence-point. Coherent pressure crystallizes her stance with felt loss, though stakes remain more conceptual than visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of limitations as filters for essential truth emerges organically from the artist's struggle and coin-guided painting, culminating in a resonant final image that reweights her identity without moralizing; subtext in negative space and fractal patterns invites reflection on recognition's failures. Emotional aftereffect lingers through complexity, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and character-specific, with perceptual signature biased toward tactile indentations and sky fragments; lyrical voice modulates rhythm under pressure, teaching patterned compression early for legibility at closure. No head-hopping or elision issues, and diction fits the artist's introspective mind.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied syntax and rhythmic control accelerating in demolition beats; figurative language like "fractally precise strokes" is purposeful without muddle, and no loops or artifacts obscure clarity. Information density advances atmosphere and character simultaneously, though some long sentences border on overwriting without harming momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of prosopagnosia with fractal art and guild secrets transforms familiar artist-in-crisis tropes through specific, inevitable choices like coin indentations in paint; risk-taking in lyric structure heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry. Originality coheres as a singular vision, with the negative-space face offering non-obvious ingenuity.</comment>
