<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to translate silence is clear and intensifies through her methodical fork-striking, revealing embodied emotions like fear in red spikes; interiority is concrete, with contradictory impulses shown in her shift from grief to wonder, earning the final renunciation of restoring sound with felt cost in her capsizing loss.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with patterned elision of sound building to a Conceptual Repricing closure where silence is repriced as thermal dialect, with conceptual cost in reweighting the world's "unfinished" state; orientation anchors early in the conservatory, and one meaningful deepening through fork sequences tightens to the glowing symphony image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The winterglass conservatory constrains choices by its frosted isolation and thaws in response to Mara's actions, charging the final image of melting frost in perfect fifths; sensory details like sub-zero chill and silent clouds are selective, POV-biased, and evolve causally, mirroring her internal translation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><grade>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, pressure accumulates through fork strikes deepening emotional mapping, with one meaningful cadence shift at the dome weeping that reweights the stake of silence; dominant stake of proving the world's dialect is signaled early, with felt cost in her career's end becoming a masterpiece.</grade></comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of silence as untranslated marvel emerges organically from fork sequences and thermal auras, culminating in a resonant final image of the treble clef cloud without stated moral; subtext in silent expressions and color harmonies invites reflection on perception's complexity, with emotional honesty avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single-POV third-person is stable with perceptual signature in Mara's acoustic bias, like breaths as unplayed chords; prose texture distinct in rhythmic, lyric syntax that modulates with pressure, teaching patterned elision of sound paid off at closure; no dialogue, so policy applies without penalty.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in accumulative builds like fork strikes blooming instruments; no loops or artifacts, with purposeful metaphors like brass rivers enhancing propulsion without muddle, especially in the closure's frozen symphony image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-sound apocalypse with emotional heat-mapping transforms tropes through Mara's specific survivor traits and conservatory tactics; risk in lyric, conceptual closure heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in the thawing fifths.</comment>
