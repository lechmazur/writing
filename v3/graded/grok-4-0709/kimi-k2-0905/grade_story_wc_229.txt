<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The assistant lighthouse keeper's motivation to prove subtle vibrations' power is rooted in her mother's disappearance, intensifying through embodied actions like whispering into the vial cork and adjusting the beacon; interiority is concrete via sensory memories, though some emotions lean toward abstract labels like "screaming tenderness" without full contradictory impulses in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Structure follows an accumulative/textural lens with a single continuous scene from door to garden, building to a resonant reconfiguration where the boat's course change reprices her understanding of her mother's fate; orientation anchors early with the tower and dawn, and closure lands with felt conceptual cost of enduring loss, though ellipsis in her descent feels slightly unmotivated.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The cobalt lighthouse and night garden at dawn constrain and charge choices, with scents rising like ghosts to purify intentions and enable her ritual; sensory details are vivid and POV-filtered, mirroring her longing through jasmine and gardenia, culminating in the prism scattering light to enhance the final image's resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of proving whispers' reach escalates texturally through scent waves and pulsing light, deepening to crystallize her stance in the garden; one meaningful tightening via the floating cork forces emotional trade-off of vulnerability, with felt cost in reliving loss, but pressure remains more internal than externally tested.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of subtle intentions traveling far emerges organically from scents and vibrations reshaping loss into connection, culminating in a resonant final image repricing her mother's "drowning" without moralizing; subtext in decaying blooms adds complexity, though some direct statements like "the softer we become, the farther we reach" border on explicit.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable with perceptual signature in scent-focused noticing, syntax rhythmic and voice-motivated in lyric compression; no dialogue, so policy skips those bullets; purposeful elision in transitions pays off at closure, though some sentences stretch simultaneity under emotional peaks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied rhythm, multi-job sentences weaving sensory action like "dawn bleeding across the horizon like a wound"; no significant loops or artifacts, though occasional stacked metaphors in peak moments like the prism and ripples slightly muddle without harming clarity at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lighthouse mechanics with vibrational intent and night scents transforms familiar loss tropes into a non-obvious ritual of tenderness; risk in lyric abstraction heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable through recurring vial cork, though premise echoes poetic elegies without full subversion.</comment>
