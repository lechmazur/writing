<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Riven's motivation to heal broken promises is clear and intensifies through embodied actions like uncorking the storm, rooted in family absences that compel his rebellious choices. Interiority shines in contradictory impulses, such as whispering coordinates like prayers, revealing value hierarchies with felt costs in emotional vulnerability. The single-POV focus excels without needing relationship bullets, as flaws like guarded hope complicate his endurance, earning a meaningful renunciation at the mailbox trade. Climax motivation feels earned, but minor stock phrasing in absences slightly abstracts embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned imagery and motif accrual, with orientation anchored by paragraph one in the arcade at twilight with Riven. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing via the storm-letter trade and rain, reweighting absences into presence with undeniable emotional cost in reunions. One meaningful deepening suffices, as storm drops accumulate to short-circuit the drone, holding the lens without contradiction. Persistent constraint of the border shapes tactics, elevating the score, though ellipsis in tunnel travel is minimally elided.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The cobalt arcade at twilight is vividly anchored with sensory details like neon veins and ozone smells, filtered through Riven's displaced bias, constraining choices like threading cabinets to evade the drone. Atmosphere evolves causally, dimming to indigo during the storm drop, mirroring internal hush and charging the final rain image. Micro-setting of the console and mailbox pressures actions, with weather affecting outcome in the healing rain. Recurring bottle object charges the closure, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><grade>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the dominant stake of healing promises tightens through density increase in motifs like devoured letters, culminating in a cadence shift at the mailbox trade that reweights cost. Agency in Riven's renunciation forecloses isolation with felt emotional price in traded apologies. One deepening via drone threat forces stance crystallization without coincidence resolving. Cost is unmistakable in the rain's temporary truces, driven by protagonist choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of borders devouring promises emerges organically from images like the storm bottle and devoured stamps, inviting reflection on displacement without tidy morals. Subtext in gestures like forehead to glass implies emotional contraband, with the final rain image offering a resonant, non-literal repricing of absences as presence. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality through complex ambiguity in guards' tears. Ending reweights prior material without stated moral, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, with perceptual signature in selective noticing of frayed patches and flickering neon, biased by Riven's rebellious lens. Prose texture distinct in rhythmic, metaphorical syntax that modulates with intensity, teaching patterned elision early and paying off at closure. No dialogue beyond the game's voice, which carries subtext naturally. Distinct signature and control under pressure meet the 9+ test without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose propels with high density in multi-job sentences like "tokens clattered... spelling the route," varying rhythm naturally without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, avoiding muddle in peak beats like the storm trade. Minor overwriting in stacked metaphors during arcade description slightly dulls momentum, but clarity holds at closure. Zero artifacts in final third allow high band, with strong propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of mailman smuggling emotional weather transforms tropes of borders and loss into a non-obvious premise, feeling inevitable through motifs like the bottle. Risk in lyric structure heightens stakes via accumulative pressure without gimmickry. Fresh inflection in trading storm for letters reconfigures histories boldly. Meets 9+ test with specific, indispensable elements like the lightning key.</comment>
