<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to unlearn hatred is clear and rooted in her traits as a former choir teacher, intensifying through embodied grief and contradictory impulses like humming to subtract her own rage. The final sacrifice of her voice earns a meaningful renunciation with visible cost, foreclosing her audible singing while altering the city's harmony. Interiority is concrete and particular, avoiding stock phrasing, with micro-choices like placing lips to the rosette revealing her value hierarchy under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned motifs of sound and silence, with coherent density increase leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration in the final image of the rosette crumbling and the city's heartbeat rearranging. Orientation anchors who (Mara), where (velvet library), and when (autumn equinox night) by the first paragraph, serving the closure without disorientation. One meaningful deepening occurs at midnight with syllable collection, reweighting stakes with felt cost in her vocal sacrifice; minor elision in the city's change is motivated and pays off conceptually.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The velvet library in autumn is vividly anchored with purposeful sensory details like cedar, candle smoke, and crimson drapes that absorb sound, selectively filtered through Mara's perceptual bias toward silence and harmony. Setting constrains choices, such as the mahogany table and stained glass nave enabling the rosette's use, and charges the final image of untouched dust under moonlight. Atmosphere evolves causally with events, mirroring her internal subtraction through scents released from books, heightening thematic resonance without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of unlearning hatred to braid harmony is signaled early and deepens texturally through syllable collection and vocal sacrifice, forcing stance crystallization with felt cost in her permanent silence. One meaningful cadence shift at midnight narrows options, interweaving internal grief with external library responses, though coincidence in the library's exhalation slightly complicates without resolving. Agency via renunciation forecloses audible singing, reweighting the city's root tone with legible emotional price in the dawn scene.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of harmony through subtracting noise emerges organically from Mara's actions and the rosette's use, resisting tidy morals by embracing complexity in rage as a subtractable frequency. Subtext operates in images like the rosette drinking lamplight and books exhaling banned scents, inviting reflection on vanishing arts without confusion. The final image of crumbling wood and lingering dust offers a resonant, non-literal repricing of silence as a root tone, reweighting the premise with conceptual cost to the city's voices.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and apt, with perceptual signature biased toward auditory details like moth-wing syllables and distant drone rage, modulating rhythmically under emotional intensity. Prose texture is distinct in poetic syntax and word choice, such as "traveled stillness," teaching patterned compression early and paying off at closure without elision issues. No dialogue present, so not evaluated; psychic distance shifts intentionally serve beats, like close immersion in her ear to the rosette.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with vivid, propulsion-driven sentences like "the rosette accepted the scale, then reflected it back diminished," advancing atmosphere and character without loops or scaffold. Rhythm varies naturally, with syntactic variety accelerating in peak moments like the scale-singing, and no figurative muddle or register drift. Information-rich lines multitask, integrating action and theme concisely; zero artifacts touch closure, ensuring clarity in the final dust circle image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The premise of subtracting noise to unlearn hatred via a rosette in a velvet library offers fresh synthesis of magical realism and auditory motifs, feeling inevitable through Mara's choir background. Risk-taking in textural accumulation heightens stakes without gimmickry, transforming tropes of lost arts into specific, grounded choices like syllable braiding. Originality shines in the non-obvious reconfiguration of silence as a city's root tone, committing fully without hedging.</comment>
