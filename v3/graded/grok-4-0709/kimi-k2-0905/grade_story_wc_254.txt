<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The poet's motivation to dissolve boundaries is clear and consistent, intensifying through her actions like reciting couplets that alter the environment, revealing aesthetic drive under pressure. Interiority is concrete via pulse tremors and warmth in ribs, showing embodied emotion without stock phrasing. However, internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses, trending toward resolute endurance rather than layered hypocrisy. The final couplet earns stasis by foreclosing rigid laws with conceptual cost, but flaws feel abstract without visible micro-choices complicating her hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density increases via harmonies and fissures building to closure; orientation anchors who (poet), where (cobalt atrium by frozen lake), and when (after ban lifts) by line 1, waiving any penalty. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing when the lake lifts into wings, reweighting prohibitions into possibilities with undeniable social cost legible in citizens' uncertainty. Pattern of elision and mosaic shards (e.g., backstory reflection, recitation beats) is taught early and pays off without causality breaks. One meaningful deepening suffices, but persistent constraint of ice's impermanence shapes tactics exceptionally.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting anchors vividly with cobalt atrium, frozen lake, and humming quartz colonnade, where environmental details like A-flat harmonies and lantern-moth hush constrain choices and charge the final image of the lake's wings. Sensory hierarchy reflects the poet's aesthetic bias, balancing sound (quartz breathing) and touch (palm on crystal) purposefully without visual overload. Micro-setting of the ice evolves causally, mirroring internal certainty as fissures spread, guiding the closure without static repetition. Recurring pillars and moths constrain and recharge the reconfiguration, meeting 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of dissolving boundaries signals early and deepens once via recitation that shifts "None shall pass" to "None shall stay," narrowing options under Accumulative lens with conceptual cost in potential re-freezing. Pressure coheres through aesthetic agency, forcing stance crystallization as ice becomes mist, with visible price in risk of mispronunciation. No multiple reversals required; one tightening forecloses rigidity, charging the final image. Coincidence (moth teaching) complicates without resolving, but agency feels more declarative than driven, capping at band guardrail.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of rewriting rigid laws through aesthetic paraphrase emerges organically from images like fissures as calligraphy and borders as parentheses, embracing complexity without tidy morals. Subtext in silences and implications (e.g., quartz sliding pitches) invites reflection on impermanence, with final image offering resonant non-literal answer to boundaries' fluidity. Emotional aftereffect lingers via possibility's tremor, avoiding sentimentality through oblique costs. Recurring motifs constrain closure without tokenism, but lacks dramatic irony for higher resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with perceptual signature in poetic noticing (e.g., footfalls swallowed by hush), modulating rhythm under pressure without head-hopping. Prose texture distinct via syntax like "each syllable a warm exhale," teaching patterned elision early and paying off at closure. No dialogue, so policy skips those bullets; free indirect style clean with voice-motivated compression. Meets 9+ test with rhythmic control heightening certainty's tremor, no elision obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose propels with high density, varying rhythm in sentences like "hairline fissures spread... fine black calligraphy," advancing atmosphere without loops or scaffold. Figurative language coherent (e.g., ice as membrane to mist) without muddle in peak beats like the recitation. Clarity and concision strong, with zero paraphrase loops; final line recharges motifs exceptionally. Minor register elevation in abstract terms like "recalcitrant" fits voice but avoids 9+ due to hairline overwriting in moth descriptions.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Original synthesis of poetic rebellion against laws via paraphrase feels inevitable, transforming trope of artist-as-revolutionary through specific quartz harmonies and boundary dissolution. Bold risk in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, cohering as singular vision. Fresh inflection in final reconfiguration grows from particulars like A-flat to G-sharp shift. Avoids derivative premises, but proximity to surrealist echoes (e.g., horizon as door) lacks full transformation for higher band.</comment>
