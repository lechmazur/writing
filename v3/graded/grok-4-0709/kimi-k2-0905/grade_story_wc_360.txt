<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Quince's motivation to quantify emotion through borrowed personalities drives consistent, intensifying choices, with embodied contradictions like grief and logic superposing in his chest; the final renunciation forecloses borrowing with visible emotional cost, earning a meaningful change without stock epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with patterned elisions and density building to a resonant reconfiguration in the reversed press and restored sky; closure lands as Conceptual Repricing with undeniable cost of weightless solitude, though one minor orientation slip in the initial dome setup slightly delays anchoring.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The topaz workshop under vanishing stars constrains choices through its dome and tools, with sensory details like moon-silver ink and glowing outlines charging the final image; micro-setting of the press and halo fragment evolves causally, mirroring internal turbulence without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of transposed empathy escalates through accumulative deepenings, like the superposed visions forcing stance crystallization; one meaningful tightening narrows options at the balcony address, with felt cost in eroded self, though coincidence of the child's appearance slightly complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of empathy as subtraction emerges organically from images like peeling personalities and rekindled stars, offering a resonant non-literal answer in the final equation of shining alone together; subtext in deliberate ambiguity invites lingering complexity without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature in mathematical metaphors and rhythmic syntax that modulates under stress; purposeful compression teaches patterns early, paying off at closure without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm and propulsion, free of loops or artifacts; figurative language like "lungs full of lucid turbulence" heightens without muddle, advancing atmosphere and character in every line, especially in the closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of printing, astronomy, and empathy transforms tropes through specific details like the halo fragment and backward flywheel; risk in surreal logic heightens stakes organically, feeling inevitable without gimmickry.</comment>
