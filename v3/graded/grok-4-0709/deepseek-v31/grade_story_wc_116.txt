<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation shifts compellingly from passive observation to active preservation, rooted in her traits and intensified by the hum's pressure, culminating in her healing act that forecloses pure detachment with visible exhaustion as cost. Interiority is concrete and embodied, showing contradictory impulses in her trembling unfold of the swan, avoiding stock phrasing. The single-POV focus excels without needing relationship dynamics, though flaws feel slightly abstracted in early descriptions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under a Causal lens, the structure links events tightly—disturbance prompts descent, discovery leads to healing—with orientation anchored by paragraph two in the library setting. Closure is a Decisive Change as Elara mends the fracture, with felt cost in her exhaustion and fragile peace, evident in the line "Exhausted, Elara sat back on her heels." One meaningful tightening during the descent suffices for length, holding without contradiction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The overgrown library and catacombs provide vivid, purposeful sensory details filtered through Elara's bias, constraining her descent and charging the final calm reflection in the obsidian walls. Atmosphere builds regenerative silence that mirrors her internal state, with the river and refuge evolving causally to pressure choices. Environment directly shapes the climax by supplying the fracture's location and essence for healing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><grade>Under the Causal lens, the dominant stake of preserving the library escalates through the descent's deepening hum, tightening options to a single healing act that forecloses passive witnessing with exhaustion as cost. One meaningful deepening during the confrontation suffices, driven by Elara's agency without coincidence resolving it. Stakes feel visceral in the "screaming" light's threat to the ecosystem.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of embracing change through preservation emerges organically from Elara's shift and the swan's unfolding, offering a resonant non-literal answer in the refolded swan that reweights observation without moralizing. Subtext in silence as healing force invites reflection on judgment, tied to the core concept without abstraction. Final image reconfigures the premise with conceptual cost of fragility.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and modest, with perceptual signature in Elara's biased noticing of decay and hum, modulating rhythm under pressure like the descent's "age of careful climbing." Prose texture is distinct and purposeful, with lyric compression taught early and paid off in the healing sigh. No dialogue or head-hopping issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied rhythm and high information in metaphors like "placid lake" advancing atmosphere without loops, though minor figurative density in the cavern description borders on overwriting without harming clarity. Clarity shines in the climax's action sequence, free of artifacts. Final line recharges the swan motif effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes fantasy archival duty with origami geomancy in a fresh, non-obvious way, feeling inevitable as the swan's folds enable healing, heightening stakes through risk of unfiltered reality. Bold ingenuity in silence as regenerative force transforms familiar library tropes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity in Elara's crumbling peace avoids generics.</comment>
