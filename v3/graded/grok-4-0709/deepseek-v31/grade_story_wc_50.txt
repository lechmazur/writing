<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to preserve wonder through meticulous repair is clear and rooted in her peripheral focus trait, driving higher-stakes choices like descending into the cavern; interiority is concrete and embodied, as in her obsessive need to mend the echo, revealing values with felt cost in isolation. However, internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses in key scenes, trending toward summary over dramatized tension. The resolution's endurance feels earned but could deepen with more visible flaws complicating the repair process.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under a Causal lens, the structure follows strong because/therefore linkages from noticing the acoustic shift to repairing the device, with orientation anchored by the first paragraph in the town and cavern. Closure lands as a Decisive Change with the machine's activation and resonant cavern song, carrying conceptual cost in preserving magic against decay. One meaningful tightening suffices at this length, as her reverse-engineering narrows options effectively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The marble cavern is vividly anchored with sensory details like quartz veins and acoustic shifts, constraining choices through its geology and pressuring the repair via echo paths. Atmosphere of geometric silence and metallic dust mirrors Elara's obsessive focus, charging the final image of the singing system. Micro-setting of the device and rock integrates into action, evolving causally without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Causal lens, dominant stake of restoring the echo tightens meaningfully through reverse-engineering, narrowing options as she maps sound paths and forges parts, with felt cost in her days of isolation. Pressure coheres and escalates via the broken timer's disruption, forcing stance crystallization in the repair. Agency drives the climax, but stakes remain somewhat abstract without a sharper ethical tradeoff.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of storing wonder through reason emerges organically from Elara's actions and the echo harvest concept, culminating in a resonant final image that reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext in images like fractured chords and singing polyphony invites reflection on decay and preservation. Emotional aftereffect lingers through complexity, avoiding tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Consistent third-person close POV with stable distance, perceptual signature biased toward intricacies like acoustic stutters, and rhythmic prose that modulates with pressure, as in the whirring click buildup. No dialogue present, so policy skips evaluation; purposeful compression in lyric descriptions is taught early and pays off at closure. Diction fits the reflective voice without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied rhythm, as in the polyphonic hymn buildup, avoiding loops or scaffold; metaphors like "store wonder in the cellar of reason" are coherent and purposeful without muddle. High information density advances atmosphere and character per sentence, with clean grammar and strong verbs. Minor overwriting in descriptive passages slightly slows momentum but doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The premise of an echo engine and harvest of sounds offers fresh synthesis, transforming locksmith tropes through sonic geology and obsessive repair, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in conceptual ingenuity heightens stakes without gimmickry, as the cavern's song reconfigures the wounded season. Authenticity coheres in voice and theme, avoiding derivatives.</comment>
