<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to weigh dream against empire is clear and intensifies, compelling her choice to propagate sorrow despite risks; interiority is concrete with embodied contradictions, like desperation from the tree blending with her resolve. The mulberry tree functions as a secondary character applying pressure, forcing her micro-choice under the roots. Flaws complicate her decision without hedging, earning the renunciation of preservation with felt cost in the gala's grief. Quick test passed via simultaneous impulses in the coffee-reading moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with because/therefore linkages, like fracture discovery leading to propagation decision; closure is a Decisive Change with Resonant Reconfiguration as the violin dissolves and plants wilt, reweighting empire's power with conceptual cost of united grief. Orientation anchors early in the velvet observatory with Elara's role. One meaningful tightening suffices, with the coffee map forcing stance crystallization; cost is legible in the Emperor's frozen fury and Elara's shadowed satisfaction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The velvet observatory with its star-pricked dome and ancient mulberry tree constrains choices, as roots enable propagation and charge the final hum of satisfaction; sensory details like coffee dregs and wilting petals reflect POV bias and urgency. Micro-setting of the tree and pedestal mirrors internal sorrow, evolving causally to pressure the gala. Quick test passed: recurring tree and violin constrain the propagation action and charge the mist-dissolution image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving history vs empire's power tightens once through the coffee vision, narrowing options to propagation with visible cost of potential punishment and artifact loss; under causal lens, agency drives deepening via her hands-on-trunk focus. Coincidence of telepathy complicates but doesn't resolve. Quick test passed: protagonist agency escalates to unmistakable cost in the synchronized wilting.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of empathetic resistance against unyielding power emerges from images like mulberry ache and wilting flowers, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in Elara's quiet satisfaction. Subtext in tree whispers and diamond dust invites reflection on loss without confusion. Quick test passed: final image of bowed petals offers resonant, non-literal answer reweighting the empire's claim.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in plant telepathy and velvet shadows; voice texture is distinct, poetic yet controlled, modulating with urgency in the gala sigh. No dialogue, so policy skips those bullets; elision in future vision is taught and paid off. Quick test passed: rhythmic control heightens pressure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing through vivid images like "perforated destiny" without loops; rhythm varies naturally, though some metaphors like "mulberry ache" border on overwriting in peak beats. No major artifacts obscure closure; final line recharges motifs effectively. Quick test passed: zero loops, propulsion clear in propagation sequence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of plant telepathy, ice violin, and empathetic rebellion feels inevitable, transforming tropes like flawed artifact into fresh confrontation of power via nature's grief. Risk in quiet, collective mourning heightens stakes without gimmickry. Quick test passed: non-obvious propagation redefines empire's symbol with hindsight inevitability.</comment>
