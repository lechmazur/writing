<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to translate grief into a permanent map is clear and rooted in her shift from quick burns to patience, shown through embodied actions like slow breathing and precise arrangements; interiority is concrete, with contradictory impulses from her flash-paper past evident in the final sealing act. The single-POV focus excels in revealing values through micro-choices, such as waiting for the starlight to flare, earning the endurance with felt emotional cost. No relationships or secondary characters limit scope, but this fits the length without penalty.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned details like stone spirals and petal constellations, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where the map is sealed with conceptual cost (starlight exhausted, grief preserved); orientation anchors early in the crater's bowl. Closure lands on-page with the thrum and darkened alembic, reweighting the stake of capturing ephemeral moments. One meaningful deepening suffices, with no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The subarctic crater orchard is vividly specific, with skeletal trees and thick air mirroring Elara's grief and constraining her ritual; it charges the final image as branches lean in, joining the pattern. Sensory details are purposeful, filtered through her patience, and the micro-setting of discarded items supplies resources that affect the outcome. Environment evolves causally, enhancing atmosphere without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving immense loves/losses tightens through the ritual's deepening patterns under the Textural lens, with one meaningful intensification as the starlight flares and the map glows; agency in renunciation forecloses temporary grief for permanent form with legible cost in the consumed paper and darkened starlight. Pressure coheres without coincidence resolving it. Moral calculus between ephemerality and endurance sharpens the peak, though secondary accents are absent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of translating fleeting emotions into enduring forms emerges organically from images like pulsing starlight and the glowing map, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in the "permanent translation of a temporary heart." Subtext in gestures and silences, such as the slow breath and thrum, invites reflection on grief's cost. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer, reweighting the premise without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in selective noticing of patterns and rhythms, modulating lyrically with emotional intensity; no dialogue, so policy skips those bullets. Patterned elision in descriptive compression is taught early and pays off at closure without obscurity. Distinct texture in syntax and rhythm reflects Elara's patient mind under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied rhythm and specific imagery like "safekept starlight" advancing atmosphere; no loops or artifacts obscure clarity, though some figurative density in the ritual beat borders overwriting but serves the textural lens. Information efficiency shines in multi-job sentences, and the final line recharges motifs effectively. Clarity and concision maintain momentum without scaffolding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemy, grief-mapping, and starlight ink transforms tropes into a non-obvious premise, with risk in lyric stillness heightening stakes organically; the constellation petal arrangement feels inevitable in hindsight. Emotional specificity avoids generics, committing to the vision without hedging. No close echoes of familiar scenes.</comment>
