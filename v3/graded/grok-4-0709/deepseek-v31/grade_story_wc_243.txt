<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kaelin's motivation as an archivist is clear and intensifies through her gentle thoroughness, leading to the emotional handover; interiority is concrete with embodied haunted euphoria, showing contradictory joy and grief without stock phrasing. The son's late appearance adds relational pressure, forcing a micro-choice that alters the covenant's state. Flaws are minimal, with emotions layered realistically in the final moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under a Causal lens, the structure flows with because/therefore linkages from discovery to handover, anchoring who, where, and when early without orientation debt. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration as the locket's delivery reweights the past into living presence, with felt emotional cost in Kaelin's tears and the man's rough hope. One meaningful tightening suffices, and causality holds without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The blooming jetty at twilight is vividly specific, with phosphorescent algae and pulsing moss constraining Kaelin's actions and charging the final handover image under nebula light. Sensory details are purposeful, filtered through her professional bias, and the environment evolves causally with twilight stimulating the bloom. It charges the closure by brightening as witness, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving small moments tightens once through the voice log's revelation, narrowing options to delivery and forcing stance crystallization under Causal lens. Agency in handing the locket forecloses abstraction with visible emotional cost, though coincidence of the son's arrival complicates without fully resolving. One deepening suffices, with moral calculus between preservation and renewal sharpening the peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of regenerated covenants emerges organically from the locket's discovery and handover, with subtext in images like the blooming jetty mirroring renewal. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to preserving weight as a gift, reweighting prior grief with ambiguity that lingers. Emotional honesty avoids sentimentality, though the voice log's direct statement borders on thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in Kaelin's archival bias, and rhythmic control heightens pressure in the handover without elision issues. Dialogue is natural, subtext-laden, and advances the plot, distinguishing voices effectively in the son's rough hope. No head-hopping or register mismatch, meeting the 9+ test cleanly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied rhythm, though occasional figurative density like "planetoid of grief" risks muddle in peak beats without harming clarity. No loops or artifacts obscure closure, and information advances atmosphere and character efficiently. Strong verbs and specific details shine in lines like "fingers already stained blue-black," supporting momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of sci-fi archival preservation with proximate causes transforms familiar lost-parent tropes through walnut-ink mechanics and haunted euphoria. The son's arrival offers a non-obvious intensification that feels inevitable, with risk in the quiet, emotional handover heightening stakes organically. Avoids derivative pitfalls, though premise echoes memory-recovery archetypes without full subversion.</comment>
