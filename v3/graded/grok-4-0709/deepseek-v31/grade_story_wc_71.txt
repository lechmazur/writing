<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation as a "noticer of creeping normality" is clear and intensifies compellingly, rooted in consistent traits that drive her shift from observation to participation; interiority is concrete and embodied, with emotions like breath-stealing profundity shown through physical reactions. The final consecration earns its endurance by prior realizations, foreclosing passive watching with a felt cost of joining the "theft." Strength lies in her micro-choices, like clutching the shard, revealing a hierarchy of values without stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through layered observations and sensory deepenings, with a pattern break at uncovering the shard leading to a resonant reconfiguration in the planting act; closure is a Conceptual Repricing that reweights house vitality with undeniable conceptual cost of "stolen silence." Orientation anchors early with the coastal town and bay by ~50 words. The lens holds without contradiction, and the garden constraint shapes the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like the "shush" of waves and violet sky filtered through Elara's bias, evolving causally as she moves to the garden; the overgrown garden and bluff constrain her choices and charge the final warmth wave. Micro-setting of the damp earth soaking her jeans mirrors internal tranquility, heightening atmosphere without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of understanding house vitality tightens through the shard's discovery, deepening to participation with a cadence shift that reweights options; under Accumulative lens, pressure coheres via sensory density, forcing stance crystallization in the consecration. Agency drives the planting, foreclosing observation with felt cost of her gratitude, unmistakable in the "circuit" completion.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of houses as mosaics of donated serenity emerges organically from particulars like displaced objects, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in the "gentle theft"; subtext in images like the orris root's hush invites reflection on quiet intentions. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to why houses feel alive, reweighting the premise without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable and apt, with perceptual signature selective to Elara's noticing, like the "imperceptible erosion"; prose texture is distinct in rhythmic, purposeful syntax that modulates with intensity, teaching patterned elision in sensory deepenings. No dialogue, but voice coherence heightens under pressure without elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, sentences advancing atmosphere and character via strong verbs and specific images like "shard of hush itself"; rhythm varies naturally, free of loops or artifacts, with figurative language coherent and propulsion strong in the planting climax. Opening anchors voice, final line recharges motifs without scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality shines in the non-obvious synthesis of noticing normality with seeding resonances via displaced objects, transforming familiar haunted-house tropes through specific emotional truth; risk in the hushed, textural premise heightens stakes organically, feeling inevitable at the consecration without gimmickry.</comment>
