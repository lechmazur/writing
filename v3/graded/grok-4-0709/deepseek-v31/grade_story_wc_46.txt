<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to share light without fire is clear and intensifies through embodied sensations, culminating in an earned realization during the polishing; interiority is concrete with contradictory impulses between earthbound watching and active sharing, shown in her descent and reflective endurance. The grandmother's memory anchors backstory effectively under BRR, tilting her stance with a micro-choice to polish. No second character, so relationship bullets ignored; 9+ test met with visible cost in shifting from isolation to purposeful giving.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural, with sensations and memories building to a Conceptual Repricing where the polished glass reweights her premise of sharing light, landing on-page with conceptual cost of renouncing passive watching. Orientation anchors early in the coast and grotto; structure is one continuous shard with reflective deepening sufficient for length. Closure holds under lens with resonant reconfiguration, though cost feels more hopeful than sharply felt, slightly softening the reconfiguration's edge.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the serpentine grotto's dampness and mist constraining Elara's search and enabling the discovery, while sensory details like zephyr bloom scent reflect her melancholic hope; it charges the final image as she emerges with the glass. Micro-setting of the rock and sand integrates into action, mirroring internal stillness without overt symbolism. 9+ test met as the grotto directly shapes her polishing choice and reconfigures the entrance's shadow in the ending.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of sharing non-fiery light tightens through the polishing revelation, narrowing options from watching to placing beacons with a meaningful deepening under Accumulative lens; agency in endurance forecloses passive paths with subtle felt cost in her heavy, hopeful secret. Pressure coheres via memories resurfacing, forcing stance crystallization without coincidence resolving. Escalation is quiet but effective, though cost could be more viscerally legible on-page for higher band entry.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of quiet, listening light versus consuming fire emerges organically from the sea glass revelation and grandmother's pearl, inviting reflection on internal stillness without tidy morals; subtext in the breathing glow offers resonant ambiguity. Ending provides a non-literal answer reweighting her motivation, embracing complexity in melancholic hope. 9+ test met as the final image of carrying sky pieces reweights prior watching without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with perceptual signature biased toward upward eyes and tactile coolness, modulating rhythm from hushed mist to pulsing glow; no dialogue, so policy ignored. Prose texture is distinct in syntax like "It didn’t blaze; it breathed," teaching patterned elision in memories that pays off at closure. 9+ test met with rhythmic control under reflective pressure and no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in meditative polishing beats without loops or artifacts; sentences propel via precise verbs like "brushed" and "awoke," avoiding overwriting in peak revelation. Figurative language like "solid tear" is controlled and coherent, supporting momentum. Minor scaffold in repeated "light" phrasing noted but doesn't dull closure; 9+ test nearly met but capped by subtle register drift in "opalescent."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Originality shines in synthesizing sea glass as a non-fiery light vessel, transforming trope of star-seeking through grounded polishing and grotto revelation; emotional specificity in hopeful melancholy feels inevitable. Risk in quiet, accumulative structure heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry. Fresh inflection in the breathing glow reconfigures familiar introspection motifs.</comment>
