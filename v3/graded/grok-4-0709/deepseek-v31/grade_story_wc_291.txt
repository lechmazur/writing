<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ellis's face blindness and methodical nature root his motivations deeply, with the ribbon-touching moment embodying contradictory impulses between analysis and empathy; the shift to awakening dormant feelings compels a higher-stakes artistic choice, earning the final renunciation of pure intellect with visible emotional cost. Interiority is concrete and embodied, avoiding stock phrasing, though the detective's brief appearance lacks secondary pressure. The resolution confronts his flaws without artificial balance, revealing values through micro-choices like reimagining the mask.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through textural density of descriptions and a pattern break in motivation, leading to a Conceptual Repricing closure where Ellis reweights his perception of faces with undeniable conceptual cost in the unforgettable portrait; orientation anchors early in the studio overlooking the quarry. Causality holds via motivated shifts, with one meaningful deepening sufficient; the detective's arrival provides resonant reconfiguration without coincidence resolving the arc.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The shadowed quarry in mist anchors atmosphere early, mirroring Ellis's obscured perceptions and charging the final image as he gazes at it post-revelation; sensory details are selective, POV-biased, and evolve with his empathy shift, constraining choices like imagining the woman's life. The ribbon as recurring object functions as micro-setting, heightening specificity without overbreadth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of unifying descriptions into a portrait tightens through the empathy shift, a meaningful deepening that narrows options from clinical to holistic under the Accumulative lens; agency in renouncing pure method forecloses intellectual detachment with felt cost in awakened vulnerability. Pressure coheres, with the ribbon prompting a stance crystallization; cost is legible in his transformed self-perception at closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of unifying opposites to awaken empathy emerges organically from Ellis's process and the portrait's breathing life, resisting tidy morals through ambiguity in his unchanged blindness yet newfound sight; subtext in the mist and ribbon implies deeper human connection without statement. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to seeing beyond features, reweighting the premise without sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable, with perceptual signature biased toward analytical cataloging that shifts rhythmically under empathy's pressure; prose texture in syntax and rhythm reflects Ellis's mind, teaching patterned elision in mist descriptions paid off at closure. Dialogue is natural, subtextual, and advances the revelation; no head-hopping or register mismatch.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm naturally—e.g., softer lines post-shift accelerate emotional propulsion without loops; metaphors like "lance the abscess" are coherent and purposeful, though minor synonym churn in "unifying opposites" slightly dulls momentum. No artifacts obscure closure; strong verbs and specific details advance atmosphere efficiently.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of face blindness with cold-case portraiture transforms tropes through specific empathy awakening, feeling inevitable via the ribbon's evolving role; risk in blending clinical and emotional methods heightens stakes without gimmickry. Avoids derivative premises, committing to premise implications boldly.</comment>
