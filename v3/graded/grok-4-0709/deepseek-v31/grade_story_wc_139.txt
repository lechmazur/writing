<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to find a "fair trade" for her father's lies is clear and intensifies through embodied interiority, culminating in a resonant shift from anger to complex grief; contradictory impulses are shown simultaneously in her rigid thinking liquefying upon discovery. The final renunciation of her prior certainty is earned by the ink pot revelation, with visible emotional cost in the heavier grief. No stock phrasing mars the concrete, character-specific interiority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural, with density building through revelations to a Conceptual Repricing closure where the passport reweights her father's life with undeniable emotional cost. Orientation anchors early in the mortuary prep room, and causality holds via motivated discovery without breaks. The single meaningful deepening at the hidden compartment effectively reconfigures stakes in this single-scene scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details like the "cloying scent of disinfectant and wilting lilies" filter through POV bias and mirror internal turmoil, while the prep room's cold steel constrains the discovery. The recurring ink pot as micro-setting charges the final image by rewriting history. Atmosphere supports the deathly vitality tone without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reconciling a lifetime of lies tightens through the discovery, deepening knowledge and forcing a stance crystallization under the Accumulative lens, with agency in her active waiting and felt cost in the "heavier, more complex grief." One meaningful cadence shift reweights options without coincidence resolving. Moral calculus between instability and safety sharpens the peak realization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of deception as survival emerges organically from the ink pot secret and passport reveal, inviting reflection on sacrifice without tidy morals or false equivalence. Subtext in the object's hidden truth and her liquefying anger builds resonant ambiguity. The final image offers a non-literal repricing of honesty as asylum, reweighting prior material with emotional honesty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Close third-person POV remains stable and modest, with perceptual signature in her biased noticing of the ink pot as a prop turned truth-holder. Voice texture is distinct through rhythmic, metaphorical prose like "deathly vitality" that modulates with intensity. Brief dialogue is natural and advances the scene; no elision or head-hopping issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm and syntax to propel beats, as in the fluid revelation sequence without loops or scaffold. Figurative language like "liquefy" is purposeful and coherent, avoiding muddle in peak moments. Clarity holds with strong verbs and integrated details; final line recharges motifs effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of con artist trope with political asylum twist feels organic and inevitable, transformed through specific emotional complexity in the discovery. Risk in the quiet, reflective structure heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry. No close echoes of familiar scenes; authenticity coheres in the singular vision of sacrifice.</comment>
