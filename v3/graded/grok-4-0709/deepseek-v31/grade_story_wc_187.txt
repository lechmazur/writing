<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong interiority with embodied, contradictory emotions like preemptive nostalgia aching in the present moment, driving micro-choices under pressure; motivation to sculpt identity intensifies compellingly to the final self-conjecture, earning the renunciation with felt cost of isolation; no other characters, so relationships ignored; the line "mourning its passing even as she lived it" exemplifies concrete, character-particular depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through patterned elision and density of images toward a Conceptual Repricing closure with conceptual cost of unread existence; orientation anchors early in the forecourt after rain; one meaningful deepening via shadow readings leads to resonant reconfiguration; the final shadow measurement of herself provides legible before/after with undeniable pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vivid, purposeful sensory details like sighing tiles and stormlit glow filter through POV bias, with the observatory constraining choices and charging the final twilight image; micro-setting of pillars and shadows evolves causally, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism; the solidifying fog-shell affects action decisively, heightening atmosphere; no orientation debt applied in Q2, supporting high specificity here.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><grade>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, dominant stake of recording the end deepens through shadow conjectures, with one meaningful cadence shift narrowing options to grief then calm; cost is felt conceptually in the unread data and personal integration; agency via endurance forecloses future paths; the pillar shadows' narrative weaving forces stance crystallization without coincidence resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of identity in present meaning-making emerges organically from shadow examinations and final realization, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in the closed loop; subtext in images like faint hand shadows invites reflection; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer reweighting the archivist's role; the "act of looking" line recharges prior motifs without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in lyric, patterned diction like "deepening hush" taught early and paid off at closure; stable third-person close POV with controlled distance shifting intentionally for emotional beats; prose texture rhythmic and purposeful, modulating with intensity; no dialogue, so ignored, but voice coherent without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density and propulsion with varied rhythm, concise sentences advancing atmosphere like "the air itself was a deepening hush"; minimal artifacts, no loops or scaffold dulling closure; figurative language consistent without muddle, as in "pearlescent shell" enhancing momentum; final line's image resolves cleanly with strong verbs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archival end-times with shadow conjectures feels organic and inevitable, transforming tropes through specific worldview; risk in lyric compression heightens stakes without gimmickry; the fog-to-solid premise offers non-obvious angle on memory; closure's self-shadow measurement provides memorable inflection.</comment>
