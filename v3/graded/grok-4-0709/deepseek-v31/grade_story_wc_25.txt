<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to prove her whisper theory is clear and intensifies through her stealthy navigation, with embodied interiority shown in her gait and coin-fingering; contradictory impulses of caution versus bold experiment drive micro-choices like avoiding guards. The final renunciation of shouting earns its cost in the boss's realization, foreclosing her dismissal. Strength lies in her unique walk-identifying attribute constraining actions, as when she evades the panicked guard's rhythm.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under a Causal lens, the structure holds with because/therefore linkages from storm-induced chaos to her unsanctioned traversal, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where the whisper proves her point with conceptual cost to the boss's skepticism. Orientation anchors early in the rust-grid world. Persistent constraint of silence shapes tactics, charging the final alcove encounter without contradiction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The port city's container labyrinth is vividly specific, with dents, serial numbers, and acoustics constraining Elara's choices, like using puddle history for navigation. Sensory details reflect her POV bias, mirroring internal certainty amid storm chaos. The setting charges the final plaza image, where shadows and echoes enable her whisper's precision.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of proving whispers over shouts tightens causally through encounters like the key discovery and guard avoidance, narrowing options with the storm's pressure. Protagonist agency drives the whisper climax, with felt cost in her isolation risk. One meaningful deepening suffices, but lacks a sharper ethical trade-off at peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of nuance triumphing in noise emerges organically from walks, maps, and the whisper, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in the boss's wide-eyed realization. Subtext in silences and the key's message enriches complexity. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal repricing of navigation without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person close POV on Elara is stable, with perceptual signature in sound-focused noticing and rhythmic prose mirroring her gait. Minimal dialogue carries subtext effectively in the whispered "Here." Distinct texture holds under pressure, with no elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in storm hisses and soft gaits; no loops or artifacts obscure clarity. Figurative language like "razor of sound" propels without muddle, especially in the climax whisper. Opening anchors voice, final line recharges the coin motif cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of auditory navigation and zodiac whisper transforms familiar maze tropes through Elara's skill and the key's test. Risk in unsanctioned proof heightens stakes organically. Non-obvious angle on silence feels inevitable in hindsight, though premise echoes labyrinth myths without full subversion.</comment>
