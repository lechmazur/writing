<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to harvest lessons from loss is clear and intensifies through embodied grief, leading to the carving choice that forecloses unchecked mourning with felt integration cost. Interiority is concrete, with contradictory impulses in her ache versus practical containment, shown in the sensation of Leo's hand steadying her. The final renunciation of literal mourning for symbolic assurance earns its poise through prior reflection anchored in the present. No stock phrasing mars the character-specific embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through sensory and memorial density to a Charged Poise closure where grief integrates into peace, with conceptual cost legible in the "quiet rebellion against the void." Orientation anchors early in the loft during the storm, with no disorientation debt. One meaningful deepening occurs via the hand-sensation memory, reweighting options without needing causal turns. Minor slip in ellipsis of carving process slightly softens causality but doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The rain-beaded skylight loft constrains and charges choices, with rain mirroring grief and steam fogging the glass to soften light at closure, directly shaping the final peace. Sensory details are vivid and POV-filtered, like linseed oil and sawdust ghosts, evolving causally with the storm's passage. Micro-setting of the workbench and kettle supplies resources that pressure the timeframe. Environment charges the final image of refracted droplets, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of containing grief escalates texturally through memory density and cadence shift to calm, with one meaningful deepening in the hand-sensation that narrows to carving a cupped form, foreclosing literal loss. Agency in her renunciation drives the Charged Poise, with felt cost in integrated absence. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens without coincidence resolving. Cost is unmistakable in the "crushing silence" reweighted to fertile ground.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of transforming loss into enduring love emerges organically from carving the hand-shape, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in grief's weather. Subtext in images like forgotten rivers in wood grain and rust-hued peace offers resonant, non-literal answer to bridging absence. Final image reweights premise without statement, eliciting honest aftereffect. No explicit moralizing; complexity lingers in love's quiet architecture.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in Elara's calloused thumb and biased noticing of scents tied to Leo. Prose texture distinct in rhythmic, sensory syntax that modulates with focus, like kettle's hiss as white noise. No dialogue, so policy skips those bullets; elision in memory is taught and paid off at carving. Rhythmic control heightens pressure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in sentences like the echoing phrase "He was here and gone," advancing atmosphere without loops. No artifacts obscure closure; metaphors cohere, like grain as forgotten rivers, with strong verbs and specific nouns. Information propels via integrated details, passing read-aloud test. Final line resolves by recharging motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis in carving absence into a cupped hand transforms widow-grief trope through specific sensation-memory, feeling inevitable with risk in quiet rebellion heightening stakes. Emotional specificity avoids generics, committing to premise without hedging. No close echoes of famous scenes; ingenuity in timeframe as grief-container. Bold non-literal form elevates coherence.</comment>
