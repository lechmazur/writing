<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to uncover walls' dreams is clear and intensifies through discoveries, compelling her to share the burden as testimony; interiority is concrete, with embodied emotion in feeling the "heavy mantle" and the curse of perception. Internal conflict shows in her choice to carry the weight despite anguish, revealed through micro-choices like pressing her ear to the wall amid screams. Strengths shine in the climax where sensitivity enables the scream's revelation, earning her stance shift with felt cost. Minor slip in stock phrasing like "weight settled on her shoulders" slightly genericizes embodiment, but it doesn't undermine the earned endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through layered discoveries (diary, negative, echo) with causal ellipsis linking finds to deepening knowledge, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing where sharing reweights the legacy as collective warning with undeniable social cost. Orientation anchors early in the post-shifts world and manor, with no disorientation debt. Closure lands on-page as Resonant Reconfiguration, with her return and projection charging the final image of shared memory. Strongest moment is the scream's revelation forcing stance crystallization, though one more explicit linkage could tighten the accumulative density.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the ivy-veiled passage and manor constraining choices—shadows and walls enable the echo scream, charging the final realization; sensory details like damp earth and decay reflect Elara's perceptual bias, mirroring internal anguish. Micro-setting of the fireplace and negative integrates into action, evolving causally as she sifts debris. Environment pressures the climax by amplifying the house's "groaning" anguish, directly shaping the thematic reconfiguration. Exceptional specificity in the "eastern flank swallowed by forest" anchors the post-shifts world without excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of uncovering walls' dreams escalates texturally through accumulating finds, deepening with the negative's revelation that narrows options to testimony, forcing stance crystallization with felt cost in bearing the "awful weight." One meaningful intensification suffices, as the scream tightens pressure, reweighting ignorance's legacy. Agency shines in her decision to share, foreclosing silence with conceptual price. Minor friction in abstract stakes occasionally feeling declared rather than viscerally tested in the confrontation echo.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of willful blindness's cost emerges organically from particulars like the negative's frames and daughter's diary, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer via shared warning that reweights complicity without moralizing. Subtext in images like the laughing man with champagne implies profit over truth, inviting reflection on legacy. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality through Elara's cursed perception. Strongest in the walls' "dream of betrayal," tying theme to arc without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in Elara's sensitivity to "faintest vibrations" and biased noticing of echoes; prose texture distinct in rhythmic, lyric diction like "listener of stone." No dialogue, so policy skips those bullets; elision purposeful in accumulative build, taught early and paid off at closure. Psychic distance shifts intentionally with emotional intensity, as in the scream's immediacy. Minor register drift in occasional elevated phrasing like "heavy mantle" slightly jars the voice under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, sentences advancing atmosphere and discovery without loops; rhythm varies naturally, as in the varied syntax of the negative's description. Information propulsion strong in peak beats like sifting diaries, with concrete images replacing generics. Minor artifact in one paraphrase loop ("weight of his legacy's burden" echoes earlier heaviness) dulls momentum slightly but doesn't touch closure. Final line resolves resonantly, recharging motifs without scaffolding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis in "corridor echo cartographer" transforms post-apocalyptic trope through perceptual mapping of walls' dreams, feeling inevitable with Elara's sensitivity driving turns. Risk in lyric, accumulative structure heightens stakes via echoing betrayal, cohering without gimmickry. Core premise offers non-obvious angle on climate legacy via trapped murmurs. Strongest in the negative's reprise reweighting ignorance, though familiarity in manor exploration slightly tempers novelty.</comment>
