<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aris's motivation to preserve hope is clear and intensifies compellingly, driving her from investigation to quarantine with embodied regret; interiority is concrete, showing contradictory impulses like curiosity versus fear in her chill upon realization. Emotions are embodied without therapy-speak, and her final metamorphosis reveals a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The single-POV focus excels in interior contradiction under pressure, though secondary characters are absent, fitting scope.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Causal lens, the structure builds through motivated discoveries, from canister viewing to video comparisons, leading to a Charged Poise closure where Aris forges a shield with felt cost of personal change. Orientation anchors early in the blooming library, and one meaningful tightening occurs via the shadow revelation. Closure lands on-page with conceptual cost, though the entity's vector jump feels slightly elliptical without fuller causal linkage.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The blooming library above clouds is vivid and purposeful, with bio-luminous vines constraining Aris's deliberate pace and charging the quarantine isolation. Sensory details like trailing fingers and crystalline spires integrate into action, reflecting her priorities. The setting evolves causally, mirroring her luminous regret, and charges the final image of metamorphosis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving dreams escalates causally through the shadow discovery, tightening options to quarantine with a deepening cost of personal infection. One meaningful reversal narrows paths, forcing her stance crystallization against the entity's hunger. Agency drives the ending via her choice to bind it, with visible emotional price, though coincidence in the acquisition complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of hope's fragility emerges organically from Aris's investigation and the geomancer's warning, with subtext in the unbound shadow implying commodified dreams' dangers. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal repricing of preservation as containment without moralizing. Emotional aftereffect lingers through complexity, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in Aris's sharp-eyed noticing of metadata and shadows, modulating rhythm under pressure like her race against time. Prose texture is distinct in syntax and word choice, such as "luminous regret," without register drift. No dialogue present, so policy skips those bullets; elision in the entity's jump is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing through vivid images like the unbound shadow, though minor paraphrase loops appear in describing the videos. Rhythm varies naturally, with strong verbs and specific nouns; no major artifacts obscure closure, but some figurative language in the ending feels slightly stacked. Opening anchors voice effectively, and final line recharges the motif with propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The premise of a dream library with a parasitic shadow entity offers fresh synthesis, transforming sci-fi tropes through Aris's archivist role and the video method. Risk in the conceptual warning heightens stakes organically, feeling inevitable via the geomancer's hollowed face. No close echoes of famous works, with authenticity in vision.</comment>
