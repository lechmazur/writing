<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies compellingly from the diagnosis to her patient work, with embodied emotions like thinning body and tears under pressure; interior contradiction shines in her "brazen calm" defying death through creation. The final renunciation of life for legacy feels earned with visible cost in her physical decline. Minor slip in over-articulated self-awareness mid-crisis, as in "I was not afraid; I was listening," which borders on diagnostic speak without deeper embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Structure accumulates texturally under the inferred Accumulative/Textural lens, with motivated progression from diagnosis to copper wrapping and resonant response; closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost in eternal understanding post-death. Orientation anchors early in the first paragraph with who, where, and when. Pivotal moment of vibration and pillar shift provides a meaningful cadence shift, charging the final image without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The temple orchard and living stone pillars are vivid and purposeful, constraining choices like wire placement and charging the closure with shifting archways; sensory details like geothermal hum and star-flower scent reflect POV bias and evolve causally. Environment directly shapes the final reconfiguration, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><grade>Escalation builds through accumulative density of work and thinning body, tightening at the vibration response that reweights the stake of interspecies respect; cost is felt in her decline and legacy. Under the lens, one decisive intensification suffices, driven by agency in offering gratitude. Minor abstraction in stakes during early reflection slightly dilutes visceral pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of interspecies respect emerges organically from actions like copper bridging, culminating in a resonant final image of eternal dialogue without moralizing; subtext in vibrations and shifts invites reflection on listening. The ending offers a non-literal answer reweighting human-stone relations, meeting the 9+ test, though ambiguity leans subtle without stronger counter-readings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in botanical details and vibrational focus; prose texture modulates rhythmically under pressure, as in meditative wire-looping. No dialogue, so policy skips those bullets; purposeful compression in reflective blocks anchors present with micro-choices like hand placement.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in meditative descriptions and closure shift; metaphors like "cold stone in my pocket" are controlled without muddle. Minor template cadence in repetitive "I" openings during work beats, but no loops obscure closure; information propels toward the vibrational pivot.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of lithicores and copper translation feels fresh and inevitable, transforming eco-fantasy tropes through specific vibrational language; risk in quiet, legacy-focused ending heightens stakes without gimmickry. Core premise commits fully, with emotional specificity in brazen calm avoiding generics.</comment>
