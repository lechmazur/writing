<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Aris's motivation to outwit cosmic tricksters is clear and intensifies compellingly to the high-stakes interference, rooted in her cautiously hopeful traits and embodied through her tireless work on charts; interior conflict shows contradictory impulses like profound suspicion amid wonder, with the final renunciation of protocols earning a felt cost in exhaustion. Leo, as secondary character, applies relevant pressure by discovering the anomaly, forcing her choice. Minor slip in stock phrasing like "gnawing drive she barely admitted" trends toward label-only without deeper embodiment mid-crisis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Inferred Causal lens holds with strong because/therefore linkages, like the signal's growth causing division, leading to anomaly discovery and counter-broadcast; closure is a decisive change as the signal dissolves into static, with legible cost in Aris's battered hope and broken protocols. Orientation anchors who (Aris), where (radio station), and when (a week after signal starts) by ~120 words. One meaningful tightening suffices at this length, but the ending's "for now" adds resonant ambiguity without undermining causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The university radio station is vividly anchored with sensory details like ozone and old coffee, filtered through Aris's POV, and constrains choices by providing consoles for repurposing into a weapon; astronomical charts as recurring objects charge the final image, reweighting them from answers to questions. Atmosphere supports ethereal grit tone through humming consoles and crowds below. Minor overreliance on visual tapestry without broader sensory evolution in peak moments.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of outwitting tricksters via interference escalates causally from signal discovery to subsonic anomaly, tightening options with a meaningful deepening as they repurpose the array, forcing stance crystallization; agency drives the counter-attack with visible cost in breaking protocols and community confusion. One reversal (from listening to shouting back) narrows options effectively. Coincidence of Leo's find complicates but doesn't resolve, keeping pressure coherent under Causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of human vulnerability to cosmic manipulation emerges organically from events like the subliminal wave stirring division, with subtext in the "beautiful lie" and magician's flourish; final image of charts as endless questions offers resonant, non-literal repricing of curiosity's cost without moralizing. Emotional aftereffect lingers through Aris's battered hope, embracing complexity. Slight drift in abstract "infinite game" phrasing mid-story, but closure reweights prior material effectively.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person close POV on Aris is stable, with perceptual signature in her suspicion-tinged noticing of patterns; voice texture distinct in rhythmic prose like "ethereal grit" modulating with pressure. Dialogue is natural, subtextual, and advances plot, as in Leo's tight-voiced "It's subsonic," distinguishing idioms. No head-hopping; purposeful compression in plan-forming pays off at closure without elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing through vivid images like "cluttered nest of humming consoles" and varying rhythm in peak broadcast; no major loops or artifacts, though minor synonym churn in "stuttered, glitched, and then dissolved" slightly dulls propulsion. Strong verbs and specificity propel momentum, with clean mechanics. Final line recharges motifs effectively, but one paraphrase loop in signal description ("perfect mathematical series defying all known celestial phenomena") adds slight scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alien signal trope through subsonic manipulation and counter-interference feels organic and inevitable, transforming familiar contact narrative via Aris's suspicion and the hidden carrier wave; risk in bold ethereal grit tone heightens stakes without gimmickry. Core premise offers non-obvious angle on power plays as subliminal, with emotional specificity in battered hope. Minor hedging in "for now" avoids full commitment to implications.</comment>
