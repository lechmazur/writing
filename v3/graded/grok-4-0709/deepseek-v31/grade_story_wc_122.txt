<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Inara's motivation to defeat emotional numbness is clear and intensifies through tactile teaching methods, compelling her to guide Leo toward vibration-based playing; her interiority is embodied in feeling vibrations, with contradictory impulses shown in her use of the broken phonograph to bridge her deafness. Leo's frustration and growth provide secondary pressure, altering their relationship by the recital. The final renunciation of sound for sacred silence earns a meaningful endurance with felt cost in her healed spirit.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through deepening vibrations and sensations from teaching to recital, with orientation anchored early in the cavern; closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration via the silent applause, reweighting silence as sacred with conceptual cost of remade numbness. One meaningful deepening occurs as Leo's playing transforms, narrowing options to tactile harmony. The pattern of reverse records and vibrations holds without contradiction, charging the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The drum maker's cavern is vividly specific, with stone walls and half-formed drums constraining choices by absorbing resonance and enabling felt vibrations; atmosphere evolves from autumn chill to winter clarity, mirroring Inara's emotional thaw. Sensory details are purposeful, filtered through her bias toward touch, and the setting charges the final recital image by embracing their silent pursuit.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the dominant stake of defeating numbness escalates through deepening vibrations in lessons, with one meaningful cadence shift at the recital forcing stance crystallization on tactile music; cost is legible in Inara's dizzying victory and the foreclosed path of traditional sound. Agency drives the plan via the backward phonograph, earning the reconfiguration without coincidence resolving it.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of remaking silence into something sacred emerges organically from vibrations and the broken phonograph, with subtext in gestures like palm-out hands and silent applause; the final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to numbness by repricing sound's absence as victory. Ambiguity lingers in the ghost of music, eliciting emotional aftereffect without sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV on Inara is stable, with perceptual signature in vibration-focused noticing; voice texture is distinct in rhythmic, sensory prose like "filament of hush," modulating with emotional intensity. Signing dialogue carries subtext and advances plot naturally, though minimal. No head-hopping or unwarranted certainty.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere through vivid images like "jagged, unpleasant tremor"; rhythm varies naturally, but occasional figurative density in peak beats like the recital slightly muddles without harming clarity. No loops or artifacts obscure closure; strong verbs and specificity propel momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise of a deaf cellist teaching via backward records and vibrations offers fresh synthesis on silence and music, transforming tropes through specific tactile details; risk in lyric, textural style heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable at the silent applause. Emotional specificity avoids generics, committing to the vision.</comment>
