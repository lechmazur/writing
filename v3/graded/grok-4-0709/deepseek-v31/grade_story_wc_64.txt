<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to discover intentions is clear and intensifies through her actions, rooted in her gardener's intuition for patterns; interiority is concrete and embodied, showing contradictory impulses like reverence amid gloom. The change from blithe to settled feels earned with a felt cost of newfound gravity, foreclosing her prior lightness. Strength lies in micro-choices, such as tracing threads, revealing values under pressure. No second character, so relationship bullets ignored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned elision and density increase from chess game to silo revelation, with orientation anchored by the first sentence in the graveyard at night. Closure is a valid Conceptual Repricing as the locket's discovery reweights past intentions with conceptual cost of love's gambit, made legible in the final image. One meaningful cadence shift suffices, with cost felt in her shifted demeanor; persistent motif of threads shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The cobalt silo under stars is vividly specific, with sensory details like chilled air and dust motes constraining Elara's exploration and charging the final image of respectful shroud. Atmosphere evolves causally, mirroring her internal shift from gloom to softness, integrated into action without stalling. Recurring object (tapestry) constrains choices, meeting 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of discovering intentions tightens through untangling threads, with one meaningful deepening changing knowledge via echoes, consistent with Textural lens. Agency in her patient decoding drives escalation, foreclosing ignorance with felt cost of lost blitheness; cost is unmistakable in the closing paragraph. Coincidence of finding the chest complicates but does not resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of uncovering faded intentions emerges organically from images like the frayed tapestry and chess king, offering resonant ambiguity in love's gambit without moralizing. Subtext in sensations and echoes invites reflection on loss, with the final image providing a non-literal answer that reweights the premise. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality through concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature, biased toward patterns and echoes, modulating rhythm under pressure like focused tracing. Prose texture is purposeful and lyric, teaching patterned diction early; no dialogue present, so ignored. Elision of full backstory pays off at closure without withholding known facts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied rhythm and syntactic variety accelerating in the untangling beat; no loops or scaffold, high information density in images like "velveteen gloom." Figurative language is controlled without muddle, even in peak moments, meeting 9+ test. Minor overwriting in descriptors like "tenderly organized chaos" is purposeful and voice-motivated.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chess motif with graveyard mystery transforms tropes through specific details like the black king locket, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk in lyric, accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, committing to premise of echoes revealing intentions. No close echoes of famous scenes; emotional specificity avoids generics.</comment>
