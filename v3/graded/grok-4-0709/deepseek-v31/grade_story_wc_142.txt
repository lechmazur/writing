<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rio's motivation to navigate gentrification is clear and intensifies through her dual allegiance, compelling choices like painting the graffiti; interiority is concrete and embodied, with contradictory impulses of hope and desperation acting simultaneously, as in her fragile hope piercing desperation after finishing the art. The final endurance earns its cost through prior causality, foreclosing outright resistance for adaptive merging. Secondary character (net-mender) applies relevant pressure, shifting status dynamics in their casual exchange that crystallizes her stance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under the Causal lens, the structure links beats through motivated actions, from receiving the chip to painting and the confirming conversation, with one meaningful tightening in the net-mender's idea that narrows options toward adaptation. Orientation anchors who, where, and when by the first paragraph in the carnival setting. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) in the final reflection, reweighting her dual allegiance as a bridge with felt cost in the persistent desperation undercurrent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The raft city carnival setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like neon lights and fried dough filtered through Rio's biased perception, constraining her graffiti action on the rust-stained wall. It evolves consistently, mirroring her internal shift from desperation to hope in the sunset hues. The environment charges the final image at the city's edge, where water swallows reflections, reweighting the stake of adaptation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of navigating gentrification signals early and tightens once through the net-mender's conversation, forcing stance crystallization under coherent pressure without coincidence resolving it. Agency in Rio's graffiti and committee proposal forecloses pure resistance, with visible cost in the cold desperation undercurrent. Under Causal lens, escalation narrows options via because/therefore linkage, though a second deepening could elevate.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of merging old and new emerges organically from graffiti symbols connecting community and Rio's dual allegiance, inviting reflection through ambiguity in adaptation's costs. Subtext in the net-mender's casual words and the foundation chip implies resilience without tidy morals. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer, reweighting the premise of inevitable change with conceptual cost in the defiant carnival music.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and modest, with perceptual signature in Rio's orderly intuitive filtering of sensory assault. Voice texture is distinct in rhythmic, image-rich prose that modulates with emotion, as in the serene graffiti movements. Dialogue is natural, subtextual, and advances plot, distinguishing characters like Elias's muttered warning and the net-mender's casual scratch.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in sentences like the blooming maze description that advances atmosphere and character. No major loops or artifacts, though some figurative density in the sunset paragraph borders overwriting without muddling clarity. Final line resolves with resonant image, propelling toward charged poise.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of gentrification in a floating carnival city, transformed through Rio's graffiti-encoded rebellion and dual allegiance, feeling inevitable in the adaptive bridge realization. Risk in quiet, hopeful desperation tone heightens stakes without gimmickry. Avoids tropes by grounding in specific details like the foundation stone chip's warmth.</comment>
