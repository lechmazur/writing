<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyra's motivation as a root-bound visionary is clear and intensifies through her curiosity-driven pursuit, compelling the sacrificial choice at the plinth with embodied pain and contradictory elation; interiority is concrete, with scars revealing flaws and values under pressure. The covenant's limits drive inevitable struggle, shown in her tethered movement and final renunciation of isolation for connection. No second character, so relationship bullets ignored; quick test met with contradictory impulses in the incision moment earning the reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, pattern of glowing clipping and visions builds density to a resonant reconfiguration at the plinth, with felt cost in the incision and conceptual repricing of her purpose as anchor; orientation anchors who (Lyra), where (cobalt glade), when (dusk eclipse) by paragraph two. Closure lands on-page with the shimmering knot reweighting her bondage; quick test met with persistent root constraint shaping tactics to the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The cobalt glade at dusk is vivid and purposeful, constraining Lyra's movement via roots and supplying the plinth that charges the closure; sensory details like humming air and phosphorescent light reflect POV bias and urgency, mirroring her anxious elation. Environment evolves with the eclipse, affecting choices; quick test met as the glade and plinth constrain the sacrificial act and charge the final knot image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of finding the dream intersection signals early and deepens through the eclipse's pressure, culminating in agency-driven sacrifice that reweights options with pain's cost; under Accumulative lens, cadence shifts with visions narrowing to the plinth, forcing stance crystallization. One meaningful tightening suffices; quick test met as protagonist agency drives the incision, making cost unmistakable in the fresh wound.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of connection through sacrifice emerges from scars, covenant, and dream intersection without direct statements, inviting reflection on bondage as purpose via ambiguity in her elation; final knot image offers resonant, non-literal repricing of her role. Subtext in visions and clipping implies complexity; quick test met as ending reweights premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in tactile scars and visionary flickers biased by curiosity; prose texture distinct in rhythmic, lyric syntax modulating with pressure, teaching patterned elision early for legibility. No dialogue; quick test met with rhythmic control under stress at the plinth, no elision unpaid.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in sentences like the glade's eruption advancing atmosphere without loops; some figurative stacking in visions, but purposeful and taught, avoiding muddle in peak beats. Clarity strong, propulsion to closure clean; quick test met with zero artifacts dulling the knot image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of root-binding and dream intersection transforms fantasy tropes through specific scars and eclipse covenant, feeling inevitable in the plinth sacrifice; risk in lyric ambiguity heightens stakes without gimmickry. Quick test met with non-obvious reconfiguration as anchor.</comment>
