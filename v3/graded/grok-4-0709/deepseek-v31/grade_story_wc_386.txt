<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to salvage pure truth is clear and intensifies compellingly, rooted in her traits as a whisperer and diver, with interiority shown through concrete, embodied focus on the snow globe. Internal conflict emerges in her desperate need amid the cacophony of spirits, leading to an earned revelation that forecloses the lie's persistence with conceptual cost. No second character appears, so relationship dynamics are irrelevant; the single-POV interiority avoids stock phrasing effectively.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through layered dream-fragments into a mosaic, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration where exposing the truth silences the purser's lie, with conceptual cost legible in the poisoned collective memory. Orientation anchors early in the glacier shrine; causality holds via patterned accumulation without breaks. The single-scene scope fits, with one meaningful deepening in the Reykjavik dream window paying off at closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The glacier ice shrine is vividly specific, with sensory details like frigid air and burning wax filtered through Elara's priorities, subtly mirroring her quest for trapped light and truth. The setting constrains her delicate work and charges the final image, as the ice holds its breath in reverence, evolving causally with her revelation. Micro-details like the altar integrate into action, enhancing atmosphere without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of exposing the devastating lie signals early and tightens accumulatively through dream analysis, narrowing options to the pivotal Reykjavik window that forces truth's emergence. Protagonist agency drives the deepening, with conceptual cost felt in the terrible fact's purity amid regrets. Under Accumulative lens, pressure coheres without needing multiple reversals, though stakes remain somewhat abstract until the final reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of salvaging untainted truth from wreckage emerges organically from Elara's method and the purser's guilt, with subtext in overlapping sensations and distorted glass implying distorted memories. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer by repricing the ship's history, embracing complexity without tidy morals. Purposeful ambiguity lingers in the terrible fact, eliciting emotional aftereffect through the ice's reverence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and apt, with perceptual signature biased toward ethereal echoes and frigid details, modulating rhythmically under analytical pressure. Prose texture is distinct in poetic syntax and word choice, like "borrowed starlight held fast in ice," without unmotivated elision. No dialogue present, so irrelevant; voice coherence heightens the accumulative build to closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is concise and propulsive, with high density in layered images like the warped snow globe doing double work for atmosphere and theme, varying rhythm naturally without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is controlled and coherent, avoiding muddle in peak beats like the revelation. Final line recharges motifs effectively, with clean grammar and purposeful syntax supporting momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise ingeniously synthesizes wreck-diving with ghost-whispering via dream cameos in a glacial shrine, transforming shipwreck tropes through Elara's unorthodox method and the purser's fraud. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes organically, feeling inevitable in the snow globe's guilt-melted form. Fresh inflection in the conceptual repricing avoids derivative echoes, committing fully to its visionary authenticity.</comment>
