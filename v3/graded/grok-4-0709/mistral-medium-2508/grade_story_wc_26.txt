<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Liora's motivation as a dusk noticer is clear and intensifies compellingly toward her high-stakes shadow trade, with embodied interiority in her "half-empty" state; the final choice earns its cost through prior reflections without stock epiphanies. Minor weakness in the curator's thin presence, but relationships aren't pivotal here. The moment she presses the stone to her chest reveals contradictory impulses of protection and sacrifice effectively.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through patterned images of shadows and light to a resonant reconfiguration in the shadow merger, with legible cost in Liora's thinned shadow; orientation anchors early with the floating library. Closure lands as Charged Poise with the settled shadow curling like a cat, reweighting hope's persistence. Slight ambiguity in causal links between footage and decision, but pattern holds without contradiction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The blooming library above clouds is vivid and purposeful, constraining choices like placing the stone on the windowsill and charging the final image with glowing books; sensory details filter through Liora's bias, evolving causally as shelves shift. Environment mirrors her internal metamorphosis subtly without overt symbolism. The curator's discovery moment integrates setting into emotional resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving unbound hope tightens through the footage comparison, deepening to her shadow offer with felt cost in her half-emptiness; under Textural lens, cadence shifts reweight stakes without needing multiple reversals. Agency in her palm-opening crystallizes stance, foreclosing isolation. The poet's lingering shadow provides coherent pressure, though coincidence of the stone's appearance slightly complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of hope's metamorphosis emerges organically from images like the unbound shadow and pulsing stone, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer via the final luminous regret without moralizing. Subtext in silences and implications, like the curator's lie, invites reflection on emotional detachment. The poet's line "I carved my longing into stone" reweights prior particulars effectively.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person close POV stays stable and character-specific, with perceptual signature in dusk-noticing details; voice texture is poetic and rhythmic, modulating with pressure like the held breath. Brief dialogue feels natural and subtextual, advancing the curator's protective lie. No head-hopping, and elisions like footage summaries are taught and paid off in her realization.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in blooming petals and humming air; no significant loops or artifacts, though some metaphors like "forgotten promise" border purple but serve momentum. Final line resolves with resonant image, propelling through selective detail. The shadow-peeling sentence advances action and atmosphere without scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of shareable dreams and unbound shadows transforms familiar tropes through specific library motifs and Liora's noticer perspective; risk in poetic structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. The stone's pulse as hope feels inevitable in hindsight, committing to conceptual integrity. Avoids derivative echoes, with ingenuity in the shadow trade reconfiguring emotional entities.</comment>
