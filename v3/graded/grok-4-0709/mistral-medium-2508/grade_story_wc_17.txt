<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to map echoes and confront legacy is clear and intensifies through embodied interiority, with contradictory impulses evident in his hesitation before opening the door; the final renunciation of the burden as a "thread" feels earned with visible emotional cost. Strengths include concrete traits like his perceptive ear driving choices, avoiding stereotypes. Minor slip in stock phrasing like "weight of legacy" slightly flattens complexity, but it doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through layered echoes and realizations to a Resonant Reconfiguration in the mural completion and singing corridor, with conceptual cost of reweighted legacy legible in the final image; orientation anchors early with Elias in the passage. One meaningful cadence shift suffices, and closure lands on-page with undeniable pressure. No causality breaks, though some ellipsis feels convenient without narrowing options further.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting of the ivy-veiled passage is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like damp stone and old smoke filtering through POV bias to constrain choices, such as following the hum to the alcove; it charges the final image of the glowing threshold. Micro-setting elements like the alcove and door evolve causally, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism. Environment directly shapes the climax by revealing the mural and echoes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of legacy's burden signals early and deepens through discoveries like the negative and diaries, with one meaningful tightening in the door-opening that narrows emotional options; cost is felt in the shaking hands and lighter chest. Under Accumulative/Textural lens, pressure accumulates via overlapping echoes, forcing stance crystallization. No multiple reversals needed, but coincidence of the face matching his mother's slightly undercuts agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory and legacy emerges organically from images like the negative and mural, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer where walls remember and sing, reweighting the premise without moralizing; subtext in silences and implications adds complexity. Emotional aftereffect lingers through ambiguity of the thread to follow or cut. Final image offers Conceptual Repricing with undeniable cost, avoiding tidy resolutions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in Elias's sensitivity to echoes, and prose texture modulates rhythmically under pressure, such as shortening in the alcove discovery; no dialogue present, so not evaluated. Purposeful compression in reflective blocks anchors in present cues like the negative. Minor register drift in poetic flourishes feels voice-motivated and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm and syntax to propel momentum, as in the match-lighting beat; metaphors like "pulse of the corridor" are controlled without muddle. Minor paraphrase loops around echoes and ivy repeat without payoff, slightly dulling propulsion, but not in closure. Information advances atmosphere and character without scaffolding; opening and final lines recharge motifs effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original concept of corridor echo cartographer synthesizes post-climate shift world with personal legacy in a non-obvious way, transforming tropes of haunted spaces through specific details like tuning fork and negatives; risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity feels inevitable, with fresh inflection in the singing echoes. Avoids derivative premises, committing fully to implications.</comment>
