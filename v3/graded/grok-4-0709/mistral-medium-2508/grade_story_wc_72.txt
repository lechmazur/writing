The single-POV focus reveals contradictory impulses in scene, especially at the dome-splitting moment, foreclosing the old certainty with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, revelations build density and break patterns, leading to a Conceptual Repricing closure where the city rises with undeniable conceptual cost of the old world's end.

The final image reconfigures meaning with charged poise, as the human's drowning becomes rebirth, shaped by persistent telepathic pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The underwater garden's specifics—marble arches, coral plaques, mosaic—constrain choices and charge the final blooming image, with bioluminescence and silt filtering through POV bias. Sensory details evolve causally, mirroring revelations, and the dome's seam as micro-setting directly enables the closure. Environment pressures the human's tactics, evolving from sagging ruins to rising city.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of poisoning the "god" tightens through revelations, forcing stance crystallization under textural pressure, with one meaningful deepening that narrows options to pressing the seam.
