<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The balladeer's motivation to encode unspoken needs is clear and intensifies through his interaction with the ghost, culminating in a credible renunciation with felt cost in the raw throat and empty hands. Interiority is concrete, embodied in his deliberate exhales and searing palm, revealing contradictory impulses like preserving silence while pressing symbols. The grandmother's reflection anchors present choices without excess, tilting his final micro-choice to slam the bolt plate. Single-POV focus excels, but minor stock phrasing in emotional embodiment slightly limits the high band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned symbols and mist density to a resonant reconfiguration in the ghost's unraveling, with conceptual cost legible in the inverted mist and unbroken shadow. Orientation anchors early in the misty courtyard above clouds, serving the ethereal closure without disorientation debt. Closure lands on-page as Earned Stasis, foreclosing the ghost's escape into him with visible pressure behind ribs and raw throat. One meaningful cadence shift suffices, but ambiguity in the child's waking slightly softens hindsight inevitability.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The misty courtyard above clouds constrains choices, with slick cobblestones and dying lanterns pressuring the encoding act and charging the final inverted mist image. Sensory details are vivid and POV-filtered, like ozone scent and warm bolt plate, mirroring internal tension without overt symbolism. Environment evolves causally, from dim lanterns to flaring life, guiding the climax without static repetition. Recurring bolt plate as micro-setting elevates ingenuity, directly shaping the decisive slam.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of articulating the ghost's need tightens through symbol etching and spiral question, deepening to a stance crystallization in the slam under Accumulative/Textural lens. One meaningful intensification narrows options, forcing renunciation with felt cost in the searing palm and unraveling code. Agency drives escalation via micro-choices like pressing harder, but coincidence in the graffiti ripping slightly complicates without fully resolving. Moral calculus sharpens the peak, weighing preservation against release.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of translating silence emerges organically from encoding actions and grandmother's flowers, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer via the broken line symbol and dissolved echo. Subtext in mist coiling and warm pulse invites reflection on unspoken burdens without confusion. Final image reweights the premise with conceptual cost, embracing ambiguity in the ongoing work. Emotional honesty avoids sentimentality, but a touch of pseudo-profundity in "silence was enough" caps the band.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable, with perceptual signature in driftingly alert fingers and ozone scents, modulating rhythm under pressure like slow exhales. Prose texture is distinct, with purposeful compression in symbol descriptions taught early and paid off at closure. No dialogue present, so policy skips those bullets; free indirect style is clean, avoiding filter verbs. Rhythmic control heightens the scream without obscurity, meeting quick test fully.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere through vivid images like mist as wet silk, without loops or scaffold. Rhythm varies naturally, accelerating in the slam and breathing in the quiet aftermath, but minor figurative muddle in "ghost in code" metaphor slightly dulls peak clarity. No artifacts touch closure, and information propels forward with strong verbs. Opening anchors voice; final line recharges motifs effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of folklore and digital metaphor in "ghost in code" feels organic, transforming relic tropes through specific encoding and bolt plate use. Risk in lyric compression heightens stakes without gimmickry, with the child's waking offering non-obvious inflection on ongoing silence. Emotional specificity avoids generics, but proximity to familiar ghost story echoes slightly limits transformation. Core premise commits fully, synthesizing ideas memorably.</comment>
