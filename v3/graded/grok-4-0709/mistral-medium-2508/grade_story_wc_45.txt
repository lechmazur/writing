<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Liora's motivation as a forgiving skeptic is clear and intensifies through her bone-setting background, compelling her bargain with the changeling; interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions like steady breath under pressure revealing contradictory impulses. The final renunciation earns its cost via prior causality, as seen in her whisper to "make it right," foreclosing unchecked magic. Relationships are minimally present but effectively pressure her via the brother's memory. Minor slip in over-articulated traits like "shrewdly innocent" trends label-like without deeper contradiction in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under a Causal lens, the structure links events tightly—finding the tooth causes the garden's reaction, leading to the confrontation and decisive change of the brother's return with conceptual cost in the humming needle. Orientation anchors early in the maze gap, serving closure without disorientation debt. Closure is a Decisive Change on-page, with felt cost in Liora's retained needle and dreams, shaped by the persistent constraint of the well's symbols. The persistent price of understanding mistakes elevates tactics in the bargain moment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The secret garden is vividly specific, with pulsing flowers and sighing vines that constrain choices, like revealing the changeling, and charge the final image of dissolution into light. Sensory details are purposeful, filtered through Liora's POV, mirroring her internal cleft in certainty. Environment evolves causally, from entry to water rising, affecting action without static repetition. The well as micro-setting directly shapes the climax, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reclaiming her brother tightens meaningfully in the forehead-press memory flood, narrowing options under Causal lens pressure and forcing the bargain with visible emotional cost in her exhale. Agency drives escalation via Liora's decision to offer the tooth, crystallizing stance without coincidence resolving it. One deepening suffices, but lacks a secondary accent for fuller weave. Cost is unmistakable in the shed skin and reordered world, meeting the 9+ test marginally.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of mending world's cracks emerges organically from events like the tooth pickup and bargain, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in the humming needle. Subtext in gestures, like the changeling's lunge, invites reflection on forgiveness without confusion. The final image of steady hands offers a resonant, non-literal answer to certainty's cleft, reweighting the premise. No explicit statements mar it, though thematic echo in "some cracks were meant to let the light in" borders on direct.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with distinct perceptual signature in waxy leaves and aching symbols, modulating rhythm under pressure like shortened sentences in the memory drown. Dialogue is natural, subtext-laden, advancing plot in lines like "You dropped this" pursuing reconciliation. No head-hopping or unmotivated elision; prose texture reflects Liora's mind. Perceptual bias and rhythmic control heighten the bargain without obscurity, passing the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in poetic images like "vines heavy with fruit no one had ever tasted" advancing atmosphere without loops. No significant artifacts or paraphrase churn; metaphors cohere, like iron in rain scent. Opening anchors voice, final line recharges motifs with propulsion. Minor overwriting in stacked details during entry slightly dulls momentum but doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Original synthesis of changeling lore with bone-setting transforms tropes through specific choices like the needle and star bargain, feeling inevitable in the well's flare. Emotional complexity in yearning avoids generics, with fresh inflection in turning wounds to constellations. Risk in magical realism heightens stakes without gimmickry. Proximity to fairy tale echoes is transformed, but lacks bolder subversion for higher band.</comment>
