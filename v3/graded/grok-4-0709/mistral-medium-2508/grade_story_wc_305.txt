<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's motivation for seeking the "source" beyond fragile peace is clear and intensifies through micro-choices like pressing the hairpin into soil and plucking the shoot, revealing contradictory impulses of forgiveness without forgetting; interiority is concrete and embodied, with emotions like grief scalloping joy shown in her palms' scars and the fig tree's roots. The final renunciation of mere peace earns a meaningful endurance with felt cost in ongoing grief, foreclosing simpler paths. Contradictory impulses act in scene, and the choice is earned with visible cost, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned images like scallops and vines, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration in the silver fruit and understanding grief's shape, with conceptual cost in reweighted cycles; orientation anchors early with the grotto and Maren at the threshold. Closure lands on-page with the fruit-giving and tree-sitting, reweighting stakes without decisive physical change but through charged poise. Persistent motif of scallops shapes the final image, but lens holds without full escalation to 9+.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The grotto's damp earth, bioluminescent moss, and umbral vines vividly anchor the setting, with sensory details like the first sigh of a world waking filtered through Maren's bias; the environment constrains choices, as the moss parts and shoot unfurls, charging the final image of the silver fruit on the fig tree. Micro-setting of the hairpin and tree integrates into action, evolving causally. It constrains the closure choice and charges the final image, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of unearthing contentment beyond forgiveness tightens through the grotto interaction, deepening with the shoot's absorption and fruit's emergence, reweighting options under Accumulative/Textural lens; cost is felt in the grotto's tremble and her lighter steps amid persistent grief. One meaningful deepening suffices, with agency in plucking and giving the fruit. Escalation via pattern shift is agency-driven with unmistakable cost, but lacks multiple layers for higher band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of rebirth as quiet unraveling emerges organically from motifs like the scalloped hairpin, shoot, and fruit, resisting tidy morals by embracing grief's role in joy; subtext in silences and images like the thread connecting endings to beginnings invites reflection on forgiveness's hollow. The final image of scalloping a bandage offers a resonant, non-literal answer to seeking the source, reweighting prior material without stated moral, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and modest, with perceptual signature in Maren's biased noticing of vines and moss pulsing like heartbeats; voice texture is distinctively poetic, with rhythmic control in phrases like "not a wound but a cradle" heightening pressure. Minimal dialogue is natural and subtextual, as in her reply to the voice. Distinct signature and rhythm under pressure with taught lyric compression paid off at closure meet the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with vivid images like "the color of twilight just before the stars remember themselves" advancing atmosphere without loops; syntactic variety and rhythm vary naturally, though some figurative density in the grotto beat borders on overwriting but serves the lyric mode. No major artifacts obscure closure. High density and propulsion with zero loops satisfy most of the 9+ test, but peak-beat figurations slightly muddle for full 9+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The premise transforms forgiveness tropes through mythical grotto and scalloped motifs synthesizing personal grief with rebirth cycles, feeling inevitable in the fruit-giving; risk in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Fresh synthesis of vines, shoots, and silver fruit elevates, meeting the 9+ test threshold but capped by global gates.</comment>
