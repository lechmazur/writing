<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The coachman's motivation to heal the scarred land is clear and rooted in his traits as a gaunt, wind-carved figure, with embodied emotions shown through his ritual actions and whispers; interiority is concrete, revealing a hierarchy of values in his trust despite the salt and sorrow. No contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene, slightly limiting depth, but his endurance forecloses easier paths with felt cost in poor sleep and dreams. The final renunciation of watching the growth earns credibility through prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through layered images of seeds, birds, and tide, with pattern breaks in the scattering and horizon bleed leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration via Conceptual Repricing; closure lands on-page with conceptual cost in the land's slow vengeance and the coachman's shadow existence. Orientation anchors early at the jetty and coachman, with no disorientation debt. Persistent constraint of the battlefield's hunger shapes tactics, charging the final image of poppies leaning toward the sea.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Vivid, selective details like slick stones, bleached coral, and kelp uncurling integrate into action, with the jetty and tide constraining choices and charging the closure through the glowing garden years later. Atmosphere of bruised twilight mirrors internal renewal, with sensory hierarchy biased toward the coachman's wind-squinted perception. The recurring jetty as micro-setting evolves causally, pressuring the seed-scattering and final reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><grade>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the dominant stake of reclaiming the battlefield escalates through density of natural images and cadence shift in the emptying pockets, forcing stance crystallization with felt cost in the coachman's dreams and dedication. One meaningful deepening narrows options as he trusts the roots despite rot. Agency in scattering seeds drives the reconfiguration, though coincidence of bird calls complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of renewal amid decay emerges organically from seed pods, bird calls, and the garden's vengeance, with subtext in silences and implications like the tide tasting less of sorrow. The final image of the glowing jetty offers a resonant, non-literal repricing of the battlefield's memory without moralizing. Emotional aftereffect lingers through complexity, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and character-bound, with distinct perceptual signature in wind-squinted observations and smoke-like syllables; prose texture is poetic and rhythmic, modulating with intensity. No dialogue, so policy applies; patterned elision in reflections is taught early and pays off at closure. Diction fits the coachman's idiom, with syntax reflecting his contemplative state under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm and syntax to propel momentum, as in the curling syllables and exhaling jetty; no loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddle, with strong verbs and specific nouns enhancing clarity. Opening anchors voice in the broken-rib jetty, and final line recharges motifs without artifacts. Information advances atmosphere and theme seamlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-battle renewal via seed pods and bird calls feels inevitable, transforming tropes of haunted lands through specific, poetic ingenuity; risk in lyric accumulations heightens stakes without gimmickry. Core premise offers non-obvious angle on nature's vengeance, cohering as singular vision. The garden's remembrance reweights familiar motifs organically.</comment>
