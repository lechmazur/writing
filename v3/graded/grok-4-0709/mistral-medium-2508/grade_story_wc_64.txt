<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to unravel the tapestry stems from his kind, curious nature as a gardener speaking to the dead, intensifying through embodied choices like tracing knots despite fighting resistance; interiority is concrete with contradictory impulses, such as calm hands amid tightening throat, earning the final renunciation of ignorance with felt emotional cost. Strengths include character-specific embodiment, like fingers warm from soil, revealing values under pressure. Minor slip in over-articulated self-awareness at the end, but it doesn't undermine the hierarchy of values shown in micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through patterned knot-untangling beats, each increasing density and breaking cadence with revelations like the husband's scent, leading to a Conceptual Repricing closure where Elias reweights intentions as knots, with conceptual cost in deepened blitheness like darkened soil; orientation anchors early with chess clock and silo. Strength in taught pattern of echoes paying off at closure without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid, purposeful sensory details like damp earth, rust, and groaning iron ribs anchor the cobalt silo under stars, constraining Elias's choices by providing the edge for lantern light and shadows stretching; recurring marigolds and weeping cherry evolve to charge the final image, mirroring internal reconfiguration. Micro-setting of the tapestry as object-as-setting heightens atmosphere without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of unraveling the widow's truth escalates texturally through knot-deepenings, narrowing options with each release like the fighting third knot forcing stance crystallization; agency in untangling forecloses ignorance with felt cost in the vision's weight, coherent under Accumulative lens. One meaningful intensification suffices, but coincidence of voices complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of intentions as knotted echoes emerges organically from knot-untangling and graveyard whispers, culminating in a resonant final image of reset chessboard and trembling marigolds that reweights the premise without moralizing; subtext in silo's groans and tapestry's breathing invites ambiguity on buried truths. Strength in emotional honesty avoiding sentimentality, tied to Elias's arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable with distinct perceptual signature in Elias's worm-talking bias, modulating rhythm from poetic compression in visions to sure fingers at reset; dialogue minimal but subtextual in Hester's insistence. Patterned elision in knot releases taught early, paying off legibly at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose dense with rhythmic variety, like ticking clock to creaking silo, advancing atmosphere without loops; metaphors like breathing knots are coherent and purposeful, though occasional overwriting in scents and visions risks muddle but doesn't obscure closure. High density in multi-job sentences, clean mechanics, and propulsion under pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chess, graveyard gardening, and tapestry echoes transforms ghost tropes through specific knot mechanics and intention-shapes, feeling inevitable with risk in lyric ambiguity heightening thematic stakes; originality in uncharted echoes as trapped sighs avoids stock without gimmickry.</comment>
