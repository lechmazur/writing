<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The potter's motivation to seek kindness in ruins is clear and intensifies through micro-choices like embedding the glass, revealing contradictory impulses of patience and urgency; interiority is embodied in tactile sensations like the thrum, avoiding stock phrasing. Flaws complicate choices, as his blind spot for timelines' fractures drives the renunciation of repair for remembrance, with felt cost in the ending's poise. The single-POV baseline holds with strong internal contradiction under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned images of light, thrum, and hives to a Conceptual Repricing closure where resistance becomes remembrance, with conceptual cost legible in the final wind-carried honey scent. Orientation anchors who (potter), where (oasis), and when (smoke flattening) by ~50 words, serving the lyric buildup. One meaningful cadence shift at the kiln firing tightens the stake without requiring causal turns.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The scorched wasteland and hives provide vivid, purposeful sensory details filtered through the potter's bias, with sun patterns constraining his path and charging the final bowl's glow. Micro-setting like the bowl and glass evolves causally, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism. Environment pressures choices, as the oasis's fractures enable the insight, satisfying the 9+ test by charging the closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of understanding resistant places tightens once through the bee's thrum and glass embedding, reweighting options under Accumulative lens with conceptual cost in the repriced remembrance. Agency via renunciation forecloses repair, crystallizing stance with felt pressure. No multiple reversals needed; one deepening suffices, though cost could be more viscerally embodied at peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of visibility in cracks emerges organically from images like fractured timelines and thrumming glass, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer via the bowl's glow and honey scent, reweighting the premise without moralizing. Subtext in gestures like whispering to the bee invites reflection on remembrance's complexity. Satisfies 9+ test with lingering ambiguity tied to the potter's insight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in tactile, light-focused noticing; voice texture via rhythmic, patterned diction teaches lyric compression early and pays off at closure. Brief dialogue feels natural and subtextual, advancing the stake. No head-hopping; elision of timelines is purposeful and legible under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied rhythm, strong verbs, and purposeful metaphors like "glaze shimmering like the last breath of a dying star," advancing atmosphere without loops. Some figurative density in peak beats borders on overwriting but maintains clarity and momentum. Opening anchors voice; final line recharges motifs cleanly, with zero artifacts touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of pottery, fractured timelines, and beekeeping ruins feels inevitable, transforming tropes through specific details like thrumming glass and sun patterns that heighten stakes. Risk in lyric structure elevates coherence without gimmickry, committing to the premise's implications. No derivative echoes; emotional specificity anchors universality.</comment>
