<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lena's motivation is clear and intensifies compellingly from survival to hunting potential, rooted in her father's geode and embodied through contradictory impulses like bleak exhilaration; interiority is concrete, with emotions layered in crisis without therapy-speak, as seen in her pulse hammering while hovering over the console. The final renunciation of fixing the past for an awakening earns stasis with felt cost, foreclosing passive survival. Relationships are minimal but the intercom warnings apply relevant pressure. No major flaws, though secondary characters lack depth, but this fits single-POV scope.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through patterned reflections and imagery to a Conceptual Repricing closure where Lena awakens to potential's edge, with conceptual cost legible in the geode cooling and her stepping into the dark; orientation anchors early in the observatory watching the storm. Causality holds via motivated ellipses, like stealing the hard drive leading to coordinates, without breaks. Minor slip in ellipsis density slightly softens midpoint linkage, but closure lands cleanly with undeniable pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the groaning observatory and storm below filtering through Lena's bias, constraining choices like pressing the dome glass and using the console; sensory details balance urgency, mirroring internal chaos in lightning stitches. The floating structure evolves causally with shudders and dying lights, charging the final dark step. Micro-setting of the geode as object-as-setting constrains action and reweights the closure image. No anachronisms or inconsistencies harm credibility.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, dominant stake of hunting unused potential tightens meaningfully when Lena keys the frequency despite warnings, deepening via pattern shift to brighter thread and vision, reweighting with conceptual cost in the awakening. Pressure coheres from storm and perturbations, forcing stance crystallization without coincidence resolving. Agency in her finger hovering and activation drives escalation, with visible price in alarms and field collapse risk. One tightening suffices, but lacks a secondary accent for fuller depth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of potential as hunted rather than spent emerges organically from geode imagery and perturbation motifs, culminating in resonant non-literal answer via the wedding vision and awakening without moralizing. Subtext in gestures like tracing the geode and smiling amid alarms invites reflection on unmade choices. Emotional aftereffect is concrete, embracing complexity without tidy binaries. Final image reweights premise with lingering ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable and modest, with perceptual signature biased toward tangible intangibles like the veil's float; voice texture is distinct in rhythmic, compressed syntax that heightens pressure, as in "perturbation theory wasn’t just math—it was a knife." Intercom dialogue carries subtext and advances plot naturally, with indirection in the scientist's crackled warning. No head-hopping or register drifts; elision of past events is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm and syntax to propel beats, as in lightning stitching ruins without scaffold or loops; metaphors like "a pocket of unused time" are coherent and purposeful, avoiding muddle. No artifacts obscure closure, with strong verbs and specific details advancing atmosphere. Opening anchors stakes vividly; final line resolves with charged image. Minor figurative density in storm description trends ornate but serves textural lens without harm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Originality shines in synthesizing perturbation theory with emotional hunting of potential, transforming sci-fi tropes through Lena's specific grief and geode motif, feeling inevitable in the vision's reprise. Bold risk in lyric compression heightens stakes without gimmickry. Core premise offers fresh angle on time and choice, committing fully without retreat. Minor echo of familiar time-manipulation arcs, but grounded details personalize it.</comment>
