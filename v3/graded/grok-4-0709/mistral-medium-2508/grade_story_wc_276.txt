<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The fisher's cool-headed motivation is rooted in grief and intensifies compellingly toward the renunciation of his daughter's echo, with embodied emotions like the "memory hit like a wave" revealing contradictory impulses in scene without stock phrasing. Interior contradiction shines in his unflinching lean into the mouth while carrying silence as command, earning the stasis with felt cost. No second character limits relationship crucibles, but single-POV interiority is concrete and particular, avoiding therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned elision and density increases, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where letting the echo drown forecloses chasing with legible emotional cost in the final smile and dark rush. Orientation anchors early in the sound wave garden with the fisher, and causality holds via textural shifts like the garden's scream. Minor ellipsis in the dig feels motivated but could tighten linkage to the spike's tremble for sharper payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The sound wave garden is vividly sensory and purposeful, with humming soil and swaying stems constraining choices like pressing palm to dirt and digging toward silence, charging the final image where it hums in feral lullaby. Micro-setting of the garden and rail spike evolves causally, mirroring internal grief without overt symbolism. Environment pressures action tactilely, as in the mouth's breath smelling of reeds, heightening atmosphere without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of catching/releasing the daughter's echo tightens meaningfully through the spike's drive and mouth's convulsion, deepening via textural shift that reweights options with felt cost in blackened stems and carried voice. Agency in voicing silence as command drives the Charged Poise at ending, though coincidence of constellations complicates without resolving. One intensification suffices, but the escalation feels slightly abstract until the dig's hollow strike.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of grief's echoes and silence emerges organically from images like zigzagging stars and the mouth's whisper, offering resonant ambiguity in the final reconfiguration without moralizing. Subtext in gestures like not turning to the reed scent invites reflection on letting go, tied inextricably to the fisher's arc. The ending's non-literal answer reweights the premise of chasing whispers, avoiding sentimentality through concrete cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in sound-focused noticing, like frequencies vibrating teeth, and rhythmic prose modulates with pressure via short, measured sentences in peak moments. Patterned elision in lyric mode is taught early and pays off at closure without opacity. No dialogue, so policy skips those bullets; voice coherence elevates under stress without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in lines like "The garden screamed—a sound only he could hear," advancing atmosphere without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is controlled and coherent, avoiding muddle in peak beats like the mouth's opening. Minor simultaneity in "He leaned in until his shadow filled the gap" fits sequence clarity; overall propulsion shines in the final dark rush.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of sound wave garden and sleepwalking constellations transforms grief tropes through specific, voice-driven imagery like voicing silence as command, feeling inevitable with risk in poetic compression that heightens stakes. Premise offers fresh angle on loss without derivative echoes, committing to implications in the feral lullaby tone. Bold risk in accumulative structure coheres singularly, avoiding middle-ground hedging.</comment>
