<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Reed's motivation to graft belonging through bold sympathy drives consistent choices, with interiority embodied in her hands' memory of reeds and the ache of recognition at the end; contradictory impulses appear in her solo search despite warnings, earning the final renunciation of chasing Syl with visible cost in slow weaving. Syl's scars mirror Reed's carvings, adding crucible pressure without stereotype. Minor slip in villagers as collective rather than individualized, but it doesn't harm closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through patterned images (reeds, tags, light) toward a Conceptual Repricing closure where belonging becomes a current and languages an invitation, with felt cost in the ache of recognition; orientation anchors early in the crystalline orchard and crater. One meaningful deepening in the shared painting reweights kinship; no causality breaks, though ellipsis in Syl's arrival is motivated by the search pattern.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The crystalline orchard and Shimmer Crater constrain choices, with the crater's hum pressuring the search and charging the final palm-press image; sensory details like whispering reeds and violet glow are selective, POV-filtered, and evolve causally, mirroring Reed's internal grafting. Micro-setting of the arbor as tool-object charges closure without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of belonging tightens through the search's deepening, narrowing options when Reed finds Syl and they paint together, forcing a trade-off in not chasing; under Accumulative/Textural lens, pattern break in the collective handprints reweights cost legibly in the constellation of touches. One meaningful intensification suffices, with coincidence of finding Syl complicating but not resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of kinship as made, not found, emerges from images like tags and grafting without direct statement, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer where lost languages invite; subtext in silences and shared paint deepens complexity, avoiding tidy morals. Final image reweights premise with ambiguity that lingers honestly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person close POV stays stable and modest, with perceptual signature in Reed's reed-memories and crater-syncing breath; dialogue is subtextual and goal-driven, like "You didn’t have to look" evading origins. Prose texture distinct in rhythmic, image-dense syntax that modulates with pressure; no head-hopping or unmotivated elision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in poetic sentences like "how they bent but never broke" advancing atmosphere without loops; no artifacts obscure closure, though some figurative density in crater descriptions risks muddle but pays off in invitation. Strong verbs and specific nouns propel momentum; final line recharges motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sculptor and street artist in a crystalline-crater world transforms kinship tropes through specific tags like "We are here, and so are you," feeling inevitable; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes without gimmickry. Avoids stock metaphors, committing to premise's implications.</comment>
