<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The carver's motivation to carve grief is clear and intensifies through embodied emotions, with contradictory impulses shown in his chisel slip and unvoiced scream, culminating in an earned renunciation of old methods. Interiority is concrete, like fingers twitching from grief's weight, and the spectral relationship with his father forces a choice that alters their dynamic. The final micro-choice to add his own poem reveals a hierarchy of values with visible cost in accepting collective grief.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through motif density (butterflies, ribbons, poems) to a Conceptual Repricing closure where grief becomes a door, with felt cost in the thunderous echo of voices. Orientation anchors early in the greenhouse at dusk; causality holds via patterned elision without breaks. The chisel slip and spectral adjustment provide a meaningful deepening, though the ending's reconfiguration feels slightly soft without a sharper before/after cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The ancient greenhouse at dusk is vividly specific, with damp earth, cracked glass, and jasmine scent filtering through POV bias to mirror internal grief; it constrains choices, like the butterflies projecting constellations that charge the final image. Sensory details evolve causally, with rain striking wings like chisels, heightening atmosphere without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of carving grief tightens through spectral pressure and chisel crack, forcing a stance crystallization under Accumulative/Textural lens, with visible cost in the unvoiced scream and foreclosed path of traditional carving. One meaningful deepening occurs via father's advice, narrowing options to hollows; agency is in renunciation, though coincidence of butterfly arrival complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of grief as a reshapable hollow emerges organically from images like the cracked stone and butterfly wings, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer at dinner where it's reframed as a door. Subtext in silences and implications, like the father's flickering form, invites reflection on absence without tidy morals.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in poetic, meditative texture, like dusk painting in bruised violet; dialogue is natural and subtextual, advancing plot through father's advice on grief. Rhythmic control heightens under pressure, with purposeful compression in motif patterns taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied rhythm, like wings whispering like pages turning, advancing atmosphere without loops; some figurative stacking in peak beats (e.g., thunder as vibration in ribs) borders on muddle but pays off in closure. Clarity is high, with strong verbs and no artifacts touching the ending.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of spectral mentorship with butterfly migration and poem ribbons transforms grief tropes through specific choices, like hollowing stone as absence; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes organically, feeling inevitable in the dinner scene reprise.</comment>
