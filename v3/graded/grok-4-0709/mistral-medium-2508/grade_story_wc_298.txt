<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of patching her soul tightens through the needle's pain and roots' pull, deepening via the trade of the child's name, narrowing options with visible cost in her gasp and release under the Textural lens. Agency in her decision to mend drives escalation, forcing stance crystallization without coincidence resolving it. Moral calculus between guilt and freedom sharpens the peak, with the trade foreclosing her past path.

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of bartered destinies emerges organically from Liora's trades, culminating in complexity where mending accepts brokenness, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in her return. Subtext in gestures like pressing the card and the flower's wilt invites reflection, with the final image of raindrop offering a resonant, non-literal repricing of past as earth-bound. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality through concrete pain and scars. The ending reweights prior material without stated moral, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in Liora's idealistic noticing of roots and sighs, modulating rhythm under pressure like the needle's flash. Voice texture is distinct in poetic syntax, teaching patterned elision early and paying off at closure without head-hopping. Dialogue is natural, subtextual, and advances plot, as in Veyra's warning and Liora's whisper distinguishing idioms. Minor register drift in elevated diction under stress slightly limits, but perceptual control holds.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, sentences advancing atmosphere and character through vivid images like roots coiling, varying rhythm naturally without loops. Figurative language is controlled, metaphors coherent like orchard exhaling, propelling momentum to closure. No major artifacts, but occasional dense stacking in peak beats like the pulling roots slightly muddles without harming clarity. Information propulsion and syntactic variety support the lyrical mode, with final line recharging motifs effectively.</comment>
