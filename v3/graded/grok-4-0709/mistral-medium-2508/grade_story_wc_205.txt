<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation as a poet-revolutionary is clear and intensifies through concrete actions like tracing the shard, revealing contradictory impulses in his hunger for revision over vengeance; interiority is embodied in his lighter chest after the vision, with flaws like lingering sorrow driving the closure without stock phrasing. Taelis as secondary character applies pressure effectively in the confrontation, forcing the thematic choice. The final renunciation of the shard earns stasis with felt emotional cost on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under a Causal lens, the structure builds through motivated actions from preparation to activation, with orientation anchored early in the asteroid cathedral; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration via the vision, reweighting the dispute with conceptual cost in the shard's dust and archaeologists' uneasy knowledge, visible in the final image. One meaningful tightening occurs in the shard's fracturing, narrowing options decisively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid and time-strands vividly anchor the setting, with sensory details like humming air and glowing embers filtered through Elias's bias; the environment constrains choices, as the storm's particles enable the shard's activation, charging the final image of Elias pressing the altar. Micro-setting of the shard and mirrors integrates into action, evolving causally to mirror internal revision.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reimagining the civilization signals early and tightens causally through the storm and confrontation, forcing stance crystallization in the vision; agency in activating the shard drives escalation with visible cost in its destruction, under the Causal lens. One meaningful deepening suffices, narrowing options without coincidence resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of history as poetry emerges organically from images like tangled time-strands and the refracted vision, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in failure's beauty; the final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer by reweighting excavation as remembrance, eliciting emotional aftereffect without assertion. Subtext in Elias's correction to Taelis deepens complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in poetic noticing of threads and shards; voice texture is rhythmic and purposeful, modulating with intensity in the vision beat without register drift. Dialogue is natural, subtextual, and advances the confrontation, distinguishing characters idiomatically.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in lyrical descriptions like "pulsing with memories" without loops or scaffold; figurative language is controlled, avoiding muddle in peak beats like the shard's fracturing. Information propels forward, with strong verbs and specific details charging the closure image cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes temporal anarchy and poetic revision freshly, transforming sci-fi tropes through grounded details like irradiated silk and visible time; risk in lyric compression heightens stakes, feeling inevitable in the vision's reconfiguration without gimmickry.</comment>
