<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara's motivation as penance for a past translation error is clear and intensifies to compel her high-stakes restoration act, with interiority concrete and embodied in her trembling quill and iron-tasting breath. Internal conflict shows contradictory impulses, like careful recklessness, acting simultaneously in her decision to sing despite emissaries' approach. The final endurance reconfigures her trust in her voice with felt cost, evident in the inkwell shard's humming edge tucked away as a sharp truth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through layered images of promises and decay, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where the archive revives with conceptual cost of reknotted obligations. Orientation anchors early in the archive's scent and Elara's mission, with no disorientation debt. Closure lands on-page with the symphony's hum and Elara's laugh as a new sentence, reweighting silence as gestation rather than absence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The archive setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like crushed violets and old paper filtering through Elara's urgency, constraining her choices as emissaries approach. Micro-setting elements, such as the glass inkwell and parchment, directly charge the final image by shattering and weaving mist to seal scrolls. Environment evolves causally, mirroring her internal restoration as the doors swing open in challenge.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of restoring truth before destruction on-page reversal tightens through her singing, forcing stance crystallization under Accumulative lens, with visible cost in her past silence's curse. One meaningful deepening narrows options as indigo reveals obligations, including her name, raising personal cost. Closure is earned by her agency, reweighting promises with the archive's living whispers.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of truth as a bridge, not a blade, emerges organically from Elara's restoration of promises, with subtext in silences and harmonics inviting reflection on trust's gestation. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer by giving the past a future, reweighting extinction as waiting for the right voice. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality through her cautious, exuberant laugh as the first true sentence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in Elara's scholarly bias noticing scrolls' whispers and indigo's bloom. Prose texture is distinct, rhythmic, and lyric, with patterned elision taught early and paid off in the harmonic gaps she sings. No dialogue present, so policy skips those bullets; voice modulates under pressure without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, sentences advancing atmosphere like indigo mist coiling to seal cracks; no loops or scaffold, though some figurative density in peak beats is pattern-taught and pays off without muddle. Rhythm varies naturally, with strong verbs and specific nouns propelling to the final line's promise-split sky. Zero artifacts touch closure, maintaining clarity and propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of extinct language as living promises feels inevitable, transforming trope of cursed translations through Elara's specific penance and the inkwell shard's humming risk. Bold lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, committing to premise with fresh inflection in the archive as loom, not tomb. Risk-taking in accumulative design charges closure, earning +0.3 adjustment.</comment>
