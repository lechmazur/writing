<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lior's motivation to protect the eye while navigating truth constraints is clear and intensifies through embodied emotions like twitching fingers and grief-flavored truffle bites, revealing contradictory impulses in his occlusion tactics. The final burial renounces revelation for safety, earned by prior causality with visible cost in his quiet heart and indifferent stars. Interiority avoids stock phrasing, grounding flaws in specific misbeliefs about cures that compound his isolation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned imagery of rot, musk, and revelation, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration in burying the eye, with conceptual cost of buried truths legible in the final image. Orientation anchors early in the orchard ravine post-storm, serving closure without disorientation. Minor ellipsis in warlord encounter feels motivated but slightly softens causal linkage before the decisive act.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The ravine orchard constrains choices, with exposed roots and falling fruit mirroring Lior's precarious occlusion, charging the final burial image where roots swallow the eye. Sensory details like damp earth scent and groaning branches are selective, POV-biased, and evolve causally with the storm's aftermath, heightening atmosphere without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of protecting the eye from misuse escalates texturally through accumulating pressures like the virus's truth mandate and warlord's approach, deepening in the truffle-smearing occlusion that narrows options with felt cost of desperation. One meaningful intensification suffices, driven by agency in burial, though coincidence of men's timing complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of truth's dangers emerges organically from images like the revealing eye and occluded truffles, resisting tidy morals through ambiguity in kindness as lie, culminating in a resonant final image repricing buried truths without statement. Subtext in gestures like finger twitches and sister's echoed scream invites reflection on empathy's cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable, with perceptual signature in selective noticing of musk and roots biased by Lior's forager expertise; rhythmic control heightens in short, fragmented sentences under stress like the truffle bite. Patterned elision in reflections is taught early and pays off at closure without obscurity. Brief dialogue with warlord's men carries subtext and advances plot naturally.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in metaphors like "broken chandelier" and "pins in a black shroud" that advance atmosphere without muddle; no loops or scaffold, though one mixed simile in the eye's "saint’s relic" slightly drifts register. Clarity propels to the burial, with strong verbs and purposeful syntax under pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-apocalyptic truth virus with relic mythology transforms tropes through specific occlusion tactics and fractured grace tone, feeling inevitable in the burial that heightens stakes without gimmickry. Risk in lyric compression elevates ingenuity, committing to premise implications organically.</comment>
