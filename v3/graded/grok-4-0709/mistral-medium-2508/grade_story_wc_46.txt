<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Liora's motivation as a keeper of enduring light is clear and intensifies through memories, compelling her to pass the sea glass with felt cost of past grief; interiority is concrete and embodied, with contradictory impulses in her stillness versus the village's fire; the child's arrival forces a micro-choice that reveals values, though secondary character pressure is minimal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through layered reflections and images to a resonant reconfiguration in the passing of the sea glass, with conceptual cost in legacy amid loss; orientation anchors early in the grotto; however, causality is soft, with the girl's arrival feeling coincidental rather than motivated, slightly diluting the pattern break at closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The serpentine grotto is vividly specific, with mist and quartz veins mirroring Liora's stillness and charging the final image of woman and child with glowing stones; sensory details are purposeful, evolving with the mist's retreat to support thematic peace; the setting constrains choices by providing isolation for reflection and polishing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of sharing light without fire deepens through memories and the girl's request, with a cadence shift in teaching stillness that reweights options; agency in renunciation of fire carries felt cost in recalled losses; under Accumulative lens, pressure coheres but lacks a sharper tightening, as the arrival complicates without narrowing options decisively.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of light through stillness emerges organically from images like sea glass and pearl, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer at the passing, reweighting fire's dominance without moralizing; subtext in gestures and silences enriches complexity; emotional aftereffect lingers through ambiguity of miracle versus Tuesday.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Close third-person POV is stable and biased through Liora's perceptual signature of soft, enduring light; voice texture is distinct in lyrical rhythm and syntax, modulating with mist and memories; dialogue is natural, subtextual, and advances the handover; patterned elision in reflections is taught early and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied rhythm and high information in images like "trapped storm of green and gold"; no loops or artifacts, clarity in syntax supports momentum; final line recharges motifs effectively, though some metaphors border on ornate without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mentorship and light metaphor through sea glass polishing transforms familiar tropes; risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens thematic stakes organically; core premise feels inevitable via grotto's embrace, avoiding stock echoes.</comment>
