<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lena's motivation is clear and intensifies through her strategic creativity, with embodied emotions like steely longing driving micro-choices under pressure; the reunion confronts her flaws with visible cost in her steady voice. Interiority is concrete, showing contradictory impulses in her persistence despite years of waiting. The second character applies pressure relevant to the conflict, with status dynamics shifting in their dialogue. No diagnostic labels weaken it, but the lover's traits are shown minimally through action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned imagery and object callbacks to a Resonant Reconfiguration at the reunion, with felt cost in the long-war metaphor and clock chiming. Orientation anchors early in the tidal arbor station. Closure lands on-page with the encore reweighting past longing. One meaningful deepening suffices, but ellipsis in the path's emergence feels slightly unmotivated.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The tidal arbor setting is vivid and purposeful, constraining choices like the path's unfolding and charging the final image with branches settling like clock hands. Sensory details are selective, reflecting Lena's urgency, with the environment evolving causally as she enters the refuge. Micro-setting of objects like the piano integrates into action. It meets the 9+ test by constraining the climax and charging closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reuniting tightens through the film's path, deepening via the compasses locking and her step into the door, narrowing options with visible cost in the burning bulb and steely voice. Under Accumulative/Textural lens, pattern break in the clock's swing reweights stakes. Agency drives the encore as renunciation of past waiting. Coincidence in the figure's presence complicates but doesn't resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of defying fate through creativity emerges from images like spliced film and swinging pendulum, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer via the forward-carried music. Subtext in silence and implication enriches ambiguity without confusion. No overt moralizing, with emotional honesty avoiding sentimentality. The ending reweights prior material effectively.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature biased toward musical and temporal metaphors fitting Lena's wistful nature. Prose texture is distinct in rhythmic, lyric syntax that modulates with pressure. Dialogue is natural, subtextual, and advances the reunion with distinct idioms. It meets the 9+ test with no elision issues and rhythmic control heightening the encore.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm and syntax to propel beats, like the film's stuttering life. Figurative language is controlled without muddle, though some metaphors like wind humming risk cliché. No significant loops or artifacts obscure closure. Opening and final lines anchor voice and recharge motifs effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The surreal synthesis of tidal arbor, flickering compasses, and film-path refuge feels inevitable, transforming tropes of lost love through specific ingenuity like splicing hidden sections. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. It meets the 9+ test with non-obvious elements charging the encore. Authenticity coheres in a singular vision.</comment>
