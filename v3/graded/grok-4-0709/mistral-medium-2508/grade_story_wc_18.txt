<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interiority through embodied tracing of the sextant and contradictory impulses in resisting versus embracing the fog; motivation rooted in escaping memory compels the boundary-erasing choice, with felt cost in letting go at climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, image density builds to a resonant reconfiguration in stepping through the sky-door; closure lands as Conceptual Repricing with conceptual cost of erasure, anchored early in the orchard without orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The fog-shrouded ruined orchard constrains the recreation ritual and charges the final star-fruit image, with sensory details like frost as shattered glass mirroring internal blurring purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of erasing boundaries tightens through breathing deepening, reweighting options under textural lens; agency in renunciation forecloses holding on with unmistakable cost in the dissolving sextant.</comment>
