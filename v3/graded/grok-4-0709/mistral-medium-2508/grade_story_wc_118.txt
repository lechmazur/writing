<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to collect stories is clear and intensifies through sensory embodiment, like tracing stitches and feeling the thrum, revealing contradictory impulses in his resigned endurance; the final renunciation of balance carries a felt cost of isolation, earned by prior probing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, patterned images of dragons and displacement build to a Conceptual Repricing closure where the world remembers turning, with conceptual cost of the Sundering's trade legible in the final smile; orientation anchors early in the silo, and one meaningful deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The reclaimed silo library constrains choices through its spiraling shelves and groaning metal, charging the final image as Elias walks away; sensory details like damp parchment and wind scent are selective, POV-filtered, and evolve causally with the tilting world.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of probing displacement escalates through textural density in the tapestry's thrum and diary embers, tightening to a stance crystallization with felt cost behind the ribs; one deepening via the axis movement narrows options under the lens, though coincidence in offerings complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of lost dreams traded for a displaced world emerges through recurring dragon motifs and the Sundering's confession, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer via the pulsing tapestry that reweights isolation's cost without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable with distinct perceptual signature in tactile, auditory biases like thrum and sighs; rhythmic prose modulates with pressure, teaching patterned elision in lyric fragments that pay off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose density is high with vivid metaphors like "hook behind his ribs" advancing atmosphere without loops; syntactic variety supports propulsion, though minor figurative density in peak beats risks muddle but pays off in the bronze-quiet hum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-apocalyptic historiography with mythic displacement feels inevitable, transforming dragon tropes through the axis pivot; risk in lyric ambiguity heightens thematic stakes without obscurity, as in the trade's conceptual ingenuity.</comment>
