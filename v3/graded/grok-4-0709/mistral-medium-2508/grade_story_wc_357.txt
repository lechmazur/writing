<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Veyra's motivation is clear and rooted in her mentor's legacy, intensifying through embodied actions like touching the arrow tip, which reveals her internal conflict and hierarchy of values. The final renunciation of her old role, earned by prior discoveries, forecloses her pilot-only path with a felt cost of transformation via spreading moss. Strength lies in the contradictory impulses during the dive, where fear hitches her breath but determination compels her to reach into the fracture.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural, holding through patterned echoes and moss imagery building to a Conceptual Repricing at closure, where resilience is reweighted as growth with conceptual cost in the crumbling arrow and her irreversible change. Orientation anchors early in the cockpit during inversion, serving the accumulative buildup without disorientation. Weakness is minor redundancy in inversion descriptions, but closure lands on-page with the sapling's promise reconfiguring echoes as instructions.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The orchard planet's inverting gravity and floating arches vividly constrain Veyra's navigation, with bioluminescent moss charging choices like accelerating toward the fracture. Sensory details, filtered through her pilot's urgency, evolve causally, mirroring her internal resilience. The environment charges the final image, as arches hum in harmony, elevating the score.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of finding resilience tightens through the inversion's pressure, forcing agency in diving and reaching, with a meaningful deepening when the seed pulses, narrowing options amid reversing gravity. Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, pattern breaks like moss spreading reweight cost, felt in her thrumming veins. Strength in the ethical calculus at closure, trading her old self for planetary understanding.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of resilience as cultivated growth emerges organically from motifs like pulsing moss and echoes, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer when Veyra realizes echoes are instructions, reweighting prior losses without moralizing. Subtext in silences and implications, like the whirling hum, invites reflection on creation amid chaos. Strength in the final image of held breath, eliciting emotional aftereffect through complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable, with perceptual signature biased toward pilot's tactile cues like rudder adjustments and vibrating arrow. Prose texture is distinct, rhythmic, and modulates with intensity, as in shortened sentences during the dive. No dialogue, so policy skips those bullets; elision of mentor's fate is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in inversions like "gravity groaned" advancing atmosphere without loops. Minor scaffold in repetitive "echoes" phrasing, but no artifacts obscure closure; metaphors like "whirling silence" cohere without muddle. Strength in the final line's propulsion, recharging motifs with specific imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of inverting gravity and resilient ecology transforms sci-fi tropes through Veyra's personal quest, with fresh inflection in echoes as instructional growth. Risk in poetic compression heightens stakes without gimmickry, as moss spreading reweights her transformation. Weakness in familiar mentor-legacy setup, but specificity in pulsing seed makes it organic.</comment>
