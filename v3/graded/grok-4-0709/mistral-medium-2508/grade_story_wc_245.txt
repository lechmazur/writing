<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elian's motivation to navigate his grief is clear and intensifies through embodied sensory details, like tasting languages as salt or copper, revealing contradictory impulses in his unfolding steps. Interiority is concrete and particular, with emotions embodied in vibrations and tastes rather than labels. The final renunciation of the bone marker earns stasis with visible cost, as his grief is mapped but not erased, foreclosing raw loss for defined edges.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through layered sensory patterns toward a resonant reconfiguration at the stillpoint, with orientation anchored early in the ultrasonic forest. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing when the melody uncovers harmony, reweighting grief with undeniable conceptual cost in the "quiet blaze." One meaningful cadence shift suffices, though causality is more elliptical than linear, holding without contradiction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The ultrasonic forest is vividly specific, with humming trees and bent sound constraining Elian's navigation and charging the final image of dawn-thinning woods. Sensory details like bark-tracing and vibration-absorption reflect POV bias and urgency, evolving causally to listening branches. This micro-setting directly shapes choices, such as pressing ear to ground, and mirrors internal grief without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of navigating grief signals early and deepens through accumulating pressures like warming ring and note trails, culminating in stance crystallization at the stillpoint under textural lens. One tightening—music stopping—forces renunciation with felt cost, though escalation feels subtle and internal without sharp reversal. Agency in unfolding steps forecloses paths, but coincidence of celestial pause complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of blindness as sight emerges organically from sensory motifs and grief-mapping, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in the "quiet fire" that follows loss. Subtext in images like the remember-bone and exhaled melody invites reflection on silence-language unity. The final image offers resonant, non-literal repricing of grief without stated epiphany, though some abstractions like "spaces between sound and meaning" border on direct statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in tactile, gustatory filters like tasting sorrow as salt, modulating rhythm under pressure without elision. Prose texture in purposeful syntax and patterned diction teaches lyric mode early, paying off at closure with legible effect. No dialogue present, so policy skips; voice coherence heightens emotional beats through consistent, character-bound idiom.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in unfolding steps and exhaled forest, advancing atmosphere without loops or scaffold. Figurative language like "sound bent like light through water" is controlled and coherent, avoiding muddle in peak beats at the stillpoint. Information propulsion shines in multi-job sentences, though occasional elevated diction like "dowsing for it" fits voice without drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise ingeniously synthesizes blindness with sonic mapping, transforming tropes through specific sensory absorption and grief-as-territory, feeling inevitable in the bone's "remember." Risk in lyric compression heightens stakes without gimmickry, offering fresh angle on loss via ultrasonic world. Emotional specificity avoids generics, with bold commitment to premise implications in the carried stillpoint.</comment>
