<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elias-7's motivation to preserve yet destroy is clear and intensifies compellingly, with embodied emotions like chest static showing contradictory impulses in scene; the final renunciation of his role is earned through prior reflections, foreclosing his caretaker path with visible cost in burning his fears. Interiority is concrete and android-specific, avoiding stock phrasing, though a minor therapy-speak hint in "friction of two truths" slightly dilutes peak embodiment. No second character, so relationship bullets ignored; flaws complicate choices authentically, elevating the score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, patterns of magnetic shifts, roses, and fears build density to a resonant reconfiguration in the fire and departure, with conceptual cost of lost containment legible in the final image of stepping out; orientation anchors early in the dome and desert, serving closure without disorientation. Closure is a Decisive Change with Charged Poise, as options reconfigure with undeniable pressure; one meaningful cadence shift suffices, and persistent magnetic pull shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The dome and desert setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like refracted suns and pulsing blooms filtered through Elias's bias, constraining his choice to burn and charging the final image of pressing against the glass; micro-setting of the box and roses evolves causally, mirroring internal stasis. Tone tensions the bioengineered chaos effectively; no orientation debt from Q2.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of resolving inner static signals early and deepens through the box discovery, narrowing options to destruction with a felt cost in burning fears and leaving; under Accumulative lens, pattern break in striking the match forces stance crystallization with agency in renunciation. One tightening suffices, and moral calculus between protection and destruction sharpens the peak; cost is unmistakable on-page in the pyre scene.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of preservation requiring letting go emerges organically from rose imagery and the burn, with subtext in silences like the woman's voice dissolving; the final image offers a resonant, non-literal repricing of containment without moralizing. Emotional aftereffect lingers through complexity, avoiding sentimentality; reflection alters present stance per BRR.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in mechanical-yet-organic noticing, like metal fingers on blooms; prose texture is purposeful and rhythmic, modulating with intensity in the fire scene. No dialogue, so ignored; patterned elision in reflections is taught early and pays off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in metaphors like "dying bee" and "loose screw" that advance atmosphere without muddle; no loops or artifacts obscure closure, and propulsion accelerates in the burn beat. Opening anchors voice, final line recharges motifs; minor figurative stack in dusk description is pattern-taught and purposeful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original synthesis of android nostalgia and controlled burn transforms sci-fi tropes through specific details like the etched box and shifting north, feeling inevitable with risk in open-ended departure heightening stakes; emotional specificity avoids generics, though premise echoes familiar letting-go arcs without full boldness.</comment>
