<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and intensifies compellingly from avoidance to embrace of songs, with embodied emotions like trembling fingers and burning throat revealing contradictory impulses in scene; the final renunciation of safe stories earns its cost through prior internal conflict, though her tinkerer traits lean slightly archetypal without deeper flaws complicating choices mid-story.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned imagery and cadence shifts from dawn light to song's climax, with orientation anchored early in the arbor; closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration via the arbor's revival and Mira's role shift, with felt cost in her emotional weight and throat burn, charging the final image without contradiction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The verdant arbor at dawn is vividly specific, with sensory details like rustling leaves and ripe earth filtering through Mira's bias to constrain her choices and charge the final image of vines swaying; environment evolves causally, mirroring her internal shift without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reviving the arbor signals early and deepens through one meaningful cadence shift when Mira sings, narrowing options with the cost of confronting avoidance felt in her burning throat; under Accumulative/Textural lens, pressure coheres but lacks a secondary accent for fuller escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of reclaiming forgotten truths emerges organically from song versus stories, with subtext in images like vine tendrils and resonant final image offering a non-literal answer by reweighting silence's cost; avoids moralizing, embracing complexity through Mira's flawed delay.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in Mira's tinkerer lens, like noticing brass gears amid vines; prose texture modulates rhythmically with pressure, and brief dialogue feels natural, though minimal, advancing her resolve without register mismatch.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density in vivid images like "liquid gold" and varying rhythm, advancing atmosphere without loops; some figurative stacking in peak beats like song's climb slightly muddles propulsion, but clarity holds at closure with strong verbs and no artifacts obscuring cause.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tinkerer folklore with song revival transforms tropes through specific details like copper-winged automaton, heightening stakes organically; risk in lyric texture pays off without gimmickry, though premise echoes familiar revival arcs without bolder subversion.</comment>
