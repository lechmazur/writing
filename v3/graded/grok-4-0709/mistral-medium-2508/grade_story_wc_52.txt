<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Strong interiority with embodied emotions, like hands aching while carving, reveals contradictory impulses of containment and release; motivation intensifies credibly to the earned stasis of keeping the lion, foreclosing market sales with felt cost of isolation; flaws complicate choices without hedging, as her practical haunting softens edges but sustains grief.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, pattern of carving beats builds density to a resonant reconfiguration in the final image, with conceptual cost of acceptance legible; orientation anchors early in the loft and routine; closure via Charged Poise reweights grief as ongoing, though one more explicit tightening could elevate; dream sequence deepens without breaking causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, purposeful sensory details in the loft, like damp cedar musk and rain-beaded light fracturing, constrain choices and charge the final image of glowing embers; setting evolves causally with dawn and rain tapering, mirroring internal peace; micro-setting of the skylight pressures memory and carving, fulfilling 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of processing loss tightens through the girl's question and dream, deepening to stance crystallization in keeping the carving; under textural lens, cadence shift reweights cost as emotional endurance; agency in renunciation forecloses with felt price of half-gone existence, though coincidence of the buyer complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of impermanence emerges organically from carving images and the "here and gone" line, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer via the kept lion and letting go; subtext in gestures like thumb-smoothing enriches without direct statement; final image reweights prior motifs with ambiguity, avoiding moralizing and fulfilling 9+ test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Close third-person POV stable with distinct perceptual signature in sensory biases like sawdust musk clinging; prose texture rhythmic and voice-motivated, with purposeful compression in reflective beats; brief dialogue natural and subtextual, advancing theme via the girl's question; no head-hopping, elision taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density and propulsion in concise, multi-job sentences like the match striking "like a lion’s yawn"; rhythmic variety with no loops or scaffold, though occasional figurative density in peak beats borders on muddle without harm; zero artifacts in closure, strong verbs and specifics propel; read-aloud flows naturally.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of grief through lion carving transforms circus trope into non-obvious emotional truth; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable; originality in particulars like rain-painted stripes charges closure; avoids templates, committing to premise fully.</comment>
