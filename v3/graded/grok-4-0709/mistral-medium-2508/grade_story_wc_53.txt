<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to confront and escape her past selves is clear and intensifies through embodied emotions, like pressing the camera to her temple, revealing contradictory impulses in her refusal to go back yet surrendering to the lagoon. The ghost's presence as a secondary character applies pressure, forcing a stance crystallization with visible cost in the jump. Interiority is concrete, avoiding stock phrasing, though the chronological confusion feels slightly label-like without deeper embodiment in a pivotal choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned images and cadence shifts, like ripples spelling "coward," leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration in the jump where the lagoon remembers, with felt cost of surrender. Orientation anchors early with the carousel and lagoon by ~50 words. Closure lands on-page with conceptual repricing of past as inescapable, though one more explicit before/after cost could tighten it further.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The kinetic lagoon and carousel are vivid, sensory anchors that constrain choices, like reading ripples for memories, and charge the final image of jumping into hands from the past. Details evolve causally, mirroring Lira's internal erosion, with the environment pressuring her endurance. Micro-setting of the camera wheel functions as a tool that recurs and reweights meaning at closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of negotiating with past regrets tightens through the ghost's confrontation and churning shapes, forcing a deepening via the jump that forecloses escape with felt cost. Under Accumulative/Textural lens, pattern break in the blank frame and lagoon's churn reweights options. One meaningful intensification suffices, but the cost feels more conceptual than visceral in the climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of eroded ambitions and fractured time emerges through images like chipped paint and blurred ghosts, culminating in a resonant final image that reprices the premise of self-fragmentation without moralizing. Subtext in silences and ripples invites reflection on regret's weight. Emotional aftereffect lingers via the weightless moment, embracing complexity without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in Lira's biased noticing of fragments and ripples, modulating rhythm under pressure like the gear-grinding laughter. Dialogue carries subtext and advances the confrontation naturally, with the ghost's idiom differing slightly in bravado. Patterned elision in memory frames is taught early and pays off at closure without confusion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in wind-whipped sentences and purposeful fragments like "Not to fall, but to see," advancing atmosphere without loops. Figurative language is controlled, though one mixed metaphor ("coiled in her ribs, heavy as the camera wheel") slightly muddles in a non-peak beat. No artifacts obscure closure; final lines propel with clear propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Surreal synthesis of carousel ghosts and memory lagoon offers fresh inflection on regret, transforming trope of haunted past through specific tactics like advancing the film to shield against selves. Risk in lyric ambiguity heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable at the jump. Core premise commits fully, avoiding derivative echoes.</comment>
