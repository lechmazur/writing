<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lena's motivation to navigate loss is clear and intensifies through her building of maps, rooted in consistent traits like her patchwork navigator identity; interiority is concrete and embodied, with contradictory impulses in her persistence despite the ache in her ribs. The final endurance feels earned by prior causality, foreclosing full recovery with the visible cost of ongoing isolation lightened slightly. Strengths shine in micro-choices under pressure, such as dialing back and instructing the caller to "start walking," revealing her hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure accumulates pressure through patterned calls and maps, with coherent orientation anchored early in the signal station setting. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) in the final image of solace and continued building, with felt cost in the lightened but persistent weight in her chest. One meaningful cadence shift deepens at the midnight call, reweighting her stake without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The signal station is vividly anchored with sensory details like rusted antennae and salt wind, constraining choices as Lena builds within its creaking confines; the censer foot as a recurring object charges the final image by warming and listening, mirroring her solace. Atmosphere supports the raw tone through purposeful, POV-filtered specificity, with the environment evolving causally in the wind's howl.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of navigating loss signals early and tightens once through the call's riddles, deepening via agency in her translation and response, under Accumulative/Textural lens; cost is legible in the emotional trade-off of lighter chest amid enduring isolation. Escalation reads as pattern break in the woman's hitching breath and Lena's directive, forcing stance crystallization without coincidence resolving it.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of reverse migration and finding solace in loss emerges organically from images like maps leading inland and the listening censer foot, with subtext in silences and implications during calls. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer by reweighting her geography of loss as anchors, embracing complexity without tidy morals. Emotional aftereffect arises from particulars, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in Lena's biased noticing of pulses and transmissions; voice texture shines in rhythmic, purposeful syntax like "the moon was a sliver, and the censer foot felt cold." Dialogue carries subtext and advances plot naturally, as in the riddled latitudes and her "The way back" response. No head-hopping or unwarranted certainty, with elision taught through patterned calls.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm naturally in sentences like the opening's vivid imagery; no loops or scaffold, though minor figurative density in patina descriptions avoids muddle. Propulsion advances through integrated action and image, with clean grammar and strong verbs; final line resolves by recharging motifs without artifacts touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Originality lies in the fresh synthesis of cryptic midnight calls as reverse navigation for the drowned, transforming lost-at-sea tropes through Lena's specific building and the censer foot's evolving role. Risk-taking in the accumulative structure heightens stakes organically, feeling inevitable in hindsight without gimmickry. Core premise offers a non-obvious angle on grief, committed fully without retreat.</comment>
