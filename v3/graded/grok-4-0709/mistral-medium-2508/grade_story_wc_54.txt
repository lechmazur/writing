<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lena's motivation as a problem-dismantling engineer is clear and intensifies through her discoveries, with embodied interiority shown in her itching creativity and calculations; internal conflict emerges in her quiet satisfaction amid imperfect solutions, earning the final renunciation of full restoration with felt cost. Strengths include concrete micro-choices, like slotting the sextant, revealing values under pressure. Minor slip in over-articulated traits via labels like "functional creativity," but it doesn't undermine closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under a Causal lens, the structure links actions tightly—finding the sextant leads to alignment and resurrection—with orientation anchored by dawn in the terminal; closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing via the equation and weather vane, reweighting hope with conceptual cost of no spaceport return. One meaningful tightening suffices, and cost is legible in the imperfect repurposing. Lens holds without ambiguity, but ellipsis in carnival's role slightly softens early causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport is vividly specific, with corroded steel and algae-thick water constraining Lena's choices and charging the final image of the weather vane; sensory details like fogged breath and humming brass are purposeful, filtered through her engineering bias. Environment evolves causally, mirroring her redirection theme. Recurring objects like the sextant charge closure, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of repurposing the terminal escalates causally when slotting the sextant triggers flows, narrowing options to an imperfect bridge with legible cost of lost escape promise; one tightening deepens knowledge effectively under the lens. Agency drives the stance crystallization, but coincidence of finding the piece complicates without fully resolving. Cost is unmistakable in the "way through" trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of hope as redirection emerges organically from events like water flushing and the equation, with subtext in graffiti and humming intent; final image offers a resonant, non-literal repricing without moralizing. Emotional aftereffect lingers through complexity, avoiding sentimentality. Earned from particulars, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in engineering-filtered details like rusted gears; voice texture is distinct in rhythmic, metaphor-rich prose that modulates under pressure. Minimal dialogue is natural and subtextual, like her correction to the foreman. No head-hopping, but slight register drift in abstract phrases like "maze of intentions" under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied rhythm and high information in lines like the terminal shuddering to life; zero obvious loops or artifacts, strong verbs, and purposeful metaphors avoid muddle in peaks. Opening anchors voice, final line recharges motifs cleanly. Minor scaffold in one paraphrase loop about hope, but it doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of engineering puzzle-solving with carnival abandonment transforms tropes through specific details like the sextant and equation; risk in lyric metaphors heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry. Core premise feels inevitable, with non-obvious angle on hope. Minor hedging in symmetric carnival-terminal parallel avoids bolder ambiguity.</comment>
