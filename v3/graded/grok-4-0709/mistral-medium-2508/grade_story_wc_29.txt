<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Liora's motivation as a cautiously hopeful interpreter is clear and intensifies compellingly, rooted in traits that drive her transmission choice with embodied contradiction in her pounding heart; interiority is concrete without stock phrasing, and her flaws complicate the resolution credibly; the grad student's brief role applies secondary pressure effectively.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under a Causal lens, because/therefore linkages build from signal discovery to transmission and response, with orientation anchored early in the basement station; closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration where the signal shifts to curious, reweighting stakes with felt cost in the "scars" line, though one ellipsis in campus effects feels slightly undermotivated.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The university radio station setting is vivid and purposeful, constraining Liora's illicit access and charging the final image with humming equipment; sensory details like static and dim bulb reflect POV bias under pressure, and the environment evolves causally with the building's shiver.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of outwitting the signal to mend divisions tightens meaningfully through transmission, narrowing options with the skull-pressure response as a deepening under the Causal lens; agency drives the stance crystallization with legible cost in the community's paused arguments, though coincidence in timing complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of human resilience against cosmic interference emerges organically from events like the signal's dare and Liora's counter-melody, with subtext in inked stars shifting; the final image offers resonant repricing of divisions as scars without moralizing, inviting reflection on agency amid power plays.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in Liora's dial adjustments and static perception; voice texture shines in rhythmic metaphors like "nest of angry stars," holding under pressure; brief dialogue feels natural and subtextual, advancing the grad student's hesitant intrusion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm naturally in beats like the transmission shiver; metaphors are controlled and purposeful without muddle, propelling momentum; no loops or artifacts obscure closure, with the final "universe was still talking" line recharging earlier motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of alien signals influencing university politics feels fresh and inevitable, transforming sci-fi tropes through Liora's grounded astronomy lens; risk in the ethereal-grit tone heightens stakes organically, with the signal's "laughter" as a non-obvious intensification.</comment>
