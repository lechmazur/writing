<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to uncover deleted files is clear and intensifies through her choices, like fabricating logs, rooted in her role as memory keeper; interiority shows embodied curiosity and hesitation, with contradictory impulses in her final renunciation of exposure, earning a stasis with felt cost of secrecy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under a causal lens, the structure builds through motivated investigation beats, anchoring orientation early in the archive; closure lands as an earned stasis via Elara's secret archiving, with conceptual cost of lingering absence lifted but corporate risk felt in "the corporation's gaze was ever watchful."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The social network archive setting is vividly anchored with sensory details like humming server halls and holographic interfaces, constraining choices through access protocols; it charges the final image by mirroring digital echoes with Elara's guardianship, evolving consistently without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of uncovering the truth tightens causally through the anomaly discovery and bypass, narrowing options with the risk of lying; agency in her renunciation forecloses exposure with visible cost, though escalation feels somewhat internal without stronger external pressure complicating resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of preserved echoes amid absence emerges organically from Elara's discoveries and final archiving, inviting reflection on digital permanence without moralizing; the closing image reweights the premise non-literally, embracing complexity in corporate cover-ups, though subtext could deepen via more ambiguous irony.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable with perceptual signature in Elara's attentive scans and murmurs; prose texture distinct in rhythmic, lyric phrasing like "echoes in the void," modulating with intensity; no dialogue, but voice coherence holds under pressure without head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in sentences like "her fingers dancing over holographic interfaces"; minor overwriting in stacked metaphors (e.g., "digital mausoleum... ghosts in the machine") slightly muddles in peak beats, but no loops or artifacts obscure closure propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sci-fi mystery in a digital archive transforms missing persons trope through embedded clues in social data; risk in Elara's secretive stance heightens stakes organically, feeling inevitable with non-obvious corporate sabotage angle, avoiding derivative templates.</comment>
