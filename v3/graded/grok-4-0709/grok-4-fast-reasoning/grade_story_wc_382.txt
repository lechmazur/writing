<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to decipher old buildings is clear and intensifies through her interactions, rooted in consistent curiosity that compels her to probe deeper; Thorne's traits feel secondary but apply pressure effectively. Interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions like intrigue laced in her voice, though internal contradictions are more suggested than simultaneous in scene. The meaningful endurance at closure, accepting the building's truths, is earned with a felt cost of unveiled deceptions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Structure builds accumulatively through tea sessions to rooftop revelation, with coherent textural lens holding to a conceptual repricing closure where Elara hears the building's voice anew, carrying undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation anchors who, where, and when early, with legible transitions between shards fitting Track B mosaic allowance. One meaningful deepening suffices, tightening curiosity into confession without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The Victorian tenement and rooftop garden are vividly specific, with sensory details like rain pattering and ozone tang filtering through Elara's intrigue-biased POV, subtly guiding choices. Environment constrains and charges the final image, as meteors illuminate confession and the sigil mirrors the building's pulse. Tone tensions mystery with familiarity, supporting theme without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of uncovering the building's secrets signals early and deepens texturally through sessions, culminating in stance crystallization on the rooftop with felt cost of mutual pretense. One meaningful tightening via interrogation narrows options, forcing confession; agency in endurance forecloses ignorance with conceptual price. Pressure coheres but lacks a sharper visible trade-off, keeping it strong yet not exceptional.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of unveiling layered truths in old structures emerges implicitly from events and images like the seal and groans, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in "agreed upon lies." Subtext in gestures and silences, like Thorne's pause, invites reflection on curiosity's homecoming. Final image offers resonant, non-literal repricing of the building's language as endurance lullaby, reweighting prior material without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person close POV on Elara is stable, with perceptual signature biased toward architectural whispers; distance shifts intentionally with emotional intensity, like insistent voice at interrogation. Prose texture distinct in rhythmic, evocative syntax, modulating with pressure; dialogue natural and subtextual, distinguishing characters via Thorne's low voice and eerie tone. No head-hopping or elision issues, with voice control heightening mystery.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, sentences advancing atmosphere and character via vivid images like steam mingling with books; rhythm varies naturally, avoiding loops or templates. Figurative language integrates purposefully without muddle, as in twilight bleeding into night. Minor scaffold in repetitive "familiarity" phrasing deducts slightly, but propulsion remains strong, especially in closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes architectural mystery with linguistic tutoring in a fresh, non-obvious way, transforming tropes through specific details like the sigil-seal and meteor-lit confession. Emotional complexity in veiled truths feels authentic and memorable; risk in quiet, textural build heightens stakes organically. Core elements cohere as singular vision without hedging.</comment>
