<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to harvest lessons from loss is clear and intensifies through concrete interior choices, culminating in the decision to carve; interiority is character-particular with embodied emotions in handling the ash wood and recalling the cracked chain snap; internal conflict shows contradictory impulses in revisiting painful crystals without drowning, earning the final endurance with felt cost of grief.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under accumulative/textural lens, crystal memories build density and break pattern with the boiling-over kettle, leading to resonant reconfiguration in the final carving image; closure reweights loss as eternally present with conceptual cost of contained chaos; orientation anchors early in the loft during autumn dusk, with reflective shards cohering under Track B without harming legibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The rain-beaded skylight loft is vividly specific, with sensory details like rust-hued light and pattering rain mirroring Elara's grief; micro-setting of the kettle and wood constrains her reflective process and charges the final carving moment; details evolve causally, such as steam curling like ghosts, integrating into emotional beats without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of containing grief to harvest lessons tightens through accumulating crystals, with deepening pressure as the whistle insists and boils over; agency in mental method forecloses drowning in chaos with felt cost in painful recollections; under accumulative lens, cadence shift reweights options without needing multiple reversals.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of harvesting wisdom from loss emerges organically from crystal images and ash wood resilience, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in love's peril; final carving image offers resonant, non-literal repricing of "here and gone" without statement; subtext in gestures like tracing wood edges deepens complexity through particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Close third-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in sensory biases toward rain prisms and wood grain; prose texture modulates rhythmically with emotional intensity, like building whistle mirroring memory accrual; no dialogue, but internal voice coheres without elision issues or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied syntax and rhythm, advancing atmosphere through images like steam ghosts without loops or artifacts; figurative language is controlled and purposeful, enhancing beats like the cracked crystal without muddle; final line resolves by recharging motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of circus widow's grief through "crystallized time" method transforms familiar loss tropes with specific details like lion chain snap; core premise commits to implications without hedging, heightening stakes via haunting practicality; non-obvious reconfiguration feels inevitable in the carving start.</comment>
