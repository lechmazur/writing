<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to outwit cosmic tricksters is clear and rooted in her traits, intensifying to compel her interference action with a felt cost of isolation; interiority is concrete, showing embodied caution and hope through her adjustments and calm mask. Harlan applies secondary pressure relevant to the conflict, with legible status dynamics in their confrontation. Weakness lies in aides being underdeveloped, but they don't harm clarity; the final endurance forecloses Harlan's power play with visible unease on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Structure follows a causal lens with because/therefore linkages, from Harlan's intrusion to Elara's counter-frequencies causing the signal warp and community shift; closure is a resonant reconfiguration via charged poise, with felt cost in the wary clarity and Harlan's crumbling ambition. Orientation anchors who, where, and when early in the radio station scene. Single continuous scene fits defaults, with one meaningful tightening at the interference initiation; no orientation penalty applied as anchors are clear by 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The university radio station setting is vivid and purposeful, with dim glow, humming antennas, and console integrating into action to constrain Elara's choices; sensory details like static symphony and otherworldly hum reflect POV urgency and mirror internal grit. Astronomical charts as recurring object charge the final image by shifting paths on screen. Tone supports ethereal grit through gritty solitude and cosmic whispers; spatial choreography tracks cleanly during Harlan's entrance and Elara's adjustments.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of outwitting tricksters signals early and tightens once through Elara's interference, narrowing options with subsonic disruption forcing Harlan's unease and signal warp; under causal lens, this deepening drives agency via her decision, with visible cost in community's realigned fractures. Pressure coheres from divide to climax, interweaving internal hope with external power plays. Weakness in stakes occasionally abstract rather than visceral, but closure earns reconfiguration without coincidence resolving it.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of human greed twisting celestial wonders emerges organically from events like Harlan's ambition and Elara's interference, with subtext in deceptive signals and subsonic doubt; final image offers resonant non-literal answer by cracking the illusory veil, reweighting deceit with wary clarity. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality through gritty victory. Ambiguity lingers meaningfully in the honest silence without confusion; no overt moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable and apt, with perceptual signature selective to Elara's astronomical bias, like tracing charts and narrowing eyes at oscilloscope; prose texture distinct in rhythmic syntax blending ethereal and gritty diction. Dialogue is natural, subtextual, and advances plot, as in Elara's soft persistence contrasting Harlan's bark, distinguishing idioms. No head-hopping; psychic distance shifts intentionally during confrontation. Elision of outside events is purposeful and paid off in the hum's effect.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere through vivid images like starlight on fogged glass and vibrating console; rhythm varies naturally, accelerating in the climax with short sentences. Weakness in occasional paraphrase loops, such as repeated divide descriptions, dulling momentum slightly in mid-section, but no artifacts touch closure. Strong verbs and specific nouns dominate, with metaphors coherent and purposeful; no major overwriting or scaffold issues harm clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Originality in synthesizing cosmic tricksters with university politics via subsonic interference offers fresh angle on deception themes, transforming trope of alien signals through Elara's gritty resolve and charged final silence. Emotional specificity in cautious hope avoids generics. Risk in ethereal grit tone heightens stakes organically; no close echoes of famous scenes.</comment>
