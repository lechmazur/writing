<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to uncover truth is clear and intensifies through retrocognitive visions, compelling her descent and parley with embodied tension in choices like diving into the lagoon. Interiority is concrete, showing contradictory impulses in her unraveling sanity versus unyielding drive, though some emotions lean toward summary labels like "searing reverie" without deeper contradiction in peak moments. The final renunciation of the trap feels earned by prior causality, with visible cost to her sanity and physical state.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Under a Causal lens, the structure links events through motivated ellipsis, from letters to reverie to descent and resolution, with one meaningful tightening in the lagoon dive leading to closure via diary revelation and trap release as a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost to sanity. Orientation anchors who (Elara), where (zeppelin to dunes), and when (after letters found) by ~100 words, waiving any penalty. Mosaic shards (library, dream, descent, lagoon) fit Track B with legible transitions and coherent lens holding to closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon and zeppelin library are vividly specific, with sensory details like glassy black water and humming airship integrated into action, constraining choices like diving and parleying to charge the final image of revelation. Atmosphere builds searing tension through environmental mirrors of internal states, such as shifting sands and inky depths, without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from airship to beach, evolving causally with events.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of uncovering truth amid retrocognitive trap signals early and tightens once through the dive and parley, narrowing options with coherent pressure forcing stance crystallization under Causal lens, though coincidence in spectral guardian complicates without fully resolving. Agency in Elara's decisions, like commandeering the pod and arranging debris, drives escalation with visible costs to sanity and body. One meaningful deepening suffices, but stakes occasionally feel abstract rather than viscerally layered with ethical calculus.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of reclaiming silenced histories emerges organically from diary discovery and parley, with subtext in images like sinking truths and spectral negotiations inviting reflection on truth's cost without tidy morals. Final image of revelation and renewed purpose offers resonant, non-literal repricing of civil rights archives, reweighting prior tensions. Emotional aftereffect lingers through complexity, avoiding sentimentality, though some direct statements like "mending the fractured archive" border on thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and character-specific, with perceptual bias in Elara's archival focus filtering details like flickering holoscreens; psychic distance shifts intentionally during reverie for emotional intensity. Prose texture is distinct with rhythmic, lyric compression in phrases like "searing reverie," teaching patterned elision early and paying off at closure without head-hopping. No dialogue present, so policy skips evaluation; non-standard punctuation in dream shards serves voice-motivated effect legibly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere through vivid images like "glassy, black-water expanse," but occasional overwriting in peak beats with stacked metaphors (e.g., "tension coiled like a spring" amid "searing reverie") muddles without pattern payoff, triggering -0.4. Rhythm varies naturally, avoiding loops, though some paraphrase redundancy in reverie descriptions dulls momentum slightly. Final line resolves with resonant image, propelling to closure without artifacts touching it.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of retrocognition, civil rights archival, and sci-fi zeppelin setting feels fresh, transforming tropes like hidden truths through specific details like alchemical ciphers and debris messages, heightening stakes organically. Core premise offers non-obvious angle on suppressed histories, with bold risk in mosaic structure that coheres without gimmickry. Emotional specificity in Elara's tension avoids generics, making the parley turn inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
