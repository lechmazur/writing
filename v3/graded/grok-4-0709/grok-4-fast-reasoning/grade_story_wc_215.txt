<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The astonished recluse's motivation to preserve unspoken words is clear and intensifies through perceptual micro-choices, with embodied astonishment in his frozen dawn encounter. Interiority is concrete, showing contradictory impulses like urgency amid tranquility when handling the box. However, the character's traits lean toward stock reclusive wisdom without bold flaws complicating choices, limiting depth in the final renunciation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through perceptual shards in one contiguous oasis scene, with orientation anchored early in the wasteland and ghosts' appearance. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration via the box-gazing and finger-tracing, reweighting the covenant with felt conceptual cost in the oasis's faint hum. One meaningful deepening occurs as ghosts gather, tightening spectral pressure without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The scorched wasteland and abandoned hives anchor a vivid, purposeful atmosphere, with sensory details like cracked earth and bleached frames mirroring Elias's isolation. Setting constrains choices, as the half-buried tower yields the box that charges the final image. Subtle evolution from dawn orange to shaded alcove supports thematic decline without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of untangling the covenant without breaking silence signals early and deepens once through the box discovery, narrowing options with ghostly insistence. Pressure coheres texturally, forcing stance crystallization in the tracing action, but cost feels more conceptual than visceral, with no sharp trade-off foreclosing a path. Coincidence in unearthing the relic complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of frayed covenants emerges organically from ghosts' patterns and the box's runes, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer via the settling unspoken words. Subtext in silent reaches and faint hum invites ambiguity without confusion, avoiding moralizing. Emotional aftereffect lingers through preservation blooming in silence, tied to Elias's arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stable third-person close POV filters perceptions through Elias's tranquilly perceptive lens, with distinct texture in rhythmic, muted prose like "silence spoke volumes." No dialogue, so policy skips those bullets; perceptual signature biases toward subtle shifts, consistent under stress. Minor register drift in elevated diction like "mute eloquence" slightly jars but serves the lyric mode.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose density advances atmosphere with vivid images like "sky bled orange," but occasional paraphrase loops (e.g., repeated covenant tangling) dull momentum in reflective blocks. Rhythm varies purposefully in short, perceptual sentences, though figurative stacking in ghost descriptions borders on overwriting without muddling closure. No major artifacts touch the final hum-rising image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghostly beekeepers and a stained glass covenant in a wasteland oasis transforms familiar spectral tropes through perceptual ingenuity. Risk in mute, introspective structure heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in the silent preservation. Avoids stock echoes by grounding in specific unspoken weights.</comment>
