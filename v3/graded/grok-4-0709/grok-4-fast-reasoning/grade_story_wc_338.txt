<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in grief, driving methodical curiosity that intensifies to compel his journey and chapel reopening with felt emotional cost. Interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions like quickening heart and imagined frustration revealing contradictory impulses under pressure. The single-POV focus excels in showing internal conflict through micro-choices, though some phrasing borders on stock summary in reflective blocks.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under a Causal lens, the structure builds through because/therefore linkages from map examination to footage comparison to on-site action, culminating in a Decisive Change as Elias opens the chapel door with resonant cost tied to honoring his father's silence. Orientation anchors who, where, and when early in the workshop scene, with legible transitions across shards maintaining coherence. Multiple shards fit Track B mosaic allowance, taught early with pattern of silent interpretation paying off at closure; one meaningful tightening suffices for length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The rain-scoured fresco vault anchors atmosphere vividly, with sensory details like dim light and pattering rain filtered through Elias's perceptive bias, subtly mirroring his empathetic quest. Setting evolves consistently, constraining choices at the henge where thorns and latch pressure the reopening action. Micro-details like the map's tear and footage beam charge the final image, though some descriptions repeat without fresh evolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of bridging known and unknown to interpret silence escalates causally through footage comparison narrowing options, forcing the night drive and door-opening with visible emotional cost. One meaningful deepening via pattern emergence suffices, though coincidence in latch revelation slightly complicates without fully resolving. Agency shines in Elias's renunciation of isolation, crystallizing stance with ethical weight between grief and discovery.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of empathetic interpretation of silence emerges organically from events like footage comparison and chapel entry, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in the "rush of cool, silent air" reweighting loss. Subtext in silences and whispers invites reflection on unspoken grief without confusion. Final image offers resonant, non-literal answer to the core question of honoring the voiceless past.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and apt, with perceptual signature biased toward subtle details like folds and faded inks reflecting Elias's methodical curiosity. Prose texture in rhythmic syntax modulates with intensity, as in the quickening heart under lamplight. No dialogue present, so policy skips evaluation; purposeful compression in shards is taught early and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, sentences advancing atmosphere and character through vivid images like "beam cutting through the misty air," though occasional paraphrase loops in reflective blocks slightly dull momentum. Rhythm varies naturally, with strong verbs and specific nouns propelling beats; no major artifacts obscure closure. Figurative language integrates purposefully without muddle in peak moments like the door creaking open.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes map-framing with silent footage and whispered chapel for a fresh angle on grief-driven discovery, transforming lore tropes through Elias's empathetic lens. Risk in mosaic shards heightens stakes organically, feeling inevitable in hindsight via the map's tear as beacon. Emotional specificity avoids generics, committing to premise without retreat.</comment>
