<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to puzzle out equations for hope is clear and rooted in her functional creativity, intensifying through her methodical actions like aligning the sextant to redirect flows. Interiority is concrete, with embodied wonder in tracing the fractured edge, revealing contradictory impulses of calm acceptance and resolve under pressure. The solo POV limits relationship crucibles, but her micro-choices, such as pressing on after a wrong turn, earn the endurance with felt cost in quiet satisfaction. No stock phrasing mars key moments, though emotional progression could layer more irrationality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density increasing through layered discoveries, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing where the terminal's revival reweights decay into possibility with conceptual cost of deferred desires. Orientation anchors early in the abandoned spaceport after carnival, with no disorientation debt. Structure fits defaults as one continuous scene with causal ellipsis motivating her hunch to the atrium, but causality feels loose in the humming generators awakening without tighter linkage to her equations. Closure lands on-page with the glowing murals, though cost remains oblique beyond tentative optimism.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport setting is vividly anchored with garish lights and faded murals, selectively filtered through Elara's engineering bias to notice vents and conduits. Sensory details like dust motes and creaking doors build atmosphere, subtly guiding choices in the labyrinthine corridors where a collapsed lounge tests resolve. Environment constrains action, as tangled wires and rusted panels affect her redirection efforts, charging the final glow with ethereal hues. No white-room issues, but occupational details like airflow modeling feel integrated without excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of resurrecting the terminal signals early via her intrigue with the sextant, tightening once through the wrong turn and rerouting that narrows options from entropy to renewal under Accumulative lens. Pressure coheres internally, with agency in her calculations forcing stance crystallization, but escalation remains subdued without a sharper reversal or visible cost beyond vibrations rippling. Coincidence in finding the relic complicates without resolving, yet stakes feel abstract rather than visceral. Moral calculus between decay and hope sharpens the peak, but lacks interweaving with external conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of transforming despair into hope emerges organically from images like peeled murals and redirected flows, with subtext in the sextant's stars aligning with reborn trajectory. Final image offers resonant, non-literal reconfiguration without moralizing, inviting reflection on human ambition's ruins. Emotional aftereffect builds through stoic wonder, avoiding sentimentality, though complexity could embrace more counter-readings. No thematic echo or overt statements mar the quiet ending.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and apt, with perceptual signature in Elara's selective notice of structural flows and celestial arcs, modulating rhythm under pressure like hesitant pulses. Prose texture distinct in lyrical syntax, teaching patterned elision early for legibility at closure. No dialogue present, so policy skips those bullets; free indirect style clean without filter stacks. Psychic distance shifts intentionally in the atrium glow, enhancing emotional beats without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Prose advances atmosphere with vivid images like dust motes and confetti farewells, but overwriting in stacked metaphors (e.g., dormant lungs, unspoken desires) muddles peak beats without payoff, triggering -0.6 density penalty. Syntactic variety supports rhythm, yet paraphrase loops in describing the maze and flows dull momentum, adding -0.4 artifact deduction. Information density high in equations sketch, but template cadence in action sequences (she wandered, she knelt, she followed) creates monotony. Final line recharges motifs cleanly, though no major clarity issues touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of civil engineering with sci-fi relic in an abandoned spaceport transforms decay tropes through Elara's functional creativity, feeling inevitable in her redirection climax. Emotional specificity in stoic wonder avoids generics, with bold lyric risk heightening thematic stakes without gimmickry, earning +0.3 bonus. Core premise offers non-obvious angle on hope amid ruins, but echoes familiar explorer motifs without full subversion. No derivative premise guardrail applies, as details personalize the arc.</comment>
