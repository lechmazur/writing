<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strong motivation to uncover collective grief rooted in mother's death drives meditative choices, but interiority leans on abstract similes like "mind fiercely meditative" rather than embodied contradictions; the ribbon-unrolling moment reveals values with some cost, though flaws feel understated without complicating the final etching.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds through migration-patterned shards with legible transitions; closure reprices grief as resilient braid via the completed gravestone, with felt cost in family bindings; orientation anchors early in the greenhouse, though spectral appearance has slight ellipsis without breaking causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details like damp earth and fogged panes anchor atmosphere purposefully; the greenhouse and migrating butterflies constrain retracing choices and charge the final monument image, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of discovering grief's shape tightens accumulatively through mentorship sessions, with one meaningful deepening at the full ribbon unrolling; agency in retracing forecloses avoidance with emotional cost felt in the wave metaphor, though pressure remains somewhat introspective.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of grief as unbreakable weave emerges from ribbon patterns and butterfly migration without moralizing; final image of the monument offers resonant repricing of sorrow, enriched by subtext in Liora's counsel and poem exchanges.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV filters perceptions meditatively with distinct rhythmic texture in similes; Liora's dialogue carries subtext naturally, advancing guidance; some density in reflective beats tests clarity, but elision is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Overstacked similes like "wings a silent thunder" and repetitive "thundering calm" create figurative muddle in peak beats, dulling propulsion; information density is high, but synonym loops in descriptions of migration reduce momentum without harming closure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of spectral mentorship and ribbon relic transforms grief tropes through specific family rituals; mosaic structure risks heighten thematic resonance, feeling inevitable in the monument's weave without derivative echoes.</comment>
