<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong interior contradiction shown through contradictory impulses like defending subversion yet feeling doubt creep in like a meteor trail, leading to an earned reversal with visible cost of frayed ethical threads; motivation intensifies compellingly via the story stick's pulse; however, some stock phrasing like "moral haze" slightly flattens embodied emotion without fully degrading under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, density builds through reflective shards to a resonant reconfiguration at the viewport, with felt cost in cooled argument embers and foreclosed subversive path; orientation anchors early in the dome's heavy air; one meaningful deepening suffices, though heavy reflection risks flattening if not anchored, but BRR exception holds via concrete cues like the story stick.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Vivid, selective details like the curved walls amplifying serene breathing and rusted skeleton mirror isolation and epiphany; dome constrains pacing and charges final image at the cracked viewport; sensory hierarchy reflects POV bias effectively, though some metaphors border on overt symbolism without harm.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of ethical storytelling tightens via cadence shift from argument's pulse to doubt's creep, forcing stance crystallization with felt cost in fractured illusions; one deepening narrows options adequately under lens, but pressure feels somewhat static in reflective mode without sharper external complication.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of storytelling's ethic emerges organically from particulars like puppet reversals and blooming epiphanies, culminating in a resonant final image of vows at the viewport that reweights prior subversion without moralizing; subtext in silence and implication enriches ambiguity, though insights border on pseudo-profundity in places.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-person close POV with distinct perceptual signature in calligrapher's precise observations, like tracing etched lines; prose texture modulates rhythmically with pressure, as in pulsing carvings; no dialogue, so policy skips; patterned diction teaches lyric mode early and pays off at closure without elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with sentences advancing atmosphere and interiority, like the dome pressing down in argument; rhythm varies naturally, but some figurative stacking in peak beats like "meteor hush" and "half-lit epiphanies" risks muddle without obscuring closure; no loops or artifacts touch the final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of calligrapher's crisis with elements like the story stick and dome pivot transforms trope of artistic reversal; risk in lyric reflection heightens stakes organically, feeling inevitable in hindsight; however, premise echoes familiar redemption arcs without bolder subversion.</comment>
