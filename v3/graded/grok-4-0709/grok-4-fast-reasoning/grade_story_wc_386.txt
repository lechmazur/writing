<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to salvage purity is clear and intensifies through her careful weaving of truths, leading to an earned renunciation of isolation with visible conceptual cost in the ghosts' release. Interiority is concrete via scarred hands and attuned senses, showing embodied emotion under ethereal pressure. Weakness in slightly stock contradictory impulses, as internal conflict feels summarized rather than simultaneous in key moments like attuning to the windows.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds density through dream cameos and revelations, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where the globe reforms with undeniable conceptual cost of reclaimed purity. Orientation anchors early in the glacier shrine by 50 words. One meaningful deepening via the midshipman apparition tightens the pattern effectively, though ellipsis between cameos could be more motivated for causal clarity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The glacier shrine's blue ice veins and aurora-refracting panes vividly anchor atmosphere, constraining Elara's choices by channeling dreams and charging the final image of the reforming snow globe. Sensory details like ethereal chill and sputtering candles are purposeful, mirroring internal tenderness amid folly. Micro-setting of the ice windows evolves causally, enhancing thematic contrast without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of exposing purity tightens once through analyzing cameos, forcing a stance crystallization that reweights hidden affections with felt emotional cost in the ghosts' chorus. Pressure coheres accumulatively but lacks a sharper on-page reversal, making the surge of starlight feel slightly coincidental rather than fully protagonist-driven. Moral calculus between duty and bonds sharpens the climax effectively.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of unspoken bonds amid hubris emerges organically from cameo patterns and the globe's reformation, offering resonant ambiguity without tidy morals. Subtext in softened despair and tenderness invites reflection on suppressed affections. Final image reweights the premise non-literally, eliciting emotional aftereffect through reclaimed purity, though epiphanies border on asserted rather than fully earned via struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-person close POV maintains perceptual signature through Elara's selective noticing of ice facets and spectral threads, with rhythmic prose modulating via poetic syntax under chill pressure. No head-hopping or elision issues; purposeful compression in dream sequences is taught early and pays off at closure. Distinct texture in word choice like "borrowed starlight" and "spectral remnants" heightens voice without obscurity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose density advances atmosphere with vivid images like "veins of blue ice" and varied rhythm, avoiding loops despite metaphorical richness; information propels via integrated details without scaffold. Some overwriting in peak beats, such as stacked similes in the shrine description, slightly muddles clarity but doesn't obscure closure. Strong verbs and syntactic variety support momentum, with final line recharging motifs effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of wreck-diving with dream-analysis via ice windows transforms exploration tropes into a non-obvious angle on purity and hidden loves, feeling inevitable through Elara's method. Risk-taking in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, committing to ethereal implications. Emotional specificity in cameo tenderness avoids generics, creating memorable perspective on Franklin's expedition.</comment>
