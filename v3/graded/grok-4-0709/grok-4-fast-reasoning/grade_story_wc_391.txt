<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Motivation to sculpt patience is clear and roots in Elara's traits, intensifying to compel the group's crossing, but interiority relies on stock phrasing like "restrained wildness" without embodied contradictions in scene; Thorne's change feels summary rather than earned through simultaneous impulses, though the viaduct hesitation reveals a hierarchy of values with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with pattern of moon-tracking beats building to closure, anchored early in the sanctuary by the frozen lake; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration via Charged Poise on the viaduct with felt cost of transformed impatience, but ellipsis between weeks blurs some causality without a persistent constraint shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The basalt sanctuary and frozen lake anchor vividly early, with sensory details like fogged breath and humming walls reflecting POV bias and subtly guiding choices, such as the overlook for observation; the viaduct after rain constrains the crossing, charging the final image of the cracking lake.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of patient revolution signals early but tightens only once through the viaduct crossing under Accumulative lens, with agency in endurance foreclosing haste; cost is felt in Thorne's hesitation, but pressure remains abstract without a deepening that forces trade-offs beyond summary change.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme of sculpting patience emerges organically from moon-tracking events and the viaduct crossing, inviting reflection through ambiguity in the thawing lake; subtext in gestures like Elara's hand on Thorne's shoulder resists tidy morals, but the final image offers a resonant answer without fully reweighting prior material non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with perceptual signature in Elara's horizon-mapping bias, and prose texture uses purposeful syntax like soft currents; dialogue is natural and subtextual, advancing plot in Thorne's demand and Elara's reply, but minor register drift into elevated diction like "unyoke" feels slightly unmotivated under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose has rhythmic variety with vivid images like silver threads, advancing atmosphere without major loops, but some overwriting in mixed metaphors (e.g., boiling river to enduring ice) muddles peak beats; information density is high in the viaduct scene, with no artifacts obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cartography with革命 via moon paths transforms trope of rebellion through patient observation, feeling inevitable in the thawing lake; risk in abstract structure heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry, but premise echoes familiar allegories without fully bold specificity.</comment>
