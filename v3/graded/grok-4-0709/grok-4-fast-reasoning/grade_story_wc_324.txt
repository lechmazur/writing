<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to protect vulnerable voices is clear and intensifies through her persistent curiosity, compelling her to act at the climax by stopping Mira, with a credible endurance that forecloses redevelopment at the felt cost of Mira's plans. Interiority is concrete in her handling of artifacts, revealing contradictory impulses like urgency amid the hush, though emotions lean toward summary rather than raw embodiment in peak moments. The relationship with Mira, though brief, forces a choice that alters the atrium's state, applying immediate pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Under a Causal lens, the structure holds with because/therefore linkages from the tip to discovery to confrontation, anchoring who (Elara), where (atrium), and when (twilight) by ~100 words without orientation debt. Closure lands as a Decisive Change when Elara assures Mira, preserving the atrium with the visible cost of halting redevelopment and ensuring voices endure. One meaningful tightening occurs as pulses spike, narrowing options to urgent action; transitions are legible in the single scene with a brief shard to the gates.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium at twilight is vividly anchored with sensory details like bruised purples, damp velvet, and overgrown vines, filtered through Elara's perceptual bias toward emotional residues, constraining her choices by guiding her to the pedestal. Atmosphere supports the reeling hush tone, evolving causally as mist softens edges and twilight filters light, mirroring her urgency without overt symbolism. The setting pressures the climax by providing the artifacts that enable her incidental heroism, charging the final image at the gates.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving vulnerable voices signals early and tightens once through the spiking pulses, forcing Elara's agency in rushing to Mira, with a visible cost in Mira's halted blueprints and the reconfiguration of the atrium's fate under a Causal lens. Pressure coheres via internal curiosity conflicting with the urgency of fading echoes, earning the resolution through her micro-choices like tuning the hearing aid. Coincidence in the anonymous tip complicates but does not resolve; one meaningful deepening suffices at this length, though stakes remain somewhat abstract until the end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of incidental heroism emerges organically from Elara's pursuit preserving fragile emotional bonds, resonating through images like the pulsing hearing aid and locket inscription, inviting reflection on memory's endurance without tidy morals. Subtext in the disembodied murmur and sepia photograph implies complexity in protecting the past amid progress, with the final image offering a non-literal answer by reweighting the sanatorium's legacy. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality via concrete urgency, though thematic depth relies on particulars without forced motifs.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and apt, with perceptual signature in Elara's selective noticing of pulses and mist, modulating rhythm from descriptive breaths to urgent propulsion at the spikes. Prose texture distinct in flowing syntax and metaphor, teaching patterned elision of backstory efficiently; brief dialogue at the end feels natural, goal-driven to assure Mira, carrying subtext of fragility. No head-hopping or register drift; free indirect style clean, with psychic distance tightening under stress without unwarranted certainty.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with vivid, purposeful lines like "shadows clung to marble columns like forgotten whispers," advancing atmosphere and momentum without loops, though occasional overwriting in stacked metaphors (e.g., "reeling hush that pressed against her skin like damp velvet") muddles clarity in the opening beat. Rhythm varies naturally, sentences propel via strong verbs, and clarity holds with clean grammar; no major artifacts touch closure, but synonym churn in descriptive passages (e.g., "bruised purples and grays") slightly dulls propulsion. Information often multitasks, integrating action into setting seamlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The premise of a "contact tracer for hearts" offers a fresh synthesis of supernatural investigation and emotional preservation, transforming ghost story tropes through specific artifacts like the hearing aid and locket, feeling organic to Elara's curiosity. Originality shines in the incidental heroism arising from curiosity rather than grand intent, with the final reconfiguration inevitable in hindsight; however, echoes of gothic sanatorium tales persist without bolder subversion. Risk in lyric atmosphere heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
