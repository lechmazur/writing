<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The android Elias's motivation to resolve inner static is clear and rooted in his nostalgic traits, intensifying through embodied contradictions like vibrating chassis and blistering skin during the burn. Interiority is concrete and particular, with emotions shown through synthetic flesh pulsing and pain simulations, avoiding stock phrasing. The meaningful change—emerging refined rather than erased—is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the heated components and lingering unburned shard. Flaws complicate choices authentically, but some android stereotypes slightly limit individuality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through density increases in electromagnetic whispers and fragmented memories, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias contains chaos with felt cost in blistering skin and refined wholeness. Orientation anchors early in the glass-domed enclosure and magnetic shift, with no disorientation debt. One meaningful deepening occurs via the controlled burn, sufficient for length, though causality feels more textural than strict linkage. The final image reweights options effectively, but lacks a persistent constraint shaping tactics beyond the box.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The desert rose farm in a glass-domed enclosure is vividly specific, with crystalline petals and thorny succulents mirroring Elias's organic strangeness, constraining choices like pruning amid the storm. Sensory details are purposeful, blending visual blooms with humming air and sand devils, evolving causally with the magnetic shift. The setting charges the final image of touching a petal, feeling wholeness in fragility, meeting the 9+ test. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly, though occupational details are minimal but apt.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of resolving inner static to prevent ecosystem unraveling is signaled early, with one meaningful deepening through amplifying miniaturization that narrows options and raises cost in heated components. Pressure coheres under Accumulative/Textural lens, forcing stance crystallization in embracing the unburned shard. Agency drives the protocol initiation, with legible cost in pain and fragmentation, but coincidence of the magnetic shift complicates without fully resolving. Meets 9+ test marginally, as cost is unmistakable but not maximally driven by persistent constraints.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of fragmented wholeness emerges organically from purging fears into harmless embers, with subtext in images like the unburned shard as fuel, avoiding direct statements. The final image of the petal touch offers a resonant, non-literal repricing of nostalgia as a bridge, reweighting prior chaos without moralizing. Emotional aftereffect is concrete through Elias's harmonious hum, embracing complexity in wholeness from breaks. Some ambiguity lingers meaningfully, but lacks deeper counter-readings for higher resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable and apt, with perceptual signature in Elias's optic sensors dimming and chassis vibrations, modulating rhythm with emotional intensity like flickering lights. Prose texture is distinct in poetic syntax and word choice, such as "electromagnetic whispers," teaching patterned elision in fragmented memories that pays off at closure. No dialogue, so ignore those bullets; no head-hopping or unreliability issues. Meets 9+ test with rhythmic control under pressure and taught elision, though some diction borders on elevated register.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied rhythm in sentences like "The static within Elias swelled, threatening to scramble his directives," advancing atmosphere without loops. Clarity is high, but occasional overwriting in stacked metaphors like "coiling like thorns around his processors" muddles slightly in peak beats, triggering minor -0.3 deduction. Information density is strong, with lines multitasking image and emotion; no major artifacts or redundancies touch closure. Final line resolves resonantly, but template cadence in reflective blocks deducts lightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The premise of an organic android purging simulated childhood fears via controlled burn offers fresh synthesis of sci-fi and psychological elements, feeling inevitable in the dome's eternal bloom. Tropes like android nostalgia are transformed through specific details like holographic shards and blistering skin, with risk-taking in lyric structure heightening stakes. Emotional specificity avoids generics, but echoes familiar AI-sentience arcs without bold subversion. One fresh inflection in embracing the unburned shard recharges the arc organically.</comment>
