<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to navigate gentrification through orderly intuition is clear and intensifies compellingly, with contradictory impulses in her dual allegiance embodied during the juggler interaction; interiority is concrete, avoiding stock phrasing, and her final endurance forecloses dissolution with felt cost in the collective vote.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned shards over nights with legible transitions, anchoring orientation early in the buoyant sprawl of Aquafeste; closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration in the phoenix mural and vote, reweighting stakes with conceptual cost of adaptation, though one shard feels slightly redundant.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The raft city's perpetual carnival atmosphere is vividly specific, with sensory details like spiced kelp fritters and creaking walkways filtering through Lira's POV; the floating environment constrains choices, charging the final image of reordered bonds on gentler seas.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of unifying against privatization tightens accumulatively through graffiti beats, forcing stance crystallization in the vote; agency in reorganization forecloses scattering with visible cost in desperate energy, though coincidence of word spreading slightly complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of balancing untamed spirit with structured resilience emerges organically from graffiti motifs and dual allegiance, culminating in a resonant phoenix image that reweights the premise without moralizing; subtext in encoded messages invites reflection on adaptation's complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Consistent third-person close POV on Lira maintains stable distance with perceptual signature in orderly intuitive noticing; prose texture is distinct and rhythmic, modulating with pressure in twilight revelers, with purposeful compression in shard transitions taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with vivid, propulsion-driven sentences like "whispers of corporate buyouts slithered through the crowds," varying rhythm without loops; minor overwriting in repetitive motifs like "desperate hope" is patterned and purposeful, enhancing momentum to the final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The raft city carnival facing privatization offers fresh synthesis of floating communal chaos and encoded resistance, transforming tropes through specific graffiti mechanics; risk-taking in mosaic structure heightens stakes organically, feeling inevitable in the phoenix rebirth.</comment>
