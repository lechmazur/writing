<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation for self-forgiveness is clear and intensifies through embodied emotions like the "skittish but awake" heart, with contradictory impulses of guilt and hope acting simultaneously in choices like stepping into the shallow. Interiority is concrete and particular, avoiding stock phrasing, as seen in the reedy wheeze matching isobars that reveal flaws under pressure. The final renunciation of asking the river to mirror himself is earned by prior causality, foreclosing self-blame with felt cost on the page. Quick test passed with contradictory impulses in scene and earned choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural, with density increasing through layered reflections and pattern breaks like graffiti coordinates building to closure. Orientation anchors who (river chronicler), where (disused station), and when (after stopping medication) by the first sentence, serving the introspective journey. Closure is a valid Conceptual Repricing where the station becomes a "ledger" reframing blame, with conceptual cost of past certainty legible in the final image of mercy as footing; one meaningful deepening suffices. Cost is felt in the honest weight of water returning a "different" number, shaping the final reconfiguration without contradiction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The disused station overgrown with ivy is vividly specific, with sensory details like shimmering ivy and mossed milestones filtered through the protagonist's bias as a chronicler, evolving causally as the site of past and present grief. Setting constrains choices, such as the embankment slit by foxes guiding the path, and charges the final image where the station shifts from ruin to ledger, mirroring internal mercy. Tone tensions the raw solace through green chapel imagery, supporting theme without overt symbolism. Quick test passed as the environment and recurring accordion constrain choices and charge closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of self-forgiveness signals early and deepens through one meaningful cadence shift at the shallow, where counting to twelve forecloses past certainty with felt cost of honest weight. Under Accumulative/Textural lens, pressure accumulates via graffiti and bellows, crystallizing stance without coincidence resolving; agency in stepping in and marking the margin drives the reconfiguration. Moral calculus sharpens at the sluice gate, confronting lazy mapping as a trade-off between tidy creeds and truth. Quick test passed with agency-driven deepening and unmistakable on-page cost in the returned number.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of mapping truth versus self-deception emerges organically from particulars like graffiti arrows and bellows breaths, inviting reflection on forgiveness through ambiguity in the river's "honest" weight without tidy morals. Subtext in images like the blue mouth saying "Begin again" elicits emotional aftereffect of raw solace, avoiding sentimentality via complex flaws. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer by repricing the river as itself, reweighting the premise with conceptual cost. Quick test passed with non-literal reconfiguration charging prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable and apt, with perceptual signature biased toward cartographic details like measuring ink pressure, modulating rhythm under stress without elision issues. Prose texture is distinct in poetic syntax like "storm drunk with certainty," consistent and voice-motivated, teaching patterned compression early for legibility at closure. No dialogue present, so policy skips those bullets; psychic distance shifts intentionally serve emotional beats like kneeling without despair. Quick test passed with distinct signature and rhythmic control, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied rhythm in sentences like the shy notes sighing to match isobars, advancing atmosphere without loops or scaffold; metaphors are coherent and purposeful, avoiding muddle in peak beats at the shallow. Clarity shines in concise images like ivy veins as entries, with high information density doing multiple jobs per line. Opening anchors voice in the station arrival; final line resolves by recharging motifs with footing as mercy. Quick test passed with zero artifacts, strong propulsion, and clean craft under pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cartography, graffiti wisdom, and accordion as brother's breath transforms guilt tropes through specific choices like treating stall walls as river transects, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Bold risk in lyric, accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, committing to premise of mending via mapping. Emotional specificity in repricing certainty avoids generics, with non-obvious angle on forgiveness via bathroom allusions. Quick test passed with inevitable synthesis and risk elevating coherence (+0.3 within band).</comment>
