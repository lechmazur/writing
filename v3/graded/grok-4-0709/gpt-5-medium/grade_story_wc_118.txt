<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The historian's motivation to collect wall stories is clear and intensifies through perceptual sensitivity, compelling choices like probing the flue and rearranging the library; interiority is concrete via porosity and wind-through-gate imagery, with embodied emotions in dust flurries and palm-biting tapestry. Internal conflict shows in his non-loneliness yet volunteering to absorb stranded tales, revealing contradictory impulses of preservation amid silence. The final renunciation of old axis assurance earns stasis with felt cost of eternal listening, visible in whispering to the fevered child-like axis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through patterned elisions and motif accruals like dragons and displaced axis, with orientation anchored early in the silo library and historian's role. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration via library rearrangement and wall-teaching, repricing dreams' unseating with conceptual cost of stranded stories, felt in the prairie's pulse shift. Persistent constraint of bronze quiet shapes tactics, as in diary-reading until rooms answer, culminating in inevitable hindsight reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The reclaimed silo library anchors vividly with ladder-rung shelves and corrugated skin, constraining choices like probing the rusted flue; atmosphere of bronze quiet modulates with dust moths and ash feathers, mirroring internal porosity. Sensory details are selective, POV-biased toward murmurs and sighs, charging the final image of shifting weather-pulse. Recurring objects like tapestry and brass disk constrain and charge closure, with spatial coherence in central table and flue navigation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of collecting wall stories before silence forgets tightens via deepening discoveries like brass disk and diary fragments, narrowing options under textural lens to volunteer absorption; agency in rearrangement forecloses old axis with felt cost of porosity. One meaningful cadence shift in walls obliging tales reweights stakes, forcing stance crystallization without coincidence resolving. Moral calculus between preserving echoes and accepting dream-loss sharpens the peak whisper to the axis.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of listening to salvage displaced dreams emerges organically from images like spindle-myth and wall-gossip, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in silence's grammar. Subtext in dragon coils and ash feathers invites reflection on forgotten fears, eliciting aftereffect of porous endurance. Final image of stitching world from echoes offers resonant, non-literal repricing of human absence without stating a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in brick tones and paper breaths, modulating rhythm from soft moves to ringing spines. Prose texture distinct in syntax like "bronze quiet that even dust learns to honor," with purposeful compression teaching pattern early. No dialogue, so policy skips; elision in motif patterns pays off at closure without obscurity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, each line advancing atmosphere via images like "dust flurries like moths, each wing a different year"; rhythm varies naturally, avoiding loops or scaffold, with syntactic variety in patient plows and burnished lines. No artifacts obscure closure; final lines propel to pulse-shift with clear propulsion and strong verbs. Figurative language coherent, enhancing without muddle in peak beats like flue-probing.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-dream world with silo as fallen compass and walls as abandoned dogs transforms tropes through specific perceptual historian; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes without gimmickry. Core premise of unseated axis as myth offers non-obvious angle on silence, committing fully with authenticity. Turns like disk discovery feel inevitable from prior motifs, personalizing archetypes via chalked dragons and hummed warmth.</comment>
