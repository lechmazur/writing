<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to heal through memory-tasting is clear and intensifies via embodied tastes like "lightning" and "chalk dust," revealing contradictory impulses in gentle rebellion against forgetting; the final sharing of soup earns a credible endurance with felt cost of past ruins. Interiority is concrete and particular, avoiding stock phrasing, though flaws like self-deception could deepen under pressure. Single-POV focus excels in micro-choices, such as spitting taste as confession, aligning actions with traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned memory fragments and celestial alignment, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where neighbors rebuild via soup, with conceptual cost of refusing hate legible in the final image. Orientation anchors early in the greenhouse, and causality holds via textural density shifts like sprout shivering. One meaningful deepening suffices, but ellipsis in tree growth feels slightly unmotivated without stronger linkage to prior beats.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The rusted greenhouse is vividly specific, with cracked panes and glittering soil constraining choices like planting and pruning, charging the final gathering; sensory details like groaning wind and luminous sprout reflect POV bias and mirror internal healing. Micro-setting of soil and fruit evolves causally, guiding action without static repetition. Environment pressures the climax by brightening with alignment, making it indispensable to closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of gentle rebellion tightens once via alignment's peak, deepening through pruning that narrows options and reveals costs like "forgetting's" price; agency in sharing soup crystallizes stance with felt emotional trade-off. Pressure coheres accumulatively, but coincidence of alignment complicates without fully resolving, and stakes remain somewhat abstract until the final gathering. One intensification suffices at length, earning solid escalation under the lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of healing ruins through memory emerges organically from particulars like tasting "river stones" and brother's scarf, offering resonant non-literal answer in the soup's untangling effect without moralizing; subtext in gestures like quiet laughter adds complexity. Final image reweights premise with ambiguity, avoiding tidy binaries. Earned from struggle, it invites reflection beyond plot.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in synesthetic tastes, and rhythmic prose modulates with pressure, like curved shadows; purposeful compression in memory fragments is taught early and pays off at closure. No dialogue, so ignore those bullets; elision of growth feels motivated, enhancing texture without obscurity. Diction fits wise, mechanic-like voice consistently.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied rhythm in lines like "shadows curved like commas," advancing atmosphere without loops; metaphors are coherent, though occasional overwriting in peak beats like synaptic mentions slightly muddles clarity. No major artifacts, high information density, and strong verbs propel to resonant close. Opening anchors voice; final line charges motifs effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory-tasting chef and knowledge fruit transforms tropes into organic rebellion via specific details like pruning unfinished homework; risk in poetic structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable at soup-sharing. Premise commits fully, avoiding generics with non-obvious angle on healing. Bold vision coheres singularly.</comment>
