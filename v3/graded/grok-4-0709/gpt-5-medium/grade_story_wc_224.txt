<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to reclaim buried talents is clear and intensifies through embodied interiority, with contradictory impulses shown in the refusal to sing and later seeding of forgiven mistakes. The seer's quicksilver eyes and actions apply immediate pressure, forcing micro-choices like touching the stone that reveal values with felt cost. Flaws like self-silencing complicate choices, earning the stasis of home as practice without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned imagery and elision, with orientation anchored by the first line in the mountain bookstore. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing when the protagonist speaks a "true hello" with the mountain's rumble, reweighting home with the cost of exiled words. One meaningful deepening occurs at the stone-touch, changing knowledge without requiring causal turns.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The labyrinthine bookstore-mountain setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like shelves breathing cold and aisles curling that mirror the protagonist's internal exile. It constrains choices, such as narrowing paths leading to the seer, and charges the final image of the courtyard door. Micro-setting elements like the stone and feather evolve causally, heightening atmosphere without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of mapping lost rooms signals early and deepens texturally through the feather and stone, narrowing options with the cost of confronting silenced accents. Pressure coheres via hidden thunder, forcing stance crystallization at the mirror revelation without coincidence resolving it. One tightening at the stone-touch forecloses denial, with moral calculus between withheld breaths and seeded possibility charging the poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of home as a practice of naming refused feelings emerges organically from images like cracked jars and seeded tongues, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in forgiven mistakes. Subtext in mirrors trembling and letters swimming invites reflection on silenced talents without assertion. The final hello offers a resonant, non-literal repricing of the premise, reweighting prior burials with emotional honesty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature in poetic, biased noticing of page-ivy and river-smells, modulating rhythm under pressure like the exhaling floor. Dialogue pursues goals with subtext, as the seer's "Your home has the shape of your mouth" evades directness while advancing insight. Patterned elision in lyric compression is taught early and pays off at closure without opacity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied syntax and rhythm accelerating in beats like the stone-touch, free of loops or scaffold. Figurative language like "daylight bends away from the eyes" heightens without muddle, doing double work for atmosphere and advancement. Opening anchors voice; final line resolves by recharging motifs with high clarity and no artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of a mountain-bookstore seer and seeded languages transforms familiar loss tropes through specific, voice-driven metaphors like mercury eyes and feather-texture. Risk in surreal compression heightens stakes without gimmickry, committing to implications like nightly reality swaps that feel inevitable. Fresh inflection at the vowel-house mirror reconfigures the premise organically.</comment>
