<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The potter's motivation to understand resistance to change is clear and intensifies through her gentle actions, rooted in zen-minded traits like open-handed patience; interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions in moments like kneeling and singing, revealing contradictory impulses of holding without forcing. However, the lack of a second on-page character limits relationship crucibles, though single-POV interior contradiction shines in the final realization. The ending choice feels earned by prior micro-choices, with visible cost in her depleted water and breath.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned imagery of light and thrumming, leading to a Conceptual Repricing closure where the potter reweights resistance as repeated tenderness, with conceptual cost in the anchored fractures made legible in the final shawl image. Orientation anchors who (potter), where (oasis), and when (as smoke flattens) by line 2, serving the lyric pattern. One meaningful deepening suffices, with causality in motif accrual rather than linear turns.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The scorched wasteland and abandoned oasis vividly anchor the scene, with sensory details like heat trembling and cracked troughs constraining choices, such as gathering clay; the setting charges the final image by evolving from ash to a shawl of times, mirroring internal states through purposeful, POV-filtered specificity. Micro-setting of hives and lantern glass functions as environment that directly shapes tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of understanding resistance escalates texturally through motif density, with one meaningful deepening when the thrumming spreads and timelines braid tighter, narrowing options to gentle persistence; agency in renunciation (not forcing) forecloses aggressive change with felt cost in her last water. Under Accumulative lens, pressure coheres without needing multiple reversals, though cost could be more viscerally embodied at peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of places resisting change through repeated kindness emerges organically from images like braided timelines and phototropic leaning, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer in the final shawl and her intention, embracing complexity without moralizing. Subtext in gestures like open hands and singing adds depth, inviting reflection on tenderness's cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in poetic, zen-infused noticing of light patterns and thrumming; lyric compression and patterned elision (e.g., shimmer of bees) are taught early and pay off at closure without obscurity. No dialogue, so policy skips those bullets; rhythmic control heightens under pressure, like in the singing note climbing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in short, imagistic sentences that propel accumulation; no loops or artifacts, with purposeful metaphors like "sun braided three threads" advancing atmosphere without muddle. Clarity shines in closure, though some figurative layering in peak beats borders on dense but remains legible and voice-motivated.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of zen pottery, fractured timelines, and phototropic kindness feels inevitable, transforming tropes like wasteland renewal through specific, non-obvious details like breath-collected water; risk in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, committing to the premise's implications.</comment>
