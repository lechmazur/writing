<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to teach endings through estrangement is concrete and intensifies under pressure, compelling her choice to loop calls without entering the emotional frame; interiority shows embodied contradiction in her "standing back" while haunted by voices, with the final quiet return earning stasis via visible cost of isolation. Rojo and Flora apply secondary pressure, their rituals forcing Mara's micro-choices like spinning the disc. Flaws complicate without hedging, as her estrangement braces her like a healing bone, revealing value hierarchy in the elevator crisis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, patterned elision and motif accrual build to a resonant reconfiguration in the final ledger entry and disc cleaning, with conceptual cost legible in the "melodically haunted quiet return"; orientation anchors early in the booth and tunnel, but minor ambiguity in call timelines slightly softens causality without breaking lens hold. Closure via Charged Poise reweights beginnings/endings with undeniable pressure from the child's rescue.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The subway utility tunnel constrains choices with flickering bulbs and humming wires, charging the final image as wires purr like cats; sensory details like salted dark and thready rings are POV-filtered and purposeful, mirroring Mara's estrangement. Micro-setting of the booth and disc integrates into action, evolving causally with trains and calls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of cultivating estrangement tightens in the elevator crisis, deepening via the disc's unprompted hum that forces Mara's looping decision, narrowing options with felt cost of emotional distance; under Textural lens, cadence shift reweights stake without multiple reversals needed. Coincidence of the arcing rail complicates but protagonist agency resolves through routing the crew.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of teaching endings to begin emerges organically from wrong-number rituals and the rescue, with subtext in silences and implications like the pressed flower surviving dark; final image offers resonant, non-literal answer by letting endings "go upstairs together," embracing complexity without moralizing. Emotional aftereffect lingers through Mara's quiet tending, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person close POV stays stable and modest, with perceptual signature in melodic haunting and wire harmonies; prose texture distinct in rhythmic, image-dense syntax that modulates with pressure, like crackling lines in crisis. Patterned elision taught early pays off at closure; dialogue subtext-driven, distinguishing Rojo's hinges from Flora's pulses.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose dense and propulsive with varied rhythm, like "calls came down the old copper like rain through a colander," advancing atmosphere without loops; minor scaffold in repetitive "Mara" stems in mid-beats, but no artifacts dull closure. Figurative language coherent and voice-motivated, heightening the disc's hum in peak moments.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of underground operator with glass harmonica and wrong-number rituals feels inevitable, transforming trope of misdialed connections through melodic estrangement; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes without gimmickry, as the child's rescue reconfigures premise boldly.</comment>
