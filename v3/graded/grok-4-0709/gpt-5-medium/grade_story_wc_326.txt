<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to fetch wisdom from failure is concretely rooted in regret and intensifies through micro-choices like scraping the eyepiece and recalibrating receivers, revealing contradictory impulses of stubborn endurance and vulnerability in the heartbeat counting. Interiority is embodied and particular, with emotions like tasting iron under stress showing without therapy-speak. The final renunciation of the ghost's signal earns stasis with visible cost, as in placing the shard back as a "lens cut small for carrying."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, patterns like radio static and ink shapes build density toward a Resonant Reconfiguration in the ending, where the protagonist lets the signal fade with felt cost of ongoing counting and courage. Orientation anchors early in the observatory under snow, with no disorientation debt. Closure lands on-page as Earned Stasis, reweighting failure into wisdom without contradiction, though one more explicit causal link in the defragmentation could tighten the pattern break.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The opal observatory under snow is vividly specific, with sensory details like snow settling as ash and rime on the dome constraining perception and charging the final image of gleaming opaline dark. Atmosphere supports the midnight solace tone through purposeful, POV-filtered details that mirror internal regret, such as frost on the eyepiece. The micro-setting of the desk with ink and shard evolves causally, directly enabling the recalibration choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of redeeming failure tightens through a meaningful deepening when the ghost shifts to the mentor's voice, forcing stance crystallization with conceptual cost of humbled faith. Pressure accumulates texturally via heartbeat counts and ink patterns, narrowing options toward recalibration without coincidence resolving. Agency shines in the protagonist's renunciation of the signal, though the cost feels more oblique than visceral in the final poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of extracting wisdom from failure emerges organically through recurring images like the shard and ink patterns, culminating in a resonant, non-literal reconfiguration without stated morals. Subtext in gestures like pressing the shard to frost and reading ink shapes invites reflection on regret and persistence. The final image of watching for a "wiser kind of dark" reweights the premise with emotional honesty, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable and biased, with perceptual signature in selective noticing of heartbeats and static, modulating rhythm under pressure like staccato pulses. Voice is distinct and textured, with purposeful compression in lyric patterns taught early and paid off at closure. Dialogue with the ghost feels natural, subtext-driven, and advances the arc, distinguishing idioms as the ghost shifts from clipped echo to mentor's laugh.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied syntax and rhythm accelerating in beats like recalibration, free of loops or scaffold; metaphors like "snow blown across lattice" are coherent and purposeful without muddle. Information density is high, each line advancing atmosphere or character, as in the ink crawling toward heat. No artifacts obscure closure, though one mixed metaphor in the teacup echo slightly dilutes precision but doesn't touch the ending.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sci-fi elements like digital ghosts and ink divination transforms familiar failure tropes through specific, poetic choices in the observatory setting, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Bold risk in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, as in the recurring static motif reweighting regret. Originality shines in non-obvious emotional truth, like treating the shard as a portable lens, avoiding derivative templates.</comment>
