<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The frugal astronomer's motivation is clear and intensifies through consistent traits like tallying oil and prizing pencils over calves, compelling the pledge with felt cost of spare resources. Interiority is concrete and embodied, showing contradictory impulses in mocking rites yet counting like a penitent, especially in the alcove revelation. The final renunciation of grandeur for maintenance earns its stasis with visible hierarchy of values in the vow.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, patterns of numbers and stars build density to a resonant reconfiguration in the pledge, with conceptual cost of thrift-bound devotion legible in the final exhale. Orientation anchors early in dusk courtyards and palace, serving the lyric buildup without disorientation. Closure lands as Earned Stasis with persistent constraint of frugality shaping tactics, though one ellipsis in water pouring feels slightly under-motivated.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The reimagined Babylonian palace is vivid and purposeful, with doors tuned to stars and wires anchoring risings constraining choices like waiting for Saturn. Sensory details filter through POV bias, mirroring internal devotion via arithmetic stone. The alcove and urn charge the final image, making the micro-setting indispensable to closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><grade>Under Accumulative lens, dominant stake of sealing a covenant tightens through pattern breaks like the note sounding and plaster falling, reweighting with cost of patient hours. Agency in pressing the bead and pledging drives deepening, with moral calculus between grandeur and thrift forcing stance crystallization. Cost is unmistakable in the vow's trade-off of oil and time.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of encrypted devotion emerges organically from arithmetic piety and frugal vows, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in empirical irony. Subtext in images like violet silk and reed coolness invites reflection on faith without spectacle. The final image of mending gutters offers a resonant, non-literal repricing of unknown covenants.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in frugal noticing, like breaths to spare oil, and rhythmic control heightens dusk harmony. Patterned elision in schematic overlays is taught early and pays off at urn discovery without obscurity. Prose texture modulates with pressure, prose as character reflecting the mind's quiet arithmetic.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied rhythm, like "dusk clung" opening and "gray feathers" imagery advancing atmosphere without loops. Figurative language is controlled, though one mixed metaphor in "dusky harmony like violet silk torn" slightly muddles but doesn't touch closure. High information density in lines like the water splitting into sums, with zero scaffold in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of Babylonian palace with magic squares as devotion transforms tropes through specific frugal lens, feeling inevitable in the pledge. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, committing to premise of arithmetic piety. Non-obvious angle on faith via empiricism avoids derivatives, with authenticity in voice and vision.</comment>
