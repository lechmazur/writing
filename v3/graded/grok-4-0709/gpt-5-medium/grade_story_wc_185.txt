<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation as mapkeeper is clear and intensifies through micro-choices like placing the stone, revealing values with felt cost in the ongoing tending; interiority is concrete via embodied perceptions like ribs clattering, though emotions lean abstract in peak moments. Flaws complicate choices authentically, with the narrator's pretended confidence contrasting internal struggle, earning a meaningful endurance at closure. No second character on-page, so relationship bullets are ignored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned images and cadence shifts, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where the bloom of hush reweights the caves' resonance with conceptual cost of perpetual vigilance; orientation anchors early in the harmonic caves post-arrival. Closure lands on-page with the marked map and warmed stone, charging the final image of tending the bloom. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length, with no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The harmonic caves setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like battered breathing and resonance storms constraining choices, such as examining ice cracks; it charges the final image by blessing the corridor for hush, meeting the 9+ test. Details evolve causally, mirroring internal hush through softened cracks. Spatial coherence holds in the single-scene progression.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of finding quiet in the storm tightens through one meaningful deepening when planting the hush, narrowing options and forcing endurance with felt cost in relief and ongoing storms; under Textural lens, cadence shift reweights abundance as gentler. Agency via conjuring and tapping drives escalation without coincidence resolving. Meets 9+ test threshold but minor abstraction in cost clarity caps it.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of forging calm amid chaos emerges organically from images like hammered repose and blooming hush, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in the beings' persistent presence; final image of the marked map offers resonant, non-literal repricing without statement. Subtext in silences and softening deepens complexity. Earned through particulars like tasting scripts, avoiding abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Consistent first-person POV with distinct perceptual signature in ripple-mark metaphors and rhythmic prose that modulates under pressure, like fizzing edges; no dialogue, so those bullets ignored. Patterned elision in poetic compression is taught early and pays off at closure with legible hush. Diction fits the mapkeeper's idiosyncratic voice without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied rhythm and high information in lines like "singing a weather we had never cataloged," advancing atmosphere without loops; minor figurative density in peak beats like milky shine doesn't obscure clarity. No artifacts touch closure, and syntactic variety supports emphasis. Opening anchors voice strongly, final line recharges motifs effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of fantastical elements like energy beings and echo stone feels inevitable through poetic transformation of tropes, with fresh angle on harmony via hammered repose; risk in lyric density heightens stakes without gimmickry. Commits to premise without retreat, personalizing archetypes via mapkeeper's worldview. Specific details like shy hieroglyphs create memorable freshness.</comment>
