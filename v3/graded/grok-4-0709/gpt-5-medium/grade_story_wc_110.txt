<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation to thaw mistrust is clear and intensifies through embodied interiority, culminating in the public confession that earns acceptance with the felt cost of vulnerability; contradictory impulses, like fearing silence while eavesdropping, act simultaneously in scene without stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds density through patterned doodle revelations to a Resonant Reconfiguration at the projection, with conceptual cost of exposed cowardice legible in the final acceptance; orientation anchors early in the forecourt, and one meaningful deepening suffices at this length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The crystal forecourt after rain is vivid and purposeful, constraining choices like patrolling awnings and projecting on tarps, while charging the final image with bright ripples that reweight communal trust; sensory details reflect POV bias and evolve with events.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of communal mistrust tightens through the narrator's deepening realization from doodles, forcing the public projection as a stance crystallization with visible cost of risking the registrar role; under the textural lens, one cadence shift reweights options sufficiently without needing multiple reversals.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of honesty freeing mistrust emerges organically from doodle subtext and the projection's resonant answer, embracing ambiguity without tidy morals; the final image of refitted machine and laughter reweights transparency's complexity non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in poetic, image-dense texture; rhythmic control heightens pressure in the bandstand confession without elision, and purposeful compression teaches patterns paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied rhythm and specific imagery like "puddles murmuring like glass throats," advancing atmosphere without loops; minor figurative density in peak beats avoids muddle but could trim for concision, yet closure remains clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original synthesis of silent city, doodle eavesdropping, and projector lens transforms familiar redemption tropes through specific, non-obvious details like ambiguous drawings, heightening stakes with bold lyric risk that coheres at closure.</comment>
