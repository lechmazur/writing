<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The widow's motivation to harvest lessons from loss is concretely embodied in her carving ritual, with contradictory impulses of grief and containment shown through micro-choices like pausing at the knot and deciding not to restore the tag. Emotions are embodied and flawed, as in her refusal to sand away the knot, reflecting a hierarchy of values with visible cost in preserved absence. The single-POV interiority is character-specific, avoiding stock phrasing, and her flaws complicate the resolution into an Earned Stasis. This earns high marks under the accumulative lens, with the final thumb-press on the notch highlighting irreplaceable loss.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned images and reflections toward a Charged Poise closure, where setting the carving on the sill reconfigures grief with felt conceptual cost in ongoing absence. Orientation anchors early in the loft, with rain and kettle as cues, avoiding penalties. Causality is motivic rather than linear, with one meaningful deepening in carving the knot into a scar, but a minor slip in unmotivated ellipsis around speaking to the wood slightly softens linkage. The final image charges prior motifs effectively, though without a decisive physical act.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The rain-beaded skylight loft is vividly specific, with sensory details like droplets as lenses constraining her pause and mirroring patience, directly charging the final image on the sill. Micro-setting elements like ropes and tins evolve subtly, reflecting her interior state without overt symbolism. Details are POV-filtered and purposeful, with rain affecting choices like opening the window for exhale. This constrains reflection and closure, passing the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of containing grief escalates texturally through carving deepenings, like working the knot into a scar, narrowing emotional options with felt cost in preserved absence under the accumulative lens. One meaningful intensification suffices, driven by her agency in rituals, but coincidence of rain complicates without resolving. The Charged Poise ending makes cost unmistakable in the bundle's placement. Minor abstraction in stakes slightly limits, but agency holds.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of impermanence and containment emerges organically from carving and rain motifs, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer as she preserves absence in the notch, reweighting loss without moralizing. Subtext in gestures like thumb-pressing the tag spot invites reflection on trust and miracles. Emotional aftereffect is honest, avoiding sentimentality through complexity. The final image recharges the premise, passing the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable and modest, with perceptual signature in selective noticing of rain beads and wood knots, biased by grief. Voice texture is distinct in rhythmic, lyric compression, teaching patterns early like steam ropes and curling shavings, paid off at closure. Brief dialogue to wood and rain feels natural and subtextual, advancing theme. Rhythmic control under pressure heightens without obscurity, passing the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied syntax and rhythm in lines like "rain freckles the skylight until the loft feels buoyed by silver music," advancing atmosphere without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, avoiding muddle in peak beats like carving the knot. High information density, zero artifacts in closure, but minor simultaneity in steam and rain descriptions slightly tempers perfection. Passes 9+ test with clear propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of circus grief and carving ritual transforms tropes through specific details like the collar curve and tag notch, feeling inevitable in the final sill placement. Risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens stakes without gimmickry, committing to premise. Non-obvious angle on loss as "hinge" avoids generics. Passes 9+ test with bold, coherent vision.</comment>
