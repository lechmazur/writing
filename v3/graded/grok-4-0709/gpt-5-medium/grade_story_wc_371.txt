<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation as a "creeping normality noticer" is clear and intensifies through micro-choices like gardening and sharing bread, revealing contradictory impulses of guilt and tenderness; interiority is concrete, embodied in actions like whispering names and tearing bread, with flaws like lateness complicating choices without hedging. The relationship with the woman forces a stance crystallization, altering their dynamic by the end with felt cost of ongoing vigilance. Emotions layer contradictorily, avoiding therapy-speak, as in the lighter but not exonerated feeling at closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through patterned images of loss and remembrance, with orientation anchored by 120 words in the courtyard journey; closure lands as Charged Poise in the final walk home, reconfiguring absolution as a held line with felt cost of perpetual noticing, shaped by persistent constraint of small surrenders. One meaningful cadence shift from reflection to shared quiet deepens the stake without requiring causal turns.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The overgrown courtyard and tea house constrain choices, with thorns testing gentle hands and ivy offering embrace, charging the final image of seeds in seams; sensory details like moss, steam, and sesame are selective, POV-biased toward forgotten places, mirroring internal erosion. Micro-setting of bread and thermos integrates into action, evolving causally as crumbs feed the garden.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of seeking tenuous absolution tightens through deepening pattern of small losses confessed, under Accumulative/Textural lens, with one cadence shift in shared laughter reweighting apathy's cost; agency in renunciation forecloses forgetting, with visible price in the lighter-but-holding feeling at closure. Pressure coheres without coincidence resolving, forcing stance crystallization in the tea-sharing beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of finding sacred in ordinary amid creeping normality emerges from images like bread crumbs as communion, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in absolution's tenuousness; final image of seeds and table waiting offers resonant, non-literal repricing of forgetting's cost without statement. Subtext in silence and gestures deepens complexity, eliciting lingering reflection on patient company.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in noticing tiny surrenders, modulating rhythm from reflective compression to quiet texture; dialogue is natural, subtext-laden, advancing shared losses without exposition, as in the woman's oven-crack story. Patterned elision in lyric mode is taught early and pays off at closure without obscurity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in sentences like "the bread cracks as if remembering heat"; no loops or artifacts, with strong verbs and specific images propelling momentum, as in guerrilla gardening beats. Figurative language is controlled, purpose-driven without muddle in peak moments like steam reaching rafters.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of urban decay and gentle resistance through guerrilla gardening transforms trope of lost places, with non-obvious reconfiguration in bread-as-devotional; risk in lyric accumulations heightens stakes organically, feeling inevitable in the patient sap contract. Emotional specificity avoids generics, committing to vision of careful company.</comment>
