<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to weigh a swallowed truth is clear and intensifies through embodied emotions like the rattling stone star, compelling the confession; interiority is concrete with contradictory impulses in the smudging and holding scenes. The oracle's fault-tolerant trait pressures choices without stock phrasing. Flaws complicate the resolution via grief's isobars, earning stasis with felt cost in the storm's mercy. Voice distinction holds in the oracle's indirect speech versus the protagonist's reflective idiom.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, patterns of imagery (smudges, gentian, weather) build to a Conceptual Repricing where truths lighten when shared, with conceptual cost in swaying certainties; orientation anchors early in the hike to the station. Closure lands on-page with the folded gentian as a map of auroral sorrow, reweighting the premise. One meaningful deepening suffices, but minor elision in the lie's reveal feels slightly unmotivated without stronger causal cue.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The mountain weather station is vividly anchored with humming rooms and anemometer, constraining choices like taking the illustration outside; sensory details like antenna wires' tongues and quivering paper reflect POV bias and pressure. Environment charges the final image in the shivering station during the storm. Micro-setting of the barometer and scale integrates into action without cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of weighing the swallowed truth signals early and deepens via the confession, narrowing options with the balance test; under Textural lens, cadence shifts reweight grief's cost in the storm's arrival. Agency in occupying margins forecloses silence with felt price in release like dawn. Coherent pressure crystallizes stance without coincidence resolving it.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of swaying certainties emerges through recurring images like the smudged gentian and isobars, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in grief's mercy; final folded map offers resonant, non-literal repricing of swallowed truths. Subtext in gestures like mittened fingers and soot line deepens complexity. Emotional aftereffect lingers via auroral sorrow without sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in auroral imagery and rhythmic control under pressure, like the rattling stone star; patterned elision in echoes and wind teaches its logic, paying off at closure. Dialogue carries subtext and advances via indirect questions, distinguishing idioms. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose density is high with purposeful metaphors like blue trumpets with frost veins advancing atmosphere; rhythm varies naturally, accelerating in the confession beat. Minor template cadence in repetitive swaying certainties deducts slightly, but no loops obscure closure. Information propels without scaffold, and final line recharges motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of oracle as fault-tolerant meteorologist transforms grief tropes through specific images like smudged gentian and auroral sorrow, feeling inevitable; risk in lyric compression heightens stakes without gimmickry. Non-obvious angle on swallowed truths avoids templates.</comment>
