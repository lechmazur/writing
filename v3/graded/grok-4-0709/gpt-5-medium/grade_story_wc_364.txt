<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Iven's motivation to coax resilience is clear and intensifies through deliberate actions, rooted in quiet determination that compels high-stakes bartering with stone; interiority is embodied in his bruised wrist and traded memories, showing contradictory impulses under pressure. The collective POV limits individual depth, but Iven's flaws complicate choices without hedging, earning a meaningful endurance with felt cost at the climax. Strong micro-choices reveal values, like offering personal memories, foreclosing easy paths.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds density through patterned three-night progression and symbolic silk, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration where arches settle and rubble reshapes with conceptual cost of traded memories. Orientation anchors early in the orchard planet post-quakes, serving closure without debt. Closure lands on-page with felt cost in Iven's bruised wrist and offered names, reweighting stakes; one meaningful cadence shift suffices at this length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The orchard planet with floating rock arches is vivid and purposeful, constraining choices like mapping mine shafts and charging the final image of lowered arches grazed by ladders. Sensory details filter through collective urgency, mirroring internal resilience; the setting evolves causally as roots weave and arches groan, directly affecting action and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of rebuilding post-quakes tightens accumulatively over three nights, with pressure deepening via wind storm and silk tightening, forcing stance crystallization in Iven's memory barter. One meaningful intensification suffices, but cost feels oblique until the wrist bruise and traded names; agency in deliberate planning earns endurance with visible price, though coincidence of wind complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of bartered awakenings emerges organically from events like silk oaths and stone bargains, resisting tidy morals through ambiguity in mystery-living; final image of ringing bells offers resonant, non-literal repricing of resilience without stated moral. Subtext in gestures like tying ribbons deepens complexity; emotional aftereffect lingers via azure defiance, tied to particulars without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Collective first-person POV is stable and apt for communal tone, with perceptual signature in poetic noticing of embers and sighs; rhythmic control modulates with pressure, like snapped silk in storm. Patterned elision in whispers and truths is taught early and pays off at closure; no dialogue present, so policy skips those bullets.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with vivid images like "silk glowed in moonlight like water sliced thin," but occasional overwriting in stacked metaphors (e.g., whales, giants, veins) muddles peak beats without full payoff. Rhythm varies naturally, advancing atmosphere; minor loops in repetitive "bartered awakenings" deduct slightly, but clarity holds at closure. Information density high, with lines multitasking character and theme.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sci-fi setting with poetic bargaining transforms tropes like awakening land through specific silk mechanics and memory trades, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes organically; core premise offers non-obvious angle on resilience without hedging.</comment>
