<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to release control is clear and intensifies through embodied contradictions, like tying knots that sigh loose, compelling her to endure the cost of unfixing her certainties; interiority is concrete, with emotions layered in hypocritical self-deception rooted in her arranging habit. The boy's brief interaction reveals her values via micro-choice, but secondary characters lack pressure on her arc. Flaws complicate choices without safety-hedging, earning the metamorphosis through small bends before larger fate.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through patterned elisions of rain and plant motifs, with orientation anchored early in the nursery during storm season; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration via Charged Poise in the final vow under the trellis, reweighting her tending with felt cost of releasing certainty, evident in the crisped leaf as memory. One meaningful deepening suffices, but ellipsis occasionally softens causality without breaking lens coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The mossy trellis after rain constrains choices, pressuring Mara's listening and charging the final image where roughness blesses her palm; sensory details are vivid and POV-biased, with droplets like second thoughts mirroring internal states through action. Environment evolves causally with storms pruning certainties, and micro-setting of the leaf as recurring object charges closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of releasing control escalates via textural density increase in plant calculus and jasmine braiding, forcing stance crystallization with visible cost in unfixing her chest; one meaningful deepening through listening longer than habit allows narrows options under the lens. Pressure coheres without coincidence resolving, but internal want vs. fear could interweave more sharply at peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of reluctant metamorphosis emerges organically from plant behaviors and Mara's release, with subtext in gestures like the leaf's map of untraveled roads; final image offers resonant, non-literal answer by allowing vines to choose the sky, reweighting premise without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers meaningfully in sustained transformation, avoiding tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in circuitous sincerity, like hearing roots thinking; prose texture modulates rhythmically with storm pressure, teaching patterned diction early. Dialogue is natural, subtextual, and advances arc, as in her gentle words to customers; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in sentences like "droplets clung to everything like second thoughts" advancing atmosphere without loops; minor scaffold in repetitive rain motifs, but they pay off in closure. No artifacts obscure cause/effect, though some metaphors border on muddle in peak beats like the ledger of unforced flourishing.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of plant listening and metamorphosis feels inevitable through specific details like ivy wanting the rough post, transforming nursery trope with non-obvious moral calculus of subtraction as care; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes without gimmickry. Avoids template plots, but echoes familiar epiphany arcs slightly hedge boldness.</comment>
