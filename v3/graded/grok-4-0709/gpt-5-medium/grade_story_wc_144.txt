<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The artisan's motivation to repair and guide the drone is clear and intensifies through her embodied adaptations to blindness, with contradictory impulses shown in her calm amid crisis; her whispering to the circuit board reveals character under pressure, earning the endurance at closure with felt cost in the tense adjustments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds density through sensory patterns to a Resonant Reconfiguration in the successful coupling and smiling exhale, with conceptual cost in reweighted perception; orientation anchors early in the mist-coated depot, but some elisions mildly obscure causal links without breaking closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The mist-coated rail depot and water bowls vividly constrain choices, with fog scrambling landmarks and refraction guiding tactics; the environment charges the final image of settled wheels, mirroring internal calm.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of decoding feedback in fog escalates with thickening mist, forcing a deepening via more bowls and midair patch; under Textural lens, pressure coheres but lacks a sharper trade-off, with cost felt yet not fully narrowing options at peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of sightless oversight through harmony with elements emerges organically from refraction rituals and drone guidance, offering resonant ambiguity in perception's complexity; the final smiling image reweights the premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Consistent third-person POV with poetic texture and perceptual bias toward sounds and vibrations; minimal dialogue carries subtext effectively, as in the artisan's command to the drone, with rhythmic control heightening pressure without obscurity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose features high density with purposeful metaphors like "beads slid along a string," advancing atmosphere and momentum; some stacked figuratives in peak beats risk muddle but pay off in textural buildup, with zero loops and clear propulsion to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of blindness, tech drones, and water refraction transforms familiar artisan tropes into a non-obvious perceptual harmony; risk in lyric density heightens stakes, feeling inevitable in the charged final smile.</comment>
