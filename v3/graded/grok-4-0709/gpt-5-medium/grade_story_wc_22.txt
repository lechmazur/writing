<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The coachman's motivation to reclaim the battlefield through patient fertilization is clear and rooted in traits like his knowledge of dead languages and bird calls, intensifying through micro-choices like cracking pods and pulling bayonets; interiority is concrete and embodied, with emotions like quiet apology shown in actions rather than labels. However, internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses in key moments, trending toward meditative endurance without sharp friction. The final renunciation of conquest for listening earns stasis with felt cost in the treaty's tightening.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through patterned images and motifs like seeds and birds, with orientation anchored early in the harbor and jetty; closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration via Conceptual Repricing, reweighting the battlefield into a garden with conceptual cost in submerged concord. Cadence shifts meaningfully at the ending, with the jetty crossing as mercy, though linkage feels more poetic than tightly causal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting anchors vividly in the blooming jetty and battlefield, with sensory details like salt-slick boards and purple sheen filtered through the coachman's bias; the environment constrains choices, as the jetty's cracks and shell holes pressure fertilization tactics and charge the final lattice image with shelter. Micro-setting of pods and ash integrates into action, evolving causally to mirror internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of maintaining submerged concord signals early and deepens through accumulative pressure of planting acts, with one meaningful tightening as he pulls bayonets and trains vines, narrowing options toward quiet holding; cost is felt conceptually in the treaty's tightening, though escalation reads more as textural density than agency-driven turns under the lens. Coincidence in bird calls complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of reconciliation between brine memory and seed breath emerges organically from images like pods and dead languages, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in growth as apology; the final image of the glowing jetty offers a resonant, non-literal repricing of conquest into listening without stated moral. Subtext in silences and bird exchanges enriches complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable and modest, with perceptual signature biased toward auditory cues like bird calls and tide breath; voice texture is distinct in rhythmic, poetic syntax that modulates with dusk's thinning sky, teaching patterned elision early for legibility. No dialogue present, so policy skips those bullets; elision pays off in closure's charged poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with vivid, purposeful metaphors like "narrow vastness" advancing atmosphere and theme without loops or scaffold; rhythm varies naturally, accelerating in planting beats with strong verbs, though occasional stacked figuratives in high-pressure moments risk muddle but remain coherent. No artifacts obscure closure; final line resolves by recharging motifs with propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of coachman archetype with dead languages and bird-scouted fertilization transforms familiar post-battle tropes into a fresh angle on submerged concord; risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes through bold imagery like bayonet lattice, feeling inevitable in hindsight without gimmickry. Emotional specificity in patience as craft avoids generics.</comment>
