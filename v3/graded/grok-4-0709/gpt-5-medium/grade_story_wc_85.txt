<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The protagonist's guilt and contradictory impulses are embodied through concrete actions like kneeling in the surf and confessing forgeries, culminating in an earned renunciation with visible cost in tempered regret; Mara's presence as a crucible forces status shifts, though her interiority is limited to dialogue and observation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned imagery and revelations to a Resonant Reconfiguration in the beach search and archive burning, with conceptual cost legible in the final belief image; orientation anchors early on the terrace, but minor elision in backstory reflection slightly delays full causality without harming closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The cobalt terrace and forgotten beach constrain choices and charge the final image, with sensory details like salt-stained watch hand and driftwood carvings mirroring internal regret; the environment evolves causally, pressuring the revelation without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of uncovering withheld truth tightens through the beach search, forcing a deepening that reweights options with felt cost in regret; under the textural lens, cadence shifts at the plank discovery escalate pressure coherently, though coincidence in findings complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of forged memory versus truthful inheritance emerges organically through recurring images like the watch hand and planks, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer at the ending that reweights the premise without moralizing; subtext in silences and gestures adds complexity, avoiding tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person voice maintains distinct perceptual signature through poetic, sea-infused diction and rhythm that heightens under pressure; purposeful elision in reflections is taught early and pays off at closure, with sparse dialogue carrying subtext and indirection effectively.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with vivid metaphors like "sea breathing like a tired archivist," but occasional paraphrase loops (e.g., repeated "hush" variations) and mixed vehicles in peak beats slightly dull momentum without obscuring closure; syntactic variety supports rhythm, though some overwriting in reflective blocks adds minor scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Original synthesis of black market genealogy with poetic sea motifs transforms familiar truth-revelation tropes through specific details like driftwood carvings, heightening stakes organically; risk in lyric compression pays off without gimmickry, feeling inevitable at the watch hand reprise.</comment>
