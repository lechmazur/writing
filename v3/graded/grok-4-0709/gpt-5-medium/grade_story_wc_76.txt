<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to reverse fate is clear and intensifies through embodied regret and micro-choices, like offering blood, revealing contradictory impulses in the climax; interiority is concrete, with emotions layered contradictorily without therapy-speak. The keeper's presence as a crucible forces the final renunciation with felt cost, though secondary pressure from her is understated. Flaws complicate choices authentically, leading to earned stasis in choosing her over the door.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned images of reversal and hunger to a resonant reconfiguration in the final choice, with orientation anchored early in the lighthouse arrival. Closure lands as Earned Stasis with visible cost in foreclosing the timelines, shaped by the yoyo's persistent constraint. One meaningful deepening suffices, though causality feels more textural than strict linkage.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The lighthouse and rocky island constrain choices vividly, with tidal stains and spiral stairs mirroring the yoyo's path and charging the final image of the breathing ocean. Sensory details are selective and POV-biased, evolving causally with the radiance climbing walls like fever. Environment pressures the climax by embodying fate's design, meeting the 9+ test through tactical constraint in the chamber.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of stepping beyond fate tightens through one meaningful deepening when the yoyo reveals timelines, forcing stance crystallization under textural pressure with legible cost in the keeper's potential death. Agency drives the refusal, foreclosing the door with felt exhilaration's thinness. Coincidence in the stone's response complicates but doesn't resolve, aligning with the lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of defying fate through reversal emerges organically from images like the counterclockwise gears and hunger stone, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer via the yoyo's climb snuffing threads. Subtext in silence and implication enriches ambiguity without confusion, eliciting emotional aftereffect in choosing the tide. Avoids moralizing, embracing complexity in the protagonist's flawed wish.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person voice is distinct and rhythmic, with perceptual signature in brass-scented regrets and backward script; syntax modulates poetically under pressure without obscuring clarity. Purposeful elision in timelines is taught and paid off at closure. Minimal dialogue feels natural and subtextual, like the keeper's scar and lantern offer, advancing the stake.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with high information in metaphors like "barnacles on my ribs," but occasional overwriting in peak beats, such as stacked radiance descriptions, muddles without payoff, triggering a -0.4 deduction. Rhythm varies naturally, and sentences advance atmosphere, though some paraphrase loops in the chamber scene dull momentum slightly. No major artifacts touch closure, maintaining clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of clockmaking with a backward yoyo puzzle transforms fate tropes through specific, inevitable reversals, heightening stakes in the timeline visions without gimmickry. Risk in lyric density pays off in the charged refusal, feeling organic and memorable. Avoids derivatives, committing to its premise with bold ingenuity.</comment>
