<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The gardener's motivation to uncover hidden intentions is clear and rooted in his tenderly organized traits, intensifying through micro-choices like untangling knots with kindness, revealing internal contradictions in his blithe yet shadowed demeanor. Interiority is embodied in moments like his palm nicked by wire, showing emotions as contradictory without therapy-speak. The final softening into respect earns a meaningful change with felt cost, though the single-POV limits relationship crucibles.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned echoes and images to a Conceptual Repricing closure where the gardener reweights the widow's faithfulness with undeniable conceptual cost, evident in marking the grave and planting poppies. Orientation anchors early in the cobalt silo under stars after the clock runs down, with no disorientation debt. Causality holds via motivated actions like climbing the ladder, though some elliptical echoes feel more textural than strictly causal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The cobalt silo and lunar gray cemetery are vividly specific, with sensory details like velvet hush and asters' stubborn color filtered through the gardener's bias, constraining choices such as pressing the case to earth. Atmosphere of velveteen gloom tensions the blithe tone purposefully, charging the final image of the settling tapestry. Micro-setting like the ladder's ribs and frayed threads integrates into action, evolving causally without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of discovering intentions tightens through a meaningful deepening as threads reveal the missing grave, narrowing options under the Accumulative lens via pattern breaks in knots and frays. Agency in untangling and following the map forecloses paths with felt emotional cost in the softened mask, though coincidence in echoes complicates without resolving. Stakes feel visceral in the burlap sack discovery, but internal-external weave is optional and lightly present.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of hidden intentions and dual truths emerges organically from images like frayed threads and uncharted echoes, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer as the gardener honors both living and departure without moralizing. Subtext in gestures like tapping the case and apologizing to asters invites reflection on faithfulness's complexity. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality through concrete particulars, though some ambiguity lingers purposefully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable with a distinct perceptual signature in selective noticing of threads and echoes, modulated by patterned diction like "monarchic sigh" that teaches its lyric compression early. Narrative stance is consistent, with syntax and rhythm reflecting the focalizer's blithe yet shadowed state under pressure. No dialogue present, so policy skips those bullets; elision in echoes pays off at closure without obscurity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose features high information density with vivid, purposeful metaphors like "velvet unwinding" advancing atmosphere and momentum, varying rhythm naturally without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated in peak beats like untangling knots, though occasional density borders on overwriting without harming clarity. Final line resolves by recharging motifs like the untangled story, with clean grammar and propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes cemetery mystery with threaded codes in a fresh, non-obvious way, transforming tropes like hidden graves through specific details like the chess clock and sovereign case. Originality shines in the bold risk of lyric echoes heightening stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in the widow's dual truths. Emotional specificity avoids generics, though some archetypal gardener elements limit peak ingenuity.</comment>
