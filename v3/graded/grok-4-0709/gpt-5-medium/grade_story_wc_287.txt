<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The protagonist's wistfully pragmatic motivation is concretely embodied through actions like saving cracked pots and relighting the lighthouse, with interior contradictions shown in the tension between clinging to the past and choosing to reflect light forward; this earns the final renunciation of delay with visible emotional cost in the harbor's relief and the child's pointing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned images and reflections toward a Charged Poise closure where relighting the lighthouse reconfigures meaning with conceptual cost; orientation anchors early in the fire escape and harbor, with causality holding via motivated ellipses like the petal's fall signaling action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The luminous harbor and fire escape settings constrain choices, with the moonlit waves and iron railings pressuring the protagonist's rowing and climbing; recurring objects like the bitting gauge tooth charge the final image by enabling the lock's opening, mirroring internal thawing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of honoring legacies escalates through textural deepening, with the lock-picking tightening options and forcing a trade-off of grief for action; cost is legible in the heart's "deciding not to leave me" and the harbor's flinch, though one more explicit foreclosure could sharpen it further.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of protected vulnerability emerges organically through images like the flame sheltered by palm and the lantern's glass, culminating in a resonant final image that reweights mending over first tries without moralizing; subtext in silences and implications enriches complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature in poetic, selective noticing like "neon sighs" and "quivering hush," maintaining rhythmic control under pressure; no dialogue, but elisions are patterned and paid off at closure without obscurity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied syntax and rhythm, free of loops or artifacts; metaphors like the harbor as "sleeping lung" advance atmosphere and character without muddle, and the final line recharges motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of gardening and lock-picking as metaphors for thawing grief transforms familiar loss tropes through specific details like the bitting gauge tooth, with risk in lyric compression heightening stakes organically.</comment>
