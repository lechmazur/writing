<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation to listen and stitch rumors is clear and intensifies through poetic interiority, with contradictory impulses shown in disguising wisdom as foolishness, leading to the earned stasis of carrying the rumor with blame as cost. The keeper provides secondary pressure, forcing micro-choices like asking for water, though emotions feel more conceptual than embodied. Flaws complicate choices authentically, as in recognizing masks, but interiority occasionally veers into abstract phrasing without strong physical contradiction under stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through layered images and patterns like stitching pauses, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where the narrator tucks the embroidery and accepts blame, with conceptual cost legible in the final sleep setup. Orientation anchors early with arrival at the cobalt observatory in autumn. Causality holds via textural density shifts, though some elisions feel more poetic than motivated; the whisper hardening into speech marks a meaningful cadence shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The cobalt observatory in autumn is vividly specific, with sensory details like echoed silence and brass rails filtered through the narrator's bias, subtly mirroring internal listening; the dome and desk constrain choices, charging the final candle by the window. Atmosphere supports the conspiratorial tone without overt symbolism. Micro-setting like the eternal candle evolves causally, affecting the room's exhale and whisper.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of unraveling the conspiracy before the coup tightens through stitching and listening, with a meaningful deepening when the whisper reveals falsified charts, narrowing options and forcing the stance of carrying the rumor; cost is felt in anticipated blame. Pressure coheres texturally, with agency in renunciation via the fool's role. Coincidence in whispers complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of truth disguised as foolishness emerges organically from stitching rumors and jester masks, culminating in a resonant final image of the candle watching that reweights listening without moralizing. Subtext in silences and whispers invites reflection on conspiracies. Emotional aftereffect lingers through complexity, avoiding tidy morals.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature in poetic, pattern-taught elisions like "rumor is a wandering star," holding under pressure without head-hopping; voice modulates rhythmically, with purposeful compression paying off in the whisper's speech. Minimal dialogue feels natural and subtextual, as in the keeper's coup remark. Diction fits the embroiderer's idiosyncratic lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied syntax and rhythm accelerating in moments like the cloth trembling, free of loops or scaffold; metaphors like "dust made constellations" are coherent and multi-job, enhancing atmosphere without muddle. Clarity holds in peak beats, with strong verbs and specific nouns; final line recharges the candle motif effectively. No artifacts obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original synthesis of embroidery as conspiracy-unraveling feels inevitable, transforming tropes like jesters and stars through specific details like midnight silk and starwash; risk in poetic structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Fresh angle on listening avoids generics, with authenticity in the fool's blame. No close echoes of famous scenes.</comment>
