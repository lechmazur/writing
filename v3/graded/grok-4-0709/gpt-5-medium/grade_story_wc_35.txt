<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The chef's motivation to transform rough memories is clear and intensifies through embodied tastes like "borrowed thunder" and "rust," revealing contradictory impulses in not wanting to be a savior yet proceeding; the keeper's remorse adds relational pressure, but interiority occasionally veers into abstract phrasing without sharper embodiment under stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through patterned imagery like puddles and coral leading to RR closure where the meal subsumes remorse with felt emotional cost; orientation anchors early in the fortress after rain, but some elisions feel more poetic than taught, slightly softening causality at the pavilion touch.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The desert fortress after rain is vividly specific with sensory details like "wet stone and singed cumin," constraining choices through puddle maps and the icebound pavilion that charges the final image of vanishing puddles; micro-setting of the coral directly shapes the climax without ornamental excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of subsuming remorse escalates texturally through emotional contagion and the pavilion's touch, tightening to a deepening where cooking transforms it with visible cost in the keeper's steadied posture; one meaningful cadence shift suffices, but pressure occasionally diffuses in metaphors rather than narrowing options sharply.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of rendering remorse bearable emerges organically from images like sandpapered memories and the broth carrying silt, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer where the memory is subsumed without erasure; subtext in the filament's touch and final salt rings adds complexity without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person voice maintains distinct perceptual signature through taste-based perceptions like "salt note that made my jaw ache," with rhythmic control in poetic syntax that heightens pressure; dialogue is sparse but natural, and elisions are taught early via puddle readings, paying off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with vivid metaphors like "puddles stitched the courtyard like mirrors without frames," varying rhythm purposefully; minor scaffold in repetitive image echoes (e.g., salt and brittleness) doesn't obscure closure, and information density advances atmosphere without loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of tasting memories with desert coral remorse feels inevitable, transforming tropes through specific risks like contagious emotion that heighten stakes; the pavilion's archive premise offers fresh ingenuity without gimmickry, charging the closure with non-obvious emotional truth.</comment>
