<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation to uncover deleted files is clear and intensifies through discoveries, culminating in a high-stakes choice to post Aida's files, earning the decisive change with visible job risk as cost. Interiority is concrete and embodied, showing contradictory impulses like duty versus justice in the moment of lying to the access bot. The single-POV focus reveals character through micro-choices under pressure, such as following the breadcrumb trail despite team dismissal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the story builds through patterned discoveries and recurring numbers, leading to a resonant reconfiguration in the ending where the narrator posts the files and receives a response, reweighting absence into presence with felt cost of job risk. Orientation anchors who (narrator as memory keeper) and where (Remnant archive) by the first sentence, with no disorientation debt. Closure lands on-page as a decisive change, though the path relies on elisions that are taught early via metaphors and paid off in the Sink revelation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The social network archive setting is vividly specific, with sensory details like cold air smelling of old servers constraining choices, such as the ritual sign-in to the Sink that pressures the narrator's tactics. Atmosphere of sensed absence mirrors internal stakes, evolving causally as the vault's silence shapes the missing person motif. A recurring object like the mission patch charges the final image, constraining the closure by mapping numbers and guiding the decision to reroute memories.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of restoring voice versus maintaining policy hush tightens through a meaningful deepening when entering the Sink, narrowing options and raising the cost of job loss, legible in the choice to post despite risks. Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, pattern breaks like recurring numbers escalate pressure, forcing stance crystallization in the climax. The cost is unmistakable on-page in the final posting and response, driven by protagonist agency without coincidence resolving it.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of memory's persistence amid erasure emerges organically through images like forgotten songs and the mission patch, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer in the ending's "Still here, still counting" that reweights prior absences without moralizing. Subtext in silences and implications, such as the Sink as hiding place, invites reflection on digital grief. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality, arising from concrete particulars like the warm coat metaphor.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The first-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature in poetic, metaphor-rich texture, modulating rhythm under pressure like the tide-like waveform without obscuring clarity. Patterned elision in lyric mode is taught early through archive metaphors and paid off at closure, with no head-hopping or unwarranted certainty. Prose rhythm reflects the focalizer's attentive mind, heightening immersion in peak moments like the Sink entry.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with high information density, varying rhythm naturally in metaphors like "archivists sweeping a beach at night" that advance atmosphere without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, avoiding muddle in peak beats like the Driftwood audio discovery. No artifacts obscure closure, with concise sentences accelerating momentum toward the final image of rerouting streams.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes digital archiving with grief and disappearance in a non-obvious way, transforming tropes like cold cases through specific details like telemetry breadcrumbs, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, as in the bold choice to lie and post, committing to the vision of memory over policy. Originality shines in the fresh angle on deletion as a hiding place, avoiding derivatives with authentic, singular voice.</comment>
