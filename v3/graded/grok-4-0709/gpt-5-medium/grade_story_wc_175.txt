<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation to honor overlooked histories is clear and intensifies through symbolic actions like building structures, revealing interior contradictions between suspicion of fantasies and attentiveness to hidden truths. Emotions are embodied in gestures such as kneeling to tie the knot, showing contradictory impulses without therapy-speak. The endurance in the final poise forecloses paths with felt conceptual cost, though single-POV limits relational crucibles. The line "I called myself an esoteric realist" anchors traits effectively, but some interiority borders on abstract summary.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned images and elisions toward a Charged Poise closure, with conceptual cost in transience legible in the final waiting. Orientation anchors early in the grotto above clouds during migration, avoiding penalties. Causality is soft but holds via motif accumulation, though lack of a sharper tightening caps high-band entry. The monarch's arrival and blessing provide a meaningful cadence shift, reweighting stakes without decisive physical change.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The verdant grotto above clouds is vividly anchored with sensory details like water tapping and green light, filtered through POV bias and constraining choices like arranging signals. Environment charges the final image of lying on moss, with micro-setting elements like reeds and pollen guiding actions. Tone of blushing stillness mirrors internal state organically. The cave-mouth's cadence subtly mirrors thematic loss, elevating specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake in honoring histories tightens accumulatively when the monarch arrives, deepening via pattern break in signals and heartbeat ferns, with conceptual cost of interruption legible. Pressure coheres situationally from migration urgency, forcing stance crystallization without coincidence resolving. One meaningful deepening suffices, but low external antagonism and abstract stakes limit visceral escalation. The hawk shadow interrupts cadence, narrowing options briefly but not transforming tactics sharply.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of transience and honoring overlooked histories emerges implicitly from images like the moth wing and temporary structures, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in survival's grammar. Subtext in gestures and silences invites reflection, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer via the final poise. Emotional aftereffect arises from particulars without sentimentality. The line "an interrupted cadence can still resolve elsewhere" reweights premise subtly, though some direct statements border on assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in poetic, patterned diction like "blushing stillness," modulating rhythm under pressure without head-hopping. Purposeful compression and elision teach lyric mode early, paying off at closure legibly. Prose texture reflects focalizer's mind, with non-standard grammar voice-motivated and consistent. No dialogue present, so policy skips those bullets; psychic distance shifts intentionally for emotional beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm and syntax purposefully in lines like "the wing trembled, translating breeze into faint semaphore," advancing atmosphere without loops or artifacts. Figurative language is controlled, avoiding muddle in peak moments like the monarch's arrival. Information propels via multi-job sentences; no scaffold or redundancy dulls momentum. Final line resolves by recharging motifs cleanly, though dense metaphors in the opening risk slight overwriting without harming clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original synthesis of esoteric realism with symbolic gestures transforms migration trope into fresh angle on memory and loss, feeling inevitable via particulars like pollen circles. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, committing to premise authentically. Emotional specificity avoids generics, with non-obvious inflections in signals as survival grammar. The moth wing's semaphore offers memorable ingenuity, though familiarity of nature symbols slightly tempers novelty.</comment>
