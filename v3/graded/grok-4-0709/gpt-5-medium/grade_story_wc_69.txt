<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong interiority in Mara's reflection on her past shouting until her throat bled, revealing contradictory impulses between conviction and care that earn the final endurance; students like Rafi and Ola show embodied emotions through tone and gestures, but they border on types with smoke and tremble as somewhat stock traits; the rosette-offering moment effectively reveals hierarchy of values with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with pattern of building harmony through shards of rehearsal and performance, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where silence lands like a bird, reweighting unlearning hatred with felt cost; orientation anchors early in the autumn library; one meaningful deepening suffices, though causality is more textural than strict linkage.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, purposeful sensory details like curtains as patient throats and shelves breathing through spines charge the atmosphere and constrain choices in the velvet library; the setting mirrors internal unlearning with dust and memory exhaling, directly charging the final image of carrying stillness home; autumn's hush integrates tone without cliché overload.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of braiding voices signaled early, with meaningful deepening as voices share a sky and the rosette slips, forcing a trade-off in offering safe passage; pressure accumulates texturally to crystallize stance at performance, with visible cost in unclenching fists; lacks a sharper reversal, but lens allows one intensification.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of preserving vanishing arts emerges organically from the rosette's inheritance and choir's new chorus, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in unfinished chances; subtext in gestures like catching the rosette reweights the premise without statement; final image of the rosette warming in rows offers resonant, non-literal answer to harmony across hatred.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable first-person POV with distinct perceptual signature in poetic noticing, like warmth migrating through carved petals; rhythmic control modulates with pressure, compressing in rehearsals and breathing at rests; no dialogue present, so those aspects ignored; purposeful compression teaches pattern early and pays off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density with sentences advancing atmosphere through images like fist unclenching, but some overwriting in mixed metaphors (e.g., taps coinciding after suspicion in twos and hope in threes) muddles peak beats; rhythm varies naturally, though occasional template cadence in listings like "Rafi carried smoke... Ola had a tremble" drags momentum slightly; no major loops, but figurative excess touches closure without fully obscuring it.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of reconciliation through musical subtraction and the rosette as listening compass transforms familiar trope of divided youth; risk in lyric mosaic heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry; the unlearning hatred frame offers non-obvious angle, feeling inevitable in the performance's bridge.</comment>
