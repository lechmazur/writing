<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to reimagine the civilization is clear and rooted in poetic traits, intensifying through choices like the mirror-covering ritual that compel higher-stakes public readings. Interiority is concrete and embodied, as when pressing the shard to the temple translates breaths into words, revealing contradictory impulses of hunger and idealism without stock epiphanies. The relationship with Ledger acts as a crucible, forcing choices that alter their dynamic by the council adjudication. Flaws like the defunct revolution complicate decisions, earning the stasis with felt sorrow at the shard's cracking.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned elisions of time veils and storms, leading to a Conceptual Repricing closure where the archive revision reweights the civilization's meaning with conceptual cost in the protagonist's sorrow-shone failure. Orientation anchors early in the baroque asteroid and visible time, serving the lyric pattern without disorientation debt. Causality holds via motivated reflections that tilt present stances, like childhood rituals enabling the shard's song. The final image of the cracked shard provides resonant reconfiguration with undeniable pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid setting is vivid and purposeful, with veils of years and time-squalls constraining choices like shrouding mirrors to enable the shard's song. Sensory details are selective and POV-biased, as in gilt dust spinning in drafts, mirroring internal longing without overt symbolism. The environment charges the final image, where time shines around cornices and the shard cracks in burnished sorrow. Spatial coherence tracks through salons, colonnades, and council hall, evolving causally with storms.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of proving the civilization's solidarity escalates texturally through pattern breaks like the shard's vibration and public readings, deepening to force stance crystallization at the council with visible cost in muffled laughter and sorrow. One meaningful tightening suffices, as the storm-admitted years narrow options, driving agency in ritual and recitation without coincidence resolving. Pressure coheres under the lens, interweaving internal longing with external dispute. Moral calculus sharpens in competing truths, with the revision foreclosing Ledger's certainty.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of ornament as solidarity emerges organically from images like the shard's etchings and pooled crafts, resisting tidy morals through ambiguity in the failed revolution's endurance. Subtext operates in silences like covered mirrors sighing and faces loosening, inviting reflection on ideology without confusion. The final image of the cracked shard offers a resonant, non-literal answer to reimagining, reweighting prior longing with sorrow's cost. Emotional honesty avoids sentimentality, eliciting aftereffect through particulars like "we made, we made."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable and apt, with perceptual signature in poetic noticing like "gilt dust spinning" biased by revolutionary longing. Prose texture is distinct, with rhythmic control in patterned diction like breath marks and scansion, teaching lyric compression early and paying off at closure without elision issues. Narrative certainty matches knowledge bounds, avoiding withholding for suspense. Under stress, syntax breathes purposefully, heightening intensity in council hum without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, each sentence advancing atmosphere and theme through images like "minutes rained" without loops or scaffold. Rhythm varies naturally, accelerating in storm sequences and breathing in reflections, with syntactic variety supporting emphasis. Figurative language is controlled and coherent, avoiding muddle in peak beats like the council translation. Zero artifacts obscure closure, propelling to the resonant cracking with clear propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The premise of visible time on a baroque asteroid offers fresh synthesis, transforming archaeological tropes through poetic rituals and shard songs that feel inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes, committing to implications like mirror superstitions enabling truth without gimmickry. Emotional specificity in burnished sorrow personalizes the arc, avoiding generics. A non-obvious inflection in the shard's cracking reconfigures the revolution's futility boldly.</comment>
