<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to recover deleted memories of his sister is clear and intensifies through embodied actions like exhuming the box, revealing contradictory impulses in his grief and determination; interiority is concrete, with emotions like the tug of gravity on bones showing under pressure. However, the sister's traits feel summarized rather than dramatized in scene, slightly limiting depth. The final choice to seal the memory earns a meaningful renunciation with felt emotional cost, foreclosing unchecked loss.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural, with patterned imagery building to a resonant reconfiguration in the final lantern lighting, where understanding "what my work really keeps" reweights the stake of loss with conceptual cost. Orientation anchors early in the harbor after the beaching, and causality holds through motif accrual without breaks. The ending's charged poise crystallizes options for carrying memories home, with the cost of fluctuating gravity felt in the protagonist's steps.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The harbor, pier, and salt chamber are vividly specific, with sensory details like "gleaming silence" and "salt and old paper" filtered through POV bias, constraining choices like navigating gravity pockets. The whale's ribcage charges the final image, mirroring internal reconfiguration. Micro-settings like the tin and glass scroll evolve causally, heightening atmosphere without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of recovering deleted memories tightens through the Accumulative/Textural lens via deepening imagery, culminating in the corridor discovery that narrows options and forces endurance with emotional cost. Pressure coheres as gravity fluctuations complicate tactics, like the ground eating steps, leading to stance crystallization. One meaningful deepening suffices, but coincidence in finding the box slightly undercuts agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of preserving memories amid chaotic change emerges organically from motifs like wildflowers regaining scent and salt archiving shapes, culminating in a resonant final image that reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext in silences and implications, like gulls arguing syllables, invites reflection on loss's gravity. The ending offers a non-literal answer to where memories go, embracing ambiguity with emotional honesty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in metaphorical noticing, like gravity as "tide with private instructions," and rhythmic control heightens pressure without obscurity. Patterned elision in lyric mode is taught early and pays off at closure. Dialogue with the chemist feels natural, subtextual, and advances the quest; no head-hopping or register mismatch.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in metaphors like "lantern flame held still" that advance atmosphere and character without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, avoiding muddle in peak beats like exhuming the box. Zero artifacts obscure clarity, with strong verbs and specific details propelling to the resonant close.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of beached whale as gravity seed with memory archiving in salt transforms familiar loss tropes into a fresh, surreal angle, feeling inevitable through motifs like fluctuating gravity. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, committing to the premise's implications. The non-obvious reconfiguration at the end elevates ingenuity.</comment>
