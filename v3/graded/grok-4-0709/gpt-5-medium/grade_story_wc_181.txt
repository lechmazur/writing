<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The curator's motivation to pursue forbidden knowledge is clear and intensifies through disquiet, compelling the choice to eat the fruit with embodied contradictions like shaking hands and brightened fog. Interiority is concrete and particular, with emotions layered via self-deception rooted in lineage, avoiding stock phrasing. The final endurance accepts the orchard's claim with felt cost, foreclosing isolation, as seen in the cameo's burning and unfinished eyes. Minor slip in aunt's vanishing feeling summarized rather than fully embodied, but it doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned elisions of pages, fruits, and whispers, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing where the curator inherits nonlinearly with conceptual cost of being archived like a question. Orientation anchors early in the astral orchard on the asteroid, with deliberate disorientation in the mirror paying off at closure. One meaningful deepening tightens via the tree's rule, leading to resonant reconfiguration in the final smile and gleaming pod. Strong hold of lens without ambiguity, though midpoint could teach pattern more explicitly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The astral orchard on a lonely asteroid is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like pulsing fruits and tide-like inhales filtered through the curator's bewildered bias, constraining choices like retreating to pods for epiphanies. Environment charges the final image, as the grove closes like covers and the pod invites rethinking, reweighting the between. Spatial choreography tracks coherently from pod to grove, with roots and branches mirroring nonlinear inheritance. Exceptional integration without static repetition, elevating closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of pursuing forbidden knowledge signals early and deepens via the tree's lineage rule, narrowing options to press the cameo with visible cost of burning warmth and unfinished face. Under Accumulative/Textural lens, pattern break in the flood of scenes reweights stakes, forcing stance crystallization without coincidence resolving. Agency in choosing the dullest fruit drives escalation, with moral calculus between complicity and inquiry. Cost is unmistakable in the orchard claiming him, though one more tightening could heighten pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of nonlinear inheritance emerges organically from images like pulsing fruits and rippling pages, embracing complexity without tidy morals, as the curator accepts being rewritten with lingering ambiguity in uncarved eyes. Subtext in silences and implications, like the aunt's wordless instruction, invites reflection on inquiry and legacy. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer by curating the between, reweighting prior material. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality through honest bewilderment.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with controlled focalization, perceptual signature selective via curator's bias toward whispers and histories, with rhythmic prose modulating like tides under pressure. Purposeful compression in mirror visions teaches pattern early, paying off at closure without obscurity. No dialogue, so policy skips those bullets; free indirect style clean, with syntax reflecting inquiring mind. Distinct texture in word choice like "brightened disquiet" holds without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, sentences advancing atmosphere and character via vivid images like "lantern raised within fog," varying rhythm naturally without loops or scaffold. No artifacts in peak beats; metaphors coherent and purposeful, like orchard as book written by weather, propelling to closure. Clarity in sequence and grammar, with final line recharging motifs effectively. Zero redundancy, though one simile chain in grove could trim slightly without harming.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of astral orchard with nonlinear histories transforms archival tropes through specific details like hungry objects and bathroom epiphanies, feeling inevitable in the cameo's ticking. Risk in surreal mosaic heightens stakes without gimmickry, committing to premise of fruits holding perspectives. Non-obvious angle on inheritance avoids generics, with emotional specificity in disquiet. Strong authenticity, though premise echoes speculative fiction without full subversion.</comment>
