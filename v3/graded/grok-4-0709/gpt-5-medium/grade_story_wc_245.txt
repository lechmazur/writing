<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to navigate emotional depths is clear and intensifies through embodied sensations, with traits like absorbing languages through skin driving micro-choices like brushing lichens for vowels. Interiority is concrete and particular, showing contradictory impulses in refusing to erase grief while mapping it, culminating in an earned stasis with felt cost in the unfolding sorrow. Strength lies in the specific memory of the mother's rhythms anchoring the trait's origin, avoiding stock phrasing. Minor slip in occasional abstract labels like "quiet blaze" slightly dilutes embodiment but doesn't harm closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through layered images and sensory patterns toward a resonant reconfiguration, with the final realization reweighting grief as a navigable map with conceptual cost in accepting its radius. Orientation anchors early with the protagonist in the ultrasonic forest, and causality holds via textural escalations like the ring's humming guiding to the stillpoint. Closure lands on-page as Charged Poise in "the map is inside me, not ink but marrow," with undeniable pressure from sorrow's unfolding chart. Strength in the persistent ring constraint shaping tactics without contradiction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The ultrasonic forest is vividly specific, with sensory details like bark syllables and ultrasound striking the ring filtered through the blind POV's tactile bias, constraining choices like dowsing and charging the final image of carrying the stillpoint. Atmosphere builds a tonal vault of glass strings, mirroring internal grief without overt symbolism. Micro-setting of the ring and earth as tools evolves causally, affecting action like kneeling to touch the language flood. Strength in the fern writing on the wrist as a purposeful, integrated detail that guides without stalling.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of navigating emotional depths signals early and deepens through textural accumulation, with one meaningful cadence shift in the clearing where the ring cools, forcing a stance crystallization with felt cost in sorrow's unfolding. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, narrowing options via the musical notes trail without coincidence resolving. Agency in dowsing and tracing lines forecloses escape, reweighting grief as axis. Strength in the ethical calculus at "not to erase my grief," but minor abstraction in stakes slightly softens visceral feel at peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of consenting to grief's pivot emerges organically from images like the stillpoint as axis and the map growing round, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in sorrow unfolding without vanishing. Subtext in silences and implications, like the fern's message, invites reflection on loss's native coast. Final image offers resonant, non-literal answer by repricing grief as marrow-deep without statement. Strength in emotional honesty avoiding sentimentality, tied to the protagonist's arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable and apt, with perceptual signature in tactile, sonic bias fitting the blind mapmaker, modulating rhythm from flowing sentences in exploration to clipped at the cooling ring. Prose texture distinct in poetic syntax and word choice like "bark syllables," teaching patterned elision early and paying off at closure without opacity. No dialogue, so policy skips those bullets; no head-hopping or register drift. Strength in prose as character, with syntax reflecting absorptive interiority under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, sentences advancing atmosphere and character through vivid images like "leaves speak above hearing, but touch translates their storms," varying rhythm naturally without loops. Figurative language integrates without muddle, though occasional dense metaphors in peak beats like the clearing risk slight overwriting, but clarity holds at closure. No artifacts or redundancies obscure cause/effect; strong verbs and specifics propel momentum. Strength in the final line's resonant image, but minor scaffold in one paraphrase loop around grief mapping deducts lightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Originality shines in synthesizing blindness with mapmaking and tactile language absorption, transforming tropes of grief journeys through non-obvious specifics like ultrasound forests and dowsing emotions, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyric, accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, committing to premise's implications. Fresh inflection in repricing sorrow as a planet-sized ache, avoiding generics. Strength in the bold, singular vision of "the ring stops humming," elevating coherence.</comment>
