<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation as a nostalgic quay painter is clear and intensifies through embodied reflections, compelling choices like entering the cave and dipping the shell; interiority is concrete, with contradictory impulses shown in his fear and vow-keeping, culminating in an earned renunciation with felt cost of leaving the inner harbor. Strengths include micro-choices under pressure, like drawing the harbor line, revealing values with visible trade-offs. No secondary characters, so relationship bullets ignored; single flaw is occasional stock phrasing in emotions, but it doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through patterned images and cadence shifts, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration in the cave where the protagonist adds a curve and leaves, reweighting his promise with conceptual cost of temporary eternity; orientation anchors early in the studio and harbor. Closure lands on-page with felt cost in backing away, and one meaningful deepening suffices; minor slip is a brief unmotivated ellipsis in the corridor reveal, but it doesn't break causality at the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting vividly integrates the coastal cave network with sensory details like brine and mineral syllables, constraining choices like following the brine smell and charging the final image of the pool's language; the oasis and mirror wall evolve causally, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism. Micro-setting of the shell as object-as-setting enhances specificity; strength is purposeful detail that guides the journey, with no slips in spatial coherence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, dominant stake of keeping the hidden promise tightens through pattern break in the oasis, forcing stance crystallization with felt cost of leaving the inner world; one deepening via the shell dip narrows options effectively. Agency in renunciation forecloses living in the painting; strength is coherent pressure without coincidence resolving, but escalation feels slightly abstract in the voice's arrival, capping at high band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of temporary eternity emerges organically from images like the split mirror and quivering pool, offering a resonant non-literal answer in the final painting that reweights the premise without moralizing; subtext in gestures like dipping the shell deepens complexity. Emotional aftereffect is concrete through the warm shell; strength is ambiguity that lingers, tied to the protagonist's arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in salt ghosts and mineral syllables, rhythmic control heightens pressure in the cave without obscurity; patterned elision in reflections is taught early and pays off at closure. No dialogue, so ignored; strength is prose as character, with syntax reflecting introspective state under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied rhythm, high information in lines like "tidal shards" advancing atmosphere; zero loops or scaffold, but minor figurative muddle in "liquid seams open" slightly obscures the corridor moment without harming closure clarity. Strength is concise imagery doing double work; no artifacts in peak beats allow high band.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Originality shines in synthesizing artist's vow with temporary eternity through specific cave journey, transforming trope of self-promise via non-obvious synthesis like the self-painting tides; risk in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Fresh inflection in the curve addition feels inevitable; no derivative echoes.</comment>
