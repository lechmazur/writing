<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation as a celestial signal interpreter is clear and intensifies through micro-choices like discarding assumptions, revealing contradictory impulses in listening without keeping; interiority is concrete and embodied, as in tasting the seam where silence stitches storm. However, emotions occasionally lean abstract, like prickling gums, without deeper contradiction under stress. The final renunciation of the hush shard earns stasis with felt cost, foreclosing resurrection for placement.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned images and cadence shifts, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where the city plays its prologue backward, reweighting endings with beginnings; orientation anchors early in the abandoned radio tower city during lunar perigee. Closure lands with conceptual cost in honored endings, visible in the matriarch's doorway and grandmother's handle. Minor elision in signal origins doesn't obscure the pattern's payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting of the abandoned radio tower city suspended over a gorge constrains choices, with winds braiding advertisements into prayers and the gorge as an orchestra pit charging the final image; sensory details are vivid and POV-filtered, like cables knitting shadows. Micro-setting elements like the mast and hush shard evolve causally, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism. This environment directly shapes the climax by tilting dishes toward the moon.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake in finding beginnings in endings tightens through a deepening cadence shift when pressing the hush to the mast, narrowing options under lunar perigee pressure; cost is felt in threading the star fragment, foreclosing resurrection for placement. Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, pattern breaks like signals rising as lanterns reweight the stake with goodbye roots. No coincidences resolve; agency drives the reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of honoring endings through beginnings emerges organically from images like the hush shard clarifying echoes and the mast as stylus, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in the city's laughter. Subtext in silences and implications, such as the grandmother's meteor-counting, invites reflection on letting go. The final image of the gorge as orchestra pit offers a resonant, non-literal answer, reweighting the premise without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature in metaphorical noticing, like signals as migrating lanterns; rhythmic control heightens in serenely electric registers without obscuring clarity. Elision is patterned and taught early, paying off in the inward stairway. Dialogue from signals feels natural and subtextual, advancing the thematic pursuit without direct declaration.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied rhythm, as in "signals rose from the gorge like migrating lanterns," advancing atmosphere without loops; metaphors are coherent and purpose-driven, avoiding muddle in peak beats like pressing the hush. Minor scaffold in repetitive electric humming, but information density is high, with lines multitasking character and theme. No artifacts touch closure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes fantasy practicality with radio towers breathing during perigee, transforming tropes through specific details like the hollywood star fragment's burn scars; risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Fresh inflection in the mast as stylus reconfiguring the gorge as record feels inevitable. Authenticity coheres in a singular vision of signals as weathered saints.</comment>
