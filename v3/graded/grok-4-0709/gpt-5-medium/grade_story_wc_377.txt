<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Iri's motivation to preserve wonder is clear and intensifies through her silent gestures and tuning actions, culminating in the earned stasis of guarding the shard with trembling fingers that embody the cost of restrained force. Interiority is concrete and embodied, shown in her patience and vigilance, avoiding stock phrasing. The flaw of seasonally mute feels integral, constraining communication and enabling resonant answers via sculptures.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through layered images and resonances toward a Resonant Reconfiguration in the Keepers' departure with new slowness, reweighting the stake of wonder with conceptual cost in Iri's trembling guardianship. Orientation anchors early with the bluff and Iri's role, avoiding disorientation penalties. Closure lands on-page with felt cost, though the caravan's arrival feels slightly elliptical without a sharper inciting beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The whispering bluff above clouds is vividly specific, with wind and sculptures constraining choices like salting bell lips, and the environment charges the final image of foxes pausing like commas in snow. Sensory details are purposeful and POV-filtered, reflecting Iri's attuned perception. Micro-setting of the iceberg fragment functions as a tool that evolves and affects action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving wonder against archival hardening escalates through the Keepers' approach and Iri's nudge of the shard, deepening via symphonies that force stance crystallization with felt cost in tears and fallen hands. Under Accumulative lens, one meaningful cadence shift suffices, though pressure remains more textural than visceral. Agency in renunciation forecloses their claim with legible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of sound preserving wonder's color against words' scuffing emerges organically from images like the glistening shard and transparent harmonies, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer as the Keepers leave with slowness, reweighting truth without moralizing. Subtext in silence and gestures invites reflection on fear versus delight. Emotional aftereffect lingers through complexity, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third-person POV is stable and close to Iri, with distinct perceptual signature in poetic, image-rich texture that modulates rhythm under pressure, like the bluff's exhale. Prose has rhythmic control with purposeful compression, teaching patterns early for legibility at closure. No dialogue present, so optional bullets ignored; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with vivid metaphors like "frostbitten birds cupped in their chests," varying rhythm naturally without loops or scaffold, though some stacked figuratives in the symphonies beat border on overwriting without harming clarity. Information density is high, advancing atmosphere and theme per sentence. Final line resolves by recharging motifs with Iri holding the place for wonder.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of seasonal muteness, kinetic sculptures, and iceberg shard offers a fresh angle on truth versus wonder, feeling inevitable through poetic ingenuity like the ledger of weather. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, transforming tropes organically. Core premise commits fully, avoiding derivative templates.</comment>
