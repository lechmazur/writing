<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The protagonist's claustrophobia is embodied through the "old tightness rise behind my ribs" and motivates micro-choices like breathing to "invent a larger room," showing contradictory impulses under pressure; motivation to find the key intensifies credibly, culminating in an earned conceptual shift with felt emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, imagery patterns of shifting alleys and organ reverberations build density toward a Conceptual Repricing closure where the mutiny is reframed as hunger, with conceptual cost legible in the final realization; orientation anchors early in the shadowed nexus at night, and one meaningful cadence shift suffices for length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid, POV-filtered details like alleys "shifting like sleepers turning" and the fountain's silt constrain choices and charge the final telescope image, mirroring internal claustrophobia; sensory hierarchy narrows under stress, with environment evolving causally to permit exit.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of uncovering the key amid spatial mutiny tightens through organ-assisted alley realignment, deepening via the compass prick that narrows options with emotional cost in rising tightness; under Accumulative lens, pattern break at the observatory reweights stakes without coincidence resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of wistful rebellion and spatial treaties emerges organically through recurring images like the compass holding maps to promises, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer that the mutiny is hunger, reweighting the premise with conceptual ambiguity and emotional honesty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>First-person POV remains stable with a distinct perceptual signature in metaphorical noticing, like space as "elaborate shrugs"; rhythmic control heightens pressure in peak beats, with patterned elision taught early and paid off at closure without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High information density and propulsion shine in lines like "sound spearing my little geometry," with varied syntax and rhythm accelerating momentum; zero loops or artifacts, and figurative language coheres without muddle, charging the closure image cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of claustrophobic exploration and spatial mutiny transforms familiar lost-artifact tropes through specific, voice-driven ingenuity, like the organ as "stone's own slow lungs"; risk-taking in poetic structure heightens stakes, feeling inevitable at the observatory realization.</comment>
