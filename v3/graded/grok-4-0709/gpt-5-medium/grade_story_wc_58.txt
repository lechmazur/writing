<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to understand the geography of healing is concrete and intensifies through the interaction, compelling the obituary-writing choice with embodied emotion in the salt-and-brass breath return. The woman's secondary pressure reveals her grief's contradictions, forcing a micro-choice in sharing names like winds. Internal conflict shows in the man's raw hands and horizon-seeking, aligning with traits without stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds density through recurring images like threads and harbors, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration in the woman's irrigating weeping and the thread's looping, with felt emotional cost legible in her shoulders' new slope. Orientation anchors early in the harbor and garden by ~50 words. Closure reweights grief with undeniable pressure, holding the lens without contradiction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The shadowed autumn garden is vivid and purposeful, with quinces bruising fragrant and leaves as coins constraining the intimate encounter and charging the final image of dropping quinces approving the reading. Sensory details filter through POV bias, evolving causally as the fountain and paths support the thread's use. Environment mirrors internal states subtly, like the hush reflecting absence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of explaining living absence tightens through the thread's humming and projection, deepening via the man's confession of seeking breath, reweighting options with cost in the inland sea metaphor. Under Accumulative lens, pattern break in the weeping irrigates rather than breaks, forcing stance crystallization. Agency in projection forecloses unbridged grief with legible emotional price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of navigating grief's geography emerges from images like projected presence and humming threads, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer where absence becomes a breathing space without moralizing. Subtext in silences and veils of weather invites reflection on latitude's cruelty. Ending reweights premise with complexity, avoiding tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in sea-learned methods and salt-threaded breath, modulating rhythm under pressure without head-hopping. Dialogue carries subtext, like names as winds pursuing explanation, distinguishing voices naturally. Patterned poetic diction is taught early and pays off at closure with legible effect.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied rhythm in metaphors like conch to bones and quince drops, free of loops or scaffold; information advances atmosphere and character without redundancy. Figurative language coheres without muddle, even in peak beats like projection across slick stones. Final line recharges motifs with stubborn brilliance.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original premise of obituaries for living synthesizes fresh with poetic ingenuity, transforming grief tropes through thread-measured distances and projected bridges, feeling inevitable in the irrigating weep. Risk in lyric compression heightens emotional stakes without gimmickry. Non-obvious angle on absence avoids derivatives.</comment>
