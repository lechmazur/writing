<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to resist automated imagination is clear and intensifies through micro-choices like inserting the keystone, revealing contradictory impulses of doubt and hope; interiority is concrete and embodied, as in exhaling doubts as moths, avoiding stock phrasing. Flaws like underachievement complicate choices without safety-hedging, leading to an earned stasis in accepting eternal apprenticeship. The final renunciation of the keystone forecloses ownership with visible cost, satisfying the 9+ test for contradictory impulses and earned choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned images and elisions to a resonant reconfiguration at the end, with the keystone's removal repricing failure's value; orientation anchors early in the stairs and spire, avoiding penalties. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing with conceptual cost in refusing ownership, visible in the sky's flickering smile. Persistent constraint of the cracked compass and keystone shapes tactics, though one minor elision in descent feels slightly unmotivated.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The icebound spire setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like cold ringing in teeth constraining choices during mist walking; it charges the final image as the sky closes around its question mark. Micro-setting of the notch and keystone integrates into action, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism. Environment evolves causally, from fog-braided stairs to platform flexing like a sail, satisfying the 9+ test by constraining the climax insertion and repricing the descent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of finding un-automated sacredness tightens through the keystone insertion, deepening via light's condolences and moths, under Accumulative lens; agency in removing the stone crystallizes stance with felt cost of eternal apprenticeship. One meaningful cadence shift reweights the stake, forcing trade-off between ownership and freedom. Escalation driven by protagonist's choices, with unmistakable cost in the hush-gloved hands enabling street work.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of embracing failure as nourishment emerges organically from images like the bowl of cloud and white moths, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in the spire's accommodations; subtext in gestures like tugging the keystone invites reflection on unmarketable whispers. The final image of the sky's satisfied smile offers a resonant, non-literal repricing of underachievement without stated moral, reweighting prior material. Emotional aftereffect arises from particulars, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable and apt, with distinct perceptual signature in poetic noticing like fog as gray rope; rhythmic control heightens pressure in dense, patterned diction without obscuring clarity. Purposeful compression in mist walking teaches elision early, paid off in descent. No dialogue, so policy skips those bullets; prose texture reflects focalizer's mind under stress, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
