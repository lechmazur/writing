<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation as a synesthetic caretaker is clear and intensifies through sensory-driven choices, like pressing the coin to anchor the Star, revealing contradictory impulses in nostalgia and release; the ghost feels somewhat archetypal but applies pressure via shared echoes. Interiority is concrete and embodied, avoiding stock phrasing, with emotions layered in scenes like smelling blue as winter plums. The final endurance forecloses despair with felt emotional cost, earning the Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through layered sensory echoes and wind, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration in the final nostalgia swell and hedges shifting back, with conceptual cost in ongoing letting go; orientation anchors early with locking doors after closing. Closure lands on-page with the ghost's last bow promising return only if finishing letting go together, reweighting the timeline stake. Persistent sensory constraints shape tactics, like following the blue chord.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The mystic orchard and hedge maze are vivid and purposeful, with apples leaning as if listening and boughs creaking like curtains, constraining choices like rearranging paths and charging the final image of pears applauding softly. Sensory details filter through POV bias, evolving causally as the maze allows revelations. Environment mirrors internal nostalgia without overt symbolism, heightening atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of mending the fractured timeline signals early and deepens via echoes intertwining with wind, forcing stance crystallization under Textural lens; one meaningful cadence shift in the crack with chorus confetti narrows options, with felt cost in genteel panic. Pressure coheres but could tighten more viscerally at peak, like when anchoring the Star. Agency in producing echoes earns the reconfiguration, though coincidence complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of nostalgia as a kind, swelling force emerges organically from sensory images and echoes, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in letting go together; subtext in the ghost reaching for nothing lures possibility from despair. The final image of the heart as the sound of home offers a resonant, non-literal repricing of memory's cost. Emotional aftereffect lingers through particulars like silver dust and burgundy rafters.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature via synesthesia, like smelling green cymbals; voice texture in rhythmic, poetic syntax modulates with intensity, teaching patterned elision early. Dialogue is sparse but natural, subtextual, advancing via the ghost's genteel panic. No head-hopping or register drift, with purposeful compression paying off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with vivid metaphors like paint shivering as spilled music, varying rhythm naturally; however, some figurative stacking in peak beats, such as blue becoming a bell amid citrus and brass, risks muddle without fully obscuring clarity. No major loops or artifacts, but occasional synonym churn in sensory descriptions slightly dulls momentum. High information density advances atmosphere, with clean mechanics.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of synesthesia, tarot coin, and stage ghost in a fractured timeline feels inevitable, transforming ghost tropes through sensory choreography and nostalgia's rise; risk in lyric boldness heightens stakes without gimmickry. Core premise offers non-obvious angle on memory and performance, cohering as singular vision. The orchard's lantern fruit as cues inflects originality organically.</comment>
