<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to uncover the withheld truth is clear and intensifies through embodied sensory details, culminating in an earned acceptance that forecloses denial with a felt emotional cost. Interiority is concrete and particular, with contradictory impulses shown in the hesitation and redirection of breathing while mapping the ache. No stock phrasing mars the single-POV focus, and the flaw of youthful impulsiveness complicates the resolution without artificial balance. The line "I do not forgive the child or blame her; I fold her into the chart" exemplifies the hierarchy of values revealed under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned sensory elisions and repetitions, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist accepts and weaves the truth into maps, with conceptual cost legible in the heavy "weight" reframed as routes for survival. Orientation anchors early in the repair bay and dream-murmur timeframe, serving the closure without disorientation debt. Causality holds via rhythmic leaps between universes, with the shard's activation as a key linkage that reweights knowledge. The final redirection outward provides charged poise, crystallizing options with undeniable pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport repair bay is vividly rendered through selective, POV-biased sensory details like ozone and rain smells, with textures and vibrations constraining choices in parallel strands. Setting evolves causally, mirroring internal discovery, and the bay's metal records directly charge the closure by revealing the truth. Micro-details like hanging chains echoing as snakes in other universes heighten atmosphere without stalling momentum. The line "Every surface smelled of ozone and rain" anchors tone and reflects the protagonist's sensory mapping priority early.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, the dominant stake of discovering the withheld truth escalates through a cadence shift in visions, deepening via the self-revelation that narrows options and imposes a felt cost of acceptance. Agency manifests in the protagonist's redirection of breathing and mapping, foreclosing erasure with conceptual price. One meaningful intensification suffices, but the pressure feels slightly diffuse before the climax. The moment "I was the one who pressed REDIRECT" forces stance crystallization with coherent, undeniable cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of weaving truths across worlds emerges organically from sensory mapping and redirections, resisting tidy morals through ambiguity in forgiveness and blame. Subtext in the shard's refractions and mother's silence invites reflection on withheld knowledge's weight without confusion. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal repricing of accident as survival routes. The line "I fold her into the chart" reweights the premise with emotional honesty, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature in sensory biases like smells as doorways, and rhythmic syntax that modulates with emotional intensity. Patterned elision in universe leaps is taught early and pays off at closure without obscurity. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are ignored; prose texture feels singular and voice-motivated. The opening "In the murmur of half-remembered dreams" establishes the lyric compression that holds through peak pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm and syntax to propel momentum, free of loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddle even in peak beats like the revelation. Information advances story and atmosphere simultaneously, with strong verbs and specific details enhancing clarity. No artifacts obscure closure; the final lines achieve resonant cadence. The sentence "The shard warms against my palm, green as planetfall, and I weigh it without flinching" exemplifies propulsion and textural specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise of sensory mapping across parallel universes offers fresh synthesis of sci-fi and lyric introspection, transforming evacuation tropes through rhythmic spontaneity and truth-weaving. Risk-taking in nonlinear, accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable via the shard's evolving role. Emotional complexity avoids generics, with the self-caused redirection as a non-obvious inflection. The concept coheres as a singular vision, elevating beyond familiar archetypes.</comment>
