<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The archivist's motivation to mentor resilience is clear and intensifies through combative tenderness, with embodied emotions like trembling while pacing backwards under pressure; interiority is concrete via specific traits and micro-choices, such as unstoppering the bottle to aid the child. However, the child's resolve feels slightly underdeveloped, relying on poetic implication rather than contradictory impulses in scene. The final endurance forecloses surrender with felt cost, as in the heat in the chest laid bare like a ledger.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned imagery and elisions toward a Resonant Reconfiguration in Earned Stasis, with the council's reluctant faith and the library's stillness reweighting exile's cost; orientation anchors early in the playground swing and library. Closure lands on-page with conceptual cost in the path to rejoining, but some elliptical jumps mildly obscure causal links, as in the sudden child return.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The forgotten library setting constrains choices, supplying resources like stacks and tea leaves that pressure the confrontation; sensory details are vivid and POV-filtered, with dust instructing light and floorboards testing retreats mirroring internal states. The courtyard window and swing evolve causally, charging the final image of night filtering like a verdict.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, the dominant stake of preserving reversible exile escalates through density increase in the council confrontation, with a meaningful deepening when the shadow spills to form a corridor, narrowing options and forcing stance crystallization. Cost is legible in the trembling defense of presence, but coincidence in the child's timely return slightly complicates without fully resolving pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of combative tenderness emerges organically from images like tea leaves and shadowed corridors, resisting tidy morals through ambiguity in exile's pivot; the final image of the swing slowing to listening offers a resonant, non-literal reconfiguration of resilience without stated epiphany. Subtext in silence and gestures deepens complexity, eliciting emotional aftereffect via the child's quiet return.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person voice is distinct with perceptual signature in metaphorical noticing, like steam rising as faint script; rhythmic control heightens pressure in reverse pacing, and patterned elision teaches lyric compression early, paying off at closure. Dialogue is sparse but natural, subtext-driven in the child's reading and council questions; no head-hopping, with consistent psychic distance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere through vivid metaphors like bruise remembering light, without loops or scaffold; syntactic variety supports rhythm, varying with emotional beats. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, but occasional overwriting in peak moments, like ellipses pointing to sorrow, mildly muddles propulsion without harming closure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise of a shard-mirror archivist practicing reversible exile offers fresh synthesis of memory and mentorship, transforming tropes through specific ingenuity in tea-leaf geometry and backward walking; risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in the council's unsettled return path.</comment>
