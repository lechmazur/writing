<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Miren's motivation to preserve wonder is clear and rooted in her traits as a pruner, intensifying through embodied actions like clipping scars and sharing with the child, leading to an earned renunciation of forgetting. Interiority is concrete and particular, shown in her listening to the grove and breathing on the seed, with contradictory impulses in her humble clipping versus creative hunger. The child's arrival applies secondary pressure that alters the relationship crucible, forcing a shared pruning that reveals values with felt cost. However, some phrasing like "sap-stained hands" feels stock, slightly limiting individuality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through patterned images of mist, seeds, and pruning, with causal ellipsis in the seed's glow leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration via planting that reweights memory with conceptual cost in the valley's renewed breath. Orientation anchors early with Miren on the parapet beside the waterfall in a hush of budding hope. Closure lands on-page with the seed weaving worlds, foreclosing forgetfulness via the child's promise and moss cover, though one micro-turn (child's story) feels mildly redundant. Persistent constraint of the heirloom seed shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The verdant parapet beside the waterfall anchors vividly early, with sensory details like mist braiding hair and water clapping that reflect POV bias and urgency, constraining choices like placing the seed in the misted seam. Atmosphere supports theme through radiant hush mirroring wonder, and the micro-setting of mossed stone and boughs charges the final image of planting. Details evolve causally, with the waterfall's syllables patient under blessing, and spatial choreography tracks cleanly from limb to limb. Environment mirrors internal states subtly, like scent of rising bread from cuts, elevating resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving wonder signals early and tightens accumulatively through deepening gestures like clipping weariness and feeding the seed testimonies, narrowing options to planting in the seam with visible cost of forgotten stories repriced. Pressure coheres under Textural lens via pattern breaks in glow shivering and scent release, forcing stance crystallization with the child's help. One meaningful deepening occurs when the child's jar story integrates, weaving internal/external conflicts with ethical calculus between worlds. However, coincidence of child's arrival complicates without fully resolving, slightly softening agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of weaving worlds to preserve wonder emerges organically from images like the seed's glow and pruning stitches, inviting reflection through ambiguity in the non-miracle work without tidy morals. Subtext in gestures like tapping the jar and breathing on the seed builds emotional aftereffect of radiant hush, resisting sentimentality via complexity in tired apples and lonely chairs. Final image of the seed weaving whispers offers resonant, non-literal answer repricing the premise with conceptual cost. Motifs like waterfall patience accrue pressure without tokenism, charging closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person close POV on Miren is stable, with perceptual signature in sap and memory filtering, and purposeful compression in lyric diction like "color of wonder itself" taught early and paid off at closure. Voice texture distinct in rhythmic, poetic syntax modulating with intensity, as in wind-braided mist versus humble clipping. Dialogue is natural, subtextual, and advances plot, with child's whisper pursuing help and Miren's response evading direct fix via teaching breath-holding. No head-hopping or register drift; elision in seed's hunger is pattern-taught and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, sentences advancing atmosphere and character via vivid images like "scent like bread learning to rise," varying rhythm naturally without loops. Figurative language is controlled, consistent in peak beats like seed's pupil shivering, avoiding muddle or register drift. No artifacts obscure closure; opening anchors voice, final line recharges motifs with propulsion. Minor scaffold in one paraphrase loop ("orchard spoke... carried an heirloom") slightly dulls momentum but doesn't touch ending.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Originality shines in synthesizing pruning as weaving worlds, transforming trope of wise guardian through specific details like applewood locket and seed's unnameable color, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Fresh angle on memory and wonder via textural accumulation avoids stock archetypes, with bold lyric risk heightening stakes in radiant hush without gimmickry. Emotional specificity in child's jar story and dawn promise offers non-obvious moral calculus. Proximity check clear; no echoes of famous scenes.</comment>
