<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to understand living houses is clear and rooted in consistent traits as a "creeping normality noticer," intensifying through observations that compel choices like placing the orris shard; interiority is concrete and embodied in actions, such as trembling hands at the beetle tin discovery. Emotions are contradictory and shown under pressure, avoiding stock phrasing, with the final realization earning a credible endurance that forecloses simplistic views with conceptual cost. No second character appears, so relationship bullets are ignored; the single-POV interior contradiction shines in the hushed interactions with houses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned house visits with elisions that deepen the motif of aliveness, leading to a Conceptual Repricing closure in the final realization that reweights houses' vitality with undeniable conceptual cost in the "inadvertent ritual" line. Orientation anchors who (narrator), where (quiet bay), and when (spring, streetlights daydream) by ~50 words, serving the meditative pattern without debt. Causality is motivic rather than linear, with one meaningful deepening sufficient, but lacks a persistent constraint shaping tactics beyond the orris shard.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The quiet bay in spring is vividly specific with sensory details like tide-slurred pebbles and salt lane, filtered through POV bias to mirror internal quest; setting constrains choices, as house interiors pressure discoveries like the beetle tin, charging the final image. Atmosphere supports the hushed, alive tone without overt symbolism; micro-settings like doorframes and banisters evolve causally, guiding action tactilely.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of understanding house aliveness is signaled early but remains abstract, with one textural deepening in the third house that reweights knowledge via the beetle tin, yet pressure feels coherent but low-intensity under Accumulative lens without narrowing options or visible trade-offs. Agency is in attention and renunciation, foreclosing paths with conceptual cost at closure, but no reversal tests commitment; stakes stay visceral only in poetic implication, like the "trembled with the weight" moment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of aliveness through human attention emerges organically from images like displaced objects and breathing houses, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer in the final paragraph that reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext operates in implications of whispers and exhales, inviting reflection via ambiguity in house "confessions"; emotional aftereffect is honest, avoiding sentimentality, with complexity in houses mimicking or guarding stories.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in poetic noticing of gradual shifts, like porch reclines; voice texture is rhythmic and purposeful, with patterned diction like "shard of hush" taught early and paid off at closure. No dialogue present, so ignored; elisions are motivated and legible, with syntax reflecting the focalizer's contemplative state under subtle pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with vivid metaphors like "tide pulled by a small moon" advancing atmosphere without loops or scaffold; rhythm varies naturally, sentences multi-task, but some figurative density in peak beats like the orris warming risks muddle without harming clarity. No artifacts obscure closure; final line recharges motifs effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original synthesis of anthropomorphic houses and perfumer's shard offers a fresh angle on aliveness, transforming tropes through specific details like the beetle tin vow; risk in lyric structure heightens stakes organically, feeling inevitable in the "inadvertent ritual" reconfiguration without gimmickry.</comment>
