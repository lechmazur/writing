<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The coachman's motivation to deliver the promise is clear and intensifies through his patience and use of the yarn needle, revealing embodied emotion in his attentive hush; Wren's contradictory impulses emerge in her quiet laugh and stitching action, earning the final endurance with felt cost of overwriting fear. However, interiority leans poetic rather than concretely contradictory in scene, with emotions more performed than layered irrationally under stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned images like fog and stitching toward a Resonant Reconfiguration in the final unscrolled road, with conceptual cost legible in the warming scars; orientation anchors early in the fog-bound crossing. One meaningful deepening occurs via the mid-river current challenge, reweighting stakes without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The fog-bound river crossing is vividly sensory and purposeful, constraining choices like the ferry crossing and stitching, with details like water slapping the hull mirroring internal patience; the environment charges the final image as fog parts into alleys, evolving causally without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the dominant stake of fulfilling the palimpsest promise escalates through density increase in stitching the map, with one meaningful deepening at the mid-river turn forcing stance crystallization; cost is felt in the conceptual repricing of fear into motion, though coincidence in the ferry steadying slightly complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of distilling complexity into essence emerges organically from stitching and crossing motifs, culminating in a resonant final image that reweights the promise without moralizing; subtext in gestures like touching the sleeve invites reflection on patience amid risk.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable with perceptual signature in the coachman's ambient awareness, modulating rhythm poetically under pressure; dialogue is natural, subtextual, and goal-driven, as in Wren's line about the road being water, with distinct idioms fitting characters.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in metaphors like "water slapped the hull like a dog too tired to fetch," advancing atmosphere without loops; minor figurative muddle in stacked images like "spindrift serenity" slightly dulls propulsion in peak beats, but clarity holds at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The premise transforms familiar crossing tropes through specific poetic synthesis of stitching and palimpsest, feeling inevitable in the charged final motion; risk in lyric compression heightens stakes without gimmickry, though some metaphors echo common nature symbolism.</comment>
