<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mara's motivation as a neutron star researcher applying pulsar logic to flood recovery is clear and intensifies through micro-choices like sweeping and tracing spirals, revealing embodied emotions in her calm pulse amid decay; interiority is concrete and particular, with flaws like habitual preprocessing creating genuine struggle without stock phrasing. The final renunciation of dramatic bias feels earned by prior causality, foreclosing explosive interpretations with a felt cost of ongoing patience. Relationships with neighbors apply subtle pressure, shifting status dynamics as she distributes tasks like constellations.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through patterned images of dust and decay, with orientation anchored early in the storm-damaged greenhouse post-flood; closure lands as Conceptual Repricing where recovery is repriced as rehearsal, with conceptual cost in humility legible in the final notebook entry and dust resettling. One meaningful cadence shift tightens via the spiral tracing and plastic sheet pinning, reweighting stakes without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The greenhouse setting is vivid and purposeful, with shattered panes, dripping ribs, and silt constraining Mara's choices, like kneeling to trace spirals in dust; sensory details are selective, biased through her scientific POV, evolving causally as she pins plastic and neighbors map shorelines. Recurring dust and algae slick mirror internal states subtly, charging the final image of resettled dust without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of stripping needless drama signals early and deepens through one meaningful cadence shift in tracing the spiral and logging decays, narrowing options under Accumulative/Textural lens; pressure coheres via flood's residues forcing stance crystallization in humility, with felt cost in accepting gradual change. Coincidence of rain resuming complicates but doesn't resolve; lacks a sharper reversal, keeping escalation functional but not exceptional.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of embracing gradual change over drama emerges organically from images like dust patterns and pulsar timings, culminating in a resonant final image that reweights the premise without moralizing; subtext in gestures like blowing dust invites reflection on patience, with emotional honesty avoiding sentimentality. The core concept integrates through Mara's experiences, eliciting a lingering ambiguity about recovery's costs.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in scientific metaphors like pulsar glitches filtering reality; prose texture is distinct, rhythmic, and lyric with patterned elision taught early and paid off in closure. Narrative stance modulates with intensity, diction matches Mara's lexicon without register drift; brief dialogue with neighbors feels natural and subtextual, advancing communal recovery.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, sentences advancing atmosphere through vivid images like "faint brown whisper" without loops or scaffold; rhythm varies naturally, syntactic variety supports momentum, though occasional dense metaphors in peak moments like the dust slide risk muddle but remain legible. No artifacts obscure closure; final line propels with clear propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of astrophysics and greenhouse recovery feels inevitable, transforming tropes of disaster through specific details like butterfly dust under lens; risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens stakes without gimmickry, committing to premise of unspectacular symmetry. Core premise offers non-obvious angle on resilience, with emotional specificity avoiding generics.</comment>
