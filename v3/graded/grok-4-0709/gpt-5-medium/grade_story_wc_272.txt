<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to descend into darkness is rooted in her crestfallen state and embodied through concrete actions like threading cards, revealing contradictory impulses in her habitual dimming versus re-aiming her lens; the final renunciation of her fragmented life earns stasis with felt cost in the luminescent ache. Interiority avoids stock phrasing, with emotions layered contradictorily, as seen when she carries foam without insisting it become stone. Flaws like ignoring faces complicate her choices, leading to the resonant ledger entry.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned images like threads and light, culminating in a Charged Poise closure where relighting the wick reconfigures her stance with conceptual cost in stitching herself to the weather; orientation anchors early in the lighthouse library. Causality holds via motif accumulation rather than strict linkage, with one meaningful deepening in the gearhouse. Minor elision in how she understands the keeper's redesign feels taught but could tighten for inevitability.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The forgotten library inside a lighthouse constrains choices, supplying threads and ledger that enable her redesign, charging the final image of brightness stitching her to the weather; sensory details like brine-sweating stones and oil smell are selective, POV-filtered, and evolve with pressure. Micro-setting of the gearhouse and stairs pressures descent, mirroring her internal fragmentation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of re-aiming her inner lens escalates texturally through thickening weather and anticipating collapse, deepening in the gearhouse where braiding threads forces stance crystallization with felt cost in the tremble revealing failed faces; one meaningful cadence shift suffices, driven by agency without coincidence resolving. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, narrowing options via the perished wick.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of untangling fragmented realities emerges organically from images like threaded cards and relit wick, offering resonant non-literal answer in the final brightness column without moralizing; subtext in gulls as commas and foam drifting back invites reflection on carrying impermanence. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality through honest ache and cost of faces seen in tremble.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable, with perceptual signature in metaphor-biased noticing like pages rustling as tide-wrack; prose texture distinct in rhythmic, patterned diction that teaches lyric compression early and pays off at closure. No dialogue, so policy skips those bullets; elision of backstory anchors in present cues, tilting stance via micro-choices like gathering threads.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose density high with multi-job sentences like "light argued up the spiral, impatient and golden," propelling momentum without loops; figurative language coherent, though dense metaphors in gearhouse beat risk muddle but pay off in flame's fluency. Rhythm varies naturally, clarity holds at closure; minor scaffold in repeated "she" stems deducts slightly but doesn't obscure cause.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tarot threading as lighthouse redesign transforms familiar artist-in-crisis trope through specific motifs like salt-bandaged box and wick braiding, feeling inevitable in hindsight; risk in lyric density heightens stakes without gimmickry, as in the non-obvious untangling fate question. Authenticity coheres in singular poetic stance.</comment>
