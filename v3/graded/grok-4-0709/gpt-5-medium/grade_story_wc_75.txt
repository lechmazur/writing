<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation to rescue dying arts is clear and intensifies through concrete micro-choices like baking initials, revealing internal conflict between embalmer and nurse roles; emotions are embodied in salt-tongued hope and nectar armor, with flaws like unworthiness complicating the acceptance of the lens. Senka provides secondary pressure that forces relational shifts, though other characters remain somewhat archetypal. The final endurance forecloses surface-world detachment with felt conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned images of honey, bread, and wax, with orientation anchored by the first line in the grotto city; closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the narrator accepts the lens and promises returns, reweighting history as enduring with conceptual cost of responsibility. One meaningful cadence shift at the stranger's arrival deepens knowledge without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The grotto behind the waterfall is vividly sensory with moist air, beeswax scent, and cold lace spray, constraining choices like building ovens from cisterns and charging the final image of the bowing waterfall; details evolve causally, mirroring internal thawing, and the micro-setting of the lens as tool reweights endurance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of rescuing arts tightens through one deepening at baking initials, narrowing options amid floodlight and hunger, with agency in renunciation of gentler titles; under Accumulative lens, pattern break at the stranger's arrival reweights grief with felt cost of apologies, though coincidence complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of enduring history through fed memory emerges organically from baking and wax thawing, with subtext in edible courage and invisible seams; the final image of breathing galleries offers resonant, non-literal repricing of orientation as warm and eaten, embracing complexity without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in poetic, historically biased noticing like rosewater dread; voice texture in rhythmic, image-dense syntax holds under pressure, with purposeful compression teaching patterns early; dialogue is subtextual and goal-driven, like Senka's relic explanation advancing the lens's role.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, sentences advancing atmosphere through vivid images like crumbs sprinkled into wax; rhythmic variety in short-long structures propels momentum, though occasional figurative stacking like "nectar armor, sweet and unbearable" risks muddle but pays off in closure without loops or artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of displacement with baking initials and thawing wax transforms preservation tropes through specific, honeyed motifs; risk in lyric structure heightens stakes organically, feeling inevitable at the stranger's hive box, with fresh angle on history as edible and enduring.</comment>
