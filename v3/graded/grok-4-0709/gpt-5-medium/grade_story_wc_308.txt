<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to navigate without moving is clear and intensifies through embodied stillness and reverence, compelling choices like tying the arrowhead and tuning breath; interiority is concrete and particular, with contradictory impulses in active listening versus physical immobility, earning the final endurance with felt cost in alignment to the pulse.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through layered echoes and patterns toward a Resonant Reconfiguration in the ending, where the canyon shifts and the map is redrawn with conceptual cost of stillness; orientation anchors early in the canyon with the kit of stones; closure lands on-page with the pulse less alone, holding the lens without contradiction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The canyon of endless echoes and towers of bone are vividly specific, with sensory details like stratified echoes and lichen scent constraining choices and charging the final image of birds settling at dusk; micro-setting of the ledge and seep mirror integrates action, reflecting POV bias in patience and sound navigation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of learning motionless navigation tightens through accumulating patterns of hum, birds, and pulse, deepening to reweight options in the canyon's shift; under textural lens, cadence shift forces stance crystallization with felt cost in consent alignment, though coincidence of birds complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of navigation through stillness and echoes emerges organically from images like the wandering pulse and birds' patterns, offering a resonant non-literal answer in the final reconfiguration without moralizing; subtext in arrowhead as prayer deepens complexity, inviting reflection on being heard versus location.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in sound-focused noticing, like wingbeats as ripples; prose texture in rhythmic, patterned diction teaches lyric compression early and pays off at closure; no dialogue, but voice modulates with emotional intensity purposefully.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied rhythm, like "distances fold like paper boats," advancing atmosphere without loops or scaffold; figurative language is coherent and purposeful, heightening pressure in peak beats like the pulse settling, with zero artifacts dulling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of harmonic stone skimming and wandering pulse transforms familiar mythic tropes through specific sound navigation and bird patterns; risk in lyric stillness heightens stakes organically, feeling inevitable in the redrawn map, with no close echoes of known scenes.</comment>
