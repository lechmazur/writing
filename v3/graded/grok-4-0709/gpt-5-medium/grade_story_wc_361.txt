<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The protagonist's jittery nature and motivation to coax wonder are rooted in consistent traits, intensifying through micro-choices like tuning to the ridge's hum, with embodied emotions in the pendant's tremble and mentor's felt absence; the widow applies secondary pressure that forces a shared instrument moment, earning the stasis of planting continuance with visible cost in prickling grief.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned elisions and image density toward a Charged Poise closure where the corridor thins and the yew is planted, reconfiguring memory to myth with felt cost in the mentor's echo-less hush; orientation anchors early in the ridgeway route, and causality holds via vibrational sympathy without breaks, though one reflective block slightly exceeds BRR allowance without fully tilting a micro-choice.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The aurora-lit ridgeway is vividly specific, with sensory details like green sap in snow and humming spine constraining choices, such as the highest switchback delivery that charges the germination and final image of the throbbing path; micro-setting of the pendant and tube integrates into action, mirroring internal grief without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, the dominant stake of carrying continuance escalates through density increase in the shared vibration and germination, deepening to force stance crystallization in the overlapping corridor with felt cost of the thinning miracle; one meaningful cadence shift suffices, though coincidence in the ridge's song slightly complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of coaxing wonder from routine emerges organically through images like sugar-thread time and germinating seeds, culminating in a resonant, non-literal reconfiguration of grief via the corridor without stated moral; subtext in silences and pendant's tremble invites reflection on absence, avoiding sentimentality with complex ambiguity in the mentor's fade.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The first-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature in selective, biased noticing of sounds and lights, modulated by stress in trembling rhythms; purposeful compression and lyric diction are taught early and paid off at closure without obscurity, and minimal dialogue carries subtext in the widow's strokes and shared breath.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied rhythm in metaphors like moth in a bell, advancing atmosphere without loops; some figurative stacking in peak beats like the corridor's thaw risks muddle but pays off in clarity, and sentence-level craft heightens the final hush without artifacts touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The premise of a vibrating courier planting continuance synthesizes relic delivery with mythic germination in a fresh, non-obvious way, transforming tropes through specific vibrational method and ridgeway pressure; risk in lyric compression heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in the mentor's fade to myth.</comment>
