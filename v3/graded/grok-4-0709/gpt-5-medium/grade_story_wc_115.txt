<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong interiority with embodied skepticism and contradictory impulses between denial and need, shown in the father's death reflection tilting present action; motivation intensifies credibly to the wheel-turning choice, earning the final renunciation with felt cost in unforgiven losses; no second character, so relationship bullets ignored; minor stock phrasing in emotional labels like "poised fatigue" slightly flattens specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with patterned elisions and image accrual building to a Conceptual Repricing closure where turning the wheel reweights the swallowed truth with undeniable conceptual cost in the carried memory; orientation anchors who (narrator), where (tunnel), and when (night) by line 4; one meaningful deepening via the valve interaction suffices; minor ellipsis in radio calls feels motivated but could tighter link to final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details like cold drips and iron breath filter through POV bias, constraining choices in the tunnel's hush; environment charges the final metronome image, reweighting the ghost shift; micro-setting of the valve wheel as tool evolves causally; quick test met with setting pressuring the wheel-turn and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake in measuring swallowed truth tightens once through wheel interaction under Accumulative/Textural lens, deepening knowledge with felt cost in unforgiven weight; agency in renunciation forecloses denial path; one reversal in turning then resetting the wheel narrows options; cost legible but could be more viscerally embodied at peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of truth's unghostable weight emerges from images like rosary beads and metronome without direct statement, inviting ambiguity in habits vs. fear; subtext in silence and implication charges the final image non-literally; resonance from particulars avoids platitudes; minor drift in radio psychic asides slightly dilutes thematic focus.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in iron-tasted breath and grease-shined beads, with rhythmic control modulating under pressure; patterned diction teaches lyric compression early, paying off at closure; no dialogue, so those bullets ignored; quick test met with consistent first-person distance and no slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with sentences advancing atmosphere and interiority, varying rhythm in hush descriptions; some metaphor stacks like rosary and bible feel dense but coherent without muddle; no loops or scaffolds obscure closure; minor overwriting in "yellow coin" image slightly pads without harming propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost lore through skeptical appraisal and radio patterns, transforming tropes with valve as habit-of-force; risk in lyric introspection heightens stakes without gimmickry; core premise commits without retreat; minor echo of familiar abandonment motifs limits top ingenuity.</comment>
