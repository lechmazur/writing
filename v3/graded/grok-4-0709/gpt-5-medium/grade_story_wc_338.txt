<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrator's methodical curiosity drives consistent, embodied choices, like tracing the seam and listening before acting, revealing internal contradictions between shielded openness and active pursuit; emotions are embodied in steady hands and perceptual details under pressure. The verger provides secondary pressure through reluctant agreement, shifting status dynamics in the descent. Motivation intensifies to compel the reopening, earning the final renunciation of blanks with felt gratitude as cost. The 9+ test is met with contradictory impulses in scene and earned closure choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned imagery of tears, seams, and breaths, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing where the map's wound becomes a seam reweighting known/unknown with conceptual cost in the final framing. Orientation anchors early in the hills and henge, with no disorientation debt. Closure lands on-page with the note in the window, reconfiguring history's quiet; one meaningful deepening suffices. Persistent constraint of the tear shapes tactics, meeting the 9+ test but capped by minor lens ambiguity in early causal hints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting vividly anchors in rain-scoured hills, henge, and vault, with sensory details like cold air nicking fingertips filtered through the narrator's perceptive bias. The fresco vault and whispered chapel constrain choices, pressuring the discovery and charging the final image of the breathing vault. Micro-setting of the map tear mirrors internal states without overt symbolism. The environment shapes the closure, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of interpreting silence signals early and deepens through video comparison and seam tracing, narrowing options to reopening with coherent textural pressure under Accumulative lens. One tightening via the gathered village forces stance crystallization, with felt cost in the verger's exhaustion and communal hush. Agency drives the empathetic interpretation, but cost is more conceptual than visceral. Meets 9+ test with agency-driven deepening and unmistakable cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of shielded openness to history's quiet emerges through images like the tear as seam and breathing frescoes, inviting reflection on known/unknown without tidy morals. Subtext in whispers and silences enriches ambiguity, with the final note offering a resonant, non-literal answer reweighting the premise. Emotional aftereffect arises from particulars like the purling forebears. Meets 9+ test but subtle sentimentality in gratitude slightly softens complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in map-framer's methodical noticing, like listening for bevels; rhythmic control heightens in hushed drafts without obscurity. Patterned elision in poetic compression is taught early and pays off at closure. Dialogue is sparse but natural, subtextual in the verger's shrug. Meets 9+ test with no elision issues or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense with purposeful metaphors like rain as a slow animal, advancing atmosphere without loops; syntactic variety creates rhythm, though some figurative density in the vault scene borders on overwriting without harming clarity. High information density propels through images, with clean mechanics and no artifacts in closure. Opening anchors voice; final line recharges motifs. Meets 9+ test with zero loops and propulsion, but peak-beat density deducts slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of map-framing and whispered architecture transforms discovery tropes through specific details like video silences and pricked names, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk in poetic structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, committing to premise. No derivative echoes; emotional specificity avoids generics. Meets 9+ test with non-obvious angle and risk elevation.</comment>
