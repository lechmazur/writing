<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to seek justice through adaptive means is clear and intensifies via reflective micro-choices, like kneeling to the sand and retracing frost, revealing embodied contradictions between survival fear and purposeful endurance; interiority is concrete and particular, with emotions layered in glass metaphors without stock phrasing. However, the rival's traits are summarized rather than shown under pressure, slightly limiting relational crucible depth. The final renunciation of direct confrontation earns stasis with felt conceptual cost, foreclosing aggressive paths.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned elisions and imagery (ledger, frost, stars) to a Charged Poise closure where the protagonist reconfigures truth via annealed glass, with conceptual cost of indirect exposure legible in the final image; orientation anchors early in the canyon under stars. One meaningful cadence shift deepens knowledge from the frost's revelation, holding without contradiction. The braid of sounds recalling the attempt pays off prior setups effectively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The canyon setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like chilling sand and drifting resonance filtered through the artist's bias, constraining choices by providing frost patterns that charge the closure; the environment evolves with dawn, mirroring internal reconfiguration. Micro-setting of the stone and frost directly shapes the revelatory turn.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of exposing the rival without forgery tightens through frost-pattern deepening, narrowing options to an annealed midpoint with felt cost of patience over direct action; under Accumulative lens, pattern break in the braided sounds forces stance crystallization. Coincidence of wind push complicates but does not resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of purpose in pauses emerges organically from images like flaking ledger and frost veins, resisting tidy morals by embracing adaptive ambiguity; the final image of glass letting purpose pour through emptiness offers resonant, non-literal reconfiguration without statement. Subtext in silences and gaps enriches complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>First-person voice is distinct and rhythmic, with perceptual signature in glass metaphors and patterned diction taught early, modulating under pressure without obscurity; elision of direct confrontation pays off in closure. No dialogue, so policy skips those bullets; psychic distance shifts intentionally with emotional intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied syntax and high information in lines like "the ledger strip waited, flaking its own moons," advancing atmosphere without loops; figurative language is coherent, though occasional density in peak beats risks muddle but pays off in resonance. No artifacts touch closure; read-aloud rhythm breathes naturally.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of glass artistry, smuggling ledger, and mystic canyon frost transforms tropes into non-obvious adaptive justice, with risk in lyric mode heightening stakes; the annealed window premise feels inevitable, committing fully without retreat. Fresh inflection in frost as method reweights familiar revenge arcs.</comment>
