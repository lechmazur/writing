<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marek's logically emotional trait drives consistent choices, like adapting via vibration instead of force, with embodied contradictions in his graphed feelings and protective vector; the seeker's hunger shifts through sonic exposure, revealing values with cost in her ache. Interiority is concrete and particular, avoiding stock phrasing, as in his ribs chiming with the stone's breath. Flaws complicate without hedging, but the seeker's quick alignment feels slightly tidy, though it doesn't undermine the closure's earned stasis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, textural density builds through sound patterns and imagery, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where they guard together with felt cost in responsibility's weight; orientation anchors early with Marek at the marina under sunset. Closure lands on-page with the lighthouse's relieved beam, reweighting protection via adaptation. Minor ellipsis in the seeker's arrival doesn't break pattern, but lacks a sharper micro-turn for full tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting anchors vividly early with drift-ice marina and ice floes like shy animals, constraining choices as the seeker climbs from the skiff; sensory details like salt and lamp oil, filtered through Marek's POV, mirror internal states without overt symbolism. The lighthouse environment charges the final image, with the lens room and stone as micro-setting that enables vibrational matching. Specificity is purposeful, evolving causally with the sunset thinning to brass.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of protecting the artifact escalates texturally through the stone's chord and seeker's arrival, deepening via sonic absolution that reweights her hunger with one meaningful shift; agency in Marek's adaptation forecloses force, with felt cost in her ache and key's heaviness. Pressure coheres under lens, but coincidence of her skiff complicates without fully resolving, keeping it from higher band. Moral calculus sharpens at the landing confrontation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of adaptation through forgiveness emerges from vibrational matching and the stone's low chord remembering drowned orchards, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in her ache; subtext in gestures like reaching then stopping invites reflection. Final image of shared guardianship offers resonant, non-literal answer to protection without stating it. Emotional aftereffect is concrete via sorrow as true data, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in ethereal hush and graphed feelings; voice texture is distinct in poetic rhythm, modulating with pressure like lengthening exhales. Dialogue carries subtext, advancing plot indirectly as Marek offers sonic absolution instead of arguing. Patterned diction teaches lyric mode early, paying off at closure without opacity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in metaphors like ice floes as shy animals without loops; sentences propel via vivid verbs, avoiding scaffold as in the courteous click of the lock. Figurative language coheres without muddle, even in peak beats like the chord filling space. Minor register elevation in "vibrational matching" fits voice, but doesn't clash.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lighthouse engineering with sonic mysticism transforms tropes through specific vibrational adaptation, feeling inevitable in the stone's forgiveness; risk in ethereal tone heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional complexity in logically emotional trait avoids generics, with non-obvious angle on protection via sound. Core premise commits fully, subverting confrontation for alignment.</comment>
