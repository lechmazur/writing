<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to restore faith is clear and intensifies through embodied choices, like tracing the stele and rebuilding the sundial, revealing contradictory impulses in purposeful wandering. Interiority is concrete and particular, with emotions embodied in moments like the "hinge give way in my chest," earning the final endurance with felt cost. Sami applies secondary pressure effectively, his nod and laugh deepening the protagonist's stance without stereotype. The single-POV voice coherence elevates this, though minor stock phrasing in reflections slightly tempers perfection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned images of interruption, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where staying to tend the orchard reweights the stake with conceptual cost legible in the "small orbit" final image. Orientation anchors early in the catacomb orchard return, with no disorientation debt. Closure lands on-page with felt cost, like the hinge in the chest, and one meaningful cadence shift suffices. Persistent motif of roots and bones shapes tactics subtly, enhancing hindsight inevitability.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard is vividly specific, with roots snaking between bones constraining choices like arranging artifacts and charging the final image of orbiting the stele. Sensory details are purposeful, filtered through POV bias, mirroring internal restoration via quince trees and silt. Atmosphere evolves causally, from cautious enchantment to gentle wind, supporting theme without overt symbolism. Micro-setting of the sundial base recurs to charge closure, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><grade>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the dominant stake of restoring faith tightens through one decisive intensification in rebuilding the sundial, narrowing options with felt cost in the chest hinge. Agency drives the renunciation of leaving, foreclosing prior interruptions. Pressure coheres via coherent motifs, with the shadow's return crystallizing stance. Cost is unmistakable on-page, though secondary accents are minimal, fitting scope.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of interrupted journeys emerges organically through images like roots braiding skulls and the sundial's shadow, offering a resonant non-literal answer in the final orbit that reweights faith without moralizing. Subtext in gestures, like Sami's laugh, invites reflection on diaspora ache with purposeful ambiguity. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality, earned via concrete struggles like arranging bones. The ending reweights prior material subtly, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in poetic noticing, like earth speaking a dialect, and rhythmic control heightens pressure without obscurity. Dialogue is natural, subtextual, and advances plot, as in Sami's question about smiling at dirt revealing shared curiosity. Patterned elision in lyric mode is taught early and pays off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift, with prose as character under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied rhythm in metaphors like "starlings circled like punctuation" advancing atmosphere without loops or scaffold. Information density is high, sentences multi-tasking character and theme, and figurative language coheres without muddle in peak beats like sundial rebuilding. Clarity and concision shine, with no artifacts touching closure. Zero loops and strong verbs meet the 9+ test, though density borders on ornate in reflections.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of diaspora return, catacomb orchard, and sundial restoration feels fresh and inevitable, transforming tropes of homecoming through specific motifs like braided roots and interrupted journeys. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, with emotional specificity avoiding generics. Core premise offers non-obvious angle on faith, committing fully with bold ambiguity. A non-obvious reconfiguration in the final orbit elevates, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
