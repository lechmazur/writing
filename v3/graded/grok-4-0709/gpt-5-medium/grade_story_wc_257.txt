<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation is clear and intensifies through grief-rooted choices, with interiority concrete and embodied in metaphors like metal refusing polish; contradictory impulses show in the shift from personal mourning to teaching others, earning the endurance of their new role with felt emotional cost. Relationships are absent on-page, so ignored per guidelines. The hierarchy of values reveals in micro-choices, such as projecting the stencil instead of burying it, foreclosing isolation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned elision and density of images like curtains and lilies, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration in the ending where the narrator reconfigures purpose with conceptual cost of ongoing waiting; orientation anchors early in the observatory arrival. Closure lands on-page with the final commitment to illuminate refusals, reweighting prior grief. No causality breaks, but lacks a decisive physical act, fitting the lens without penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The observatory setting constrains choices, supplying the projector and dome that enable the lily projection and rituals, charging the final image of glowing fingerprints; sensory details are vivid and POV-filtered, like dust as silt, mirroring internal withering. Micro-setting of tools like vellum and wire integrates into action, evolving causally. Environment pressures the thematic shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of transforming grief escalates texturally through pattern breaks like shifting from personal projection to communal rituals, deepening with the mother's aurora moment that reweights intention; one meaningful cadence shift suffices, with legible emotional cost in subdued ardor. Agency in renunciation forecloses old life, under lens. Coincidence of visitors complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of intention as loom emerges organically from images like curtains and hinges, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in broken plans; subtext in silences and implications, like the lily singing, invites reflection. Final image offers resonant, non-literal answer to teaching withering to bloom, reweighting grief without statement. Emotional aftereffect honest, avoiding sentimentality through complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>First-person POV stable with perceptual signature in poetic noticing, like light finding dust; voice texture distinct in rhythmic, metaphorical syntax that modulates with emotion, teaching patterned diction early. Dialogue natural and subtextual in quiet talks, advancing theme via implication. Elision purposeful and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose dense with propulsion, sentences multi-tasking via metaphors like "curtains of intention" without loops or scaffold; rhythm varies naturally, syntactic variety supports emphasis in peaks. No artifacts obscure closure; final line recharges motifs cleanly. High information density, zero muddle in figurative language.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mourning jewelry with astronomical projection transforms tropes of grief into non-obvious rituals, feeling inevitable via specifics like shipwreck coal beads; risk in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Core premise commits fully, avoiding middle-ground hedging. Emotional specificity personalizes archetypes.</comment>
