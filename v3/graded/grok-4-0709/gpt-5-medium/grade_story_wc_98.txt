<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to protect cultural memory is clear and intensifies through dream interpretation and doubt, culminating in the planting choice with luminous doubt as a felt cost; Iru's presence adds relational pressure that forces shared courage. Interiority is concrete via embodied metaphors like the seed trembling, revealing contradictory impulses of caution and action. However, emotions lean abstract without stronger physical degradation under stress, slightly limiting depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through layered dreams and imagery toward a Resonant Reconfiguration in the planting and sprouting, with conceptual cost in shared doubt reweighting memory; orientation anchors early with the ridge walk. Causality holds via pattern breaks like the conch's echoes leading to the hollow. The closure lands on-page with the tree's leaf glinting intact stories, though a more decisive physical change could sharpen it.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The ancient ridge in bloom is vividly sensory with debating petals and blooming stones, filtered through the protagonist's whimsical POV; it constrains choices by shifting soil and guiding to the listening hollow. Atmosphere builds tension with the approaching monsoon bruise, mirroring internal doubt. The setting evolves causally, with hibiscus pollen and red rain charging the closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving collective memory tightens through dream-guided escalation and the monsoon's pressure, deepening via Iru's conch to force the planting; under Accumulative/Textural lens, cadence shifts reweight cost in luminous doubt. One meaningful intensification suffices, with visible trade-off in kneeling courage. Coincidence of Iru's arrival complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of honest myths versus erasure emerges organically from interpreted dreams and the seed's sprouting, with subtext in whispers and salt; the final image of the tree's leaf reweights memory's fragility without moralizing. Emotional aftereffect lingers through complexity of water remembering salt. Resonance arises from particulars like pelican circles as provisional fact.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in whimsical metaphors like crabs citing sources; patterned elision in dream voices is taught early and pays off at closure. Dialogue with Iru carries subtext and advances planting, feeling natural in echoed lines. Prose texture modulates rhythmically under pressure, with non-standard punctuation enhancing lyric flow.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in metaphorical sentences like "footprint becomes a rumor running downhill"; no loops or scaffold, strong verbs propel momentum. Figurative language coheres without muddle, as in droplets spelling names. Minor overwriting in pollen and red rain slightly pads, but clarity holds at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of myth-checking with empirical whimsy transforms tropes through specific details like tidebook testing and luminous doubt, feeling inevitable at the ear-shaped hollow; risk in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Core premise offers non-obvious angle on collective memory, committing fully with bold imagery.</comment>
