<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The conjurer's motivation is clear and rooted in his sister's ambiguous loss, intensifying through inventive rituals that compel micro-choices like arranging fruit and threading eyes, revealing contradictory impulses of longing and acceptance. Interiority is concrete and embodied, with emotions like ache layered through memories of fractions and laughter, avoiding stock phrasing. The final endurance forecloses reunion but earns coherence with felt cost in the theorem he carries, though reflection borders on excess without stronger present-frame tilt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, patterns of imagery and motifs build density toward a Conceptual Repricing closure where the theorem reweights ambiguous loss with undeniable conceptual cost, visible in the carried memento. Orientation anchors early in the silent orchard beneath the moon, with no disorientation debt. The structure holds as one continuous scene with reflective shards, but ellipsis in answers arriving "via the chipped patterns" feels slightly undermotivated, though it pays off in the shifting proof.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The cavern orchard is vividly specific, with dripping stalactites and mineral blossoms constraining choices like placing the stone on a root and tying to a stalactite, charging the final image of the swaying eyes. Sensory details like mineral sweetness and ticking water are purposeful, filtered through the conjurer's grief-biased perception. The micro-setting of the stepping stone and eyes evolves causally, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of understanding ambiguous loss deepens through pattern breaks in mosaic interpretations and fruit spirals, reweighting with conceptual cost in the theorem's uncertainty. Pressure coheres accumulatively, with one meaningful intensification via the eyes' sway forcing stance crystallization on longing as a variable. Agency in renunciation is earned, though coincidence in moon-threading light slightly complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of ambiguous loss emerges organically from images like chipped patterns and swaying eyes, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer via the cracked theorem that reweights emotion as mathematical without moralizing. Subtext in gestures and silences invites reflection on coherence amid sorrow, with purposeful ambiguity in doorways shaped like refusals. The final image elicits emotional aftereffect through buried optimism, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature biased toward mathematical metaphors and grief, modulating rhythm under pressure like in the whispering to the stone. Prose texture is distinct in syntax and diction, teaching patterned elision early for lyric effect that pays off at closure. No dialogue present, so policy skips those bullets; minor register drift in academic terms like "arithmetic" fits voice without jarring.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied rhythm, as in the exhale of mineral sweetness hushing, advancing atmosphere without loops; information density high in multi-job lines like the laugh surviving as theorem. Figurative language is controlled, though stacked metaphors in peak beats like "equations wearing festival clothes" border on muddle without harming clarity. No major artifacts, but occasional synonym churn like "sums and shadows" slightly dulls momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of conjuring, mathematics, and grief transforms tropes through specific details like taxidermist eyes mapping emotions, feeling inevitable in the theorem's emergence. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, committing to premise of buried optimism. Core premise offers non-obvious angle on loss, with emotional specificity avoiding generics.</comment>
