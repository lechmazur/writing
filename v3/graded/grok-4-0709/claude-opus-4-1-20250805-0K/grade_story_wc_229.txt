<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to purify intentions and forgive is clear and intensifies compellingly, rooted in embodied grief and contradictory impulses like longing versus acceptance; interiority is concrete, with emotions shown through tactile sensations like the cork's warmth, avoiding stock phrasing. The relationship with Thomas acts as a crucible, forcing her renunciation of anger with felt cost in the climax. Flaws are minimal, but Thomas feels slightly one-note as a spectral presence. The final beckoning choice is earned by prior accumulation, revealing her value hierarchy with visible emotional price.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the story builds density through jasmine scent and ascending steps, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Thomas solidifies with conceptual cost of merged existences; orientation anchors early in the lighthouse at dawn. Closure lands on-page with felt cost in "screaming tenderness," holding the lens without contradiction. One meaningful deepening via the whisper's vibration suffices, but a minor ellipsis in Thomas's guilt reveal feels slightly unmotivated.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The cobalt lighthouse at dawn is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like peeling paint and salt air filtered through Mara's bias; it constrains choices via the stairs and beam, charging the final image of dancing shadows. Micro-setting of the lamp room mirrors her internal state without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly, evolving with the ascent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reuniting via purified love signals early and deepens through the ascent and forgiveness, narrowing options under Accumulative lens with one tightening that forces stance crystallization; agency in beckoning forecloses isolation with felt emotional cost. Pressure coheres, but the guilt resolution feels slightly coincidental without stronger complication. Moral calculus between protection and freedom sharpens the peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of love transcending dimensions via pure intent emerges organically from scent molecules and forgiveness, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in Thomas's partial return; subtext in jasmine's impossibility invites reflection. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to longing's power, reweighting the premise without statement. Emotional honesty avoids sentimentality through embodied ache.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in Mara's sensory bias toward scents and pulses; prose texture is lyric and rhythmic, modulating with intensity. Dialogue is natural, subtextual, and goal-driven, like her whisper vibrating dimensions. Elision of Thomas's full backstory is taught and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm and syntax to propel beats; metaphors like "bruise healing into gold" are coherent and purposeful without muddle. No loops, scaffolds, or artifacts; information advances atmosphere and character, as in the cork's warmth doing double duty. Final line recharges motifs effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost lore with intention-manifestation feels inevitable, transforming tropes through specific vibrational mechanics; risk in mystical resolution heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity in "screaming tenderness" avoids generics, committing to premise implications. Minor echo of familiar lighthouse isolation, but grounded choices make it memorable.</comment>
