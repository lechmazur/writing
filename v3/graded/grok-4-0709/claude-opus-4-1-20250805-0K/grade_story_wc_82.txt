<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mei's motivation as a crafty lantern maker intensifies compellingly through her grief-driven polishing, revealing contradictory impulses in embodied actions like trembling fingers and preserving memories; the final renunciation of raw anguish into transformed love earns stasis with visible emotional cost, as in folding "grief itself" into cranes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned memory shards to a resonant reconfiguration in the final gem's vision, with conceptual cost legible in love's transformation; orientation anchors early in the workshop and tea garden, though reflective density risks minor disorientation waived by closure payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The floating tea garden and glass basilica constrain Mei's choices, with woven moonlight bridges and crystal bells mirroring her ascending descent, charging the final image of dancing shadows; sensory details like polished gems and sunset notes evolve causally, reflecting POV bias in grief-filtered perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of transforming grief tightens through accumulative deepening, as polishing uncovers possibility amid pain, forcing stance crystallization with felt cost in persistent loss; one meaningful cadence shift suffices, though pressure remains more internal than external under the lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of grief's transformation emerges organically from gem-polishing motifs and luminous torment, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer via lanterns that hold sorrow and joy; subtext in Master Shen's dialogue and final reconfiguration invites lingering ambiguity without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable with character-specific perceptual signature in crafty, grief-tinged noticing; prose texture distinct in rhythmic, metaphorical syntax that modulates with emotional intensity, teaching patterned elision early and paying off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with vivid, propulsion-driven sentences like "polished the dream-gem, its surface catching memories," varying rhythm purposefully; minor figurative muddle in mixed metaphors (e.g., shadows detaching yet dancing) avoided in peak beats, with zero loops and clean mechanics.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dream-recording and lantern-crafting transforms grief tropes through specific ascending-descent motif, feeling inevitable in the basilica's dancing shadows; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes without gimmickry, committing to premise's implications.</comment>
