<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maya's motivation to hunt the shard is clear and rooted in her interpreter traits, intensifying through embodied interiority like the fragment thrumming against her ribs; her final decision to teach others represents an earned renunciation with felt cost, foreclosing her Guild path. Contradictory impulses—Guild training versus intuitive discarding of assumptions—act simultaneously in her tuning process, avoiding stock epiphanies. The single-POV interiority is concrete and particular, with emotions embodied in tingling fingertips and signal drifts.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through descriptive density and pattern breaks, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing where Maya reweights endings as beginnings with conceptual cost in her life shift; orientation anchors early in the towers over the gorge. The closure lands on-page with the fragment going dark and her descent smile, reconfiguring options via persistent perigee constraint. One meaningful cadence shift suffices, though causality feels more textural than tightly causal in signal echoes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting of suspended towers over misty gorge is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like mineral rain scent and swaying cables constraining Maya's climb and tuning; it charges the final dawn image, mirroring her realization. Perigee's gravitational distortion enables the hush gaps, directly shaping choices. Micro-details like rung pitches integrate into action, reflecting POV bias without tourist catalogs.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of finding the hush tightens via perigee's pressure, deepening through fragment connection and intention-tuning, narrowing options with gravitational sway; agency drives the stance crystallization, with unmistakable cost in her Guild renunciation. Under textural lens, density increases to reweight silence as potential. One meaningful deepening suffices, though internal conflict could interweave more externally.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of silence as communicative potential emerges organically from signal hunts and hush discovery, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer via the final fragment promise, reweighting endings without moralizing. Subtext in images like backward echoes invites reflection on cycles. Earned insight arises from specific perigee experience, embracing complexity without tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in signal-focused noticing, like wind-threaded pitches; prose texture in rhythmic, purposeful syntax reflects Maya's mind under stress. No dialogue, but voice modulates intentionally with emotional drifts. Patterned elision in hush entry is taught and paid off at dawn, enhancing legibility.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied rhythm in sentences like "the fragment began to glow, casting amber shadows"; zero loops or scaffolds, high information density in multi-job lines without figurative muddle. Clarity shines in peak hush moment, with strong verbs and specific details advancing atmosphere. Opening anchors voice, final line recharges motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sci-fi signals with lyric silence-hunting feels inevitable, transforming tropes via fragment's extinct dreams; risk in textural structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Core premise offers non-obvious angle on cosmic cycles, committed fully with authentic vision. The hush as backward-traced potential inflects boldly, organic to voice.</comment>
