<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyra's motivation to capture presence is clear and intensifies through overthinking flaws, culminating in a earned shift via her relationship with Marcus; interiority is concrete and embodied, with contradictory impulses shown in her clinging to the shell while insisting on perfect equations. The crucible of friendship forces the final reconfiguration, revealing values with visible emotional cost in the twilight revelation. Some diagnostic self-awareness in admitting romantic entanglements slightly flattens peak interiority, but it doesn't undermine the closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, textural density builds through pulsing motifs of twilight and spirals, leading to a Conceptual Repricing closure where presence is reweighted as return rather than capture, with felt cost in the intimate witness moment; orientation anchors early in the nexus lab. One meaningful cadence shift at the shell placement tightens the pattern effectively. Persistent constraint of failed experiments shapes the final image without contradiction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The ember nexus at twilight is vividly specific, with sensory details like cooling sting and pulsing veins filtering through Lyra's alchemical bias; it constrains choices by responding to the shell, charging the final glowing image. Micro-setting of the nexus evolves causally, mirroring internal revelation without overt symbolism. Minor repetition of amber shadows slightly dilutes selectivity, but purpose drives every detail.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of capturing presence tightens through one deepening shift when Lyra revalues her approach, driven by agency in placing the shell; under textural lens, pattern break at the gentle glow forces stance crystallization with legible emotional cost in the shared silence. Coincidence of nexus response complicates but doesn't resolve. Cost is unmistakable in the foreclosed path of forced fusion, though a touch more visceral layering could elevate.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of presence as dynamic return emerges organically from shell motifs and friendship, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer at the pulsing shell-sun that reweights prior failures without moralizing. Subtext in silences and glances invites ambiguity about memory's cost. Emotional aftereffect lingers through precise tenderness, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Close third-person POV on Lyra is stable with distinct perceptual signature in twilight-filtered observations; voice texture modulates lyrically under pressure, teaching patterned compression early. Dialogue carries subtext and advances revelation naturally, with Marcus's lines evading directness. No head-hopping or unwarranted certainty, though one filter verb cluster in the nexus touch slightly dulls immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose density is high with rhythmic variety and purposeful syntax, advancing atmosphere through vivid images like "crystalline veins pulsing"; no loops or scaffold, and metaphors cohere without muddle in peak beats. Final line recharges motifs effectively. Minor register elevation in "ineffable weight" fits voice without clash.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemy with romantic memory transforms tropes through specific nautilus geometry and twilight method, feeling inevitable at the shell's levitation; risk in lyric introspection heightens stakes without gimmickry. Core premise commits fully, avoiding middle-ground hedging.</comment>
