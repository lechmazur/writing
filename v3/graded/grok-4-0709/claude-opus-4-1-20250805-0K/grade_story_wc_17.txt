<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's motivation as the last echo cartographer is clear and intensifies through discoveries, with embodied emotions like breath catching at Voss's diary revealing contradictory impulses of burden and purpose; interiority is concrete, avoiding stock phrasing, and her final choice to add her whisper earns stasis with the cost of isolation felt on the page. Relationships are absent, so no crucible evaluation applies. Minor slip in diagnostic self-awareness during reflections slightly flattens complexity, but it doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through layered discoveries from film strip to diaries, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration where Mira's notebook placement reweights legacy with conceptual cost; orientation anchors early in the ivy-conquered university, and causality holds via motivated ellipses like tracing stones. Closure lands with charged poise in her final whisper, foreclosing solitude by preserving for future searchers. No meaningful slips affect the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The ivy-veiled passage constrains Mira's navigation and charges the final image of green passages as new architecture, with sensory details like rustling leaves and cool stone filtered through her perceptual bias; micro-setting of walls as recording devices mirrors internal states without overt symbolism. Environment evolves causally, pressuring choices like brushing vines. Recurring ivy and stone objects charge closure, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving acoustic memories tightens through deepening discoveries, narrowing options to extraction and her own addition, with agency in renunciation of isolation via notebook placement; under Accumulative/Textural lens, cadence shift at nightfall reweights cost legibly in her whisper. One meaningful deepening suffices, driven by protagonist agency. Cost is unmistakable in legacy's ongoing burden.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of legacy as remembered dreams emerges organically from walls' echoes and Voss's diary, inviting reflection on preservation amid loss without tidy morals; final image of Mira's notebook offers a resonant, non-literal answer reweighting burden as future-oriented. Subtext in urgent echoes and half-burned pages enriches complexity. No explicit moralizing mars the ending.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable, with perceptual signature in vibration-sensing and echo fragments biased by Mira's sensitivity; prose texture distinct in rhythmic, ivy-laced sentences modulating with intensity. No dialogue, so policy skips evaluation. Minor filter verbs like "feeling for vibrations" are voice-motivated without dulling immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere through vivid images like "curtains of leaves" without loops or scaffold; rhythm varies naturally, though one paraphrase loop in diary descriptions slightly drags momentum. No artifacts obscure closure, and information propels toward the final whisper. Figurative language is controlled, avoiding muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-climate apocalypse with echo cartography transforms familiar eco-dystopia through specific perceptual details like wall-thrumming, feeling inevitable in Mira's notebook entry; risk in quiet, accumulative structure heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry. Avoids template plots, though premise echoes legacy tales without full subversion.</comment>
