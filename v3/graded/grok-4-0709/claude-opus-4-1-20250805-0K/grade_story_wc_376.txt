<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vera's motivation to uncover truths is rooted in her peculiar gift and personal loss, intensifying through steady micro-choices like piecing fragments and venturing into tunnels, culminating in an earned renunciation of the city's peace with visible cost. Interiority is concrete and embodied, with contradictory impulses shown in her loneliness versus duty, avoiding stock phrasing. The single-POV focus excels without needing secondary characters, though a deeper blind spot could elevate flaws' impact on closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under a Causal lens, the structure flows with because/therefore linkages from discovering the fragment to mapping and retrieval, anchoring orientation early in the workshop. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing in the final transcription decision, reweighting truth's value with undeniable social cost to the city's peace, evident in the dissolving metaphor. One meaningful tightening suffices, with the grandmother's letter revelation changing knowledge and forcing stance crystallization.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The greenhouse city under a toxic sky is vividly specific, with sensory details like sweating walls and copper scent constraining Vera's choices in the tunnel, charging the final image of wilting truths. Micro-setting elements like the brush and leaves integrate into action, reflecting POV bias and mirroring internal honesty struggles. Environment evolves causally, pressuring the climax without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of delivering hidden truths escalates causally through discovery and retrieval, with one meaningful tightening in the letter's revelation narrowing options and forcing agency in transcription, under the Causal lens. Cost is legible as the city's peace dissolving, a felt social price charging the ending. Coincidence of finding fragments complicates but doesn't resolve, with pressure coherent until stance crystallization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of truth's inescapable flow emerges organically from images like crystallized messages and wilting leaves, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer via the grandmother's letter and Vera's decision, reweighting candor's cost without moralizing. Subtext in phrases like "filtered truths" invites reflection on honesty's dangers, earned through specific struggles. Emotional aftereffect lingers in the dead zones metaphor, embracing complexity without false equivalence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and modest, with perceptual signature in Vera's lie-sensing embodiment, like trembling hands, and rhythmic prose modulating with pressure in the tunnel scene. No dialogue present, so policy skips evaluation; free indirect style is clean without filter stacks. Syntax reflects her focused mind, with purposeful compression in discoveries taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere in lines like "sweating condensation that smelled of copper and regret," varying rhythm naturally without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is controlled and coherent, enhancing propulsion in peak beats like the letter reading, with zero artifacts touching closure. Strong verbs and specific details propel momentum, passing read-aloud test cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes sci-fi elements like living leaves and crystallized sound waves into a fresh angle on truth and censorship, feeling inevitable through Vera's gift and the map's confessions, with risk-taking in the wilting metaphor heightening stakes organically. Tropes of hidden messages are transformed via specific world logic, committing fully without hedging. The non-obvious reconfiguration of "dead zones" as truth repositories elevates ingenuity.</comment>
