<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to decode celestial messages is clear and rooted in her gift, intensifying through the telegram discovery and star observation to compel the shared revelation; interiority is concrete in her tactile handling of the daylily and journal, revealing embodied emotion under pressure. However, internal conflict lacks strong contradictory impulses in scene, trending toward summary over simultaneity, as in the abstract "cosmic loneliness" softened without visible cost mid-crisis. The final endurance feels earned by accumulative clues, but flaws like therapy-speak in her healing words slightly dilute character specificity at the climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The accumulative/textural lens holds with pattern breaks in dream symbols and star pulses building to a resonant reconfiguration, where understanding reprices isolation into shared purpose with conceptual cost of the burden; orientation anchors early in the observatory with Mira and the telegram. Closure lands on-page via the dawn-painted dome and her added memory card, foreclosing solitary madness with felt communal weight. Minor weakness in elliptical sender's vanishing, but it serves the relay motif without breaking causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The observatory setting is vivid and purposeful, with the dome whispering starlight and telescope constraining choices like adjusting toward Cepheus, charging the final dawn image to mirror revelation; sensory details like whale-song audio and brass housing integrate into action, reflecting POV bias. Micro-setting of the atlas and daylily evolves causally, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism. Strength in how environment pressures the collective arrival, but occupational depth is minimal beyond affecting the discovery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of decoding the cosmic warnings escalates texturally through density of matching patterns from telegram to star pulses, tightening to a meaningful deepening that crystallizes their witness role with cost of ongoing burden; agency in Mira's healing words and documentation forecloses isolation. Pressure coheres under the lens, but stakes remain somewhat abstract, with the madness burden declared more than viscerally tested on-page. The realization of predictions like solar flares sharpens ethical calculus, yet lacks a second optional accent for fuller depth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of shared cosmic burdens emerges organically from recurring dream symbols and generational clues, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer via the daylily's brief bloom repricing human comprehension; subtext in silences and implications, like the vanished sender, invites reflection on isolation without confusion. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality through concrete particulars like the whale song. Minor slip in near-explicit statements like "we carry this together," bordering on moralizing at closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and modest, with Mira's perceptual signature in starlight whispers and tactile daylily; voice texture distinct in rhythmic, lyric prose like "morse code written across millennia," modulating with intensity. Dialogue is natural, subtextual, and advances plot, as in Hayashi's skepticism crumbling. Patterned elision in dream fragments is taught early and pays off at revelation without obscurity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, sentences advancing atmosphere and revelation, like the telegram's swimming words under tired eyes; rhythm varies naturally, avoiding loops, though minor scaffold in repetitive "burden" phrasing. Figurative language is controlled, with metaphors like "sunrise on an airless moon" enhancing without muddle. Strength in propulsion toward dawn closure, but occasional weak modifiers like "strange resonance" slightly dilute specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of astronomy, dreams, and generational relays transforms tropes like mad scientists into a non-obvious relay of witnesses, feeling inevitable through variable stars as clocks; risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity in cosmic solace avoids generics. Minor hedging in balanced skepticism-to-belief arc, but overall authenticity coheres.</comment>
