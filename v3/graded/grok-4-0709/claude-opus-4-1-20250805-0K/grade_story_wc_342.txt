<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyra's motivation to capture the library's essence is clear and rooted in her prosopagnosia, intensifying through tactile discoveries that compel her final crafting choice with felt cost in transcending limits. Interiority is concrete and embodied, showing contradictory impulses like doubt and revelation in her palm-pressing the coin, though guild members feel secondary without applying relational pressure. The meaningful change—reframing her condition as strength—is earned by prior causality, foreclosing isolation with conceptual cost. Quick test passed, but minor stock phrasing in emotional summaries caps at high band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure accumulates discoveries like the coin's map, leading to a Conceptual Repricing closure where Lyra internalizes the library's sky with undeniable conceptual cost of loss, visible in her walking away at sunrise. Orientation anchors early in the tree trunk library at pre-dawn, with no disorientation debt. One meaningful deepening—the light-crafting—tightens knowledge and reweights stakes effectively. Cost proof test passed via the enduring memory amid demolition rumble, though ellipsis in guild arrival feels slightly soft.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The tree trunk library is vividly specific, with carved shelves and worn nooks constraining Lyra's movements and charging the final light portrait, mirroring internal states through tactile details like ladder marks. Sensory hierarchy reflects her touch-bias, integrating into action without stalling. Environment evolves causally with moonlight gaps, affecting choices like mirror positioning. 9+ test passed as the setting directly charges the closure image of dancing shadows.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving the library's essence signals early and tightens once through the coin discovery, forcing Lyra's agency in crafting with light, narrowing options as dawn approaches under Accumulative/Textural lens. Pressure coheres via time constraint, with one deepening that reweights cost in her transcendence. Visible price of the library's loss charges the final image, though coincidence of moonbeams complicates without resolving. 9+ test passed with unmistakable on-page cost in the rumbling machines.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of perceiving truth beyond sight emerges organically from Lyra's tactile art and the library's continuity, with subtext in spirals and reflections inviting reflection on identity without tidy morals. Final image of carrying the sky inside offers a resonant, non-literal answer to limits, reweighting the premise with complexity. No overt statements; insights earned through coin-reading and light-crafting. 9+ test passed via the non-literal reconfiguration of her condition.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and modest, with perceptual signature biased toward touch, as in reading indentations like braille, and rhythmic prose modulating with stillness. Brief dialogue feels natural and subtextual, advancing the scholar's whisper to preserve memory. No head-hopping; elision in time taught and paid off at closure. 9+ test passed with distinct texture under pressure, though minor filter verbs in reflective blocks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in hushed descriptions and propulsive crafting beats, like moonbeams refracting without loops or scaffold. Figurative language, such as fractally precise indentations, integrates without muddle, advancing atmosphere. No major artifacts; final line recharges motifs effectively. 9+ test nearly met but minor synonym churn in "truth" repetitions in peak reflection dulls slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of face-blind artist crafting a library's portrait via coin-map and light transforms tropes of loss and perception, feeling inevitable through tactile details like verdigris indentations. Risk in lyric, accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, committing to premise of unseen faces enduring. No derivative echoes; emotional specificity in transcendence avoids generics. 9+ test passed with non-obvious angle on continuity, earning +0.3 risk bonus.</comment>
