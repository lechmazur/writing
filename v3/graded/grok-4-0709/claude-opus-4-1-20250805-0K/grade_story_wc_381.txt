<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The summoner's motivation to hush the prophecy is clear and intensifies through her patient gathering of fragments, revealing contradictory impulses in her reverence for the wing's power versus her need to disperse it; interiority is concrete and embodied, as in her tactile mapping of silence, culminating in an earned stasis with the cost of solitude evident in the final walk upstream.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through layered silences and prophecy fragments, leading to a resonant reconfiguration at dawn where the wing crumbles and futures are dispersed; closure lands with conceptual cost in the "peculiar kind of peace" from ignorance, and orientation anchors early in the nocturnal haven beside the brook.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting of the nocturnal haven beside the brook is vivid and purposeful, with mist and water constraining choices like placing the wing on a stone; it charges the final image as the brook smooths away footprints, mirroring the prophecy's dispersal, while sensory details like brook-mist and morning light evolve causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><grade>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, the dominant stake of hushing the prophecy escalates through density of gathered fragments and silence pockets, tightening to a cadence shift at dawn; agency in guiding the flow forecloses destructive futures with felt cost in prevented loves and wars, though coincidence in allies' willingness slightly complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of prophecies as living, self-fulfilling entities emerges organically through the summoner's actions and the wing's unfolding, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer that truths are kindest as whispers; subtext in ember-glow versus blaze adds complexity without moralizing, inviting reflection on dispersed possibilities.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The third-person close POV is stable and apt, with perceptual signature in cosmic mud-tracing and silence-mapping; prose texture is distinct in rhythmic, lyric diction like "pockets of concentrated quiet that hung in the air like invisible fruit," modulating with pressure while teaching patterned elision of prophecy fragments effectively at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, as sentences like "She had not destroyed the future—merely dispersed it into a trillion smaller possibilities" advance theme and closure without loops; rhythm varies naturally, figurative language is coherent and purposeful, avoiding muddle in peak beats like gathering prophecy whispers.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality shines in synthesizing origami of crystallized moonlight with prophecy dispersal via brook and silence-mapping, feeling inevitable through the summoner's communion; risk in tranquil blaze tone heightens stakes without gimmickry, transforming familiar mystic tropes via specific, solitary agency.</comment>
