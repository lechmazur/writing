<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mei's motivation to save her daughter drives consistent, intensifying choices rooted in family legacy, with embodied emotions like the "weight of that small body against her chest" revealing contradictory impulses under pressure; the final sacrifice earns a meaningful renunciation with visible cost, foreclosing her identity; interiority is concrete and particular, avoiding stock phrasing; flaws like inherited duty complicate choices without hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds through patterned reflections and cadence shift at closure, with resonant reconfiguration in Mei's memory loss and the new amber bead as proof of success; causality builds via motif accrual rather than strict therefore links, but orientation anchors early in the orchard; closure lands on-page with felt cost, though some backstory blocks summarize without fully tilting present stance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The forgotten orchard in bamboo forest anchors vividly early, with sensory details like "filtered light piercing the bamboo canopy" filtered through Mei's bias; setting constrains choices by embodying the raveling silence, charging the final image where bamboo grows thicker; details evolve causally, mirroring internal sacrifice without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of saving the daughter tightens through deepening sacrifice under Accumulative/Textural lens, with one meaningful intensification as Mei weaves and memories unravel; agency in renunciation forecloses paths with legible cost in lost memories; pressure coheres without coincidence resolving, forcing stance crystallization at climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of latent sacrifice emerges organically from generational weaving and memory costs, resonating in the final image of the new amber bead without stated moral; subtext in silences and implications invites reflection on unspoken messages; ending offers non-literal repricing of family duty's complexity, avoiding tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and modest, with perceptual signature in Mei's selective noticing of threads and silence; voice texture is distinct and rhythmic, modulating with pressure in lines like "the raveling silence crept closer"; no dialogue, so policy skips those bullets; purposeful compression in backstory teaches pattern paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied rhythm and specific imagery like "stoically sparkling" advancing atmosphere; minor scaffold in repetitive "stoically sparkling" echoes but pays off in closure without obscuring; clarity holds, though some metaphors like "time's unraveling tapestry" border on mixed without muddle; high density in peak beats avoids loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of weaving magic with memory sacrifice feels inevitable, transforming tropes through specific orchard legacy and impossible distances; risk in quiet, sacrificial ending heightens stakes organically; non-obvious angle on ancestral messages avoids derivatives, committing to premise with authentic vision.</comment>
