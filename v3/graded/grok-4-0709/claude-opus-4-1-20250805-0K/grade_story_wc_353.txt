<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to revive sound through empathy is clear and intensifies via her symphonically minded trait, shown in embodied actions like swaying to rhythms; interiority is concrete, with contradictory impulses in her tender approach versus the world's suffocating quiet. The resolution earns stasis by foreclosing silence's dominance with felt cost in her ongoing labor, visible in the insulator's new cracks. No second character, so relationship dynamics are irrelevant.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through layered vibrations emerging from the tree, with orientation anchored early in the workshop window and grove; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration via the symphony's mist-like hanging, repricing silence with conceptual cost in recovered memory. The ending reweights the dominant stake without decisive physical change, but the pattern of sound accumulation holds coherently.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The siskin alder grove is vividly specific, with scarred bark and stress cracks constraining Mira's choices and charging the final image of mist-like music; sensory details like moss and porcelain warmth are purposeful, filtered through her perceptual bias. Environment evolves causally as sound emerges, mirroring her internal harmony.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of breaking silence deepens texturally as layers of siskin song accumulate, tightening via feedback loop with the insulator; one meaningful cadence shift at noon reweights options with felt cost in the insulator's fractures. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, though coincidence of tree memories complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of compassion unlocking trapped memories emerges organically from Mira's tender strumming versus others' forceful failures, culminating in a resonant final image of ghost birdsong that reweights the Silence without moralizing. Subtext in the hedgehog's "smile" invites ambiguity about nature's recovery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in symphonic noticing of cracks as notes; prose texture is distinct, rhythmic like emerging music, with purposeful compression in sound descriptions. No dialogue, so those bullets ignored; elision of broader world teaches pattern early and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in strumming beats and avoiding loops; figurative language like "frozen sound waves" is coherent without muddle, propelling toward symphony's emergence. Minor register elevation in "acoustic architecture" fits voice without drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise of tree-song sculptor in a Great Silence world offers fresh synthesis, transforming post-apocalyptic trope through empathetic, non-violent sound revival; risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes, feeling inevitable in the insulator's etched cracks at closure.</comment>
