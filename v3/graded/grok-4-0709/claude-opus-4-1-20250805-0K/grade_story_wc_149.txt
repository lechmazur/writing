<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Marlow's motivation as the bound keeper is clear and intensifies through his contradictory impulses of joy and poison in greeting the ghost, with embodied emotions like the bead's warmth and his final weeping earning the renunciation's cost; the ghost bride's venomous affection applies immediate pressure, forcing the climactic release.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned images of alchemy and haunting to a resonant reconfiguration when the bead cracks, releasing memories and transforming the world with legible cost in Marlow's mournful liberation; orientation anchors early in the greenhouse scene, and causality holds without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The alchemical greenhouse is vividly specific, with luminescent fruits and mercury pools constraining Marlow's actions and charging the final image of transformation to ordinary fruits under dawn, mirroring internal freedom; sensory details like pulsing hearts and crystalline laughs integrate purposefully without excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of repaying the toxic debt tightens through the bead's pulsing and her touch, deepening to force stance crystallization under the Accumulative/Textural lens, with unmistakable cost in the ghost's dissipation and Marlow's cold translucence yielding to liberation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of beautiful yet venomous love emerges organically from images like nocturnal blooms and the bead's longing, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer at the sunrise that reweights the debt's complexity without moralizing; subtext in her whispers and his elation invites lingering ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable with a distinct perceptual signature in Marlow's alchemical focus, rhythmic prose modulating under pressure like the bead's hum; dialogue carries subtext and goal-driven venom, with crystalline laughs distinguishing the ghost's voice naturally.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density and propulsion with varied rhythm, as in the bead cracking's flood of memories, free of loops or artifacts; figurative language like "crystalline frost" enhances without muddle, and the final sunrise image resolves with concrete charge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The alchemical haunting premise synthesizes ghost tropes with fresh ingenuity in the debt's toxic protection and resonant awakening, feeling inevitable at the bead's crack; risk in the venomous affection heightens stakes organically without gimmickry.</comment>
