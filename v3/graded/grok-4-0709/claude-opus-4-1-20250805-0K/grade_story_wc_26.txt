<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to preserve dreams and shadows is clear and intensifies through her comparisons, culminating in an earned renunciation of past regrets with felt cost in her tears; interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions like the warm stone and prismatic light catching her eyes, revealing contradictory impulses between skepticism and belief. Colleagues' dismissal highlights her blind spot, driving her solitary pursuit without stock phrasing. The final micro-choice to transcribe reconfigures her values with visible emotional price.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds density through footage patterns across decades, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration in the vision and purpose realization with conceptual cost of luminous regret; orientation anchors early with Mira ascending the staircase in the blooming library. Causality holds via motivated ellipses in shadow migration, with the metamorphosis as a pattern break reweighting stakes. The ending's charged poise crystallizes her stance without contradiction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The blooming library's glass petals and bio-glass membranes vividly anchor the perpetual sunset setting, constraining choices like activating the interface amid shifting rainbows; this micro-setting charges the final image of deepening dusk colors, mirroring internal regret. Sensory details are selective, POV-filtered through Mira's familiarity, evolving causally with petal shifts. Environment guides her realization without overt symbolism, heightening atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of understanding the shadow's purpose tightens through footage comparisons, deepening to a cadence shift in the metamorphosis that reweights hope's cost with luminous regret; agency in placing the stone and syncing timelines drives escalation under textural lens. One meaningful intensification narrows options, forcing stance crystallization with felt emotional price. Coincidence in shadow's migration complicates but does not resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of hope's metamorphosis across generations emerges organically from shadow's journey and grandmother's dream, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer via the final image of the stone's shadow as quiet witness; subtext in untethered shadow implies unfulfilled dreams without direct statement. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality through complex regret, inviting reflection on preservation's ambiguity. The core concept integrates via specific events like the vision, resisting tidy morals.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and modest, with perceptual signature in Mira's sharp-eyed noticing of footage details; voice texture is distinct in rhythmic, purposeful syntax like "softly deliberate grace," modulating with intensity. No dialogue present, so policy skips those bullets; elision in timeline jumps is patterned and taught early, paying off at closure without head-hopping. Psychic distance shifts intentionally during the vision, serving emotional beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with sentences advancing atmosphere and character, like "fingers trailing along walls that hummed with stored memories," varying rhythm without loops; figurative language is controlled, avoiding muddle in peak beats such as the metamorphosis. No scaffold or synonym churn, with strong verbs and specific nouns propelling momentum. Final line recharges motifs effectively, though minor register elevation in "luminous regret" fits voice without drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The unbound shadow preserving hope offers a fresh synthesis of dream-sharing tech and ancestral legacy, feeling inevitable through footage patterns; risk in textural structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, transforming tropes like haunting into deliberate migration. Originality shines in the stone's constancy across eras, committing to premise implications. Core premise avoids derivatives, with emotional specificity in regret elevating ingenuity.</comment>
