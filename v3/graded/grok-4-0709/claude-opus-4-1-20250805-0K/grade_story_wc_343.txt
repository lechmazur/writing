<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's diligently curious nature is embodied through concrete actions like tracing the hopscotch board and cross-referencing the phrasebook, revealing contradictory impulses between isolation and connection that culminate in her resonant purpose shift. The final renunciation of "great discovery" for rediscovery carries a felt cost of societal disconnection, earned by prior observations. Minor slip in stock phrasing like "understanding flooding through her" slightly dilutes interior specificity, but it doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, patterns build through murmurations and lights to a Conceptual Repricing closure where Elara reweights her purpose with conceptual cost of lost knowledge, visible in the final image of following the birds. Orientation anchors early with the airship and Elara's role. One meaningful deepening suffices, with the breakthrough beat tracing hopscotch in 3D space as a pattern break that reweights stakes without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The antique airship setting constrains choices through its creaking timbers and observation deck, charging the final image as Elara adjusts the wheel amid murmurations. Sensory details like shifting shadows and wind whispers are selective, POV-filtered, and evolve with events, mirroring her isolation. The hopscotch board as micro-setting recurs to charge closure, meeting 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of charting stranded luminance tightens through pattern accumulation, deepening in the breakthrough where birds trace hopscotch, forcing stance crystallization under Accumulative lens with felt cost of isolation. One meaningful cadence shift suffices, driven by Elara's agency in adjusting course. Cost is legible in her sociable isolation, but coincidence of finding the book slightly complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of rediscovering lost knowledge emerges organically from patterns in birds, lights, and hopscotch, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer via the child's handwriting "How to find your way home," reweighting the premise without moralizing. Subtext in isolation's sociability adds complexity. Meets 9+ test by reweighting prior material through the final sketch.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in Elara's pattern-noting bias, like tea leaves and rust stains; voice modulates rhythmically with whispers and breaths. No dialogue, so policy skips those bullets. Elision in blended days/nights is patterned and pays off at closure, but minor filter-verb use like "she noticed" in peak beats slightly dulls immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm from descriptive murmurations to clipped realizations like "They're writing," advancing atmosphere without loops. No artifacts in closure; metaphors like "captured sunrise" are coherent and purposeful. Meets 9+ test with zero scaffold and propulsion in the final adjustment sentence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of starlings as cartographers and hopscotch as cipher transforms migration tropes into a non-obvious rediscovery premise, feeling inevitable via the book's sketch. Risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, charging closure. Meets 9+ test with bold ingenuity in luminous language translation.</comment>
