<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to rectify her loss is clear and intensifies through concrete micro-choices like selecting tuning forks, rooted in her survivor's grief; interiority is embodied in contradictory emotions, such as crying while discovering thermal symphonies, with the tears freezing on her cheeks as a pivotal moment of felt cost that reveals her hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds density through layered observations and realizations in one continuous scene, anchoring orientation early in the conservatory setting; closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with Mira understanding music's secret language, with visible emotional cost in her frozen tears, though the pattern break feels slightly soft without a sharper cadence shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The winterglass conservatory is vividly specific, with refractive walls and thermal systems constraining Mira's discoveries and charging the final image of reflected light on frozen tears; sensory details like pulsing frost patterns are purposeful and POV-filtered, mirroring her internal transformation without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of translating silence escalates through accumulative deepenings like the frost vine's response, narrowing options to a resonant endurance with emotional cost in recalling lost crewmates; under the textural lens, one meaningful intensification suffices, but pressure remains internal and somewhat static, lacking a forced trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of music beyond sound emerges organically from thermal patterns and plant responses, culminating in a resonant, non-literal reconfiguration in the final realization without moralizing; subtext in images like aurora ribbons invites reflection on loss and Indigenous wisdom, with emotional honesty avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Close third-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature focused on visual and tactile vibrations, suiting Mira's deafness; prose texture in rhythmic, lyric syntax heightens emotional beats without elision, and no dialogue appears, maintaining voice coherence under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied rhythm, strong verbs, and purposeful metaphors like "crystallized breath," advancing atmosphere without loops; minor overwriting in prismatic descriptions slightly muddles a peak beat, but clarity holds at closure with high information density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original synthesis of acoustic botany, thermal imaging, and post-trauma discovery feels inevitable, transforming loss tropes through specific details like 432 Hz responses; risk in lyric introspection heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry, though premise echoes familiar redemption arcs.</comment>
