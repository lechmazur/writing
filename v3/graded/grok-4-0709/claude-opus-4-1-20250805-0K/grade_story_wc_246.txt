<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and intensifies from guilt over her mistake to a high-stakes choice between saving lives and preserving discovery, with embodied emotions like gripping the pen anchoring her internal conflict. Interiority is concrete, showing contradictory impulses in her "confident uncertainty" that drives the final transmission of both coordinates. The single-POV focus excels in revealing flaws through micro-choices, such as releasing the straps to act, without stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned realizations about the anomaly, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing where transmitting both coordinates reweights reality's editability with conceptual cost of potential lost knowledge. Orientation anchors early in the observation chamber with Mira floating amid data. Closure lands on-page with felt ambiguity, though the rescue ship's approach feels slightly coincidental without fully complicating the resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The gravitational anomaly setting is vivid and purposeful, constraining Mira's choices by filtering light and signals based on observers, directly charging the final image where it pulses in approval. Sensory details like twisted starlight and microgravity are selective, reflecting her professional bias as an interpreter. The pen as a recurring object evolves to anchor her timeline, enhancing atmospheric specificity without excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of correcting her mistake versus embracing the anomaly's truth tightens through a meaningful deepening when she realizes it's editing history, forcing stance crystallization in the transmission choice under Accumulative/Textural pressure. Cost is legible in forfeiting her timeline's discovery, though coincidence of the ship's shift slightly undercuts agency. One reversal via the anomaly showing personalized histories raises stakes effectively.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of editable reality through contingent relationships emerges organically from Mira's realizations and the anomaly's mechanics, culminating in a resonant final image of transmitting both coordinates that reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext in the pen's symbolism and her grandfather's theories invites reflection on uncertainty's beauty. Emotional aftereffect lingers through the "wrong seeds" metaphor, embracing complexity without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature biased toward signal patterns and scientific idiom, modulating rhythm under pressure like in the whispered revelation. Prose texture is distinct, with purposeful compression in reflective blocks that pay off at closure. Minimal dialogue is natural, though mostly internal; no head-hopping or register drifts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in sentences like "She gripped the fountain pen tighter, its familiar weight anchoring her," advancing atmosphere and character without loops. Some metaphors, such as light bent into spirals, are vivid but occasionally dense in peak beats; no major artifacts obscure clarity. Final line resolves with resonant imagery, though one paraphrase loop in the anomaly description slightly drags momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise of a cosmic editor personalizing history offers fresh synthesis of quantum ideas and human guilt, transformed through Mira's specific choice to transmit both coordinates, heightening stakes with bold ambiguity. Risk-taking in the open-ended resolution feels inevitable, avoiding tropes via grounded sci-fi details like osmium-iridium nib. Originality shines in the "confidently uncertain" trait driving non-obvious reconfiguration.</comment>
