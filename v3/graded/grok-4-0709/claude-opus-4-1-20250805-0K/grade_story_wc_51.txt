<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to weave burdens is clear and intensifies through embodied interiority, with contradictory impulses in her boundary-less trapping that compel her endurance; the final renunciation of leaving is earned with visible cost in her isolation, as seen in the smile after months and the paradox held in the lamp. Strengths include concrete, character-specific emotions tied to objects like the burner, avoiding stock phrasing. No second character, so relationship bullets ignored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through layered patterns and motifs like fractals and weights, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the completed fractal reweights her freedom-trap paradox with felt cost of accumulated silence; orientation anchors early in the grotto with mist and starlight. Closure lands on-page with the reverie ending and lamp cooling, holding the lens without contradiction. Minor hairline slip in mid-story reflection density, but it tilts present stance via weaving micro-choice.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The bronze grotto is vividly specific, with mist, seams, and starlight filtering through vertices that constrain Mara's choices and charge the final image of dimensions settling; sensory details like shingled hush and bronze acoustics evolve with action, mirroring her internal weights. Micro-setting of the lamp anchors simpler geometries, pressuring her reverie. Environment directly shapes the whalebone structure's calcification.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of collecting burdens deepens through textural density increase, with cadence shift in the thrumming whale song forcing stance crystallization on her paradox; one meaningful tightening suffices, as adding the grotto's weight transforms the fractal with legible cost in her months-long isolation. Under Accumulative lens, pressure coheres without needing causal turns. Coincidence of starlight shift complicates but doesn't resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of burdens' weights and self-woven prisons emerges organically from fractals and motifs like the lamp's seventeen grams, culminating in a resonant, non-literal final image that reweights freedom without moralizing; subtext in silence and whalebone reverie invites reflection on joy-sorrow mass. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality through concrete paradoxes. No overt statements; complexity lingers in her smile amid trapping.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in fractal-tracing and starlight alignment, rhythmic control heightens pressure through shingled hush without obscurity; purposeful lyric compression in weaving descriptions is taught early and pays off at closure. No dialogue, so those bullets ignored. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied rhythm in fractal descriptions and hush layers, free of loops or scaffold; figurative language like "suspended pearls" and "whale ribs" is purposeful without muddle, accelerating in peak calcification. High information density advances atmosphere and character per sentence. Minor overwriting in mid-reflection, but it serves momentum under lyric mode.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of fractal weaving with emotional weights and grotto trapping feels inevitable, transforming lighthouse tropes through Mara's gift; risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, as in the paradox charging the final loop of her father. Fresh angle on isolation via boundary-less freedom avoids generics. No close echoes of famous scenes.</comment>
