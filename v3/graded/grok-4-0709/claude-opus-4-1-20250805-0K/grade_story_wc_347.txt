<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned images like the walnut and blueprint, leading to a resonant Conceptual Repricing at closure where Mara's stasis reweights her curse with undeniable cost in continued guardianship. Orientation anchors early with Mara in the labyrinth, and causality holds via motivated actions like guiding with impressions.

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The cliffside labyrinth and mechanical birds constrain choices vividly, with sensory details like scraping boots and forming frost filtered through Mara's urgency, charging the final image of her return to the inverted trees. Atmosphere builds tension through inverted nature mirroring her entrapment, with purposeful specificity in the orchard's curse.

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of guiding travelers while bound by the curse tightens meaningfully when Mara gives away the walnut, deepening her isolation as cost under the Accumulative lens. Pressure coheres through the time clock and birds, forcing stance crystallization without coincidence resolving. One reversal—handing the seed—narrows her options, with moral calculus between saving lives and personal freedom. Cost is legible in her silhouetted watchers disappearing, foreclosing her escape.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of graceless survival emerges organically from inverted trees and Mara's impressions, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in her lies-as-truths, culminating in a resonant final image repricing freedom's cost without statement. Subtext in gestures like pressing the walnut invites reflection on duty's burden. Emotional aftereffect lingers through her quiet endurance, earned via specifics like the blueprint's secret. No overt symbolism; recurrence of the seed charges closure without forcing motifs.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in Mara's efficient, offhand precision, modulating rhythm under stress like her stumbling dance. Prose texture is distinct, with purposeful syntax varying for atmosphere, and elision in backstory taught early, paying off at closure.
