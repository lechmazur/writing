<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's motivation as a root-bound visionary is clear and intensifies through her purposeful curiosity, compelling her to plant the clipping and trace scars, with embodied emotions like anxious elation showing contradictory impulses in the climax. Interiority is concrete and particular, avoiding stock phrasing, as seen in her instinctual guidance at the maze's heart. The final renunciation of isolation into empowerment earns stasis with felt cost, foreclosing disconnection. Relationships are absent, so ignored per guidelines.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned images like scars and mazes, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Mira's signing reweights her root-bound nature with conceptual cost, evident in the final line equating roots and wings. Orientation anchors early in the cobalt glade at dusk. One meaningful deepening occurs as the maze grows, revealing scars and leading to closure without causality breaks. Persistent constraint of time folds shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The cobalt glade is vividly specific, with blue grass parting to reveal earth scars that constrain Mira's tracing and charge the final intersection bloom. Sensory details like shimmering sapphires and warming clipping integrate into action, reflecting POV bias and urgency. Environment evolves causally, mirroring internal understanding, and directly shapes the closure image. Micro-setting of scars and air lines functions as setting, constraining choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of anchoring time escalates texturally through density increase in glowing patterns and spreading roots, forcing stance crystallization at the covenant with felt cost in trembling hands. One meaningful deepening narrows options as the maze reveals scars, driven by Mira's agency. Pressure coheres under Accumulative/Textural lens without coincidence resolving. Moral calculus between attachment and possibility sharpens the peak, though secondary stakes are minimal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of roots as anchors for possibility emerges organically from scars, clippings, and the covenant, culminating in a resonant final image that reweights root-bound as empowering without stated moral. Subtext in implications like forgotten covenants invites reflection on time's wounds. Emotional aftereffect arises from particulars, embracing complexity in Mira's flaws. No overt symbolism or moralizing mars the resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature biased toward scars and roots, modulating rhythmically under pressure like thrumming veins. Prose texture is distinct in lyrical syntax, teaching patterned elision early for legibility at closure. Brief dialogue from future-self feels natural and advances plot with subtext. No head-hopping or register drift occurs.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm naturally, as in the pulsing glade that advances atmosphere without loops. Figurative language like "electricity through water" is controlled, avoiding muddle in peak beats. Minor scaffold in reflective blocks is anchored per BRR, but propulsion remains strong. Final line resolves with charged image, free of artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Surreal synthesis of time folds, scar-linking, and dream intersections feels fresh and inevitable, transforming tropes like future visions through specific cobalt glade logic. Risk-taking in lyric accumulations heightens stakes without gimmickry, as in the impossible roots-wings equivalence. Core premise offers non-obvious angle on attachment, cohering as singular vision. No derivative echoes mar originality.</comment>
