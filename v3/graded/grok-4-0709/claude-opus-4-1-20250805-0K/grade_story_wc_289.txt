<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's motivation as a ghostwriter translating hearts is clear and intensifies through her spiral pattern obsession, compelling her reconciliation with Chen; interiority is concrete and embodied, showing contradictory impulses in her secret-keeping versus vulnerability. Chen applies secondary pressure relevant to her conflict, forcing a stance shift. The final endurance of their connection earns stasis with felt emotional cost in his admission about her letters.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, patterns of repeated phrases and images build density to a Charged Poise closure where the installation and hand-holding reconfigure their separation into connection; orientation anchors early at the temple post-rain. Closure lands with conceptual cost of vulnerability, reweighting prior longing. Lens holds without contradiction, with the spiral motif constraining the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The lotus temple and lily pond are vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like glistening petals and reflections mirroring Mira's themes of doubling and connection; the setting constrains choices by providing the platform for the installation. It charges the final image, multiplying phrases into infinity. Micro-setting of the pond evolves causally, reflecting the post-storm clarity and night stars.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of revealing universal longing through reconnection tightens once via Chen's admission, deepening emotional options under Accumulative lens; agency in Mira's decision to collaborate forecloses isolation with felt vulnerability cost. Pressure coheres but remains subtle without a sharper reversal. Coincidence of his arrival complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of universal love as a shared secret emerges organically from spiral patterns and letter fragments, culminating in a resonant final image that reweights the premise without moralizing; subtext in gestures like hand-reaching carries implication. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality through complexity. The ending offers a non-literal answer to connectedness, embracing ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Close third-person POV on Mira is stable, with perceptual signature biased toward artistic patterns and light; voice texture is lyrical yet controlled, modulating with quiet intensity. Dialogue is natural, subtextual, and advances reconciliation, distinguishing characters through idiom. Elision of past conflict is taught early and paid off in his admission, with rhythmic control under emotional pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm and syntax to propel thematic accumulation; metaphors like "whimsy was simply wisdom wearing dancing shoes" are coherent and purposeful without muddle. No loops or scaffolds, though some figurative layering in the final paragraph borders on density excess but serves closure. Opening anchors voice, final line recharges motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghostwriting and sculpture transforms tropes of hidden love into a universal spiral map; risk in lyrical structure heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry. Core premise offers non-obvious angle on longing, committed to implications. Emotional specificity through encoded messages avoids generics, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
