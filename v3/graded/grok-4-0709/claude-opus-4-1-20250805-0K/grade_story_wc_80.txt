<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Edmund's motivation as a surveyor of lost dreams is clear and intensifies through embodied interiority, with contradictory impulses like stoic composure cracking in the ladies' parlor; the final ritual of hiding the note earns a meaningful renunciation of the pavilion's loss with felt emotional cost, foreclosing direct preservation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through textured details and reflective shards to a Charged Poise closure where hiding the bottle reconfigures absence with conceptual cost; orientation anchors early in the drawbridge rising, but minor ellipsis in tide turning slightly softens causal linkage without breaking lens hold.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The submerged pavilion constrains choices, with details like barnacles and chandelier charging the final image of ripples and hidden archive; sensory specificity through water lapping and verdigris inkwell reflects POV bias, evolving causally to mirror internal loss.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving abandoned dreams tightens through deepening pressure of the turning tide and shifting structure, forcing stance crystallization in the hiding ritual under Accumulative lens; cost is felt in the whispered words and carried absence, though one more explicit trade-off could elevate.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of interlaced absence emerges organically from images like empty seats amplifying silence, culminating in a resonant final image that reweights preservation without moralizing; subtext in the inkwell and hidden note invites reflection on loss's cost, avoiding sentimentality through concrete ritual.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable with distinct perceptual signature in selective noticing of grooves and seaweed; prose texture modulates rhythmically, as in the echoing inkwell click, with purposeful compression teaching accumulative pattern paid off at closure; no dialogue present, so policy skips those bullets.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with vivid, propulsion-driven sentences like "water lapped against the submerged orchestra pit," varying rhythm without loops or artifacts; figurative language is controlled and coherent, enhancing momentum through the ritual without overwriting in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of surveyor role with archeology of dreams transforms erosion trope through specific ritual of hidden notes, feeling inevitable in the cornerstone gap; risk in hushed, reflective tone heightens emotional stakes without gimmickry, though premise echoes familiar flood narratives slightly.</comment>
