<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Senna's motivation is clear and intensifies compellingly from curiosity to sorrowful choice, rooted in her perceptive trait and family legacy; interiority is concrete, with embodied contradictions like aching bones and melancholy mist, culminating in an earned decisive change with the felt cost of leaving her life behind. The single-POV focus excels in showing her internal conflict through micro-choices, such as pressing the shell to her ear, without needing secondary characters. A minor slip in stock phrasing like "bones ache with recognition" slightly dilutes specificity, but it doesn't touch the closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds density through layered revelations and voices, leading to a Decisive Change in the final paragraph where Senna sings herself into the echo with the visible cost of dissolution and abandonment; orientation anchors early in the canyon under stars. The lens holds without contradiction, with persistent constraints like the shell's whispers shaping tactics toward closure. One hairline slip in mid-story ellipsis feels slightly unmotivated but doesn't harm the resonant ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The serpentine nexus under starlight is vividly specific, with sensory details like red rock and shimmering walls that constrain Senna's actions and charge the final image of her dissolution; the setting evolves causally, mirroring her transformation as walls become instruments. Micro-setting of the shell as a tool integrates seamlessly, pressuring choices without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake of accepting the invitation tightens meaningfully through progressive disclosures, narrowing options with urgent voices and the shell's resonance, under the Accumulative lens; cost is legible in the sorrow of leaving everything, charging the final image. Agency drives the deepening via her singing, though coincidence in the shell's arrival slightly complicates without resolving. One meaningful cadence shift suffices, but the pressure feels somewhat abstract until the climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of echoes as interdimensional conversations emerges organically from particulars like the shell's voices and canyon harmonics, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer in the final image of Senna joining the chorus; subtext in silences and implications adds complexity without confusion. Emotional aftereffect lingers through melancholy, avoiding sentimentality, though one overt statement in the grandmother's voice borders on thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable and apt, with a distinct lyrical texture in syntax and rhythm that modulates under pressure, such as fragmented harmonics during singing; perceptual signature is selective, biased toward auditory details like humming frequencies. No dialogue present, so policy skips those bullets; purposeful compression in revelations is taught early and pays off at closure without elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm naturally and advancing atmosphere through vivid images like "serpentine nexus" and "reed-blown melancholy"; minor scaffold in repetitive echo motifs appears in peak beats but doesn't obscure closure. One mixed metaphor ("carpet of stars" to "scales") triggers a small deduction, yet overall propulsion is strong with clean mechanics.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The premise of echo singers transforming into a universal chorus offers fresh synthesis of acoustic phenomena and mysticism, transformed through specific details like the shell fragment; risk-taking in the lyrical, accumulative structure heightens stakes organically. One non-obvious inflection in the sorrowful invitation feels inevitable, avoiding tropes with emotional complexity.</comment>
