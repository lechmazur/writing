Interiority is concrete, with actions like pressing against the rock revealing caution under pressure. Viktor's presence as a secondary character applies immediate pressure, forcing a status shift in their relationship.

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under a Causal lens, the structure links events through motivated choices, from receiving the pillbox to the meeting and acceptance, with orientation anchored early in the mist-covered Zephyr Bluff. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration where Margot is forged anew, with legible cost in her three years of isolation reweighted as freedom. One meaningful tightening occurs via the snow-codes and Viktor's revelation, narrowing options to her ghost-like role. No orientation debt, as who, where, and when are clear by the first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The misty Zephyr Bluff setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like frozen rock and melting snow-codes constraining Margot's approach and charging the dawn descent in the final image. Atmosphere builds a silver hush that mirrors her isolation and transformation, integrated into action without stalling. The environment evolves causally, from mist swallowing sound to wind dispersing it, reflecting internal shifts. Micro-setting of the cliff edge guides choices, meeting the 9+ test by constraining her prudent daring.</comment>

One meaningful deepening narrows options, forcing stance crystallization on the nuclear mole threat. Agency drives the climax via her decision to deliver, with moral calculus between trust and betrayal. Coincidence of the pillbox arrival complicates but doesn't resolve, aligning with the Causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of fixing what's broken emerges organically from Margot's transformation, with subtext in snow-codes and pillboxes implying necessary breaks for renewal, avoiding direct statements.

Emotional aftereffect is concrete, embracing complexity without tidy morals. No thematic echo or moralizing mars the ending.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and modest, with perceptual signature biased toward spy-trained caution, as in noticing snow-codes. Voice has distinct texture in rhythmic, mist-evoking prose, modulating with intensity. Dialogue is natural, subtext-laden, and advances plot, distinguishing characters through Viktor's careful apologies versus Margot's controlled anger. No head-hopping or unwarranted certainty, meeting the 9+ test with rhythmic control under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere through vivid images like mist as a living thing, without loops or scaffold.

No major artifacts obscure closure, though some metaphors like "silver hush" repeat purposefully for texture. Final line resolves resonantly, charging motifs without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The premise twists the burned-spy trope by repricing betrayal as liberation, feeling organic through specific details like GRU snow-codes.
