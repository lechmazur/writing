<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lila's motivation as a "cursed" noticer intensifies compellingly to her ministry realization, with embodied emotions in her acceptance of impossible things; internal conflict shows through her faith in planting without permission, earning the renunciation of madness with felt cost in the tea house scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with patterned elisions of impossible intrusions building to a Conceptual Repricing closure where Lila's awareness frees the spirit, with conceptual cost in reweighting her gift; orientation anchors early via the bread and palace, but minor ellipsis in the door's appearance slightly softens causality without breaking it.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The overgrown palace courtyard constrains choices by hiding entrances and gardens, charging the final image of spreading plantings; sensory details like warm bread and jasmine vines are purposeful, mirroring Lila's attentive worldview and evolving causally with her discoveries.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of witnessing impossibles escalates through accumulative deepenings like the bread's revelation, forcing stance crystallization in accepting her role; one meaningful cadence shift narrows options with felt cost in freeing the grandfather, though coincidence of the door complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of sacred in ordinary emerges organically from images like bread-memories and guerrilla gardens, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer via the tea tasting of future rain, reweighting persistence without moralizing; subtext in moths and shadows invites reflection on attention's power.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person close POV stays stable with distinct perceptual signature in Lila's biased noticing of anomalies; prose texture in rhythmic, lyric diction teaches patterned elision early and pays off at closure; dialogue carries subtext, advancing revelations naturally.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with vivid, propulsion sentences like "bread uncloaked itself slowly" advancing atmosphere and theme; zero loops or artifacts, but one mixed metaphor in "wings writing stories" slightly muddles without harming closure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of magical realism with guerrilla gardening transforms tropes into a non-obvious angle on attention as absolution; risk in lyric accumulations heightens stakes organically, feeling inevitable in the seeds' promise without gimmickry.</comment>
