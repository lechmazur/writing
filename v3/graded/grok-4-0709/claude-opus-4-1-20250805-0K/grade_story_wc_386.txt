<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marina's motivation as a wreck-diver turned ghost whisperer is clear and intensifies compellingly, rooted in fifteen years of evolving purpose that culminates in transcribing the formula; interiority is concrete and embodied, with her recognition sustaining the chemist's ghost revealing character under pressure. Internal conflict shows through her careful weaving of truths, avoiding forced meaning, and the final endurance of her role forecloses simpler paths with felt cost. Weakness lies in slightly stock emotional phrasing during the chemist's revelation, but it doesn't undermine the earned stance crystallization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through patterned visions and revelations with coherent density increase toward closure; orientation anchors early in the glacier shrine with Marina and the snow globe. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration via Charged Poise, as Marina packs the globe and ascends with reconfigured purpose, carrying "borrowed starlight" and the cost of ongoing salvage duty legible in the final image. Strength in how persistent ghost whispers shape tactics; minor slip in ellipsis of transcription details, but causality holds without contradiction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The glacier shrine setting is vivid and purposeful, with candlelight and ice walls constraining choices by manifesting ghosts and mapping wrecks; sensory details like rivulets and frost patterns reflect urgency and POV bias. Environment charges the final image as candles reflect constellations, reweighting Marina's path. Micro-setting of the altar and globe integrates into action, mirroring internal hope salvage without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of salvaging the antidote and truths escalates texturally through vision density and ghost solidification, tightening via the chemist's revelation of twelve more globes, narrowing options with the cost of perpetual duty. One meaningful deepening changes knowledge, forcing stance crystallization under Accumulative/Textural lens. Strength in agency through transcription and packing, with moral calculus between containment and exposure; minor weakness in abstract stakes until the formula's angle-specific visibility.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of salvaging purity from wreckage emerges organically through images like melted globes and dream cameos, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in the dead's patience and Marina's burden. Subtext in silences and implications, like ghosts fading at dawn, invites reflection on connections between worlds. Final image offers resonant, non-literal answer by reweighting her role without stated moral, tying to core concept of windows.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and apt, with perceptual signature in Marina's reading of frost patterns and dream architecture; voice modulates rhythmically under pressure, like wind-like ghost dialogue. Dialogue is natural, subtextual, and advances plot, distinguishing chemist's idiom from Marina's. Purposeful compression in visions is taught early and pays off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm and syntax to propel revelations; no loops or scaffolds, as sentences advance atmosphere and character without redundancy. Figurative language like "borrowed starlight" is controlled and payoff-driven in peak beats. Opening anchors voice, final line resolves by recharging motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Originality in synthesizing wreck-diving with ghost whispering and dream analysis feels organic and non-obvious, transforming tropes through specific antidote encoding in melted architecture. Fresh inflection in constellation mapping and salvage artist role heightens stakes without gimmickry. Commits to premise's implications boldly, with emotional specificity avoiding generics.</comment>
