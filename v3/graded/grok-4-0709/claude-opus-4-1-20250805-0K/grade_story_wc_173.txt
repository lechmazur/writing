<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyralei's motivation to defy her vows through liberation is clear and intensifies via absorbed echoes, compelling her final transformation; interiority is concrete in embodied gestures like untangling threads, showing contradictory impulses between discipline and rebellion. Emotions are embodied in her dance and sighs, avoiding stock phrasing, with the resolution earning stasis by accepting the cost of absence. However, some internal conflict feels summarized rather than simultaneous in scene, slightly softening peak pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through layered echoes, each unraveling tightening knowledge and leading to resonant reconfiguration at the sanctuary's opening, with conceptual cost legible in the melted snow and her transformed self. Orientation anchors early in the silver courtyard under snow. Closure lands on-page with undeniable pressure via released echoes reweighting devotion, and persistent thread constraints shape her tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The silver courtyard under snow is vivid and purposeful, with flakes catching starlight mirroring scattered echoes, constraining choices as she dances and untangles; sensory details like humming threads and melting circles charge the final image. Environment evolves causally, reflecting her rebellion, and spatial choreography tracks cleanly. Micro-setting of her body as poetic tool integrates seamlessly, heightening atmosphere without excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of liberating echoes from conformity escalates via accumulative density of absorbed memories, deepening her resolve and narrowing options toward transformation, with one meaningful cadence shift at the door's opening forcing stance crystallization. Cost is felt in her untamed state and the Academy's impending discovery. Agency drives untangling as renunciation of prescribed role, though coincidence of echoes' responses slightly complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of desire mastered without submission emerges organically from untangling actions and echo absorptions, culminating in a resonant final image of melted snow reweighting beauty's self-service without moralizing. Subtext in gestures like sighs and smiles invites reflection on transformation's space. Emotional aftereffect lingers through her authentic self-reflection, embracing complexity without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in poetic noticing of threads and echoes biased by her training; prose texture distinct in rhythmic, suggestive syntax modulating with intensity. No dialogue present, so policy skips evaluation. Patterned elision in echo rushes is taught early and pays off at closure without obscurity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, sentences advancing atmosphere and character via vivid images like "scattered diamonds across marble"; rhythm varies naturally, avoiding loops, though some figurative stacks in peak beats like unraveling memories risk muddle but pay off in momentum. No artifacts obscure closure, with strong verbs and specific nouns propelling to the resonant end. Opening anchors voice, final line recharges motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original synthesis of chaste courtesan paradox with echo-harvesting transforms seduction tropes into liberation narrative, feeling inevitable through grounded untangling mechanics; risk in poetic abstraction heightens stakes without gimmickry. Fresh angle on conformity via bodily poetry avoids stock, with emotional specificity in absorbed rebellions personalizing the arc.</comment>
