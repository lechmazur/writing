<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Kira's motivation to find her mother is clear and intensifies through sensory navigation, with embodied emotions like the shard's warmth matching her heartbeat revealing contradictory impulses of hope and dread; the final renunciation of destructive mapping for repairs shows earned endurance with visible cost in accepting their curse. However, interiority occasionally slips into stock phrasing like "the weight of the withheld truth," slightly abstracting emotions without full embodiment in peak moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The causal lens holds with because/therefore linkages in each redirect narrowing options toward the nexus revelation, culminating in an on-page Decisive Change where they weave repairs, with felt cost in the universes' fraying edges; orientation anchors early in the repair bay, though deliberate disorientation through synesthesia pays off at closure. Minor redundancy in universe descriptions slightly dilutes propulsion without breaking causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport repair bay anchors spatially and evolves causally through redirects, with vivid sensory details like rust tasting of copper bells filtered through Kira's map-maker bias, constraining choices by pulling her toward the nexus; the micro-setting of the shard as a tool charges the final image of dissolution, mirroring internal restoration without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Under the causal lens, the dominant stake of discovering the withheld truth tightens meaningfully through the shard's deliberate path, forcing a trade-off in accepting mapping's damage with visible cost in frayed realities; one deepening reversal at the nexus crystallizes stance, though coincidence in the shard's cyclic appearances slightly complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of exploration as both gift and curse emerges organically from sensory mappings and the revelation of tears in reality, with the final image of weaving repairs offering a resonant, non-literal reconfiguration without moralizing; subtext in the shard's pulses implies withheld love, inviting reflection on generational costs.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable with perceptual signature in synesthetic translations, like grease as violet whispers, modulating rhythm under pressure; dialogue is natural and subtextual, advancing the plot through harmonics in the mother's voice, with no head-hopping or unwarranted certainty.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density in sensory images advancing atmosphere, like the shard pulsing against her palm, but occasional paraphrase loops in universe descriptions (e.g., repeated "redirect" phrasing) create minor template cadence without obscuring closure; rhythm varies naturally, though some metaphors like "quantum foam" feel slightly stock.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The premise of sensory map-making across universes offers fresh synthesis in translating senses to navigate realities, transforming the trope of parallel worlds through Kira's embodied synesthesia and the risk of dimensional tears; the cyclic shard inflects boldly, heightening stakes organically without gimmickry.</comment>
