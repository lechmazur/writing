<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Vera's motivation to map digital patterns is clear and intensifies through her algorithmic card-laying, rooted in inherited intuition, but internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses in scene, trending toward summary over embodiment; the revelation to Marcus feels earned yet without a visible micro-choice cost under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure accumulates patterns via cards and tape to a Conceptual Repricing closure where the community's persistence reweights digital value with conceptual cost of crash lessons; orientation anchors early in the loft, but ellipsis in backstory reflection slightly loosens causality without harming the resonant ending image of rain and ghost data.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The rain-beaded skylight loft anchors atmosphere vividly, with sensory details like drumming rain and humming servers constraining Vera's revelations and charging the final image of flickering lights; selective specificity mirrors her curious bias, evolving causally with the storm's intensification to heighten thematic persistence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake in mapping cultural survival escalates texturally through card patterns and 43-day intervals, deepening to prove archival redundancy with conceptual cost of centralized failure; one meaningful cadence shift at the heat map reveal narrows options under Accumulative lens, though agency leans observational without a sharper trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of human connections persisting beyond crashes emerges organically from card motifs and diaspora patterns, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer that value lies in relational flows; subtext in inherited mystery adds complexity without moralizing, enriched by ambiguity in digital ghosts.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person close POV stays stable with perceptual signature in Vera's algorithmic gaze, modulating rhythm with rain's percussion; dialogue pursues goals naturally with subtext in Marcus's whispers, distinguishing voices through academic wariness versus intuitive confidence, though brief elision in backstory is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose density advances atmosphere via prismatic rain and onyx cards without loops, varying rhythm purposefully; minor scaffold in repetitive "patterns" phrasing dulls one beat, but strong verbs and concise images propel to the charged final line of mapping ruins.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cartomancy with digital archaeology transforms post-crash tropes through Vera's carbonized ink and 43-day rhythms, heightening stakes with bold risk in conceptual persistence; the non-obvious archival fragmentation feels inevitable, avoiding stock metaphors for authentic ingenuity.</comment>
