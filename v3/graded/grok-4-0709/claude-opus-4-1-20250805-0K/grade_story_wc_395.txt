<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lila's motivation is clear and rooted in her father's disappearance, intensifying through discoveries to compel her final choice to join the archived; interiority is concrete and embodied, with contradictory impulses shown in her lie to the supervisor and breadcrumb creation. The mission patch serves as a recurring object revealing character under pressure, and her flaws, like obsessive attention to patterns, complicate choices with a felt cost in the ending. Strength lies in the hierarchy of values revealed in her micro-choice to initiate the protocol, foreclosing her physical existence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned discoveries and density increases, leading to a Decisive Change in the final initiation with visible cost of becoming a digital ghost; orientation anchors early in the office between floors. Causality holds via breadcrumb anomalies accumulating to the shadow network reveal, with the closure reweighting her father's fate. Minor slip in ellipsis between realizations doesn't break lens coherence at climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The social network archive setting is vivid and purposeful, with towers of servers constraining Lila's searches and mirroring her isolation; sensory details like the mission patch's warmth and flickering screen evolve with events, charging the final image. Atmosphere of sensed absence supports the theme, and micro-setting of digital layers guides choices without stalling momentum. Strength in how the environment pressures her discovery of coordinates in a recipe, making it indispensable to the arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of uncovering the missing persons' fate escalates through accumulative patterns, with a meaningful deepening in the shadow network discovery narrowing options and raising the cost of self-archiving; agency in her decision to lie and initiate the protocol drives pressure. Coherent under lens, with one tightening sufficient, but cost feels more conceptual than viscerally embodied in the climax. Strength in how the recurring number forces stance crystallization with undeniable pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of digital absence as presence emerges organically from particulars like ghost profiles and compressed consciousness, culminating in a resonant final image that reweights the premise without moralizing; subtext in encoded messages and the patch invites reflection on loss. Emotional aftereffect is concrete, avoiding sentimentality through complexity. Strength in the non-literal answer to "where deleted files go—they go home," repricing human connection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable and apt, with perceptual signature biased toward anomalies like RGB values; voice texture in rhythmic, patterned diction suits the accumulative lens and teaches elision early. Brief dialogue in the lie feels natural and subtextual, advancing the plot. Strength in prose modulating with intensity, as in the flickering screen during initiation, without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm and syntax to propel discoveries; metaphors like "graveyard of deleted profiles" are purposeful without muddle. Minor scaffold in repetitive pattern descriptions, but no loops obscure closure; final line resolves with resonant image. Strength in information propulsion during the coordinates decode, doing double duty for character and atmosphere.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of data archaeology and space mission echoes transforms missing persons trope into a digital afterlife premise, with ingenuity in encoding methods like recipe coordinates feeling inevitable; risk in conceptual repricing heightens stakes without gimmickry. Authenticity shines in singular vision of archived consciousness, avoiding derivatives. Strength in the non-obvious twist of "We're not missing. We're archived," grounded in prior particulars.</comment>
