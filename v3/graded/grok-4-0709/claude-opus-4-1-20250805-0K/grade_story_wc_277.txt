<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Margot's motivation to protect the family empire while grappling with truth is clear and intensifies through contradictory impulses, embodied in her trembling hand and the "goodbye kiss to honesty," earning the final renunciation with visible cost of personal integrity; interiority is concrete and particular, avoiding stock phrasing, with flaws like devotion to observation driving inevitable choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, patterns of celestial metaphors and reflective insights build density to a Resonant Reconfiguration in crafting the third story, with felt cost in sealing away honesty; orientation anchors early in the observatory, but minor ellipsis in the journalist's call slightly softens causal linkage without harming closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The echoing observatory above clouds vividly anchors atmosphere, with brass instruments and dome constraining Margot's reflective process and charging the final image of dawn-glowing clouds like newsprint; sensory details are selective and POV-biased, mirroring internal orbits of regret to guide her choice without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving the empire vs. revealing truth tightens through deepening realizations under Accumulative lens, culminating in a stance crystallization with felt cost of forgoing honesty; one meaningful deepening suffices, but coincidence of the ambassador's diary complicates without resolving, keeping pressure coherent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of elusive, orbital truth emerges organically from celestial motifs and contradictions, culminating in a resonant final image that reweights the premise without moralizing; subtext in the nib's pulse and grandfather's unreported asteroid invites reflection on buried discoveries, with emotional honesty avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Consistent close third-person POV maintains perceptual signature through biased, metaphorical noticing, like shadows tracing ellipses; prose texture is distinct with rhythmic control, modulating under pressure without elision issues, though brief recalled dialogue lacks subtext depth but advances the inciting incident effectively.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied rhythm, high information density in metaphorical layers like "orbits of regret," advancing atmosphere without loops; some figurative density in peak beats borders on overwriting but pays off in closure without muddle, maintaining clarity and concision overall.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of journalism legacy with celestial metaphors transforms tropes of family secrets into a non-obvious angle on truth's elusiveness, with the third-story misdirection arising inevitably from character; risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes organically, cohering as a singular vision without gimmickry.</comment>
