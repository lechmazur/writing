<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Cassia's motivation as a truth-revealer through light is clear and intensifies compellingly, rooted in her backstory with her grandmother's photo, leading to the earned endurance of exposing painful realities; interiority is concrete and embodied, as in her quiet precision and trailing fingers on flowers, revealing values with felt cost in the mother's relief-weeping moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through patterned light motifs and revelations with coherent pressure toward a Resonant Reconfiguration in the final dialogue and jar pulse, anchoring orientation early in the metro station; closure lands with conceptual cost of truth's beauty, though one minor elision in client arrival feels slightly unmotivated.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The emerald-tiled station under moonlight constrains Cassia's actions and charges the final image as she pauses at the threshold, with sensory details like moss-covered stairs and jade pillars filtered through her savvy perception, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism; recurring jar object evolves causally, enhancing atmosphere and specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of uncovering hidden emotions tightens through the moonbeam application, deepening knowledge with a meaningful shift in the portrait's revealed longing, forcing stance crystallization under textural lens; cost is felt in the mother's weeping relief, though coincidence of client's arrival slightly complicates without fully resolving pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of truth's beauty over golden lies emerges organically from light reinterpretation and the portrait's shift, inviting reflection through ambiguity in the daughter's goodbye-joy; final image of pulsing moonbeams offers resonant, non-literal answer, reweighting the premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in light-focused noticing, like silver threads spiraling; voice texture is purposeful and rhythmic, modulating with pressure, though some elevated diction in reflections borders on register drift; dialogue carries subtext and advances revelation naturally.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in descriptive beats like the moonbeams seeping through glass; minor scaffold in repetitive light metaphors during the reinterpretation beat dulls momentum slightly, but no loops obscure closure, and syntax propels toward the resonant ending.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original premise of stealing golden-hour light via moonbeams synthesizes fantasy with emotional archaeology in a non-obvious way, transforming trope of hidden truths through specific flower codes and jar mechanics; risk in luminous tone heightens stakes, feeling inevitable at the threshold pause.</comment>
