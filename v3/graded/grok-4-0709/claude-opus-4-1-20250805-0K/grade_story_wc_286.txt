<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mei's motivation to understand resistance to change is clear and intensifies through her patient observations, rooted in her potter's traits and embodied in clay metaphors; interiority is concrete and particular, with emotions like understanding flooding "like glaze settling on bisqueware" revealing character under reflective pressure. The final renunciation of immediate action for future hope earns stasis with felt conceptual cost of waiting in a fractured world. No stock phrasing mars the specificity, though minimal contradictory impulses limit peak tension.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through patterned imagery of sun, hives, and thrumming to a Conceptual Repricing closure where the oasis's harmony reweights fractured timelines with undeniable patience-cost; orientation anchors early in the wasteland journey. Closure lands on-page with the glass's golden tint and Mei's departure, reconfiguring meaning without decisive physical act but with conceptual price. Minor elision in timeline counting feels taught but doesn't fully constrain tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The scorched wasteland and abandoned oasis are vivid and purposeful, with hexagons and sun patterns constraining Mei's realizations; sensory details like thrumming glass and flattening smoke filter through her potter's bias, charging the final image of rebuilt hives. Micro-setting of the well and hives evolves causally, mirroring her internal harmony. Environment directly shapes the closure by revealing the temporal anchor.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of seeking understanding tightens through glass visions and hive patterns, deepening to a cadence shift under Accumulative/Textural lens that reweights options with patience-cost; agency in unwrapping and viewing forecloses doubt. Pressure coheres but lacks a sharper reversal, with coincidence of smoke signal complicating without resolving. Cost is legible in the echo of wings and world's waiting.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of harmonious kindness resisting fractured time emerges organically from hives, sun patterns, and potter's patience, culminating in a resonant final image of throwing pots amid wings without stated moral. Subtext in thrumming and smoke implies complexity, inviting reflection on temporal healing. Emotional aftereffect of hopeful endurance avoids sentimentality through concrete particulars like "ghost of wings."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable and apt, with perceptual signature in pottery-filtered observations like "precise as throwing porcelain"; prose texture distinct in rhythmic, image-dense syntax that modulates with thrumming crescendo. No dialogue, so policy skips; purposeful compression in timeline fractures is taught early and pays off at closure. Rhythmic control heightens the silent realization without obscurity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, sentences like "the glass thrummed against her spine with each step, a heartbeat from another when" advancing atmosphere and character; rhythm varies naturally, avoiding loops despite recurring thrumming which pays off. No artifacts obscure closure, though minor figurative density in visions borders on muddle but serves texture. Information propulsion strong to the resonant final line.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fractured timelines, phototropic glass, and beekeeping harmony transforms tropes through Mei's potter perspective, feeling inevitable in the oasis revelation; risk in lyric nonlinearity heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry. Core premise offers non-obvious angle on resistance via kindness, committed fully with authentic vision. The sun-pattern method inflects boldly, recharging motifs at end.</comment>
