<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Moth's motivation to destabilize her perfect system is clear and intensifies compellingly, rooted in her fascination with rustling awakenings; interiority is concrete and embodied, with contradictory impulses shown in her hesitation to file the bottle yet proceeding to uncork it. The final renunciation of the library's stability earns a felt cost through her scattering into frost, foreclosing her isolated existence. Strength lies in micro-choices under pressure, like setting type for spaces between words, revealing her hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through patterned imagery of frost and whispers, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing where the library's dissolution reweights reality's negotiability with undeniable cost. Orientation anchors early with Moth's routine in the floating library. Closure lands on-page with the final impression compressing eternity, charging the image of scattering into frost; persistent constraint of the bottle's paradox shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The glass orchard library setting is vivid and purposeful, with crystalline trees and cloud sea constraining choices, like branches shedding pages during rupture. Sensory details are selective, filtered through Moth's bias, mirroring her internal destabilization. Environment charges the final image, as the dissolving library enables her scattering into non-existent frost patterns.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of maintaining vs. destabilizing the system tightens meaningfully when uncorking the bottle deepens pressure, reweighting options under Accumulative/Textural lens. Agency drives escalation through Moth's printing of compression, with felt cost in the library's sinking. One intensification suffices, but coincidence of the bottle's arrival slightly complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of rupture as revelation emerges organically from images like folded eternity and scattering frost, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in negotiable reality. Final image offers resonant, non-literal answer to perfection's destruction, reweighting prior motifs without statement. Subtext in silences and implications deepens complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with distinct perceptual signature in Moth's frost-pattern focus; prose texture uses rhythmic, lyric compression taught early and paid off at closure. No dialogue, so policy skips those bullets; elision of her backstory motivates without withholding for suspense.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm naturally; sentences advance atmosphere and theme without loops or artifacts. Figurative language like "origami made of time" is coherent and purposeful, enhancing propulsion in peak beats. Final line resolves by recharging frost motif cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes surreal elements like bottled whispers and negotiable reality into a fresh angle on perfection's rupture, feeling inevitable through Moth's choices. Risk-taking in lyric dissolution heightens stakes without gimmickry. Transformation of library trope via glass orchards avoids echoes.</comment>
