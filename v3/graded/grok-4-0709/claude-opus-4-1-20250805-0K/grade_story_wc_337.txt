<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's motivation as a restorer is clear and intensifies through her work, with embodied emotions in "lucid unrest" and micro-choices like whispering to masks revealing values; however, internal conflict lacks sharp contradictory impulses in peak moments, slightly softening the endurance at dawn.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through knot-unraveling beats that deepen silence and restoration, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where spirits settle with felt cost of Mira's inheritance; orientation anchors early in the sanctuary under stars, with no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The Prism Sanctuary's crystal walls and prisms vividly anchor atmosphere, with starlight and humming prisms constraining choices and charging the final image of spirits fading at dawn; sensory details like rainbow shadows are purposeful and POV-filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of grounding spirits tightens accumulatively as knots unravel and visions emerge, with agency in Mira's stitching foreclosing restlessness at the cost of her ongoing burden; one meaningful deepening suffices, but ethical calculus could sharpen the peak more viscerally.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of mending fractured identities emerges organically from hemp-thread stitching and spirit gratitude, with the final image of masks as monuments offering resonant reconfiguration without moralizing; subtext in silence accumulation invites lingering ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Close third-person POV remains stable and modest, with perceptual signature in Mira's dream-logic noticing; prose texture is distinct and rhythmic, modulating with unrest, and no dialogue present avoids evaluation pitfalls.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in phrases like "hours dissolved into the work" propelling momentum; zero loops or artifacts, strong verbs, and purposeful syntax heighten the accumulative build to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mask restoration via ancient nets transforms folklore tropes into a singular vision of grounding spirits, with risk in lyric accumulation heightening stakes organically; the premise feels inevitable through Mira's inheritance.</comment>
