<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mei's motivation is clear and intensifies compellingly from family legacy to personal transformation, with embodied emotions like the blood pearl revealing contradictory impulses under pressure; the final renunciation earns its cost through prior reflections tilting her stance. Interiority is concrete and particular, avoiding stock phrasing, though the grandmother's wisdom feels slightly diagnostic in peak reflection. Micro-choices, such as pressing the thorn and key, reveal her value hierarchy with visible trade-offs.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned imagery and reflections to a resonant reconfiguration in the burning and confession, with conceptual cost of exposing the family chain legible in the final image; orientation anchors who (Mei), where (sanctuary), and when (pearl twilight) by the first paragraph. Closure is a decisive change with felt cost, as her honesty forecloses deception's path. One meaningful deepening suffices, with the key's revelation tilting knowledge without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The marble sanctuary under aurora is vividly specific, with sensory details like dripping stalactites and jade shadows filtering through POV bias to mirror Mei's internal erosion; the environment constrains her choice by pulsing with her heartbeat and revealing grandmother's message, charging the final ash-snow image. Micro-setting of altar and tools guides action tactilely. Tone tensions the ethereal light against blood oaths purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of forging to save or condemn her brother tightens through one meaningful deepening—the key's warmth and message—forcing stance crystallization under Accumulative lens, with visible cost in burning options and confessing; agency in renunciation forecloses deception with ethical calculus between competing goods. Pressure coheres without coincidence resolving. Moral trade-off sharpens the peak, though secondary family chain feels slightly under-tested on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of calibrated treason versus honest completion emerges organically from images like the thorn and dripping stalactites, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer as Mei chooses truth sharper than forgery, reweighting prior deceptions without moralizing; subtext in silences and the key's message invites ambiguity about forgiveness's cost. Emotional aftereffect lingers through complexity, avoiding sentimentality. Final image reprices the premise with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable and modest, with perceptual signature biased toward calligrapher's precision and aurora's dance; voice texture in rhythmic, image-dense prose modulates with intensity, teaching patterned elision in reflections that pay off at closure. No dialogue, so policy skips those bullets. Diction fits Mei's lexicon without register drift, and syntax reflects her contemplative state under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied rhythm in sentences like the aurora's intensification accelerating to the flame's transformation; information density high as lines layer atmosphere and advancement, though minor overwriting in stacked metaphors like "jade shadows" and "pearl twilight" slightly muddles one peak beat without harming clarity. No loops or scaffolds obscure cause; final line recharges motifs effectively. Grammar clean, with purposeful fragments enhancing flow.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of forgery as calibrated treason with aurora-lit sanctuary offers non-obvious angle on family legacy, transformed through specific details like the thorn's blood oaths; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes organically without gimmickry. Core premise commits fully, avoiding tropes via Mei's bold renunciation. One fresh inflection in the key's lockless revelation feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
