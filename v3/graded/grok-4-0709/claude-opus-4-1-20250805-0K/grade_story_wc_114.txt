<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation as a fault-tolerant oracle is clear and intensifies compellingly, rooted in her ability to hold contradictions, leading to earned endurance with felt cost in carrying the truth like a "second, wiser heart." Interiority is concrete and embodied, with contradictory impulses shown in her fever-swallowed knowledge and final drawing act. The single-POV focus excels in revealing hierarchy of values through micro-choices under auroral pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned revelations from fever to aurora, with coherent density increase leading to a Conceptual Repricing closure where Mira tapes the drawing, reweighting truths with undeniable conceptual cost in her chest. Orientation anchors early in the station post-fever, serving the lyric payoff. Minor elision in fever dreams pays off without breaking causality, but a slight ambiguity in transition from discovery to nightfall holds back perfection.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The mountain weather station is vividly specific, with altitude and instruments constraining Mira's choices and charging the final aurora-lit image of flowers. Sensory details like thin air and condensation are purposeful, filtered through her oracle bias, mirroring internal contradictions without overt symbolism. Environment evolves causally, pressing intimacy in the aurora's descent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of finding the swallowed truth's weight tightens meaningfully under Accumulative lens through aurora's descent, deepening knowledge with visible cost in Mira's trembling hands and carried weight. Pressure coheres via internal conflict, forcing stance crystallization without coincidence resolving it. Agency in drawing and smudging forecloses singular certainties, but lacks a second optional accent for fuller escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of thriving in margins emerges organically from images like prayer flags and smudged drawings, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in swaying truths. Final image offers resonant, non-literal repricing of impossible beauties without statement. Subtext in gestures like touching the paper enriches complexity, eliciting lingering emotional aftereffect through fever's necessity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable and apt, with distinct perceptual signature in Mira's biased noticing of truths like "swaying prayer flags." Prose texture is rhythmic and purposeful, modulating with intensity in aurora scenes; patterned elision in fever knowledge is taught early and paid off at closure. No dialogue, but internal voice coheres singularly without filter-verb excess.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied rhythm and syntactic control accelerating in the aurora climax; metaphors like "altitude sickness" are coherent and multi-job without muddle. Zero loops or scaffolds, high clarity in peak beats like drawing the petals. Final line recharges motifs with precision, embodying textural specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of oracle gift with auroral botany feels inevitable, transforming tropes through specific contradictions and marginal truths; risk in lyric accumulations heightens stakes without gimmickry. Premise commits fully, avoiding generics with memorable perspective on fault-tolerant beauty. The fever-incorporated knowledge offers non-obvious ingenuity, organic to voice and theme.</comment>
