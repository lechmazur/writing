<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation evolves credibly from grief-born vow to teaching wisdom, with embodied contradictions in her trembling hands and pocket ribbon touch; Mira's feistiness pressures choices effectively. The final renunciation of isolation forecloses her old path with felt emotional cost, shown in pulling Mira close. Strengths in micro-choices under pressure elevate this, though Mira's traits lean slightly toward stock feistiness without deeper contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Hybrid with Causal dominant at closure, as events link through motivated actions like climbing and mending leading to reconfiguration. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration via teaching and mending, with conceptual cost of letting go of rigid tradition legible in the glowing cathedral. Orientation anchors early in the cathedral push; one meaningful deepening suffices, but backstory blocks slightly exceed BRR allowance without always tilting present stance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The orchard-cathedral setting is vivid and purposeful, constraining choices like climbing the rope ladder and charging the final image with rainbow patterns through blossoms. Sensory details filter through Elara's bias, mirroring internal growth via wild trees in holy space. Environment evolves causally, with roots threading stonework, directly shaping the mending climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of mending eyes and bridging wisdom tightens through the decision to teach Mira, narrowing isolation options with emotional cost under Hybrid lens. Pressure coheres via granddaughter's insistence and fading crystals, forcing stance crystallization. One deepening suffices, but stakes remain somewhat abstract until the mending beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of evolving wisdom through change emerges organically from events like using the ribbon and mending eyes, culminating in a resonant final image that reweights tradition without moralizing. Subtext in silences and gestures, like fumbling the sack, invites reflection on grief. Avoids tidy morals, embracing ambiguity in "accidental" wisdom.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person close POV stays stable with Elara's perceptual signature in weathered hands and memory; voice texture is poetic yet controlled, modulating with rhythm in tuning fork resonance. Dialogue carries subtext and advances plot naturally, distinguishing characters via Mira's feisty grin. Minor register drift in elevated metaphors like "deciduous vows" slightly jars, but elision is purposeful and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing via images like forbidden fruit, but occasional paraphrase loops (e.g., vows falling like leaves repeated) and mixed metaphors in the opening deduct mildly. Rhythm varies naturally, with strong verbs; final line recharges motifs effectively. No major artifacts touch closure, but figurative muddle in peak beats like the laugh-lie slightly dulls propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fantasy mending with generational healing transforms tropes through specific details like quartz eyes pulsing like stars; risk in poetic structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Core premise feels inevitable, with emotional specificity avoiding generics. Minor hedging in balanced resolution slightly tempers boldness.</comment>
