<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and intensifies compellingly from her past arsons to the archive discovery, rooted in consistent traits like analytical intuition that drive her choices; interiority is concrete and embodied, with contradictory impulses shown in her "volcanic tenderness" handling fragments. Emotions are embodied without therapy-speak, and her flaws complicate the resolution through genetic memory's cost of isolation. The final renunciation of her arsonist identity feels earned with visible cost in her scarred hands unifying destruction and creation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned revelations from vandalized portraits to the tapestry, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing where Mira reweights her premise as keeper of imperishable memory with conceptual cost of resurrecting a denied future. Orientation anchors early in the monastery archive, with backstory integrated via cues that tilt present stance. Closure lands on-page with charged poise in the final touch, reconfiguring options without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The archive setting is vividly specific with copper-tasting air and limestone corridors, filtering through Mira's POV to mirror her internal discovery; details like carved shelves constrain her choices by providing fragments that charge the final image. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency, evolving causally as she assembles the tapestry. The micro-setting of the tapestry fragment itself constrains and charges closure effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of rescuing the forgotten promise tightens through accumulative deepenings, like decoding the tapestry's molecular structure, narrowing options to mastery with felt cost of her isolated purpose. Under Accumulative/Textural lens, pattern breaks in revelations force stance crystallization, with agency in memorizing the rhythm driving escalation. The conceptual cost is legible in the ending's reconfiguration of her identity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of preserving imperishable truth emerges organically from Mira's arsons destroying forgeries and the woven histories, with subtext in vandalized portraits implying layered instructions; the final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer by unifying destruction and creation without moralizing. Emotional aftereffect arises from particulars like genetic memory's complexity, avoiding sentimentality. Purposeful ambiguity lingers in her transformation from arsonist to keeper.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature biased toward patterns and textures like smoke-tasting dreams; prose texture is distinct in rhythmic, purposeful diction that modulates with intensity, such as "volcanic tenderness." No dialogue present, so policy skips those bullets; elision in backstory is taught and pays off at closure without head-hopping. Narrative certainty matches Mira's knowledge, with inference reading as such in her realizations.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing through images like "lava cooling into new earth" without loops or scaffold; rhythm varies naturally, accelerating in the tapestry assembly. Figurative language is controlled and coherent, enhancing momentum without muddle in peak beats like the final memorization. Minor register drift in elevated metaphors slightly clashes with POV but doesn't obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The premise ingeniously synthesizes arson with ancestral memory preservation, transforming tropes of lost civilizations through specific details like encoded thread patterns; risk-taking in the textural, reflective mode heightens stakes organically. Fresh inflection in genetic memory as "dormant seeds" feels inevitable, committing to implications without retreat. No close echoes of famous works, with authenticity in the singular vision of imperishable truth.</comment>
