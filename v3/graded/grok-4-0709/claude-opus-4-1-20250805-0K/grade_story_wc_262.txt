<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vera's motivation as a psychometric reader intensifies compellingly from professional duty to personal empathy, with embodied emotions like swaying under the overwhelm showing contradictory impulses in scene; the final choice to take the film strip is earned by prior revelations, foreclosing demolition's erasure with felt emotional cost. Interiority is concrete and particular, avoiding stock phrasing. No diagnostic labels mar the crisis moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through layered revelations from the film strip, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Vera takes it, reweighting unused love with conceptual cost on-page; orientation anchors early in the booth, and one meaningful deepening suffices. Closure lands with charged poise in kissing the strip, though a slight ambiguity in lens dominance at midpoint dings it slightly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The projection booth is vividly specific, with Art Deco curves and dust motes constraining Vera's spatial imagination, charging the final image as she carries secrets like seeds; sensory details like cool brass and tasting silver embody the atmosphere, mirroring internal regret and hope without overt symbolism. Micro-setting of the film strip as object constrains her choice to preserve it.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving unspoken loves escalates texturally through accumulating goodbye letters, deepening to force Vera's stance crystallization in taking the film; cost is felt in her heartbeat's hushed thunder, though coincidence of finding the strip complicates without resolving. One intensification suffices, driven by agency under the lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of unused love's preservation emerges organically from psychometric readings and the incubator metaphor, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer as Vera gives the letters an audience; subtext in unsent farewells invites reflection on unspoken stories without moralizing. Final image reweights the premise with complexity, avoiding tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and modest, with perceptual signature in spatial expansions biased by Vera's gift; prose texture is distinct in rhythmic metaphors like "hushed thunder," modulating with intensity. No dialogue, so policy skips those bullets; elision in visions is patterned and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in metaphors like "cupped hands holding secrets" that advance atmosphere without loops; some figurative stacking in peak beats risks muddle but pays off in closure's "seeds waiting to bloom." No artifacts obscure the final image; propulsion strong through selective imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of psychometry with cinema's emotional residue transforms tropes of haunted buildings into a non-obvious angle on unsent letters; risk in lyric density heightens stakes organically, feeling inevitable as Vera carries secrets. Bold commitment to the premise avoids hedging, with authentic vision in the booth as emotional vessel.</comment>
