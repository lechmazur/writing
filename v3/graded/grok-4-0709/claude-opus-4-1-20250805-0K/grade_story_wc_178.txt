<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation as a frugal, devoted astronomer is clear and intensifies through her actions, rooted in consistent traits like purpose-driven austerity that compel her final recitation; interiority is concrete, with embodied emotion in trembling fingers and felt knowledge, showing contradictory impulses of isolation and cosmic connection without stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned realizations and schematic overlays, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration in the final light eruption and sealed covenant with felt cost of her lifelong dedication; orientation anchors early in the descent, and one meaningful deepening tightens knowledge without causality breaks, though the ending's conceptual repricing feels slightly summarized.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The ancient Babylonian palace is vividly specific with celestial ratios and phosphorescent walls that constrain Mara's choices and charge the final image of awakening stones; sensory details like filtered starlight and humming frequencies are purposeful, reflecting POV bias and mirroring her internal harmony.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of sealing the covenant escalates through textural density in alignments and resonances, with one meaningful deepening as the tile uncloaks knowledge, forcing stance crystallization with visible cost of her frugal life; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, though coincidence in alignments slightly complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of devotion bridging infinite via mathematical truth emerges organically from particulars like the magic square and schematic maps, culminating in a resonant final image that reweights the premise without moralizing; subtext in gaps and pauses adds complexity, inviting reflection on empirical irony.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with perceptual signature in Mara's astronomical bias, but some register drift into elevated diction like "dusky harmony" feels unmotivated; no dialogue, so policy skips those bullets; rhythmic control holds under pressure, though minor elision in knowledge uncloak could be taught earlier.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose has high density with vivid images like warming stone and resonating walls, but paraphrase loops (e.g., repeating "empirically ironic" and frugality motifs) and template cadence in descriptive runs dull momentum slightly; clarity is strong, with no major artifacts touching closure, though overwriting in the final paragraph stacks modifiers without propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of Babylonian astronomy with interdimensional contact feels fresh through specific details like time-encrypted cuneiform, transforming tropes with non-obvious irony in measurable devotion; risk in lyric harmony heightens stakes without gimmickry, though premise echoes ancient artifact discoveries.</comment>
