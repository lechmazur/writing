<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to recover erased histories is clear and intensifies through her studious preparations and notations, with embodied emotion in aching fingers and faith-driven actions; interiority is concrete, showing contradictory impulses like excitement restrained by precision at dawn. The monk's brief presence applies subtle pressure, highlighting her solitary crusade. Flaws are minimal, with her traits shown through choices like charting frequencies, earning a meaningful endurance with the cost of perpetual incompleteness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds density through notations and hum modulations, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration at dawn where histories are captured with conceptual cost of ongoing erasure; orientation anchors early with the mountaintop arrival. Closure lands on-page with the lamp switch-off and tea, reweighting her work's significance. Minor slip in ellipsis of night hours, but pattern holds without contradiction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The bonsai forest and fountain are vividly specific, with twisted trunks and water over bird-shaped stones constraining her ritual and charging the final dawn image; atmosphere builds textured urgency through sensory details like hum refraction. Environment evolves causally with light changes, mirroring her deepening notations. Recurring elements like lanterns and moss integrate into action, heightening thematic resonance without excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of recovering forgotten histories tightens through hum modulations at dawn, deepening knowledge with one meaningful cadence shift under Textural lens; agency in her notations forecloses complacency with felt cost of aching fingers and perpetual return. Pressure coheres but remains internal and subtle, lacking a sharper trade-off. Coincidence of monk's arrival complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of reclaiming erased histories emerges organically from her notations and tree memories, with subtext in gold leaf as protest; final image of tea and waking town offers resonant, non-literal repricing of official vs. true memory. Ambiguity invites reflection on faith without confusion. Emotional aftereffect lingers through her incandescent restraint.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in her biased noticing of frequencies and petals; voice texture is poetic and rhythmic, modulating with night deepening without register drift. Patterned elision in hours taught early and paid off at dawn. No dialogue, so policy skips; elision heightens pressure legibly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied rhythm, strong verbs, and purposeful metaphors like "valley's throat" advancing atmosphere; no loops or artifacts obscure closure, though some figurative density in fountain description borders overwriting without harm. Information density high, with lines multitasking character and setting. Final line recharges motifs effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of stationer documenting via lamp hum in bonsai labyrinth feels inevitable, transforming trope of forgotten histories through specific ritual and tree memories; risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Fresh angle on memory and erasure avoids templates. Core premise commits fully with non-obvious moral calculus.</comment>
