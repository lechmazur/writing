<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marina's motivation is clear and intensifies through revelations, rooted in her artist's traits and father's legacy, compelling her to renounce her old life with felt cost in the ending; interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions like trembling fingers and contradictory impulses between destruction and warning suppliers. The final endurance forecloses her public identity, earned by prior reflections without stock phrasing. Relationships are absent, so ignored per guidelines.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through reflective shards with one transition from studio fire to canyon, anchoring who (Marina), where (canyon), and when (after arson) by ~100 words; closure is Charged Poise in the final walk, reweighting her legacy with conceptual cost of assumed death, held without contradiction. One meaningful deepening via frost patterns charges the reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The canyon setting under stars is vivid and purposeful, with frost patterns mirroring internal states and constraining her choice to adapt safely; micro-details like ice crystals on the ledger charge the final image, evolving causally with dawn to heighten resonance. Sensory hierarchy reflects her artist's bias, integrating into action without stalling.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of uncovering father's poisoned legacy tightens once through ledger revelations, deepening knowledge and forcing stance crystallization under Textural lens; agency in deciding to warn suppliers forecloses her old path with visible cost of isolation, though coincidence of surviving fire complicates without resolving. One meaningful cadence shift at dawn reweights options authentically.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of beauty from poison versus safe transformation emerges organically from frost patterns and ledger, culminating in a resonant final image that reweights her legacy without moralizing; subtext in ice's harmless glow invites reflection on adaptation, earned through specific struggles like studio loss. Avoids sentimentality with complex ambiguity in her renunciation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature in artist's noticing of crystalline patterns; prose texture distinct in rhythmic, image-rich syntax that modulates with dawn's shift, no dialogue so ignored. Elision of fire details is taught early and paid off in revelations, maintaining legibility.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in reflective paragraphs without loops or scaffold; metaphors like frost teaching transformation are coherent and purposeful, though occasional elevated diction like "drifting resonance" borders register drift in peak beats. Final line resolves by recharging motifs cleanly, with strong verbs propelling momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of radiation in art with natural frost patterns transforms trope of inherited legacy, feeling inevitable through her adaptive trait; risk in quiet, reflective structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, committing to premise's implications. Avoids derivative echoes with specific emotional complexity.</comment>
