<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation as the orderly records chief is clear and intensifies compellingly, rooted in her meticulous traits that drive her selections under pressure; interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions like numb fingers and trembling hands revealing contradictory impulses of duty and despair. The final vow represents a meaningful change earned by prior causality, foreclosing the library's path with felt cost. Strength lies in micro-choices, such as saving the child's oath, which reveal her hierarchy of values. No major flaws, but emotional progression could layer more irrationality in peak moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds density through Elara's methodical sampling, with pattern breaks like the ancient slide's discovery leading to resonant reconfiguration in her final vow; closure lands as Charged Poise with conceptual cost of the library's fall, reweighting vows' transcendence. Orientation anchors early in the frozen library's corridors. Key strength is the persistent constraint of failing magic shaping tactics, with no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The frozen library setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like cracking ice and crystallized breath reflecting Elara's urgency; it constrains choices, as warmth seeps in to pressure selections, and charges the final image of descent through clouds. Micro-setting of slides and instruments integrates into action, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism. Exceptional specificity in the Vault of Endings elevates atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of saving strongest vows signals early and tightens through accumulative pressure of the library's groans and flickering slides, forcing stance crystallization in Elara's vow; cost is legible in the loss of thousands of promises. Agency drives deepening via her measurements, with one meaningful intensification at the founder's slide. Coherent under lens, but could sharpen moral calculus between competing vows.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of promises transcending oblivion emerges organically from events like the founder's vow and Elara's final promise, offering resonant non-literal answer in the ending image of falling library seeding a new archive. Subtext in gestures and implications, such as slides bowing, invites reflection on memory's fragility without tidy morals. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality through complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable and apt, with distinct perceptual signature in Elara's meticulous noticing of frequencies and frost; prose texture modulates rhythm under pressure, like shorter sentences during collapse. Purposeful compression in sampling sequence is taught and paid off at closure. Minimal dialogue feels natural and subtextual, as in the projected vow.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in crystalline descriptions and action beats; metaphors like "breath crystallized instantly" advance atmosphere without muddle. Minor scaffold in repetitive "vow" phrasing, but no loops obscure closure; strong verbs and specificity propel momentum. Final line resolves with resonant image, though one mixed metaphor ("ice became rain") slightly jars.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Originality shines in the fresh premise of a frozen library preserving luminous vows, transformed through Elara's gently meticulous lens and the founder's meta-vow; synthesis feels inevitable, with risk in the accumulative structure heightening stakes. Avoids tropes via specific details like frequency sampling. Could push bolder subversion of archival themes.</comment>
