<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation as a persistently curious audiologist turned tracer is clear and intensifies, compelling her to follow the pulses despite reluctance, with interiority embodied in sensory details like tasting copper; however, internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses in key moments, such as when the photo warms, trending toward summary over dramatized tension.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under a Causal lens, the structure links events through motivated discoveries like the SOS pulse and dirge rhythm leading to realization, with orientation anchored early in the atrium; closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration when she runs and faces return, with felt cost in her incidental heroism, though the basement revelation feels slightly elliptical without on-page confrontation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium at twilight is vividly specific, with orchids leaning and amber light filtering, constraining Mara's path and charging the final mist-lifting image; sensory details like copper taste integrate into action, reflecting her perceptual bias under pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of tracing the silence escalates causally as faces fade and pulses intensify, tightening options with one meaningful deepening at the dirge realization; cost is legible in the theft's spread, but agency leans observational until the final run, with no explicit trade-off foreclosing a path mid-story.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of incidental heroism and protecting vulnerable voices emerges organically from Mara's curiosity and the voice theft, resonating in the final image of returning faces without moralizing; subtext in the minor-key dirge and mist offers ambiguity, though it borders on overt in the closing line.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with perceptual signature in auditory and tactile biases, like the crackling hearing aid; voice texture is distinct and rhythmic, modulating with urgency, and brief dialogue feels natural with subtext in whispers to the mist.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in metaphors like "breath through broken teeth" that advance atmosphere without muddle; no significant loops or artifacts, though some figurative density in the atrium description risks overwriting but pays off in propulsion toward closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The premise of emotional contagion tracing via an antique hearing aid offers fresh synthesis, transforming ghost story tropes through Mara's occupational specificity; risk in the conceptual theft heightens stakes organically, feeling inevitable at the realization.</comment>
