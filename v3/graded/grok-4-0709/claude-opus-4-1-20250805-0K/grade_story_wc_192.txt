<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The keeper's motivation to sever connections for her shadow-tending purpose is clear and intensifies through embodied reflections, with internal conflict shown in contradictory impulses during the scar-linking moment. Emotions are embodied without therapy-speak, and her endurance forecloses relational paths with felt cost of isolation. The doorknocker ring reveals character under pressure, anchoring her hierarchy of values. No second character, so relationship bullets ignored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned reflections and shadow encroachments, with orientation anchored early at the sanctuary's edge. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration via Charged Poise in the final image under stars, reweighting her purpose with conceptual cost of perpetual solitude legible in the ring's warmth. One meaningful deepening occurs when linking scars, sufficient for length; no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The ashen sanctuary with charcoal pillars and starlight is vividly specific, filtering through POV bias to mirror her internal emptiness. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, evolving with actions like shadows pooling in corners. The setting constrains her choices by isolating her and charges the final image, where stars define shadows without destroying them.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of teaching suffocation through emptiness signals early and deepens via the scar-linking beat, narrowing options under Accumulative/Textural lens with felt cost of her scars glowing. Agency drives the intensification as she places the shadow on her chest, foreclosing relational paths. Pressure coheres without coincidence resolving; one tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of necessary endings and breathing emptiness emerges organically from scar images and shadow transformations, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in her isolation's cost. Subtext operates in silences and implications, like the ring's warmth. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer by reweighting burned bridges as invitations.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature biased toward darkness and scars, modulating rhythm under emotional intensity. Prose texture is distinct in syntax and diction, teaching patterned elision in reflections that pay off at closure. No dialogue present, so ignored; no head-hopping or register mismatch.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm and syntax to propel meditative beats without loops or scaffold. Figurative language like "shadows pooled like wounded animals" is purposeful and coherent, avoiding muddle in peak moments. No artifacts obscure closure; final line recharges motifs effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of shadow-tending as metaphor for self-imposed isolation transforms familiar solitude tropes through specific scars and ring, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry. No derivative echoes; emotional specificity anchors freshness.</comment>
