<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kova's motivation to catch the goddess's echo is clear and intensifies through her preparation and silence-voicing, with embodied contradictions like her hammering heart against steady breath creating authentic tension. The final reconfiguration feels earned by her seven-year training, foreclosing panic with visible emotional cost in the soul-tug moment. Strengths shine in micro-choices under pressure, such as mimicking zigzag paths, revealing her value hierarchy. Minor slip in archetypal fisher traits slightly limits individuality, but they align with motives without stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through layered imagery and pattern breaks, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where the echo yields, reweighting Kova's voice with conceptual cost of integrated wandering song. Orientation anchors early in the sound wave garden at liminal hours, with no disorientation debt. Closure lands on-page with felt cost in the dance and burning spike, shaped by persistent rail spike constraint. One meaningful deepening suffices, but redundant echo circling slightly softens propulsion without breaking causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The sound wave garden is vividly specific, with sensory details like vertical rivers and hybrid blooms constraining Kova's movements and charging the final image of blooming flowers in winter air. Atmosphere supports the feral, liminal tone through shivering frequencies and phosphorescent rain, filtered through her fisher's bias. Environment evolves causally with starlight touches, mirroring her internal steadiness amid chaos. Recurring sound waves as micro-setting directly shape choices, meeting 9+ test by charging closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of catching the echo signals early and deepens through the soul-tug and dance, narrowing options under Accumulative/Textural lens with coherent pressure from circling echo and descending constellations. Agency in voicing silence and zigzag casting drives escalation, with legible emotional cost in ignored fear bells and burning spike. One meaningful tightening suffices, but coincidence of tumbling constellation complicates without fully resolving, slightly undercutting agency at peak. Moral calculus between cure and curse sharpens the choice effectively.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of enduring songs swimming in new seas emerges organically from the garden's transliterations and echo's yield, with resonant final image offering non-literal reconfiguration without moralizing. Subtext in bowed waves and violet smoke invites reflection on readiness, embracing complexity via Kova's flawed steadiness. Emotional aftereffect lingers through the feral lullaby, tied to her internal arc. Meets 9+ test by reweighting premise in the whisper moment.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and modest, with perceptual signature biased toward acoustic details and frequency navigation, modulating rhythm from steady mist-breath to burning spike intensity. Prose texture is distinct in poetic syntax and purposeful compression, teaching patterned elision early for legibility at closure. No dialogue, so policy skips those bullets; free indirect style clean without filter stacks. Meets 9+ test with rhythmic control under pressure in the dance sequence, no elision unpaid.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied rhythm in blooming garden opener and final humming, advancing atmosphere through multi-job lines like hybrid blooms. Figurative language is controlled without muddle, though some density in peak beats borders overwriting but pays off in resonance. Zero obvious loops or scaffolds; clarity high with strong verbs like "transliterating" fitting voice. Minor register drift in abstract "frequencies" at closure slightly dulls, but no artifacts touch ending.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly original synthesis of acoustic fishing and sleepwalking stars transforms tropes into a fresh premise, with non-obvious angle on echoes as prowling cats feeling inevitable via garden logic. Risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes through paradox like voicing silence, cohering as singular vision without gimmickry. Emotional specificity in amber streams avoids generics, meeting 9+ test with bold reconfiguration. No derivative echoes; ingenuity in rail spike's evolution elevates.</comment>
