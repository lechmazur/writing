<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Emil's motivation is clear and intensifies compellingly from quiet persistence to breaking silence, with embodied emotions like rusty voice cracking under pressure; interior conflict shows in his impulse to enter the forbidden car versus stumbling into the garden, earning the final renunciation of silence with felt cost. Strength in micro-choices, such as pocketing the fragment, revealing values. No secondary characters, so relationship bullets ignored. The song moment exemplifies contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, passing the 9+ test with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through image density and cadence shifts like elongated chimes leading to the garden discovery, culminating in resonant reconfiguration via song that reweights silence with conceptual cost; orientation anchors early in the train cars. Closure lands on-page with felt cost in the imperfect voice, holding the lens without contradiction. Minor slip in the convenient stumble, but it serves pattern break without breaking causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The abandoned train and impossible garden are vivid and purposeful, with mist and moss constraining choices like following the fragment's pull; sensory details filtered through Emil's damaged hearing heighten atmosphere. The garden charges the final image by transforming ruin into possibility, passing the 9+ test. Tone whispers through fog and gleam, mirroring internal states organically.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of interpreting silence as possibility tightens through the fragment discovery and garden entry, deepening via the halo fit that forces stance crystallization with emotional cost in singing; under Accumulative/Textural lens, pattern break in the chime escalates pressure coherently. Agency in fitting the fragment drives the reconfiguration. Cost is unmistakable in the rusty voice and resurrection's quiet persistence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of silence as possibility emerges organically from images like carved eyes and shimmering horses, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer through the song that reweights brokenness without moralizing, passing the 9+ test. Subtext in the angel's expression invites reflection on persistence. Emotional aftereffect lingers via complexity, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in fog-like memories and damaged hearing; prose texture whispers through rhythmic syntax matching the misting hush. No dialogue, so those bullets ignored. Elision in the stumble is taught and paid off in the oasis discovery, with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in shafts of light and elongated chimes; no loops or artifacts obscure closure, though some metaphors like "light spread like water" border on mixed without muddle. Propulsion advances through purposeful sentences. Final line recharges motifs effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of circus ruin and magical realism in the living carousel garden transforms silence tropes through Emil's persistence, with risk in the wordless song heightening stakes organically. Core premise offers non-obvious angle on resurrection without gimmickry. The wrong turn to oasis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
