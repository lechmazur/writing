<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's motivation as the last heirloom seed saver is clear and intensifies through her precise actions, rooted in traits like patience from seed lessons; interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions in temporal drift and contradictory impulses in her furious tranquility during sorting. The final renunciation of possession for continuation earns a meaningful endurance with felt cost of ancestral responsibility. Strengths shine in micro-choices, like placing the acorn cap, revealing value hierarchy without stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through patterned imagery of seeds and time, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing closure where the garden reforms and inheritance renews, with conceptual cost of causality's weight legible in the final image. Orientation anchors early in the icebound atrium under Cassiopeia. One meaningful cadence shift tightens as the vortex stabilizes, holding without contradiction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The icebound atrium under starlight is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like subliming ice mirroring internal states; it constrains choices by revealing the oak panels and charges the final image as the garden reforms around Mira. Micro-setting of the acorn cap functions as a tool that evolves and pressures the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reopening the inheritance signals early and deepens through a textural cadence shift as seeds plant in air-turned-soil, narrowing options with the cost of potential causality unraveling felt in Mira's preparation. Agency drives the intensification via decreasing entropy, foreclosing careless wielding.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of inheritance as continuation emerges organically from seed motifs and events, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in borrowed time's texture; the final image offers a resonant, non-literal repricing of power's responsibility without stated moral. Subtext in images like humming seeds enriches complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in Mira's biased noticing of temporal textures; prose texture is purposeful with rhythmic control in phrases like "furiously tranquil precision," holding under pressure without elision issues. No dialogue present, so not evaluated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied rhythm, like the velvet texture metaphor advancing atmosphere; no loops or artifacts obscure clarity, though some figurative density in peak beats borders overwriting but pays off in closure without muddle. High information density shines in lines integrating action and theme, such as seeds planting in air.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of temporal seeds and entropy reversal feels inevitable, transforming tropes of inheritance through specific details like recursive wheat; risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, as in the vortex's chaotic whirl settling deliberately.</comment>
