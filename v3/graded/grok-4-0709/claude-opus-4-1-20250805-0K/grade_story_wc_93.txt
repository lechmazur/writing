<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Yann's motivation is clear and intensifies through her precognitive curse, compelling her to complete the pattern with embodied contradictions in knowing versus doing; interiority is concrete, as in seeing moments twice, revealing flaws without therapy-speak. The final renunciation of curse-as-burden earns stasis with visible cost of ongoing responsibility. Minor slip in grandmother's role feeling slightly archetypal, but it anchors micro-choices effectively.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned revelations and motif accrual, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing where Yann reweights her gift as time's transparency with conceptual cost of perpetual tending. Orientation anchors early in the tidal bluff under aurora. Closure lands on-page with the eels' approval and her new pattern-creation, reconfiguring meaning without causality breaks, though the flash-forward to an apprentice feels slightly elliptical.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The tidal bluff under aurora is vividly specific, with sensory details like writhing green light filtering through Yann's urgency, constraining her rock-placing actions and charging the final image of pulsing aurora. Micro-setting of stones and dust evolves causally, mirroring internal realization. Environment pressures choices, as water and light respond to the pattern, heightening thematic resonance without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of understanding the eels and patterns signals early, deepening through the precognitive flash and eel encounter to crystallize her stance with conceptual cost of endless covenant. Under Accumulative lens, pressure accumulates via motif density, with one meaningful shift narrowing options from herding to guardianship. Coincidence of aurora response complicates but doesn't resolve; moral calculus sharpens in accepting the curse's truth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of frictionless existence as original state emerges organically from eels as guardians and patterns as universe's memory, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer via the final image of Yann creating for her apprentice. Subtext in gestures like scattering dust implies deeper motion without direct statement. Emotional aftereffect lingers through complexity of curse-as-gift, avoiding tidy morals.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature biased toward precognitive flashes and sensory light, modulating rhythm under pressure like in the dust-scattering moment. Prose texture is distinct in rhythmic, lyric syntax that teaches patterned elision early, paying off at closure without head-hopping. Minimal dialogue is natural and subtextual, as in whispering to the dead grandmother.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in aurora descriptions and action beats like placing the thirteenth stone, avoiding loops or scaffold. Figurative language like "living serpents of green light" is purposeful without muddle, propelling toward closure. Minor register drift in abstract terms like "Conceptual Repricing" isn't present; zero artifacts in peak beats support propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of frictionless world with eel guardians and precognitive herding transforms speculative tropes through specific details like fibonacci rocks and star dust, feeling inevitable in the backward vision flash. Risk-taking in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, committing to premise implications. Emotional specificity in curse's dual reality avoids generics.</comment>
