<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marta's motivation as a nocturnal gardener rooted in grief is clear and intensifies through her decoding, compelling the final renunciation of timed rituals with felt emotional cost. Interiority is concrete, embodied in her patient untangling that reveals contradictory impulses between preservation and release. The single-POV focus excels without needing secondary characters, though flaws like occasional stock phrasing in reflections slightly dilute specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through layered discoveries from unearthing the case to decoding threads, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing where grief's circular nature reweights her tending with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation anchors early in the cemetery and silo, with no disorientation debt. Closure lands on-page via her decision to plant the fragment, though the pattern break feels subtly under-tightened at the wind's applause moment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The cemetery and cobalt silo under stars are vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like starlight pooling and wind rattling constraining Marta's nocturnal work and charging the final image of gardens blooming with memory. Micro-setting of the silo as tool shed integrates action, reflecting her priorities without excess. Environment evolves causally, mirroring internal states through velveteen gloom that softens death's edges.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of decoding grief's shape escalates via textural density in thread untangling, with one meaningful deepening that reweights options through revealed intentions, under Accumulative lens. Cost is felt conceptually in accepting loss's seasonality, though pressure remains more introspective than urgent, lacking a sharper trade-off. Agency in renunciation forecloses timed rituals with visible emotional price on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of grief transformed into circular devotion emerges organically from decoding the tapestry, culminating in a resonant final image that reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext in frayed threads and garden tending invites reflection on memory's encoding, with emotional honesty avoiding sentimentality. The core concept integrates through specific events like planting the fragment, embracing complexity in love's survival beyond flesh.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable and apt, with perceptual signature biased toward tender, garden-filtered noticing that modulates rhythm under insight's pressure. Prose texture is distinct in poetic syntax and word choice, teaching patterned elision in shifting engravings without confusion. No dialogue present, so policy skips those bullets; elision pays off at closure with legible reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere through vivid images like threads forming script, though minor figurative muddle in "uncharted echoes" slightly obscures in one beat. Rhythm varies naturally, with no loops or scaffold, propelling toward closure; sentence variety supports emphasis without monotony. Opening anchors voice effectively, but occasional elevated diction like "reliquary" trends register drift in peak reflection.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Original synthesis of grief as encoded tapestry in a silo-garden setting feels inevitable, transforming tropes of loss through specific decoding and circular intentions. Risk in lyric, accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, committing to premise's implications. Fresh inflection in planting the fragment reconfigures familiar cemetery motifs organically.</comment>
