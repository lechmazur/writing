<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marina's motivation is clear and intensifies compellingly, rooted in loss and duty, with embodied emotions like trembling hands and shaking arms revealing contradictory impulses between longing and endurance; the final renunciation of migration is earned through prior calls, foreclosing her path with felt emotional cost in the brother's plea. Interiority is concrete and particular, avoiding stock phrasing, and her flaw of physical fluctuation drives genuine struggle without hedging. Quick test satisfied as impulses act simultaneously in the cranking scene, charging the closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through layered calls and incremental array adjustments, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration of Earned Stasis where Marina embraces her role, with visible cost in physical strain and emotional rawness at dawn; orientation anchors early in the starlit station without debt. Persistent constraint of moon-phased strength shapes tactics, and the bronze foot's warmth charges the final image. Cost is legible in the stiff fingers and heavy artifact holding her, satisfying the proof test.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The starlit signal station is vividly anchored with purposeful sensory details like groaning array and scraping bronze, constraining choices through failed hydraulics and moonlit weakness; it charges the final image as the station hums at dawn, with the warm bronze foot embodying her anchored duty. Micro-setting of the artifact evolves causally, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism. Quick test met as the environment and recurring object constrain cranking and charge closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of guiding the reverse migration tightens through accumulating calls, deepening with the brother's sulfur fields plea that forces stance crystallization under coherent pressure; cost is unmistakable in physical shaking and emotional clenching, driven by Marina's agency in endurance. Under Accumulative/Textural lens, density increases via pattern of cryptic guidance, reweighting her role without coincidence resolving. Quick test satisfied, though one more visible trade-off could elevate.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of duty amid inevitable loss emerges organically from particulars like constellation promises and poisoned paths, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in unkept assurances; the final image of the warm bronze foot offers a resonant, non-literal reconfiguration of her calling without stated moral. Subtext in silences and implications, like the child's cry, invites reflection on migration's pull. Quick test met, though thematic resonance could deepen with one counter-reading.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in scarred hands and starlit whispers, modulating rhythm under stress without register drift; dialogue is natural, subtextual, and goal-driven, distinguishing voices like the child's simplicity from Diego's whisper. No head-hopping or unmotivated elision; psychic distance shifts intentionally in reflective moments. Quick test satisfied with rhythmic control and taught patterns in cryptic calls.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in short sentences during strain and longer flows in guidance, free of loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; strong verbs and specific details propel momentum, as in the bronze foot scraping concrete. No artifacts touch closure, with clean mechanics and purposeful syntax. Quick test met with zero redundancy and propulsion heightening the dawn release.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original synthesis of patchwork identity and reverse migration feels inevitable, transforming tropes through specific details like moon-phased strength and word-built paths; risk in quiet stasis heightens emotional stakes without gimmickry. Fresh angle on ancestral pull avoids derivatives, committing to implications in the sulfur fields. Quick test satisfied, though one bolder subversion could push higher.</comment>
