<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in personal loss and theoretical conviction, intensifying to compel her ritual despite ridicule; interiority is concrete, with embodied exhaustion at closure charging the cost. Weak magic as a flaw enables the gentle alignment, showing contradictory impulses in her persistence. The final renunciation of doubt is earned through prior micro-choices, like salvaging the bell.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under a Causal lens, the structure builds through motivated actions from theory to ritual, with orientation anchored in the first sentence via the viaduct and dawn. Closure lands as a Decisive Change with the fish returning, cost felt in Mira's collapse; one meaningful tightening suffices at this length. No orientation debt, as anchors are immediate and serve the resonant ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The sapphire viaduct is vividly specific, functioning as a tuning fork that constrains Mira's ritual and charges the final image of renewal; dawn's equilibrium integrates sensory details purposefully, mirroring her precise magic. Micro-setting of dew drops evolves causally, pressuring choices without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of restoring the cosmic balance escalates causally through the drops' accumulation, narrowing options as reality blurs; agency in her gentle channeling drives deepening, with exhaustion as legible cost. One tightening with the suspended drop forces stance crystallization under the Causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of precision over power emerges organically from Mira's weak magic enabling alignment, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in partial restoration; final image offers resonant, non-literal repricing of impossibility without statement. Subtext in the broken bell's harmonics deepens complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable, with perceptual signature biased toward acoustic details fitting Mira's theory; prose texture modulates rhythmically under pressure, like shortening sentences during the drops. No dialogue present, so policy skips those bullets; no elision or head-hopping issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm naturally—e.g., the bell's singing accelerates propulsion at climax without loops or artifacts. Figurative language like "prayer made of stone" is purposeful and coherent, advancing atmosphere; zero scaffold in peak beats supports clarity at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of acoustic magic and ecological loss transforms tropes through specific details like dripping rates, feeling inevitable; risk in her naive devotion heightens stakes organically. Core premise offers non-obvious angle on vanished oceans, committing fully without hedging.</comment>
