<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sage's motivation as a retired bloodhound rooted in war trauma intensifies compellingly to drive her journey, with embodied emotions like her hammering heart revealing contradictory impulses under pressure; her final renunciation of retirement earns a visible cost in renewed purpose, though Kemp's brief presence adds minimal relational crucible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under the Causal lens, the plot links events through motivated choices like playing the cylinder leading to revelations and travel, with strong orientation in the Heap by the first paragraph; closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration in the valley with felt cost of transformed sorrow, though the child's vanishing feels like a slight unmotivated ellipsis.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The scrapyard and wasteland settings vividly anchor the post-apocalyptic atmosphere with sensory details like rust and cracked earth, constraining Sage's choices and charging the final green valley image as a miraculous contrast that reweights the theme of hope amid sterility.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of deciphering the riddle to find the child escalates causally through the revelations and three-night journey, tightening options with her awakening gift and narrowing to the valley discovery; cost is legible in her physical travel and emotional reconfiguration, though coincidence of the hidden valley slightly complicates without fully resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of translating distance into closeness emerges organically from the leaf's map and Sage's bloodline, culminating in a resonant final image of howling that reweights loss as connection without moralizing; subtext in the waxed leaf's perfection invites reflection on endurance amid grief.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable with Sage's perceptual signature in scents and magnetic pulls, modulating rhythm under pressure like the hammering heart; dialogue is natural and subtextual, as in Kemp's wild hush, with purposeful compression in the revelations teaching the pattern effectively.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose maintains high density with vivid, propulsion-driven sentences like the leaf glowing "like trapped sunlight," varying rhythm without loops; minor figurative muddle in "chromatic compass" is offset by clarity in peak beats, though some elevated diction slightly drifts from Sage's grounded voice.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The premise ingeniously synthesizes post-apocalyptic tracking with magical wax etchings and ancestral gifts, transforming tropes through Sage's specific sorrow-to-hope arc; risk in the conceptual revelations heightens stakes organically, feeling inevitable in the valley's payoff.</comment>
