<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The guardian's motivation is deeply rooted in homesickness and feral transformation, with embodied contradictions like ice crystals in her thoughts driving micro-choices under pressure; her final nod to trust uncertainty feels earned by prior endurance, foreclosing her trapped existence with visible emotional cost in tears and softening nature.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through reflective shards and atmospheric deepening to a resonant reconfiguration at the ending, where opening the Codex dissolves boundaries with felt cost in thawed isolation; orientation anchors early in the frozen garden, though minor elision in her past slightly softens causality without harming closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The frozen garden setting constrains choices vividly, with mist and ice-glazed topiaries pressuring stealth and waiting, charging the final thaw as a reconfiguration; sensory details like crunching grass and perpetual winter mirror her internalized cold, evolving causally to support the luminous dissolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, the dominant stake of dimensional entrapment escalates through deepening homesickness and the scholar's arrival, culminating in a meaningful cadence shift that reweights rescue with uncertainty's cost; the pendant's warmth and shared vision tighten pressure, though coincidence of the scholar's need slightly complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of befriending uncertainty emerges organically from images like light's boundaries and internalized winter, resonating in the non-literal final step into luminous dissolution that reweights isolation without moralizing; subtext in silence and the pendant's spark invites reflection on loss and retrieval.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable with a distinct perceptual signature in feral, fragmented observations like clicking growls and vertical pupils; voice texture modulates rhythmically under pressure, with purposeful compression in reflective blocks that pay off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in sentences like "The pendant hung cold against her chest, its obsidian surface drinking light rather than reflecting it," advancing atmosphere and character without loops or artifacts; final lines propel to resonant closure with clear, purposeful syntax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The premise transforms feral guardian tropes through specific synthesis of dimensional tears and internalized landscapes, feeling inevitable in the pendant-enabled rescue; risk in lyric uncertainty heightens stakes without gimmickry, though familiarity of homesick traveler echoes slightly.</comment>
