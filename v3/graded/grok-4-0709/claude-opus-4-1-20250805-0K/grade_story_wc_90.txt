<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mei's motivation as the last human trained in compassion is clear and intensifies through her meditative balancing of sorrow and joy, compelling the high-stakes integration; interiority is concrete with embodied emotions like growing heavier with knowledge, and her pacifist flaws complicate choices without hedging; the final renunciation of denial earns stasis with visible cost in the release to lightness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the story builds density through meditative patterns on photographs leading to a resonant reconfiguration where the barrier ceases, with conceptual cost in integrating darkness; orientation anchors early in the monastery ship and meditation chamber; closure lands on-page as earned stasis with felt release, though one ellipsis in stitching feels slightly soft.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The recycled spaceship setting with gravitational shifts tied to emotion constrains Mei's actions, like floating or sinking near photographs, and charges the final image of weightless joy; sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, mirroring internal states through shimmering tears; the environment evolves causally as the ship groans in transformation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of integrating shadow to redeem humanity tightens through finding the fractured photo and stitching, narrowing options with coherent pressure under Accumulative lens; agency in using the tear and intention drives deepening with felt cost in recoiling from screams yet holding steady; one meaningful cadence shift suffices, but cost could be more viscerally embodied at peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of embracing shadow for wholeness emerges organically from Mei's compassionate stitching, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in redemption versus destruction; subtext in shimmering tears and dissolving photo invites reflection on denied violence; final image offers resonant, non-literal repricing of human completeness without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable and modest, with perceptual signature in Mei's biased noticing of grief patterns; voice texture is distinct in rhythmic, meditative prose that modulates with emotional intensity; minimal dialogue from AI feels natural and subtextual, advancing knowledge without intrusion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in meditative flows and accelerating at the drop's fall; no loops or artifacts obscure clarity, and metaphors like "oil on water" propel atmosphere without muddle; final line resolves with resonant image, though one simile in ship transformation borders on ornate.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sci-fi shadow work with bodhisattva compassion transforms tropes through specific details like tear-streaked photos and gravitational emotion; risk in conceptual stitching heightens stakes organically, feeling inevitable at closure; premise commits fully without hedging, avoiding derivative echoes.</comment>
