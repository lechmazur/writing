<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s “notably receptive” trait and motivation to safeguard creativity are stated repeatedly but only demonstrated once—when she translates the seed into a new room design. Interiority is lyrical yet abstract; more embodied contradiction or visible cost would push higher.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Mosaic-accumulative lens holds: image patterns (seed, brook, storm silence) tighten until the final crystallization of the new room idea grants Charged Poise. Closure image—“potential … waiting to unfurl”—delivers conceptual cost rather than concrete forfeiture, satisfying the lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Moonshadow Brook, the haven, and the storm’s lingering quiet are vividly selective, serve poetic cohesion, and mirror internal shift. No single physical object constrains the decisive choice, cap at 8.8 rule observed.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake— safeguarding room for innovation— is clear early; small deepening arrives when Elara realizes she must protect her creative process long before the flower blooms. On-page cost is conceptual (forgone commercial timelines), slightly abstract for 8.8+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</question>
<comment>Growth and transformation themes accrue from seed-and-brook imagery, culminating in the corpse-flower room concept. Final paragraph edges toward thematic echo “a reminder that innovation flows...”; slight overt statement caps the score.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Lush, cohesive lyric voice with rhythmic variation. Distinct perceptual signature: storm-born silence, storm-born electricity, “flow,” “hush.” No dialogue to test voice convergence; internal cadence is consistent and modulated with increasing pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</comment>
<comment>Prose is supple, information-dense, largely free of loop or cliché. One minor template cadence—repeated lines seeded with “the hush of…”—creates pattern cohesion more than drag. No artifact appears in the final third to cap score.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</question>
<comment>Familiar “enigmatic-package-sparks-inspiration” frame given fresh weight through corporeal flower stakes and orthogonal tactics. Emotional specificity grounded in proprietor’s nocturnal rituals; not transformative enough for 9.0+ but fresh within its micro-lens.</comment>
