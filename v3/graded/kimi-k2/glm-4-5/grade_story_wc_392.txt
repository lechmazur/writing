<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maya’s interiority is vivid—her “fortified vulnerability” is embodied in the way she photographs dust patterns and water levels. The lantern triggers specific ancestral memories that tilt her present stance, and her final micro-choice (submitting findings) is earned by prior causality with visible career cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Single-scene causal arc: missing worker → lantern discovery → note revelation → decision to expose corruption. Closure lands as Decisive Change with felt cost (“might jeopardize her career”). Orientation anchored by 120 words; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Damp-earth smell, pooled water, and fluttering police tape anchor the tunnel; the lantern’s greenish patina constrains her next action (prying it open). Micro-setting (service alcove) directly shapes evidence collection and final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—uncover truth vs. protect career—tightens when the note implicates city officials. One meaningful reversal: lantern shifts from artifact to smoking gun. Cost is legible: “might jeopardize her career.”</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of historical complicity and present-day corruption emerges organically through the lantern’s journey. Final image (“lantern’s light had guided people…now it would illuminate her path”) offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Maya’s perceptual signature—“watchfully calm,” selective attention to forensic detail. No head-hopping; diction (“greenish patina,” “water-damaged”) remains within her lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and propulsive: “She photographed everything…tucked the evidence into her case.” No loops or scaffold; sensory details are purpose-driven. Occasional elevated phrasing (“reverberate with history”) stays within reflective beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Fusing underground-railroad artifact with modern subway neglect feels fresh; the lantern’s dual role as historical beacon and evidence container is non-obvious yet inevitable. Specific family backstory personalizes the trope.</comment>
