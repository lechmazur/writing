<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—her stained fingers, humming, and skin-tinged transformation—but the “always emerges transformed” trait is asserted more than dramatized; the moonstone moment supplies a micro-choice that just earns the change, yet the cost feels gentle rather than crucible-forged.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of seed-sorting → moonstone discovery → glowing monument → decoded warning. Closure is a Charged Poise: the moonstone monument glows, reconfiguring Elara’s attunement and the arbor’s future, with the cost of perpetual bodily change legible in “already feeling the first whispers of next year’s transformation.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The ashen arbor’s shimmer, mossy platform, and chlorophyll-stained tools create a tactile micro-setting that constrains Elara’s ritual precision; the moonstone’s internal swirl mirrors the arbor’s breathing glow, charging the final image with cosmic scale without ever leaving the platform.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decode the leaves to warn the dwellers—is signaled early and tightens when the moonstone appears, forcing faster pattern-reading. The cost is diffuse (bodily transformation) rather than a concrete forfeiture, so escalation feels atmospheric rather than crucible-level.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of cyclical memory and foresight emerges through seed monuments and leaf patterns; the moonstone reweights the Sky Lily tribute into a living prophecy. No moralizing—just the quiet, mossy recognition that transformation is the price of knowledge.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise: “mossy delight,” “slumbering beast breathing softly,” perceptual signature of a botanist-mystic. Syntax modulates with ritual calm; no head-hopping or register drift. Compression in “impossible speed” beat heightens pressure without clarity loss.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; figurative language (“universe of swirling light”) is selective and tied to stakes. One minor loop—“always emerged transformed always”—is the only detectable scaffold. Rhythm breathes with the arbor’s pulse, accelerating only at the decoding climax.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Folkloric seed-sorting arborist who reads futures in leaves is fresh; the moonstone-as-prophetic-lens twist feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risk lies in the quiet lyric mode, but coherence never wavers; the Sky Lily monument fuses memory and prophecy in a way no template replicates.</comment>
