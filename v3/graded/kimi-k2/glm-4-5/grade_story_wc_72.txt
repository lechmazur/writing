<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is evocative but abstract; the diver’s shift from certainty to nuanced doubt is shown through the ampoule vision rather than embodied micro-choices. The statue’s “incisively kind” trait is stated more than enacted. Cost is felt in the diver’s new stance, yet the beat is more epiphany than earned contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the diver’s stance crystallizes with visible cost—returning “not with answers, but with better questions.” Causal chain holds under Accumulative/Textural lens; each revelation layer deepens stakes until the final image reweights meaning.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Garden’s bioluminescent corals and silted archways are vivid and selective; the ampoule’s purple shadows charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clear; environment subtly guides the diver’s reach and the statue’s offer. No props teleport; ruins remain consistent.</comment>

<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—diver’s need to integrate the city’s truth—tightens through each spectral vision; the final stance forecloses naive certainty. Pressure is coherent and intensifies via the ampoule’s expanding memories. Cost is conceptual but legible.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of embracing uncertainty emerges from the city’s cautionary fate and the diver’s embodied experience; no moralizing summary. Final image of “better questions” offers non-literal resonance that reweights prior material. Subtext operates in the statue’s silence and the shifting ampoule light.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays anchored to the diver’s perception; telepathic voice is distinct and consistent. Prose texture is lyrical yet controlled; no head-hopping. Sensory detail is filtered through diver’s urgency—narrowed focus on the ampoule’s shifting light.</comment>

<grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm modulates with pressure; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is selective—“purple shadows,” “layers of sediment”—and supports rather than obscures. Occasional elevated diction (“incisively kind,” “conceptual repricing”) slightly drifts from POV lexicon but does not muddle closure.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Forgotten underwater city, living statue, and memory-liquid ampoule synthesize into a fresh parable on hubris and epistemic humility. Premise is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight; risk-taking (telepathic statue, memory immersion) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specificity of bioluminescent corals and foxglove stain anchors universals.</comment>
