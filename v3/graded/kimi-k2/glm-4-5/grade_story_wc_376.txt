<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—her skin wilting near lies is embodied, not labeled—but the story leans on summary (“cost her clients, friends, and the love of her life”) rather than dramatized micro-choices. The final resolve to leave at dawn is credible yet compressed; we feel cost but see little on-page friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the map + plate become a “key and lock” that reconfigure her path with the cost of abandoning tolerated falsehoods. Causal chain is intact—artifact discovery → map assembly → insight → decision—though the leap from insight to dawn departure is slightly telescoped.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The greenhouse city, toxic sky, and failing filtration press against every beat; the zinc plate’s warmth and the warped floorboard ground us in tactile specificity. Environment constrains choice—only candor can open safe passages—charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—recovering lost conversations—is signaled early and tightens when the map reveals candor-gated routes. One clear deepening: realizing the journey itself must be truthful. Cost is conceptual (permanent exile from tolerated lies) but less viscerally felt on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of candor as survival currency emerges organically through Elara’s bodily reaction and the map’s truth-symbols. Final image of packing “with reverence” reweights prior motifs without moralizing, achieving quiet resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet disciplined, with controlled syntax that mirrors Elara’s meticulous craft. Sensory filtering is character-specific (gilded leaves, metallic warmth). No dialogue, so voice coherence rests on internal texture—successfully sustained.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, mostly propulsive; occasional elevated phrasing (“desperate botanical life raft”) flirts with overwriting but stays within voice. No loops or scaffold; clarity intact at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: post-collapse calligraphy that literally gilds truth, postal mysticism, and a candor-based navigation system. Premise commits fully; no close echoes. Risky lyric mode pays off in final image.</comment>
