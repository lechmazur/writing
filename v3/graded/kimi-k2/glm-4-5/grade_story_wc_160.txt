<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her trembling hands, the chain’s clink, the solvent’s scent—but the “encrypted compassion” epiphany arrives as summary rather than dramatized contradiction, softening the final cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the seasonal-lake plan crystallizes as a Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights both preservation and progress. Causal chain holds—adhesive analysis → inscription → design—though the envelope’s prior agency is slightly convenient.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The breathing volcano-amphitheater is tactile and constraining; light shafts and moss guide Elara’s measurements. The antique chain doubles as micro-setting and tool, charging the final image when draped across her shoulders as talisman.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—harmonize flood vs. heritage—is signaled early and tightened through each discovery. The seasonal-lake solution forecloses pure preservation with visible compromise; cost is felt in the relinquishing of either extreme.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of balance emerges organically from Elara’s choices and the inscription’s forgotten engineering. Final image of folded sketches left for future generations offers non-literal resonance without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, mirroring a machinist’s perceptual bias toward angles and flow. Occasional poetic compression (“dappled resolve”) is taught early and paid off in the torch-lit shadows.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; only minor scaffold (“she pictured,” “she imagined”) slows momentum. Metaphors stay coherent—volcano heartbeat, mirror pool—without overwriting the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fusion of hydrological engineering, dormant-volcano amphitheater, and centuries-old encrypted compassion feels fresh and inevitable. Risky lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
