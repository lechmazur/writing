<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maya’s interior contradiction—tradition vs. survival—drives every beat; the graffiti-mapping nights and final choice to return the chip crystallize earned renunciation with visible cost. Embodied emotion (“clutched the foundation stone chip tighter”) grounds stakes without therapy-speak. Dual allegiance resolves through action, not summary. Minor slip: “reluctant conductor” leans label, not embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: mural insight → mapping → encoded counter-proposals → favorable terms. Closure lands as Earned Stasis—Maya returns the chip, foreclosing personal centrality with felt communal cost. One transition (dawn notice) fits scope. No orientation drift; anchors set by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Neptunia’s perpetual carnival is no backdrop; its sensory overload (clashing music, salt-fried air) constrains tactics—flash mobs hide in noise, graffiti hides in color. Micro-setting of the ferris-wheel wall becomes tactical ground zero. Final lanterns on water reprise opening salt-air motif, charging closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserve culture vs. accept gentrification—tightens when corporate emissaries arrive; graffiti counter-proposals force a trade-off. Escalation causal: each encoded mural raises stakes until the dawn notice crystallizes partial victory with visible cost (Maya’s anonymity, chip relinquished).</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from action: encoded art as communal memory resisting commodification. Final spiral-in-circle symbol offers non-literal answer—culture survives by perpetual reinscription, not ownership. No moralizing; resonance arises from Maya’s relinquishment.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Maya’s perceptual bias—patterns, colors, nautical charts. Syntax mirrors their orderly intuition: long analytical sentences compress into staccato mapping nights. No head-hops; dialogue sparse but subtextual (“The water remembers”).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose propels: sensory specificity (“sequined costumes and bare feet”) without purple drift. Rhythm accelerates during three sleepless nights, then exhales at dawn notice. Minor filter-verb cluster (“they began leaving”) but does not obscure causality or dull closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Floating carnival as resistance archive feels inevitable yet fresh; graffiti-as-survival-manual transforms trope through Maya’s cartographic mind. Risky synthesis pays off: corporate suits amid sequins, encoded murals as legal briefs. No derivative echoes.</comment>
