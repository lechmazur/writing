<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Arthur’s interior contradiction—gift of listening vs fear of losing creativity—is embodied in crystal-cradling and chess displays; final renunciation of rule-only chess lands with cost amplified by the same crystal. Students remain off-page, slightly lowering status-pressure score.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single POV, two-shard build (evening grotto → dawn unveiling); causal chain crystal → displays → morning epiphany holds closure. Persistent constraint: gift still demands silence; free-indirect loops around it. Clear who/where/ when by word 60.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Cobalt library & grotto anchor spatial and symbolic pressure; mist, magnetic field, starlight crystals recur with escalating charge on Arthur’s decision. Sensory density tightens under urgency. Yet actual library interior remains abstract, one soft-tap short of 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Central stake is freeing children’s imagination versus town’s rigidity; displays create visible tightening as town discourse blooms. Cost measured in Arthur’s continued silence and the risk his gift exposes. Single decisive reconfiguration about chess itself, not plot.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme—“the quiet power of possibility” versus mechanical compliance—emerges through concrete chess metaphors and final reconfigured classroom atmosphere. No summative preaching; ambiguity lingers about sustainability of change. Subtext in whispered silences and unspoken moves.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lyric third-person free-indirect that modulates precise when musing broad, clipped when climbing stairs; overtone of cerebral wonder. Some elevated quasi-fairytale turns (“universe had made a special aperture”) drift from Arthur’s vernacular, capping top band.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Rhythm builds then releases at dawn; sculptural sentence variety, no filler loops. Occasional thicket: “magnetic grotto beneath the library—an underground sanctuary …” could shed parasitic repetition, but clears before closure. Final “forests of second thoughts” balances cliché within earned new context.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fuses sainted-librarian subterranean magic realism with small-town school critique; chess-puzzle flashmob as resistance tactic feels fresh because choice, not spectacle, drives change. Intertextual resonance (Raymond + Miyazaki), but not derivative. Retains one lock of predictability in whistle-less rebellion.</comment>
