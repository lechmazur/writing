<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s shift from passive archivist to active emotional archaeologist is embodied in the tactile handling of the wax shaving and the final candle-lit resolve; the velvet disquiet gives a consistent, embodied emotional register. Yet the prophecy arrives more as external oracle than as the scribe’s own contradiction in action, so the cost feels foretold rather than personally earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (obsidian, orchard, wax, memory) tightens the stake until the final Charged Poise—“ready to begin his new work”—reweights Elias’s duty with irreversible cost. Anchors are clear by line 4; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The skyscraper orchard, obsidian slab, and wax shaving function as micro-settings that constrain choice: the garden’s isolation enables undisturbed immersion, the slab is the literal platform for inscription, the wax is the conduit. Final candlelight charges the closure image with temporal fragility.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve the city’s emotional patterns before predicted silence—is signaled early and deepens through the wax immersion beat; the prophecy tightens options without resolving them. Cost is felt in Elias’s racing heart and the irrevocable shift of vocation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of memory-as-survival emerges organically from the orchard’s living archive and the wax’s ghost voices; the final image of candle-lit inscription offers a resonant, non-moralizing answer to how emotion outlives civilizations.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with arboreal metaphors and tactile diction (“velvet disquiet,” “weathered skin”) that remain consistent under pressure. No POV drift; sensory hierarchy reflects Elias’s scribe priorities.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; each sentence layers texture without redundancy. No loops, no mixed metaphors; rhythm modulates from long orchard sentences to clipped final resolve, mirroring rising urgency.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fusing Etruscan prophecy with Edison wax atop a skyscraper orchard feels inevitable yet startling; the emotional archaeology premise is fresh and fully committed to, with no safety hedging.</comment>
