<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is vivid—his tactile testing of the rope, his credulous curiosity—but the final beat is more quiet triumph than visible cost; the smile feels earned yet not foreclosed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the bell rings itself, reweighting the premise. Causal chain (rope repair → switch → bell’s autonomous note) holds; cost is conceptual—the sanctuary now speaks without him.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stone refuge, thin air, and the bell’s bronze tongue are woven through action; the mountain’s “whispered promise” constrains Elias’s choices and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—proving the bell can out-detect modern systems—tightens once when Elias reroutes the trigger; pressure is coherent, cost is the risk of professional ridicule if wrong.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of listening over noise emerges organically from Elias’s method and the bell’s autonomous voice; final image reweights earlier data obsession without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays close to Elias’s perceptual filter; diction is weathered, tactile, and rhythmic; no head-hop or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is lean and sensorily precise; occasional lyrical uplift (“sky met the peaks like a whispered promise”) is earned. No loops or scaffold; momentum sustained.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: ancient bell as pre-digital storm sensor, grounded in Elias’s tactile craft. Risky premise fully committed to; no close echoes.</comment>
