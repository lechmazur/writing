<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Eli’s interiority is vivid—copper nail as talisman/burden, inherited dread, obsession with ancestor’s disgrace—but the shift from “family duty” to “scientific obsession” is asserted rather than dramatized in-scene. The final activation is motivated, yet the cost (institutional blindness, personal risk) is more declared than embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each beat (decoding stanza → revealing hidden panel → initiating sequence) follows because/therefore logic. Closure lands as Decisive Change with conceptual cost—the station awakening reconfigures both weather and ancestral exile. Orientation is clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Station’s damp concrete, chaotic jet-stream readouts, and the copper nail’s tactile weight anchor the scene. The hidden control panel functions as micro-setting that constrains the final choice. Sensory selection stays urgent and POV-filtered.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to risk activating ancestral tech—tightens once when the panel responds. Pressure escalates via Eli’s trembling hand and Dr. Aris’s skepticism. Cost is visible in the “overwhelming responsibility” that replaces dread.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme of reversibility (exile, climate, reputation) emerges through concrete objects and actions rather than statement. Final image of dormant systems awakening offers non-literal resonance without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice is consistent, lyrical yet precise; “spongey dread” and “nervously confident” are character-specific. Free-indirect style stays clean. Dialogue with Dr. Aris is minimal but goal-driven.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, but occasional stacked modifiers (“idealistic map librarian,” “institutional blindness”) verge on overwriting. No loops or scaffold; rhythm modulates with tension.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of climate-fiction, family-legacy mystery, and coded-poetry puzzle. The copper nail as both key and inherited shame transforms a familiar trope. Risk-taking in poetic-scientific hybrid pays off.</comment>
