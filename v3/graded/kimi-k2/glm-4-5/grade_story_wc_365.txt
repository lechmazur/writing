<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Interiority is evocative but drifts toward abstract summary (“motivation crystallized with each transition”) rather than embodied contradiction; the withheld-truth motive is stated repeatedly yet never dramatized as a live conflict inside a single beat. No micro-choice under pressure is shown—only observation of alternate timelines—so the final refusal to open the door feels externally imposed rather than earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the map maker wakes with spent shard and renewed determination, reconfiguring options with felt cost. However, the lens wavers between Accumulative/Textural and Situational; the cyclical jumps lack a taught pattern, so the final beat reads more as pause than decisive change. Orientation is clear early, but causality between jumps is asserted rather than demonstrated.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>The repair bay is vividly anchored—“dust motes danced in shafts of afternoon light”—and the green glass shard functions as micro-setting that constrains choice when it heats to prevent contact with the red shard. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered, though occasional phrases (“forgotten histories and secrets”) edge toward the generic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—uncovering the withheld truth—is signaled early and reiterated, yet pressure escalates only by assertion (“each journey expanded perception”) rather than on-page narrowing of options. The red-shard beat offers a micro-turn, but the cost is potential, not paid. Escalation remains atmospheric rather than causal under the chosen lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of fragmented identity and the price of knowledge emerges implicitly through the shard’s refusal and the map maker’s compulsion. The final image of “determination burning brighter” offers a resonant reconfiguration without moralizing. Some phrasing drifts toward abstraction (“architecture of existence”), slightly diluting thematic specificity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical, consistent, and perceptually specific—“fingers trembled as they traced the contours”—with rhythmic control that modulates under pressure. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing”) momentarily lifts out of POV lexicon but remains coherent. No dialogue to test voice distinction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is largely clean and propulsive, with strong sensory specificity and varied sentence rhythm. Minor loops—“half-remembered dreams” appears three times—and a few stock metaphors (“like whispers echoing from another dimension”) slightly dull the edge. No artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The shard-as-key conceit refreshes portal tropes by tying travel to sensory mapping rather than machinery. Specificity of the abandoned repair bay and the red-shard prohibition lend freshness. Risk is moderate—cyclical lyric structure rather than linear plot—but the payoff lands coherently.</comment>
