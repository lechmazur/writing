<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is evocative (“voice like dry leaves”), but the reaper’s contradictory impulses remain abstract; the final naming feels more therapeutic than earned. Embodied emotion is strong, yet the micro-choice to name “Solitude” lacks visible cost on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the reaper’s stance shifts from collector to giver-of-names, crystallized through scattered light. Causality is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of naming tightens the emotional cadence. Cost is implied but not viscerally felt, capping the score.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The observatory’s cracked glass and brass mechanism constrain the reaper’s ritual; scattered light literally enables the crystallizing act. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through grief, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—transform nameless dread into bearable form—escalates via iterative naming. One meaningful tightening occurs when “Lost Hope” is named; pressure deepens but never threatens the reaper physically, muting cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of sacrificial creation emerges through the reaper’s act of naming; no explicit moralizing. Final image of the observatory holding “names for the future” reweights earlier grief without tidy resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is consistent, lyrical, and POV-bound; diction (“ebony cloak, stained with the tears of centuries”) is character-specific. Compression and patterned elision are taught early and paid off in the crystallizing light.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet clear; rhythm modulates with emotional beats. Occasional stacked metaphors (“shadows made solid”) flirt with overwriting but never obscure causality or dull the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Familiar grief-stricken immortal trope is refreshed by the act of naming fears into beauty. Specificity of the observatory and atlas page grounds the concept; synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
