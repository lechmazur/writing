<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elion’s altruistic motive is clear and consistent, but his interiority is reported rather than embodied; Aris’s “strangely trustworthy” trait is asserted, not dramatized. The final communal shift is earned, yet the ghost’s noncorporeal constraint never creates a visible cost on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the community’s stance crystallizes around the watering bell, and the final spring-solstice message reweights the premise. Causal chain holds under Accumulative/Textural lens; however, the ghost’s chalked guidance is accepted too smoothly, muting felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Floating rock arches and violet sunsets are vivid and selective; the watering bell’s seed-pod shape constrains the revival ritual. Yet the orchard planet’s rules remain ornamental—no environmental limit forces a hard choice—so the setting charges the image more than it constrains action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—save the failing crops—is signaled early and tightens once when Aris unearths the bell. Collective effort escalates under Accumulative lens, but the cost is communal rather than personal; no single character forfeits anything tangible, softening the final pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of strangers-become-family emerges organically from shared harvests and collective ritual; the butterfly garden becomes a charged symbol of rebirth. Final image of “tangled roots” offers non-literal resonance without moralizing, though subtext rarely complicates the utopian arc.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Narrative voice maintains lyrical distance appropriate to a ghostly focalizer; diction is consistent, rhythm modulates with hope-tension. Compression is purposeful, yet occasional summary (“they worked together day after night”) blurs immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; figurative language is selective. Minor scaffold—“beneath the floating rock arches” recurs without new inflection—dulls momentum slightly but never obscures closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Altruistic ghost guiding colonists via chalked dawn messages is a fresh synthesis; the butterfly bell’s symbiotic larvae twist familiar eco-magic into something specific. Risk is moderate—utopian resolution hedges—but the orchard-planet frame feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
