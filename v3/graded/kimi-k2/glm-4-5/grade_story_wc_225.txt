<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied; the tutor’s guilt and need for self-forgiveness drive every micro-choice. The final reconciliation with the prince lands as earned because the tapestry decoding and labyrinth entry visibly cost him the last of his pride. One minor slip: “productive fidgeting” is repeated rather than deepened in the climax.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the prince’s offered hand crystallizes the tutor’s earned humility and restarts time. Causal chain—tapestry → labyrinth → suspended prince—holds without gaps. The four-minute thunder lull is a persistent constraint that shapes tactics and is paid off when the bell rings.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The time-frozen village, platinum labyrinth, and tapestry are rendered with tactile specificity and constrain every move. The labyrinth’s liquid-metal walls mirror the tutor’s shifting self-image, charging the final image. One missed beat: the “woven hush” is described more than enacted until the bell breaks it.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—self-forgiveness—tightens as each decoded thread forecloses denial. The thunder-clock forces acceleration, turning reflection into urgent action. Cost is legible: forty years of silence paid for one chance at redemption.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of redemption through humility emerges organically from the tutor’s tactile labor and the prince’s wordless pardon. Final image of time restarting as “applause” reweights the premise without moralizing. No thematic drift; every motif (chess, threads, labyrinth) serves the core question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is precise, slightly archaic, and consistent with a royal tutor’s diction. Syntax tightens under pressure—“fingers flying”—matching the thunder-clock. No POV leakage; perceptual signature is maintained through selective sensory focus.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence advances plot or atmosphere. Occasional elevated diction (“fierce repose,” “salvation of humility”) risks register drift but stays within the tutor’s lexicon. No loops or mixed metaphors; final bell line lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Frozen-time village + chess tutor + tapestry code is a fresh synthesis; the premise feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric compression pays off in the charged final image. No derivative echoes; the moral calculus is specific to this voice and world.</comment>
