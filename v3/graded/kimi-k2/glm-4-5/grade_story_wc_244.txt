<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Archie’s loneliness and reciprocity belief are embodied in the moon-rock hoax, but the story summarizes rather than dramatizes his moment-to-moment choices; the final “community of believers” lands as earned stasis yet we never see him weigh a concrete risk.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The causal chain (rumor → connection) is tight and legible; closure is a resonant reconfiguration where the cure becomes the sharing itself, with the ivy-cloaked station as charged poise. One minor ellipsis: we jump from rumor launch to media reports without on-page friction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The ivy-choked station is tactile and returns as sanctuary, but it constrains only atmosphere, not tactics; the moon-rock fragment is more active as micro-setting. Sensory selection is purposeful, though spatial choreography inside the station is lightly sketched.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—curing his own loneliness—escalates through each rumor vector; the cost is the exposure of his hoax and the surrender of credit. One tightening beat suffices, but the price is more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: connection cannot be engineered, only catalyzed. The moon-rock-as-lie reframes reciprocity without moralizing; final image of anonymous gratitude carries resonant ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct—wry, compressed, slightly desperate; “desperately jocular” is woven into syntax. Free indirect style stays clean, and diction never drifts from Archie’s educated but weary lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and rhythmic; occasional lyrical lifts (“waves of ivy”) are earned. No loops or scaffold, high density. One filter-verb cluster (“had become,” “had been”) in backstory blip keeps it from 8.5.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The loneliness-via-moon-hoax angle is fresh; polite anarchy as operational ethos is a risky frame that pays off. Transformation test passes—story would collapse without Archie’s exact paradoxical reciprocity.</comment>
