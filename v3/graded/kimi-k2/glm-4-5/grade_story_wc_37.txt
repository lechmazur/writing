<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical and embodied (“hands trembled as they completed the final weave”), but motivation stays abstract—“to rekindle the dying realm” is never tested against a concrete counter-desire or flaw, so the final rest feels more symbolic than earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the woven dawn spreads and the keeper rests, cost signaled by spent personal memories. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of light intensifies until it reweights the world—yet causality between song and realm-revival is asserted more than dramatized.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Greenhouse night, phosphorescent flora, and starlight saplings are vivid and selective; the mica window returns at the end as reflective surface for the first sunrise, charging the final image. Spatial anchors are clear early and track cleanly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“restore balance of light and dark”—is signaled early; pressure tightens as the keeper exhausts personal memories to finish the weave. Cost is legible (loss of self-memories), but escalation is more lyrical accumulation than causal narrowing of options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of communal memory as connective tissue emerges organically through the orchard ritual; final image of villages reuniting offers non-literal resonance. Avoids explicit moralizing, though the “bound release” refrain edges close to thematic statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is consistent, lyrical, and perceptually specific—“gossamer threads spun from their own scattered recollections.” Patterned diction taught early and sustained; no POV drift. Compression and elision serve the accumulative design.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is musical and dense, occasionally risking purple (“fruit of condensed starlight”) but rhythm varies and no loops stall momentum. Metaphors cohere within the mirror-world logic; no artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of memory-keeper myth with alchemical horticulture; “woven dawns” concept feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric mode pays off in resonant closure without gimmickry.</comment>
