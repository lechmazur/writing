<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Khira’s embodied defiance (“the bread remembers”) and the guide’s historically anchored ache give credible interiority; the micro-choice to hand over the lens alters tactics and carries felt cost. Minor drift: the guide’s “historically oriented” label is asserted more than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the emerald lens reweights the starter’s dormant life, the thaw audibly cracks, and Khira’s song crystallizes a new stance. Causal chain (lens → dough → warmth → thaw) holds under Accumulative/Textural lens; cost is the lingering dread that threads the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Grotto city’s damp walls, bioluminescent fungi, and baker’s hollow are vivid and selective; the lens itself becomes micro-setting that constrains the final choice. Spatial choreography is clean; rosewater dread suffuses without overwriting action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—rescue dying arts—tightens when the lens reveals life inside the dough, forcing a decisive intensification. Pressure is coherent; the thaw’s delay supplies external urgency; agency remains with Khira and guide, not coincidence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of cultural memory versus eroding identity emerges through the bread initials and the bees’ absence; no overt moralizing. Final image of “vivid green of resilience” reweights prior dread without stating a thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Distinct lyric texture—“rosewater dread,” “slow roots finding light”—sustains POV; no head-hopping. Dialogue minimal but subtextual (“Still fighting, Khira?”). Rhythm modulates with pressure; no register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is patterned and paid off. One minor loop: “rosewater dread” appears twice within four lines. Otherwise clean, no mixed metaphors, strong sentence variety.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fusion of bee-mind hive, opera-glass mysticism, and bread-initial ritual feels fresh and inevitable. Risky lyric compression succeeds; no derivative echoes. Specificity of “initial-shaped loaves” grounds the fantastical premise.</comment>
