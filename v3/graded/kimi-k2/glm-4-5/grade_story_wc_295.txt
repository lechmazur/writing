<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is concrete—her dream-chronicler identity is shown through action (clipboard, telescope focus) rather than label. Motivation intensifies cleanly from private torment to shared urgency once the telegram arrives. The final “shared burden” beat with Dr. Thorne crystallizes her arc, though the cost is more conceptual than visceral.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: telegram triggers pattern recognition, telescope work yields glyphs, collaboration unlocks healing. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—shared labor reframes her solitary gift. Orientation is clear by line 3; no teleporting props. One micro-turn (stars → legible language) lands cleanly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>The observatory dome, telescope array, and dawn light are selective, purposeful, and filtered through Elara’s professional gaze. The daylily telegram’s texture (yellowed, scented) anchors memory and later becomes the literal bridge between them. Setting constrains choice—only here can star patterns be resolved into glyphs.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—decode inscriptions to recover lost healing—signaled early. Pressure tightens once star-glyphs appear; collaboration becomes the only viable path. Cost is the relinquishing of sole authorship over her gift. No external antagonist; conflict is internal and epistemic, resolved through shared labor.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges: knowledge is relational, not solitary. Subtext lives in the telegram’s pressed flowers—fragile memory bridging past and present. The final image of “midnight solace” reframes prior isolation without moralizing. No overt thesis; resonance arises from the shared act of translation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is steady, slightly elevated to match the celestial register, yet remains character-bound. Sensory specificity (“distant places” scent) and rhythmic control under pressure. Dialogue is minimal but natural; Dr. Thorne’s considerate voice contrasts with Elara’s taut focus. No head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense. Occasional soft phrases (“tormented her,” “slipping away like sand”) flirt with cliché but never stall momentum. No loops or scaffold. Final paragraph achieves quiet cadence without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: lucid-dream cartography meets astronomical decryption. The daylily telegram and variable-star glyphs feel particular to this world. Premise is not derivative; emotional specificity prevents template drift. Risk is moderate but coherent.</comment>
