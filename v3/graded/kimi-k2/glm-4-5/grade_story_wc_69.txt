<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Eleanor’s interiority is warm but generic; “expectantly resigned” is asserted rather than embodied. No single on-page choice carries visible cost; her arc is summarized across seasons. The choir remains off-stage, so status dynamics and micro-choices under pressure are absent.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Closure is a gentle Conceptual Repricing—passing the rosette as legacy—but the cost is abstract, not felt. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; seasonal montage replaces causal linkage. Orientation is clear, yet the story reads like an elegiac précis rather than a scene with tightening stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>The velvet library and autumn light are vividly sketched and return as sanctuary, but they never constrain Eleanor’s choices or charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric yet ornamental; the rosette does more practical work than the room itself.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—preserving vanishing arts through harmony—is declared early but never tested in a single on-page beat. Pressure is diffuse; “unlearning hatred” is reported, not dramatized. No tightening choice or visible price alters Eleanor’s tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of harmony-through-subtraction emerges through choral metaphor and the rosette’s lineage, avoiding overt moralizing. Subtext is strongest when Eleanor fingers the rosette while speaking of “subtracting noise.” Final paragraph edges toward thematic echo but reins back in time.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice is consistent, with autumnal cadences and gentle anaphora. Compression across seasons is taught early and sustained; no POV drift. Dialogue snippets feel written rather than spoken, but they are brief and unobtrusive.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is fluid and largely free of loops; occasional soft fillers (“as autumn shadows elongated”) could be tighter. Metaphors stay coherent; no purple overload. Rhythm modulates with seasonal transitions, supporting the accumulative design.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>The choral-harmony conceit is familiar, yet the “subtracting noise” inversion and grandmother’s zither rosette lend fresh specificity. Risk is modest; the piece leans on lyrical accumulation rather than structural daring. Still, the synthesis feels organic, not checklist-driven.</comment>
