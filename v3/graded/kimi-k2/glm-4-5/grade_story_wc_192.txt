<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is embodied and character-specific; the contradiction between craving solitude and answering the call is dramatized through the ring’s warmth and her scarred hand. Micro-choice to step through the door costs her the sanctuary she spent 97 days building. Motivation is rooted in remembered duty rather than abstract virtue. Slight deduction for “tender” as label rather than demonstrated trait.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change: she leaves isolation to teach another to breathe, paying with the sanctuary she has just abandoned. Causal chain—ring warms → she knocks → door appears → she crosses—holds under the Causal lens. Cost is legible in the final image: dawn replaces starlight, solitude replaced by linkage. Orientation is immediate and spatially coherent.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The charcoal sanctuary, starlight, and ashen dust are vivid and selective; they constrain her choice by offering comfort that must be surrendered. Micro-setting of the ring’s warmth and the northernmost wall of stars charges the final knock. Spatial choreography is clean across the three knocks. Environment subtly mirrors internal state without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve isolation vs. honor duty—tightens when the ring’s pulse forces a choice. One meaningful turn: the third knock forecloses retreat. Cost is the sanctuary itself, visible in the last paragraph. Escalation is causal and driven by her agency; no coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of healing through shared scars emerges from action, not assertion. Subtext operates in the ring’s warmth and the dawn light replacing starlight. Final image—“shared emptiness suddenly filled”—reweights the premise without moralizing. Complexity is preserved: she gains connection yet loses refuge.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet controlled; perceptual signature shows in “loaded emptiness” and “charcoal sanctuary.” Syntax modulates with pressure—short clauses during the knocks, longer reflections before. No head-hopping; POV remains anchored in the keeper. Compression and patterned elision are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic; sentences advance story or atmosphere without redundancy. Figurative language is purposeful—“shadows gained substance”—and never muddles causality. No loops or scaffold; each paragraph earns its place. Minor elevated diction (“conceptual repricing” moments) stays within keeper’s lexicon.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise of a guardian who must abandon her own refuge to save another feels fresh; trope of the hermit healer is inverted through the charcoal sanctuary and scar-linking mechanic. Specificity of the ring and threshold makes the story irreplaceable. Risk in lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
