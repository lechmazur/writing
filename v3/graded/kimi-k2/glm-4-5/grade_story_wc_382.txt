<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Clara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“stones settled…language just beyond her grasp”), but her contradictory impulses remain under-articulated; the final inheritance revelation lands as external gift rather than earned choice, softening cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the seal’s transfer crystallizes Clara’s new fluency and shared lineage with visible cost (“carried not just an artifact, but the beginnings of fluency”). Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of weekly teas and rooftop meteor shower deepens stakes until final reweighting.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rooftop garden and meteor shower function as micro-setting that alters perception and enables the climactic interrogation; earlier spaces (cluttered study, historic façades) are sketched with selective sensory detail that filters through Clara’s POV.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—learning the buildings’ language—is signaled early and tightens through weekly sessions; rooftop interrogation forces Clara to articulate the cost of inheritance, narrowing her future path. Pressure is coherent under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</question><comment>Theme of inheritance-as-language emerges organically from concrete particulars (symbols on sills, seal’s brass carvings) rather than statement; final image of “old friends with stories finally ready to be told” offers resonant, non-moralizing answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</question><comment>Voice is lyrical yet grounded in Clara’s perceptual signature; free-indirect style stays consistent, and dialogue carries subtext (“Some truths need the protection of falsehoods”). No head-hopping; diction remains within plausible lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</question><comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; occasional elevated phrasing (“ephemeral as forgotten words”) fits lyrical mode. No loops or scaffold; meteor shower description avoids purple excess while charging closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</question><comment>Premise of architectural linguistics via hereditary caretakers feels fresh; transformation test passes—details are specific to this lineage and seal. Risky rooftop meteor climax is earned by prior pattern, not gimmickry.</comment>
