<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Eleanor's interior contradictions—yearning to hear versus embracing tactile sound—are embodied and dramatized across beats. The broken needle evolves from salvage to reinvention, marking earned renunciation at closure: she accepts silence as her instrument. Reflection stays anchored in micro-decisions: choosing a record, spinning it backward, guiding students onto the floor. The cost—former identity abandoned—reads on page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: with the final backward rotation Eleanor reconfigures her role from musician to conduit of tactile music, a visible conceptual shift. Causality holds under Accumulative lens—each return to the cavern layers stakes and deepens knowledge—until the backward filament physically gathers student palms. Cost is tangible: the inability to hear the very music she teaches, stated explicitly in the mirrored hush.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The cavern’s micro-setting—stone floor, draft, resonant walls—literally conducts the music Eleanor cannot hear, constraining the method of instruction and charging final image. Sensory specificity is selective yet tactile: “vibrations haunted the stone.” Drum maker’s skepticism then collaboration provides subtle status dynamics. Spatial anchors maintain spatial coherence across student invasion. Weather and objects evolve naturally without exposition dump.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</question>
<comment>Stakes center on defeating emotional numbness through reinvention of music beyond sound. Meaningful tightening arises with discovery of backward playback: it narrows Eleanor’s options to one singular, unorthodox path. Agency remains hers; no coincidence resolves. The price—loss of audible connection to the notes—lands as ongoing rather than temporary.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</question>
<comment>Theme crystallizes subtly: music need not be heard to matter; loss transformed into new language. Motif of silence/filament returns weighted at closure—not moralistic, but experiential. Embodied emotion ("tears in her eyes") invites non-explicit reflection without didactic statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</question>
<comment>Voice maintains steady lyric compression and controlled rhythm under lyrical mode. Perceptual signature is Eleanor-centric, with sensory substitution cleanly taught: fingertips instead of ears. POV remains intact; no head-hopping. Compression occasionally sacrifices immediacy via summary loops ("each day, Eleanor returned"), nudging down.</comment>

<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is elegant with few repetitive cues; metaphor (“winter's chill”) borders familiar but works. Density remains high—“filament of hush” serves double duty as image and mechanic. A single boilerplate stem (“each day, Eleanor returned”) loops mildly within middle beats. Minor register drift into abstraction (“peaceful yet potent”) occurs but does not cloud ending. Overall line level clean.</comment>

<comment>The synthesis—deaf musician embraces silent backward playback as pedagogy—feels fresh, inevitable, and risky. No stock trope of overcoming disability through miracle; it invents a tactile pedagogy instead. Transformation reframes silence as active medium not absence. Risk yields coherence plus cost, propelling score upward.</question>
