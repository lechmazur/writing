<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“mist curled around them like listening spirits”), but her contradictory impulses remain abstract; the final renunciation is foreshadowed yet the cost feels generalized rather than personally earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each dawn’s poetry session layers density until the canyon itself “breathes with alternatives.” Closure lands as Charged Poise—her whispered line refracted into “a chorus of infinite variation”—with conceptual cost legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Bone towers and canyon acoustics are not mere backdrop; the echoing architecture literally enables her method and charges the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent; the pale spire’s visual reprise tightens the thematic screw.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—subvert the ritual—is signaled early and escalates through nightly sessions that grow “louder, more persistent.” One meaningful tightening: the Overseers’ shadowing narrows her options, forcing the dawn climb. Cost is felt but generalized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete acts: refracting truth through poetry. Final image of endless echoing voices offers a resonant, non-moralizing answer. Avoids overt thesis statements; ambiguity lingers productively.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct lyric texture sustained throughout; diction (“forged hush,” “prismatic language”) is character-bound. Compression and patterned elision taught early and paid off in the final refracted whisper. No POV drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong rhythmic control and high information density; occasional stacked metaphors (“ghosts of forgotten possibilities,” “spectrum hidden in white light”) flirt with overwriting but stay purposeful. No loops or scaffold; final cadence lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Familiar rebellion-against-absolutism arc is refreshed by the acoustic-poetic method and bone-tower setting. The transformation of echo from setting detail to active agent feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Specificity anchors universals.</comment>
