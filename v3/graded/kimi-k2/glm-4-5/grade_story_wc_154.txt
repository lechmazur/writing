<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Kaelen's conflict-zone translator persona is vivid through small embodied gestures and child-trusted innocence, but the climactic act of helping Lina feels slightly generalized rather than sharpening his own flaw into the final turn.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Lens = Hybrid (textural accumulation & situational crystallization). Closure lands as a quiet reconfiguration: coral returned as promise kept across absence—felt cost clear. Timeline anchored early, minor echo of backstory not yet constrained by action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Glass-roofed, misting atrium surfaces frequently, but its real job is to supply a “sanctuary beat” rather than alter choices; tight spatial anchoring nonetheless earns credit for consistent embodiment & lighting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Pressure is accrued rather than escalated causally: translator endeavors to graft meaning onto absence. Loss drives emotional stakes, yet the arc is deepening knowledge rather than narrowing options; single decisive crystallization qualifies closure cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of shared loss emerges through coral, smudged cast, and child sleep—not from overt labels—and is resolved in the closing whisper that father arrives in changed form. No tidy moral; the ambiguity feels earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Mediator voice is steady, specific, modest in certainty; micro-shifts intensify but never head-hop. Section where he fingers the cast notes rhythm contracts naturally under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Lyric compression trained early via “coral labyrinth” pattern pays off in final coral-in-palm gesture. Occasional stacked modifiers (“lotus-hearted ache”) are intentional texture; no loops or scaffold slow momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question>
<grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Coral child ritual repurposes familiar “object as vessel” trope through translator-framed innocence; final evolved return makes the repetition feel necessary rather than ornamental.</comment>
