<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elena’s interior contradiction—scientific rigor vs. metaphysical longing—remains vivid; every cloud categorisation beat is also a self-interrogation, culminating in renunciation of safe return. The late mentor’s absence is felt as present pressure, not backstory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Intimate single-scene architecture holds under Accumulative/Textural lens: each cloud perception is a texture shift that tightens stakes until the cirrus ‘conversation’ forces the decisive change. Orientation is anchored at once; closure pays conceptual repricing with visible emotional cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The gondola body acts as micro-setting—rails and creak anchor balance and fear; brass scope weight constrains posture and focus. Liminal sky position is rendered through filter of shifting cloud anatomy that alters vantage and choice.</comment>
<question>4</question>
<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake (prove atmospheres remember) tightens as each cloud emotion becomes evidence; the final dialogue between formations is escalation that reprioritizes life-risk against proof. Cost is felicitous—potential free-fall for validation.</comment>
<question>5</question>
<grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from particulars: ‘dusty starlight’ motif is reweighted at climax when the sky’s archival memory crystallizes into evidence, rendering absence sentient. No moralizing; poetics serve conceptual pay-off.</comment>

<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Lyrical compression is intentional: telescope syntax mirrors heartbeat under sway; cloud cataloguing diction remains scientist-specific. Unique perceptual signature sustains through charged final cadence.</comment>
<question>7</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Zero echo loops; cloud descriptions resist clichés, integrate sensory specificity with motion. Rhythm accelerates toward the charged closing image of dusty starlight reclaiming memory.</comment>

<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Transforms dismissed ‘cloud emotions’ into lived atmospheric archive; specific synthesis makes the impossible feel inevitable. Risk holds without gimmickry—lyric frame deepens rather than masks stakes.</comment>
