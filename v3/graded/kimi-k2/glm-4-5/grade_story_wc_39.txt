<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The poet’s interiority is vivid—calloused fingers, “positively wistful” gaze—but his decisive act (infusing the jar) is under-motivated; we feel his longing more than the cost of sharing it. The final renunciation of anonymity carries implicit cost yet reads more as summary than embodied choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the poet’s retreat to the corner crystallizes his new stance—translator rather than vagrant—and the cost is the surrender of his private archive. Causal chain holds under Accumulative/Textural lens; each sensory beat layers toward the communal chorus.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The feral loft’s filtered light and salt-tarnished music box are tactile and atmospheric; the loft itself, however, never constrains choice or reappears in the final image, capping the score below 9. Micro-settings (glass jars, senior-center table) do the constraining work instead.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—bridging generations—tightens when the poet risks his private sound-hoard in public; the communal humming is the earned intensification. Cost is felt in his self-erasure at the end, though the escalation is more tonal than causal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of “gleaned redemption” emerges through the communal act rather than statement; the final image of shared humming reweights the poet’s solitary craft into collective memory. Avoids moralizing, but the concept’s articulation in paragraph four edges toward label-speak.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet grounded in the poet’s perceptual bias—salt air, “tin roof” rain, “feral loft.” Syntax modulates with emotional crests; no head-hopping. Occasional elevated diction (“incompleteness,” “conceptual repricing”) slightly drifts from vagrant lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic; figurative language is selective. Minor loops—“forgotten music,” “forgotten moments”—and a few filter-verb stacks (“he began,” “he knew”) dull immediacy. No artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The sound-capturing vagrant is fresh, and the communal redemption through a music box feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risk lies in the quiet, lyric structure; it pays off without gimmickry. Some phrasing (“translator between generations”) flirts with prompt echo.</comment>
