<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s calm is consistent but never tested; her interiority remains surface-level. The group’s collective action is the only beat that changes the emotional field, yet Elara herself makes no costly choice. The “earnest whimsy” label is repeated rather than embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the circle forms, pain is transmuted into shared understanding. Causality is accumulative/textural—pattern builds until the final image reweights meaning. No orientation debt; time and place remain clear.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lavender and factory are vivid and thematically coherent, but they serve as backdrop rather than constraint. The dove-gray map case is handled twice yet never alters tactics. Final image gains some charge from the setting’s decay/renewal duality.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—collective healing—is signaled early and tightened through the photograph ritual. Agency is diffuse; the group’s shared act narrows options toward communal closure. Cost is felt collectively rather than individually.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the ritual; no overt moralizing. The arcs-as-puzzle motif reweights at the end, turning private pain into communal pattern. Subtext is carried by gesture and image rather than statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays close to Elara’s calm perception; no head-hopping. Prose is lyrical yet controlled, with rhythmic variation. Dialogue is minimal but natural when it appears.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Clean, vivid sentences; occasional soft filler (“seemed to,” “as if”) but no loops or mixed metaphors. Density is high; each paragraph advances image or ritual step. No artifacts in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The puzzle-archivist conceit is fresh, and the photograph-arc ritual feels specific to this world. Transformation of industrial decay into healing ground avoids cliché. Risk is modest but coherent.</comment>
