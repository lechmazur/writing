<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s claustrophobia and silence-tasting obsession are vivid and embodied, but the final beat of “heal her relationship to the earth” is asserted rather than dramatized; the porcelain doll’s emotional weight is set up yet never re-encountered after liftoff, leaving the interior arc slightly under-cooked.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the gilded hush is harvested and will re-weight her underground life, with the cost of leaving the doll behind felt in the final image. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each silence sampled layers density until the final cadence shift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The bunker’s metallic twilight, the watchtower glimpse, and the trellis’s soundless bells are selective and POV-filtered; the trellis itself constrains the ascent and later the descent, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography stays coherent across altitudes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—harvest the gilded hush—is signaled early and tightened by the one-hour gravity window; the cost is the irreversible exposure to open sky and the forfeiture of the doll’s comfort. Pressure escalates via altitude-specific silences rather than causal reversals, fitting the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of silence-as-flavor emerges organically from Elara’s sensory quest; the final image of doll and vessel in mutual acknowledgment reweights confinement vs. transcendence without moralizing. Subtext in the doll’s mute witness and the vessel’s paradoxical amplification is deft.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet disciplined, with perceptual signature in synesthetic tasting of silence; compression and patterned elision (“stretching contracted”) are taught early and paid off in the final ascent. No POV drift or register clash.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, but occasional stacked modifiers (“intangibly tangible yet impossible to contain within ordinary vessels meant for ordinary things”) flirt with overwriting; no loops or scaffold, and rhythm modulates with altitude.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The inversion-gravity ascent to harvest audible silence is a fresh synthesis; the porcelain doll and silence vessel form a charged binary that feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking (synesthetic silence, anti-gravity botany) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
