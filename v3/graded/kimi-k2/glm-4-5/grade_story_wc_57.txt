<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is calm and consistent, but the “infinitely patient” trait is asserted rather than embodied; no contradictory impulse is dramatized. The final acceptance of the knotted rope is credible yet feels foregone rather than costly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the rope reconfigures the collector’s path with felt, if quiet, cost. Causal chain is intact—fulgurite triggers recognition, knots yield knowledge—but the lens tilts Accumulative/Textural rather than strictly Causal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Golden dock, snow, fog, and rope micro-setting are vivid and selective; the rope’s texture ultimately constrains the final choice. Weather muffles sound and sharpens attention, integrating with the oceanic hush.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preservation of ancient methods—is signaled early and tightened through the decoding of knots. Escalation is subtle: silence and waiting intensify until the fisherman relinquishes the rope. Cost is present but understated.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of listening to time-bound craft emerges organically from the rope’s language. Final image of fog parting reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext in the fisherman’s grunts and pauses carries generational urgency.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Voice is hushed, oceanic, and consistent; perceptual signature favors texture over event. Dialogue is spare and idiomatic, though the fisherman’s diction could sharpen further. No POV drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; occasional soft filler (“seemed to muffle”) slightly dilutes peak moments. No loops or mixed metaphors; sensory hierarchy is disciplined.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Familiar quest for hidden knowledge is refreshed by knot-as-language conceit and patient observational stance. Risk is modest but coherent; transformation feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
