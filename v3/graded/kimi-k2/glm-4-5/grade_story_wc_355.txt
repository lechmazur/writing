<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s pacifism and frequency-philosophy are vivid, embodied in micro-choices (arranging forks, adjusting crystals). Interior contradiction—yearning for empathy yet fearing intrusion—surfaces only in faint whispers; a deeper clash would push the score higher. The shift from cataloguing silence to teaching empathy is earned, but the cost feels intellectual rather than visceral.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each added frequency layer thickens atmosphere until the clasp’s click becomes inevitable. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration—diary’s contents reframe her life’s work—yet the felt cost is more conceptual than bodily. Orientation is swift; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The starlit workshop is tactile—crystals glint, shadows shift—yet it never physically constrains choice; it’s backdrop rather than obstacle. Micro-setting (diary, tuning forks) carries more weight, guiding her gestures. One step short of the 9+ gate that demands environment alter tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—unlock empathy via diary—tightens through rising sonic density. No external antagonist; pressure is internal and aesthetic. The final click resolves the surface conflict but leaves the deeper cost of empathy unexploded on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</question><comment>Theme of empathy-as-resonance emerges organically from the sonic ritual; no moralizing. The diary’s reversal—from catalog to instruction manual—reweights prior labor without explicit statement. Subtext hums in metallic overtones rather than words.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical, precise, and consistent: “resonant hollow where memories yet echo” is character-specific. No dialogue, so compression and rhythm carry the scene. Occasional elevated diction (“celestial light”) stays within Elara’s arcane register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is selective and purposeful. One mixed metaphor—“shimmer between sorrow and acceptance”—is minor, forgiven in the crescendo.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: empathy as literal frequency-matching, diary as meta-manual. Risky conceit is fully committed to and pays off. Avoids stock tropes; even “locked diary” is retooled as resonant object rather than plot MacGuffin.</comment>
