<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Oracle's embodied stillness and tactile ritual with the booklet and pebbles anchor her interiority; her shift from mild obsession to violent determination is legible in the final beat ("she smiled"), yet the absence of any second on-page character or concrete status dynamic keeps relationships from becoming crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A clear accumulative/textural lens: successive layers of starlight, hush, and darkness accumulate until the final image reweights silence itself as the map. Closure crystallizes as Earned Stasis—she chooses to endure within the endless night rather than fight it, reconfiguring "end" into "beginning."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Tower, booklet, and pebbles all function as micro-setting that constrains her ritual workspace. The storm remains sonic background rather than tactical hazard, preventing the environment from shaping her final act; the booklet and pebbles in her lap do influence her moment-to-moment choice and reappear charged in the closing glow.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</question><comment>Dominant stake—finding a route through the total darkness using silence instead of light—escalates as the last star dies. Cost is diffuse: societal fear and the loss of light, felt rather than individually painful. One tightening: she reframes her task from prevention to navigation. Price legible but generalized, not sharply personalized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>Emergent theme: true guidance lies in embracing absence rather than filling it. This crystallizes without preaching in the charged final image of glowing void-sketches. Subtext operates in the oracle’s silence and the pebbles’ latent speech. No explicit moral; instead, the choice to map silence re-prices the concept of night itself.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sensuous, measured lyricism delivers a palpable sensory signature: “marbled hush,” “flaking gold leaf,” “warm as living flesh.” Micro-cadence breathes with the ritual work, accelerating imperceptibly toward the extinguishing star. POV remains tightly interior; non-standard “retell by summarizing silence” is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Prose is largely free of loops; the only detectable recurrence is minor synonym clustering around “hush.” Images work at high density (“pebble-shore oracle,” “jagged as broken bone”) without muddle. Minor static: “mildly obsessed / violently determined” label echo within three paragraphs is noticeable, yet does not distort momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</question>
<comment>The inversion of mapmaking—from recording visible terrain to recording void—feels organic rather than gimmickry. Setting a quest to navigate darkness by silence instead of light is fresh. Pebble-prophecy offers small-scale oracle custom that hasn’t been over-familiar, sustaining the surprise without late-rule hand waving.</comment>
