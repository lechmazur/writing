<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied—fingers tracing amber, glass creaking underfoot—but the “quietly proactive” trait is asserted more than dramatized; the final offering feels slightly pre-ordained rather than wrested from contradictory impulses. Emotional layering is present yet edges toward therapeutic summary (“grief and acceptance stages”).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: spiral pattern, moss growth, and pendant return build density toward a resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands with felt cost—the release of guilt onto the moss-covered keyboard—though causality between spiral and final act is more associative than driven.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Setting is richly textured—rusting racks, vines through circuit boards, sunlight through broken ceiling—yet its pressure on choice is atmospheric rather than tactical. The moss-garden does constrain movement (glass underfoot) and supplies the final altar, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reconciling public shame with personal integrity—tightens via the spiral walk and pendant offering. One clear deepening: viral confession’s grip loosens only after the physical act of surrender. Cost is emotional release rather than forfeiture of something tangible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of reclamation through decay emerges organically from moss overtaking servers and guilt transforming into growth. Final image—pendant engulfed in emerald moss—offers non-literal answer without moralizing. Avoids overt thesis statements.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet grounded in sensory specificity; “honeyed hush” and “amber pendant” recur with shifting resonance. No dialogue, so focus is on perceptual signature—watchful, tentative, reverent—which modulates under pressure without head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is fluid and image-dense; occasional soft-focus phrases (“impossible ideals,” “ethical science could emerge”) drift toward abstraction. No loops or scaffold, but figurative layering sometimes crowds the beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of post-digital ruin and personal atonement; moss colonizing servers feels inevitable yet specific. Risk lies in quiet lyricism rather than plot twist—earned by sustained imagery and closure.</comment>
