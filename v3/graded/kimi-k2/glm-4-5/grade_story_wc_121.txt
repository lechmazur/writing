<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is vivid—his hovering shame and wonder are embodied—but the “labyrinth of self” motivation is stated more than dramatized until the final beat. The climactic acceptance lands with felt cost, yet earlier beats lean on summary rather than micro-choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias returns with earned self-acceptance and the tablet’s lingering weight. Causal chain holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each step deepens pattern and stakes—though the procedural-generation rules are exposited rather than dramatized in mid-story.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The glowing viaduct is tactile and atmospheric, its phosphorescent stones anchoring every shift; the crumbling alternate version re-weights the final image. Micro-setting (tablet warmth, eclipse shadows) constrains choices and charges closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—self-acceptance versus freakhood—tightens as each timeline reframes his gift. One clear deepening beat: the convergence chamber forces a stance crystallization with visible emotional cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of fractured identity emerges organically from the timeline conceit; the final image of “beautifully complex” selfhood reweights earlier shame without moralizing. Subtext in the mirrored selves is strong, though the tablet’s lore edges toward exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with rhythmic control under pressure (“darkening brightness”). POV remains stable; perceptual signature is distinct in sensory filtering. Occasional elevated diction (“periodically eternal”) slightly strains the lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, vivid, and propulsive; only minor loops (“glow… glowing… glow”) and one mixed metaphor (“shattering glass” of time) mar the flow. No artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of quantum-fantasy and identity quest; the gravity-defier conceit is transformed through lived stigma. Risky timeline fracturing pays off in the mirrored selves, though echoes of familiar multiverse tropes remain.</comment>
