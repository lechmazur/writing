<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Marina’s motivation—childhood trauma from coral bleaching—anchors her witness stance; interiority is embodied in the tactile tapping and salt-stung cheeks. The final renunciation (accepting paths vanish because their time has passed) is credible, yet the shift from passive observer to active acceptance feels slightly under-cooked—no single micro-choice dramatizes the pivot.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the torn atlas page reweights the premise—coastlines aren’t just lost, they’re being reclaimed by pre-industrial cycles. Causality holds under Accumulative/Textural lens; each data comparison tightens the pattern. Cost is felt in Marina’s exhausted “drifting and moored” stance. Minor drift: the fossil-fuel ban is named but never threaded into the causal chain.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Station, concrete wall, and encroaching sea are vivid and selective; the torn atlas page functions as micro-setting that constrains choice by proving the past obsolete. Sensory hierarchy (tapping, salt sting, digital bleed) mirrors interior pressure. One slip: “periodically eternal” is asserted, not shown via environmental rhythm.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—why paths disappear—tightens through each data overlay until the final reconfiguration. Pressure is coherent but largely observational; agency is limited to logging and realizing. One visible cost: the sleepless third night crystallizes exhaustion, but the beat is summarized rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: human cartographies are temporary sketches on the planet’s deeper cycles. The atlas page’s final folding enacts the conceptual repricing without moralizing. Subtext in the rhythmic tapping (human order vs. oceanic pulse) is subtle and effective.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct—scientific precision laced with elegiac cadence. Rhythmic repetition (“periodically eternal,” “drifting and moored”) is purposeful, taught early, and paid off in the final line. No dialogue; interior monologue stays within character’s lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet textured; each sentence advances image or stakes. No loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing,” “pre-industrial state”) risks register drift but remains consistent with scientist POV. Strong final cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Familiar eco-fiction territory is refreshed by the atlas page as material evidence of erasure and the “delayed revelation” conceit. Risk taken in quiet, accumulative structure pays off. Slight deduction for echo of common “planet reclaims itself” motif.</comment>
