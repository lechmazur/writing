<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elian’s interiority is textured—thumb-polished wood, trembling hands—but the “price of redemption” remains abstract; no single micro-choice visibly forecloses a path. The lifelong solitude is asserted rather than dramatized in-scene, so the felt cost is attenuated.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elian leaves the ebony clipboard behind, reconfiguring their own future while acknowledging perpetual debt. Causality is accumulative/textural; the lens holds, though the final paragraph edges toward overt thesis.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The terrace’s salt air, stone canopy, and triple-sun shadows are vivid and selective, guiding mood. Yet the setting constrains tactics only implicitly; no spatial feature directly alters the negotiation’s outcome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will this treaty hold?—tightens once at midday when the first breach is bridged. Cost is implied (lifetime of solitude) but not dramatized on the page, keeping it just shy of 8.0+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme of peace as daily practice emerges through ritual detail and the bittersweet toast; final image of the child’s laughter reweights prior cynicism. A touch of moralizing in the penultimate paragraph blunts resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent; perceptual signature—“tasting the salt air and the promise of something more”—is character-specific. Compression and patterned diction are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; no loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated diction (“celestial bodies continued their timeless trajectory”) slightly drifts from Elian’s lived lexicon but never muddies clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>The forever-war negotiator archetype is refreshed through tactile ritual and cosmic backdrop; the ebony clipboard’s final placement offers a non-obvious reprise. Still, the premise itself remains recognizable, limiting higher originality.</comment>
