<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Maya’s drive to “excavate truth” is dramatized through tactile micro-choices—reassembling letters, touching the diamond—yet interiority occasionally drifts into thematic summary (“humanity’s salvation or destruction”). The final renunciation is earned, but the cost is more asserted than embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Maya’s pivot from debunker to keeper crystallizes in the charged image of the pulsing diamond. Causal chain holds under a Causal lens, though the liquidation backstory is delivered in a single expository block rather than threaded through beats.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The orchard’s toxic glow and leaning trees are filtered through Maya’s investigative gaze, constraining her movements and guiding discovery. The diamond’s warmth against her palm in the final beat reweights the setting from threat to conduit, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—protect the stillpoint—tightens once when Maya decides to conceal its location. The price (perpetual secrecy, risk of liquidation) is legible, though the escalation is compressed into a single paragraph rather than dramatized across beats.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: truth as living energy vs. weaponized information. The flawed diamond’s shift from “cursed” to “key” reconfigures the moral calculus without sermonizing. One late line (“Hope was the one thing the corporations couldn’t liquidate”) flirts with thematic echo but is saved by its placement as earned payoff.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Voice is sharp, scientific, and slightly weary—perfect for a debunker in a poisoned world. Sensory specificity (“raw fingers,” “toxic soil”) keeps focalization tight. No dialogue, so the prose carries all subtext; occasional elevated diction (“dimensional boundaries thinned”) nicks authenticity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and propulsive, with rhythmic variation that mirrors Maya’s shifting focus. One paraphrase loop (“truth had become the rarest commodity… truth had found a way”) and a filter-verb cluster (“she began to intuit”) slightly dull immediacy, but artifacts avoid the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The irradiated Eden powered by a cracked diamond feels inevitable yet fresh; the stillpoint concept reframes post-apocalyptic tropes as ecological physics. Transformation test passes—swap the orchard for any generic wasteland and the story collapses. Risk is measured but coherent.</comment>
