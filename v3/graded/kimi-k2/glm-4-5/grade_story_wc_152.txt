<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—her feigned foolishness and real acuity coexist in every stitch—but the final beat (“shrugged when praised”) is too compressed to register the full cost of her renunciation, capping the score just below 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The causal chain (cosmic anomaly → embroidered sabotage → coup unravels) is tight; closure lands as Earned Stasis when she lets the conspirators dismiss her. The only hairline slip is the off-stage execution of the sabotage, slightly blurring the decisive change.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The cobalt observatory and eternal candle are more than backdrop; the candle’s flame swells with each revelation, and the autumn wind presses urgency into her fingers. One more tactile interaction with the observatory itself would have nudged this to 9.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preventing the coup—escalates cleanly from cosmic omen to embroidered interference. Pressure tightens when she deciphers the “scheduled accidents,” but the sabotage itself happens off-page, muting the felt cost at the peak.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: knowledge disguised as art defeats power disguised as order. The final image of the eternal candle burning while whispers fade reweights the entire premise without a syllable of moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lush yet precise—“prismatic tears,” “star-flecked fabric”—and stays rooted in Elara’s perceptual bias. The lyric cadence never drifts into purple; every metaphor earns its keep under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is propulsive and dense; only a single paraphrase loop (“thread by thread, possibility adjacent to possibility”) slightly dulls the final paragraph. Otherwise, rhythm, clarity, and figurative control are exemplary.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The fusion of embroidery, astronomy, and espionage feels inevitable in hindsight; the “galaxy-chart embroiderer” is a fresh archetype, and the coup thwarted by decorative art is a risk that pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
