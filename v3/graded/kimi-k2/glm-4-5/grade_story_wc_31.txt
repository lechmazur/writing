<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Hemingway’s lifelong synesthesia and quiet dedication are sketched with economical interiority; the brass key’s tug and the librarian’s test crystallize a credible renunciation. Motivation stays rooted in sensory mystery, and the final vow carries visible cost in multicolored flames. Yet the librarian remains a cipher whose centuries of knowledge never press against Hemingway’s limits, muting relational stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Single-scene causality holds: key discovery → lighthouse portal → library revelation → luminous vow. Closure lands as Charged Poise—the multicolored flames reconfigure meaning and foreclose anonymity. The Orientation Test is met by 120 words; no teleporting props. One causal gap: why the key fits a door that “hadn’t been before” is asserted, not seeded.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Weathered pier boards, oil-lamp shadows, and drifting lanterns are filtered through a lamplighter’s selective eye. The sunken library’s starlight robes and glowing books constrain choice—waterless transit, luminous books as keys to sound-color. Spatial choreography is clean; the lighthouse exterior reappears as a threshold, charging the final multicolored flames.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—why he alone hears color—tightens when the librarian demands acknowledgment. Agency: he chooses to accept stewardship, paying with anonymity and a shimmering palm. Pressure escalates via the key’s rising heat and the sky lanterns’ chromatic echo. Cost is felt but abstract; a more visceral forfeiture would lift this higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from synesthesia reframed as sacred stewardship: “the language of light expressed through vibration.” The luminous vows constellation externalizes this without sermonizing. Final image of multicolored harbor flames reweights the premise—his gift now serves others. Subtext operates in the librarian’s rustling-page voice and the silent color-symphony.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays close to Hemingway’s perceptual bias—harbor waves are indigo, foghorns purple. Syntax is calm, rhythmic, matching a man who has walked the same pier for forty-three years. No dialogue, so voice coherence rests on sensory diction and restrained metaphor. Compression is purposeful; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet lyrical: “meteor hush,” “luminous vow of pure silver light.” Rhythm modulates with scene needs—longer cadences for wonder, clipped phrases for portal transition. No loops or scaffold; information density is high. One mixed metaphor—“robes woven from threads of starlight and seawater”—barely grazes clarity.</comment>

<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The synesthetic lamplighter who unlocks a sunken library of sound-colors feels fresh; the premise synthesizes magical realism with maritime nostalgia. Transformation test passes—this could not swap settings without loss. The luminous vows constellation is a non-obvious payoff. Minor risk: the librarian archetype flirts with trope, but starlight robes and page-voice tilt it toward wonder.</comment>
