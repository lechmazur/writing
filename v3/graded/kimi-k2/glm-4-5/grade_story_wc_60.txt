<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“luminous skeptic questioning the shadows”), but her contradictory impulses remain largely ornamental; the final choice to release memories feels inevitable rather than wrestled with, so the cost is present yet under-dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the box dissolves, fountains awaken, and Elara becomes Keeper—an earned Resonant Reconfiguration. Causal chain holds under Accumulative/Textural lens; breadcrumbs → star-map → window → release tightens once with visible city-wide payoff.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>City of Forgotten Fountains is rendered through selective, POV-filtered detail (“dry fountain basins,” “stone throats”). The micro-setting of the central plaza fountain constrains the final discovery and is recharged when water returns, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—liberate trapped memories—is signaled early and escalates once when the pedestal proves empty. The tightening is driven by Elara’s sidereal-patience choice rather than external antagonism; cost is the city’s defiant hush turning to gratitude, felt but lightly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</question><comment>Theme of memory-as-burden/freedom emerges organically through the fountains’ resurrection. Final image of water “reflecting stars” offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. Subtext in the whispers from the box deepens the thematic weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet controlled; perceptual signature (“luminous skeptic,” “defiant hush”) remains consistent. Compression and patterned elision (“sidereal patience”) are taught early and paid off at closure. No POV drift or register clash.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and musical, but occasional stacked metaphors (“luminous skeptic questioning the shadows,” “stone throats”) flirt with overwriting. No loops or scaffold; rhythm modulates with pressure. Minor purple tinge keeps it from 8.5+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</question><comment>Familiar quest structure is refreshed by the memory-box-as-bird-release metaphor and the city’s animate silence. Specificity of “sidereal patience” and “defiant hush” lifts it above template fantasy; risk is moderate but coherent.</comment>
