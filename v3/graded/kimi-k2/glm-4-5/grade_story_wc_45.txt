<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Eleanor’s contradictory impulses—scientific skepticism vs. bone-setting faith—play out in real time as she aligns realities like bones. The shift from detached observer to active intervener is embodied and earned, costing her certainty. Arthur’s liminal state forces her to confront the limits of her inherited skill, making the final hand-clasp a credible renunciation of pure rationalism.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the garden’s dissolution and Arthur’s “My bones need setting” crystallize a new, shared reality with felt cost—Eleanor’s worldview forever altered. Causal chain holds: tooth → circle → vibration → figure → mutual recognition. No teleporting props; every object’s state is tracked.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The garden’s perpetual twilight and moonpetals constrain Eleanor’s ritual choices; the hedge maze literally funnels her to the center. Victorian bio-engineering details (upside-down blooms, firefly glow) are filtered through her skeptical botanist eye and charge the final image when walls reconfigure around Arthur’s perception.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—retrieve Arthur’s authentic self—tightens when the tooth’s vibration proves the substitute body false. One decisive intensification: the figure’s emergence forces Eleanor to risk her rational identity. Cost is visible in her whispered surrender of skepticism and the garden’s reality-bending response.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from action: forgiveness outmodes skepticism, mistakes become constellations only through embodied risk. No moralizing; the final image of “constellation they would become” reweights prior material without statement. Subtext lives in Eleanor’s trembling fingers aligning air like bone.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is Eleanor’s precise, skeptical botanist diction laced with inherited folk idiom (“mending broken bones sometimes required touching the spirit”). Syntax tightens under pressure—short clauses during vibration, lyrical elongation at the end. No head-hopping; Arthur’s speech is filtered through her stunned perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet textured: “iridescent luminescence” is earned by prior defiance of physics; no loops or scaffold. Rhythm modulates—staccato during ritual, flowing as walls dissolve. Strong verbs (“dissolved into light,” “softened enough”) carry both action and emotion without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: folk bone-setting as inter-realm surgery, Victorian bio-engineered garden as liminal ICU. Risky but coherent; the tooth’s dissolution into light feels inevitable yet non-generic. Transformation test fails if relocated—details are irreplaceable.</comment>
