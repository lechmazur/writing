<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mirror maker’s interiority is vivid—calloused hands, tremor of age—but the “runaway dream” remains abstract; no contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene. The final renunciation (“I will not capture you”) is credible yet feels lightly earned because the dream never tests him. Micro-choices (breath-sync, polishing) are embodied and specific, but stakes stay conceptual rather than personal.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the sextant now points to possibility, not stars, and the orchard reconfigures from ruin to star-fruit. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of mirrored imagery and breath-cadence tighten until the final image reweights the premise. Cost is felt in the maker’s aged tremor and the irreversible shift in the sextant’s function. Orientation is clear by 120 words; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fog-bound orchard, quartz fragments catching last light, and the transformed sextant all constrain choice: the orchard’s impossible fruit only appears through the repaired lens. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered; the ruined trees mirror the maker’s own withered persistence. Micro-setting (workshop floor, brass arm) functions as extension of body and stakes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recreate the vessel to decide whether to imprison or free the dream—tightens once when the maker chooses liberation. Escalation is accretive: each breath-sync beat intensifies the boundary dissolution. Cost is the irreversible redefinition of the sextant and the maker’s acceptance of perpetual service to others’ dreams.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of erasing boundaries emerges organically from the sextant’s repurposing and the orchard’s revelation; no explicit moralizing. Final image of starlight fruit offers resonant, non-literal answer to the dream’s fate. Subtext operates in the maker’s refusal to cage what he sought, letting the dream become navigator instead.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet grounded in tactile craft: “silver nitrate, copper polish, fragments of pure quartz.” Syntax mirrors breath-sync cadence; perceptual signature is consistent. No dialogue, so no voice convergence. Compression and elision (“thirty years studying”) are strategic and taught early.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic without loops; figurative language (“glass mountains rising from fog”) is sparse and purposeful. No filter-verb stacks or mixed metaphors. Sentence variety supports the accretive pressure. Minor scaffold in “centuries of family tradition” phrase repeated, but does not dull closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Premise—mirror maker repairs sextant to recapture dream—feels fresh through the inversion of capture into liberation. Specificity of craft and orchard setting transform familiar “dream-chase” trope. Risk in lyric mode pays off; closure remains legible. No close echoes of famous scenes.</comment>
