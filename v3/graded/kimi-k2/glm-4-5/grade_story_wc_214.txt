<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elion’s spiritual curiosity and empathic openness are consistent, but the story never dramatizes an internal contradiction or micro-choice that costs him anything; the final transformation is asserted rather than earned through visible struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: a pattern of quiet observation thickens until the final reconfiguration. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) that reweights the premise, but the cost is only conceptually implied—“forever changed” lacks on-page embodiment.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The station, void, and yellow glass are vividly sketched and filter through Elion’s professional attention; the glass in particular constrains his final action and charges the closing image. Spatial anchors are clear and consistent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding strength in vulnerability—is signaled early and deepens through each star-empathy beat. However, escalation is gentle and abstract; no single tightening moment forces a trade-off with visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The theme of vulnerability-as-renewal emerges organically from star-death imagery and Elion’s empathic practice. It avoids overt moralizing, but the final paragraph edges toward thematic summary rather than image-driven resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The cosmic-philosophic register is consistent, with lyrical compression that suits the meditative stance. Perceptual signature is strong: Elion notices what a janitor-of-stars would notice. No dialogue, so no voice contamination.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is fluid and image-rich, but occasional stacked abstractions (“cosmic consciousness,” “primal elegance”) flirt with overwriting. No loops or scaffolds; rhythm modulates well with emotional crests.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>The cosmic-janitor conceit and empathic star-gazing feel fresh, synthesizing familiar tropes into a distinct contemplative frame. The final insight lands as inevitable yet non-obvious, though it leans on lyric assertion rather than dramatized discovery.</comment>
