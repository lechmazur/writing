<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is clear and embodied, but interiority flirts with label-speak (“patiently strategic”) and the chains never physically constrain her choices; the final renunciation is earned yet the cost feels generalized rather than specific to her flaws.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Causal chain holds: arrow → piano keys → vault → escape. Closure lands with a visible shift—seeds saved, wall falls—but the demolition crew’s early arrival is a mild coincidence that slightly dilutes the tightening.</comment>

<question>3</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>The carnival prize center is vividly sketched and the piano-bench micro-setting constrains the decoding beat; however, the broader geography beyond the back door remains vague, limiting environmental pressure on the final run.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—save the seeds—escalates cleanly as the wall’s demolition clock ticks; the early arrival of the crew tightens options. Cost is felt (lost seeds, ongoing exile) but not viscerally on the page at the final moment.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of renewal versus erasure emerges through concrete action; the final image of green shoots in once-dry soil reweights earlier motifs without moralizing. A touch of sentimentality in “laughter a testament” keeps it from the top band.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet controlled, with a perceptual signature in Elara’s “staggering grace.” Occasional elevated diction (“clandestine,” “iridescent”) edges toward register drift but remains consistent; no dialogue to test further.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is fluid and propulsive, with strong sensory specificity. Minor scaffold appears (“she had just begun… when she heard”), but no loops or mixed metaphors; rhythm modulates with tension. Clean copy.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Familiar dystopia refreshed by carnival setting and musical lock; the chained liberator trope gains specificity through seed-saving mission. Risk is moderate—no structural daring—but synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
