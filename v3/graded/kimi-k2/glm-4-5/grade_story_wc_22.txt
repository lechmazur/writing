<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Coachman’s interiority is vivid—seed pods as “soft language of hope” embodies motive—but the decades-later coda dilutes the single-scene pressure; the final smile feels summary rather than earned cost on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: seed-by-seed scattering tightens pattern until dawn’s “promise in his wake” crystallizes Charged Poise. One transition (carriage→jetty→battlefield) is clean; closure cost is the emptied hands and lifelong solitude.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Barren battlefield vs. resilient wildflowers on the jetty anchors place and stakes; the seed pods function as micro-setting that constrains every tactical choice. Weathered hands, dying sun, and bird calls filter through POV bias, charging the final garden image.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—restore the concord via garden—tightens as each pod is spent; bird-call guidance forces real-time course changes. Cost is the irreversible depletion of pods and the coachman’s solitary life; no external coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of “narrow vastness” emerges from concrete particulars: thirty pods against acres of scarred earth. Final image of nodding wildflowers reweights the premise without moralizing, letting silence and abundance speak the restored concord.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is textured, archaic yet tactile—“dialect that hadn’t been spoken in seven hundred years” feels lived-in. Compression and patterned elision (“submerged concord”) are taught early and paid off in the reef’s whispered return; no POV drift.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is lyrical but disciplined; figurative language (“sound of seeds hitting earth was like a soft language”) serves density without clutter. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing”) nudges register, yet rhythm accelerates under pressure and closure remains clear.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fusing dead-language necromancy with avian reconnaissance for ecological restoration is fresh; the coachman’s lonely ritual transforms a war-memorial trope into regenerative myth. Specificity of seed pods and bird calls anchors the invention, making the ending feel inevitable.</comment>
