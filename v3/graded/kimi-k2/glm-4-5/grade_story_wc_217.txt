<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical and embodied, but the poet’s contradictory impulses remain static; no micro-choice under pressure alters her stance. The final “completion that had nothing to do with finishing” is felt, yet the cost is abstract rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of release (kite snap → ink flow) tightens cadence toward closure. Closure is a Charged Poise—journal closed, feather bookmarked—cost is the surrender of the kite and the child’s cry absorbed into landscape.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Cobalt lagoon, rain-washed cliffs, and shifting feather-colors are vivid and selective; the mirrored water blurs earth/heaven and charges the final suspension. Setting constrains no tactical choice, capping at 8.2.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—capture imperfect beauty—signaled early; pressure deepens via kite release, but escalation is observational rather than narrowing options. Cost is atmospheric, not visibly paid by the poet.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of beauty in incompleteness emerges organically through image and action; final image of “forever becoming” offers resonant non-moral answer. One soft thematic echo (“beauty in the incomplete”) slightly dilutes subtext.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct lyric voice with controlled rhythm and perceptual signature; sensory hierarchy filtered through poet’s bias. No dialogue, no POV drift; compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is lush yet precise; occasional stacked modifiers (“burnished hush of the evening”) flirt with overwriting but serve cadence. No loops, no filter-verb stacks; final paragraph maintains clarity and propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Familiar “artist at shoreline” frame is refreshed by drake-feather quill and woven-dawn motif; synthesis feels specific rather than template. Risk is moderate—lyric accumulation over plot—but closure remains legible.</comment>
