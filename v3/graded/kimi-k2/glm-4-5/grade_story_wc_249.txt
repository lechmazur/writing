<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elena’s interiority is vivid—her drumming as embodied defiance, the half-consciousness of Theo lodged inside her—but the final beat leans on lyrical assertion (“separation becomes merely an illusion”) rather than dramatized cost, keeping the earned change just shy of 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the garden becomes the lagoon, Theo coalesces, and the cost is the certain knowledge that the moment will be torn away. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of drumming builds to pattern of light—without causal contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The sound wave garden is not backdrop but instrument: its vibrations unlock doors, amplify footsteps, and finally transmute into the lagoon that hosts the reunion. One more sensory anchor in the cell corridors would have pushed it to 9.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve the shared dream against erasure—tightens when Elena engineers the four-minute blackout and risks everything to reach the tower. The price is explicit: “this was temporary,” yet the act forecloses her former passive endurance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of quiet rebellion against scientific erasure emerges through concrete acts (drumming, lock-picking, sound-weaving) rather than statement. The final image of the lagoon reweights the premise: memory and love can outlast corporate control, but only at the cost of perpetual impermanence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct—percussive, synesthetic, slightly clinical yet aching. The POV never slips; even Theo’s presence is filtered through Elena’s sensory field. Rhythm modulates with urgency, and the lyric compression is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is selective and purposeful (“notes becoming flowers of light”). One minor loop—“the quiet rebellion of...”—recurs twice but does not stall momentum or cloud the final image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The neural-entanglement premise is familiar, yet its execution—drumming as code, garden as memory vessel, sorrow as auroral light—feels inevitable and specific. The risk of sentimental sci-fi is avoided by grounding every miracle in tactile detail.</comment>
