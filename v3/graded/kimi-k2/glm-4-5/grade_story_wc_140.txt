<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is textured and embodied ("ghost with flesh that hungers"), but the protagonist’s contradictory impulses remain mostly summarized rather than dramatized in scene; the final renunciation of bureaucratic identity is earned yet stated more than shown.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final image crystallizes the choice to keep collecting stories rather than reclaim paperwork. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern taught early and cadence shift lands with felt cost ("I have become something more than records can contain").</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Container labyrinth and tides are vividly anchored and return to charge the final image; the poison-bottle label functions as micro-setting that constrains memory and choice. Spatial choreography remains coherent across the single scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—identity beyond documentation—is signaled early and tightens once through the realization that stories, not papers, constitute self. Cost is felt in the renunciation of official reclamation; pressure deepens via accretion of fragments rather than causal reversals.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of erasure and reconstruction emerges organically from the container port’s constant overwriting; final image reframes identity as tidal, shared, and spoken rather than archived. Avoids explicit moralizing; resonance lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Voice is consistent, lyrical, and perceptually specific (“tones of laughter and sighs”); syntactic rhythm mirrors tidal cadence. No dialogue on page; internal monologue avoids filter-verb clutter and maintains POV modesty.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; occasional stacked metaphors (“palimpsest… overwritten… sugar in water”) risk overwriting but serve the accumulative pattern. No loops or scaffold; final paragraph lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Premise of bureaucratic death transformed into living archive feels fresh; synthesis of port logistics and ghost identity is specific and inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric mode pays off without obscuring closure.</comment>
