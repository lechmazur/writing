<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—grief-driven retreat vs. stubborn hope—are embodied in her sore fingers and quartz-eye ache; the ribbon’s reprise crystallizes her renunciation of despair. Micro-choices (planting the seed, watering with both tears) foreclose isolation with visible cost. Only the “endearingly feisty” label feels slightly external, not fully earned in dialogue.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each object added to the bridge thickens emotional density until the final image reweights the orchard as living archive. Closure lands in the apple-seed exchange—Conceptual Repricing that reframes “deciduous vows” as perennial roots. No causality breaks; spatial/temporal anchors are clear by line 5.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The inverted orchard physically constrains Elara’s reach, forcing the bridge construction; moss, stained-glass gold, and suspended apples filter perception through her mender’s gaze. Cathedral-as-archive supplies both materials (column names) and audience (whispering rafters). Sensory selection stays urgent and POV-bound.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Dominant stake—reconnection with absent daughter—tightens when the ribbon is taken and replaced by a seed, a felt price for hope. One clear deepening: from solitary making to evidence of reciprocal presence. Agency remains Elara’s; coincidence (overnight bloom) complicates rather than resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of perennial wisdom beneath deciduous vows emerges through concrete objects (ribbon → seed) without sermonizing. Final image reconfigures loss into generational continuity; ambiguity lingers in whether reunion will come, satisfying complexity. No thematic echo in dialogue.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: quartz-eye ache, selective noticing of ceiling apples, tactile handling of bent nails. Syntax modulates with fatigue (“fingers grew sore”). No dialogue, so voice coherence rests on internal texture—stable and character-specific.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is lean yet textured: “moss-covered pew,” “quartz eye ache in sympathy.” No loops or mixed metaphors; each sentence advances image or stakes. Rhythm breathes between labor and reflection. Clean mechanics.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: orchard-in-cathedral, mender’s kit as love letter, deciduous vows reimagined as perennial roots. Risky inversion of sacred space feels inevitable, not gimmicky. Specificity prevents trope drift.</comment>
