<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael’s interiority is embodied and specific—his potter’s gestures, the warmth of the glass, the circular motions that mirror his wheel. Motivation is singular and intensifies: from curiosity to caretaking. The final renunciation—choosing to return with others—carries visible cost (he stays through the night, hands shaping invisible clay). Minor slip: “sharp gentleness” is repeated as label rather than dramatized once.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the oasis’s timelines collapse into a single vibrant present, and Kael’s stance crystallizes—he will share the knowledge, foreclosing solitude. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of attention (potter’s circles, sun patterns, kindness) reweights the stake. Cost is legible in the final image—night vigil, hands still working. One micro-turn: smoke portals shift from passive vision to active invitation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is micro-focused: the half-buried lantern glass and dormant hives function as environment that constrains choice—Kael must work the earth and glass to reactivate life. Sensory hierarchy is potter-centric: texture of sand, warmth of glass, vibration in bones. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions. Wildflowers tilting toward kindness charge the final image, meeting 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—why the oasis resists decay—is signaled early and tightened through Kael’s caretaking; each act of attention narrows his solitude and commits him to return. Escalation is accumulative: thrumming ground, stirring bees, flattening smoke. Cost is felt in the night-long vigil and the decision to share. No external antagonist; pressure is situational and coherent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: memory as nourishment, kindness as renewable energy. Subtext operates in gesture—wildflowers tilting, bees sensing intention. Final image of invisible clay shaped in darkness offers non-literal answer: love remembered and re-circulated. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in whether the world will remember.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is distinct: tactile, rhythmic, potter-centric diction—“circular yet expanding outward in ripples.” POV remains tight third-person limited; no head-hopping. Compression is purposeful: “sharp gentleness” motif recurs but mostly dramatized. Syntax mirrors Kael’s wheel—circular, patient, then accelerating as timelines converge.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet clear; each sentence advances image or stakes. No loops or scaffold. Figurative language is controlled: “phototropic to kindness” risks label but is immediately embodied by petals opening. Rhythm modulates with heat shimmer and night vigil. One mixed metaphor—“smoke flattening against the darkening sky as if to punctuate”—but does not obscure closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise—abandoned beekeeping oasis sustained by kindness—is fresh, non-obvious. Transformation test fails: story would collapse without potter’s craft and lantern glass. Risk-taking in lyric timeline collapse pays off. No close echoes; synthesis feels inevitable. Specificity of potter’s gestures and beekeeper lore grounds the fantastical.</comment>
