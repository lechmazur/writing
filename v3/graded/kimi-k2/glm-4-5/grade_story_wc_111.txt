<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is textured—his ritual with the marbles, his bodily frailty, and his quiet defiance of quantification all feel lived-in. Yet the apprentice’s off-stage voice never applies pressure, so the “relationship as crucible” bullet is moot and the final stance crystallizes without visible interpersonal cost. The earned stasis is credible but leans summary rather than dramatized contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elias’s whispered defiance reconfigures the garden’s immeasurable bond against tomorrow’s instruments. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each marble placement thickens pattern until the final one reframes the whole. Orientation is clear by line 3; no causality breaks. Cost is felt in the “withered” body and the garden’s inevitable outliving of him.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The maze, marbles, and Elias’s own body function as micro-settings that constrain every move; the cracked marble at the junction literally guides footfall and memory. Sensory detail is selective—leaves “lean,” soil “embeds” glass—never catalog. Final image of the garden “blooming withering” recharges the setting as living witness.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—proving unquantifiable reciprocity—is signaled early and tightened once: the scientists’ visit forces Elias to crystallize his stance. No reversal, but the single deepening (embedding the cereus marble) forecloses any need to persuade outsiders. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral; the price is the garden’s eventual loss of its sole translator.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of mended deception emerges organically from cracked marbles and cracked bodies; no explicit thesis. Final image reweights the premise: apparent wildness is deliberate recognition. Subtext in the rustling leaves avoids sentimentality while affirming the bond.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is hushed, horticultural, and slightly archaic—“gnarled,” “cereus,” “tenders”—consistent with Elias’s vocation. No dialogue on page; free-indirect texture sustains interiority. Rhythm modulates: longer sentences for reflection, clipped fragments at dusk. No POV leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, lyrical without purple overload; “blooming withering” is the only compressed paradox and it lands. No loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated diction (“commemorate elaborately”) fits the ritual register. One near-repeat—“polishing another marble, commemorating another small victory”—is minor.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The conceit of measurable luck reframed through botanical intimacy feels fresh; the cracked-marble motif transforms a twee object into a record of lived attention. Risk in the quiet, anti-confrontational ending pays off via Charged Poise. No derivative echoes.</comment>
