<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Maya’s curiosity and “functionally creative” trait are shown through tactile exploration and circuit rerouting, but interiority drifts toward summary (“wondered how many dreams”) rather than embodied contradiction. The final choice—throwing the switch—earns its cost in the flicker of lights, yet her stoic mask stays intact without revealing deeper flaw or internal rupture. Competence is balanced by genuine struggle, but emotional layering is thin.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Causal lens holds: because Maya stays behind, therefore she finds the sextant; because she reroutes power, therefore the terminal revives. Closure lands as Decisive Change with visible cost—the resurrected lights are partial, fragile. Orientation is clear by ~100 words; no teleporting props. Minor ellipsis in technical steps is acceptable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Terminal’s dust, dormant transformers, and flickering lights are vivid and selective, filtered through Maya’s engineering gaze. The sextant’s brass against the console creates micro-setting tension. Environment constrains choice—corroded circuits force rerouting—and the revived lighting charges the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can one intern resurrect hope in a dead place—tightens when the lights flicker alive, foreclosing the option of total abandonment. Escalation is single but meaningful: from darkness to partial illumination, with the cost of partial failure implicit. Agency drives every beat; coincidence does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of hope as navigational tool emerges organically from sextant imagery and power rerouting. Final image—coordinates on brass—reweights earlier “maze of intentions” without moralizing. Subtext in the revived yet still-abandoned terminal leaves resonant ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays close to Maya’s perceptual filter; diction skews technical yet wonder-tinged. Rhythm modulates with pressure—longer sentences during reflection, clipped phrases at the switch. No dialogue, so voice coherence is judged on narration alone; it holds.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, vivid, and propulsive; no loops or scaffold. “Sleeping giants” is the only figurative reach and fits voice. Technical details feel authentic without jargon overload. Sentence variety supports momentum; no clarity issues.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Fusion of antique sextant and derelict spaceport feels fresh; the “equation for hope” reframes engineering as celestial navigation. Premise avoids cliché by grounding revival in gritty circuit work. Specificity of brass coordinates charging the final image lifts it above generic hope narratives.</comment>
