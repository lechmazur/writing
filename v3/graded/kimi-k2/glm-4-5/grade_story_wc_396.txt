<comment>Elena’s interiority is vivid—“her shadow stretching long before her as if it had a mind of its own”—and her embodied emotion when the shard “bit into her palm” anchors motive. Yet the elders, the primary external pressure, remain off-stage abstractions; relationships cannot serve as crucible when none appear on the page. Interior contradiction is dramatized in the weighted breath itself, but causal cost to her peacekeeper status is asserted not shown. Back-story exposition (shadow-lore and orchard history) totals ~22% and drifts past the 20% BRR cap without changing her present micro-choices.</comment>

<comment>Lens chosen: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is clean by word 30 (“gnarled apple trees…lighthouse orchard”); the weighted breath is named early and threads through to closure. Closure is Earned-Charged Stasis: she holds the reconstituted crystal between her fingers, the reconfiguration of “mapping empathy onto action” legible but the actual on-page price (political fallout, bodily aftermath) is inferred rather than dramatized, clipping the final cost proof. Minor teleport: we never see her physically leave the orchard for the vintage shop, only a collage of mirror memories introduced at 78%, late by the mid-point clarity rule.</comment>

<comment>Setting is lush: moonlit diamond-hard apple branches, groaning ice floes, beam sweeping in “ethereal brilliance.” These sensory particulars do more than set scene—the trees “shudder as if in recognition,” actively co-performing the ritual—but environment never materially constrains choice (e.g., no branch snaps, no cliff-edge positioning stakes). The lighthouse itself is backdrop scenery rather than apparatus Elena must navigate or manipulate during climax.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—“save their settlement from the coming storm”—is declared early and escalated by the tidal groan of shifting ice, a fine external cue tightening stakes under the Accumulative lens. Elena’s agency centers the reconstitution; the elders’ skepticism is off-page, lowering palpable conflict. Escalation is one intensifying cadence toward the weighted breath; cost is more thematic (proof of empathy) than visceral. Lucky factor: the vintage shop mirrors offer fragments without physical retrieval friction, softening earned pressure.</comment>

<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Theme of transmuting empathy into tangible result breathes quietly through image—shadows as allies, shards crystallizing between moments—never sermonized. The reprise of “mapping empathy onto action” as final pulse is resonant, though thematic articulation slips toward meta-label in the last paragraph (weighted-breath “reply stood shimmering”). Subtext sustains complexity: her power unsettles the norm yet is accepted as survival necessity.</comment>

<comment>Voice is lyrical-shadowed; diction (“shadow-laced peacekeeper,” “weighted breath”) creates consistent texture. Syntax breathes with scene rhythm, swelling during ritual and contracting to short fragments at the crystalline crescendo. One mild purple stretch: “ink in water”; overall restraint earns trust. First-person plural drift (“our people”) blurs POV modesty momentarily but returns to Elena singularity quickly.</comment>

<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm varies from sinuous long sentences during landscape setting to clipped, drum-beat clauses “The shadows responded… lifted from her palm” during climax. Density high—mirrors, ice, orchard, ritual handled in quick cuts without redundancy. One mixed metaphor: “pulled from between moments in time” barely registers. Filter verb count minimal, maintaining immediacy.</comment>

<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The shard-and-crystal conceit is familiar, yet treatment—collecting pieces via antique mirror reflections rather than traditional spellcraft—adds fresh angle. Shadow magic not as dark power but empathic conduit is non-obvious. Risk is moderate; cohesion holds. Feels inevitable in hindsight without gimmickry.</comment>
