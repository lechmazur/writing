<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is lyrically rendered but remains abstract; no contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene. The “joyful sorrow” is asserted rather than embodied through micro-choice. His final vanishing feels pre-ordained, not earned by on-page causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the harbor “sings” while Elias disappears, reweighting silence as communal music. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of mappings intensifies rather than causal chain. Cost is felt in Elias’s necessary erasure, though the beat is more elegy than decisive change.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Harbor moonlight, salt air, and the camera-as-compass are vivid and selective. The camera constrains Elias’s attention and is mirrored in the final shimmer, charging the closure image. Spatial choreography stays coherent; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—translate silence into music—is signaled early and deepened through each mapping. Yet pressure is atmospheric, not tactical; no narrowing of options or visible price paid on the page. Escalation is lyrical accumulation rather than conflict-driven.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of joyful sorrow emerges through image and gesture, never sermonized. The final singing harbor offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights all prior silence. Complexity lingers: gift and erasure are inseparable.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice is consistent, with controlled psychic distance and rhythmic variation. Perceptual signature—“water shimmered like scattered diamonds”—is character-tinged. No head-hopping; prose texture mirrors Elias’s quiet charisma.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is lush yet purposeful; occasional stacked metaphors (“invisible threads,” “warm embrace”) flirt with overwriting but serve the accumulative pattern. No loops or scaffold. Final paragraph crystallizes without figurative muddle.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Mapping silence via filmless camera and sign language is a fresh synthesis; the conceit feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk is lyric stillness rather than plot twist, but coherence holds. Specificity of gesture and harbor detail prevents cliché.</comment>
