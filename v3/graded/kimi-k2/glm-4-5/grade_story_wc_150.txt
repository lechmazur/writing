<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kaelen’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the trembling hands, the old tongue returning, the tears at closure all anchor his arc. Motivation intensifies cleanly from curiosity to purposeful restoration, culminating in the bird-piece placement that costs him exile’s weight. Minor slip: “warmly curious” is asserted rather than dramatized early on.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise in the sundial’s first shadow and Kaelen’s felt unburdening. Causal chain holds: return → discovery → daily rebuilding → final piece → spiritual completion. One smooth transition from orchard entry to dig site; orientation anchored within 120 words. No causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Catacomb orchard is tactile and specific: roots tightening around bones, morning light through canopy, sundial base half-buried. Setting constrains choices—roots dictate where Kaelen can kneel, shadows guide alignment. Final image of roots embracing the base recharges the motif. No white-room drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore lost faith—tightens through each recovered fragment; each groove rediscovered narrows the exile’s distance. Agency is continuous: Kaelen chooses to speak, to bring offerings, to place the bird. Cost is visible in the tears and the phrase “weight of exile lift.” One meaningful deepening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of cyclical return emerges from concrete particulars—bones feeding trees, sundial measuring time differently, bird carving for souls in passage. No moralizing; final line “time itself had been waiting” reweights premise without statement. Subtext in roots’ silent embrace and Elena’s whispered “beautiful.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Kaelen’s perceptual filter; diction (“foreign dust still clinging,” “grotesque yet beautiful dance”) is character-specific. Rhythm modulates with pressure—longer cadences for reflection, clipped fragments during fitting of pieces. Elena’s single line carries subtext; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and propulsive; each sentence advances image or motive. Figurative language is selective (“communion between past and present”) and never muddles causality. No loops, no scaffold, no register drift. Final paragraph achieves quiet crescendo without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: diaspora return staged as archaeological restoration within a necrotic orchard. Sundial as both literal artifact and metaphysical compass feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risky setting choice (bones and roots) is fully committed to and pays off in closure image.</comment>
