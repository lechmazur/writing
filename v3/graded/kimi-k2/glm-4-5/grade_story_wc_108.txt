<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maya’s claustrophobia and cleithrophobia are embodied in her crouch and breathing techniques; the seashell’s warmth and whisper anchor her contradictory impulses. The betrayal revelation is dramatized through the shell’s voice and the plaster cast, not exposition. Final stance—choosing vulnerability over stunt bravado—earns its cost in the charged poise of facing the silhouettes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single-scene causality holds: discovery of cast → decryption → coordinates → decision to stand. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Maya’s shift from tool to agent crystallizes as she meets the hunters with “herself, whole and unbroken.” Cost is felt in the terror she does not flee.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The rusted library’s broken skylight and decaying books physically hem Maya in, feeding her phobias; starlight provides the only usable glow for decryption. The seashell’s phosphorescence and warmth act as micro-setting extensions that constrain and guide her final choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—survival against The Production—tightens once when the decrypted cast reveals the meeting time is “dangerously near.” Agency is her decision to stand and wield vulnerability; the cost is the terror she must endure in that charged poise.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of “vulnerability is power” emerges through the seashell’s whispers and Maya’s final stance; no moralizing statement is needed. The betrayal reframes identity without tidy resolution, leaving ambiguity about what “truth” will cost her next.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Maya’s sensory filter; diction (“trembling certainty,” “beautiful uncertainty”) mirrors her stunt-trained precision colliding with raw fear. No dialogue, so voice coherence rests on internal texture and rhythmic control under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language (“voice like distant waves”) is selective and purposeful. Minor scaffold in “heart pounding” cliché is offset by fresh phrasing like “crystallized final moment.” No loops or register drift in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The stunt-double-with-phobias premise is freshened by the seashell-as-mother’s-voice and the plaster-cast decryption. The inversion—choosing vulnerability over spectacular escape—feels inevitable yet non-obvious, transforming genre tropes into personal stakes.</comment>
