<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Kaelen’s interiority is vivid—his half-smile and rumpled jacket anchor him—but the story leans on summary rather than embodied contradiction; the final “untaxed thought” lands as earned renunciation yet lacks a preceding micro-choice that visibly costs him.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: Kaelen’s moment of pure thought reclaims humanity under the Thought Tax. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern density of gardens, insects, and coded speech tightens to the final image—though the cost is more conceptual than visceral.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The greenhouse, gourd seeds, and garden plots are tactile and constraining; the carnivorous-plant message board and mycelial network charge the final beat. Sensory selection stays urgent and POV-filtered.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving inner defiance—is signaled early and escalates as surveillance adapts. The tightening comes when night-blooming cereus signals nationwide resistance, narrowing options toward the final phase; cost is implied but not yet viscerally paid.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of reclaimed humanity emerges through organic particulars—gardens, insects, coded weather talk—without moralizing. The final image of untaxed thought offers a resonant, non-literal answer to mechanized consciousness.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is consistent, with a scholar’s precision and rogue’s charm; perceptual signature shows in selective attention to botanical detail. Dialogue carries subtext (“storm approaches with determined wings”) and remains distinct between Kaelen and Dr. Beecher.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is vivid and propulsive, but occasional stacked metaphors (“converging chaos…coordinated storm”) risk overwriting. No loops or scaffold; rhythm modulates with pressure. Minor register drift toward lyric abstraction in final paragraph.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Premise of taxed thoughts is familiar, yet the synthesis with entomological cryptography, gourd-seed vibration IDs, and mycelial messaging feels fresh and inevitable. Specificity of method outweighs trope familiarity.</comment>
