<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elira’s quietly curious interiority is charming yet never deepens into agency; choices feel reactive until the final beat, where passive witnessing edges toward earned resonance but remains low-stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Linear elevator ascent provides clean (though cosmetic) causality; encrypted-diary motive is signalled early but the decryption decision never confronts escalating obstacles, so the lens reads more Accumulative than Causal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>Crystalline light-play and leather-goggle chill are vivid; however, setting mainly frames mood without constraining decisions or charging the final image beyond a gentle shimmer.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade>
<comment>Central stakes of uncovering hidden grief are clear; pressure stays atmospheric rather than tightening, and the diary’s secrets resolve without measurable pivot or cost to Elira.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>The private sorrow vs duty subtext surfaces through discreet object detail rather than blunt assertion; final moment offers tender resonance but lacks surprise or conceptual reweighting.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Narrative voice is consistent, lyrical and reflective; occasional over-performative interiority (“anguish of duty kept him from his joy”) edges toward summary.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is supple and textured, though architectural phrases occasionally echo (“scattered light into scattered patterns”); drilling down to three-word edits could heighten pace.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade>
<comment>Whisper-quiet encryption love story is an elegant twist on sky-captain tropes yet remains a stylistic variant; no fresh paradigm leap.</comment>
