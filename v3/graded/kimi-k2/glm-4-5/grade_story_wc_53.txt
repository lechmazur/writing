<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Cyrus’s regret and fractured time-sense are embodied in trembling hands and bent spine, but interiority drifts toward summary (“profoundly chronologically confused”) rather than moment-to-moment contradiction. The final negotiation with his ghost earns its poignancy because the camera wheel’s dissolution visibly costs him his last anchor to the past. Still, the shift from scavenger to penitent feels compressed—one micro-choice on the word-bridge carries the entire arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the carousel’s restart re-orders time and merges ghost with self under a Charged Poise of liquid peace. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—fragments accrete into a bridge, then into healing light—though the camera wheel’s sudden power is taught late, not early. Cost is palpable: the wheel, and thus the past, is gone.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>The kinetic lagoon’s mirrored stars and crystallized moon fruit are vivid, selective, and filtered through Cyrus’s scavenger gaze. Most crucial, the lagoon’s stillness after the halt literally enables the word-bridge; setting constrains tactics and charges the final image. Spatial choreography stays coherent across the single scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—redeeming wasted life—tightens once when Cyrus steps onto the bridge, foreclosing retreat. Pressure is coherent under the Accumulative lens: each overheard fragment adds weight until the bridge forms. The cost (loss of the camera wheel) is visible, but escalation is more accretive than sharply intensifying.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of reconciling eroded ambition emerges from Cyrus’s tactile struggle rather than statement. The final image—carousel turning, self and ghost fused—offers a non-literal answer about accepting irretrievable loss. Subtext in the ghost’s “sorrowful expression” carries more than any exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet scavenger-practical: “weathered hands,” “discarded treasures,” “silt at the bottom.” Syntax modulates with stress—short clauses during the bridge walk, longer cadences in reflection. No head-hopping; POV stays locked to Cyrus’s fractured perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; occasional poetic layering (“magnificent carousel slowly began to turn”) risks overwriting yet remains legible. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Rhythm breathes with the carousel’s halt and restart.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Familiar tropes—time-ghosts, celestial carousels—are re-angled through scavenger specificity and the disposable camera wheel as temporal lens. The synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight: a man who collected fragments finally assembles himself. Risky lyric compression pays off in the final reconfiguration.</comment>
