<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is textured and embodied; the firefighter’s contradictory impulses (guilt vs. need for meaning) are dramatized through micro-choices like tracing the fracture. The final stance—accepting the box as companion—earns its cost via prior causality. A hairline slip: “bargained innocence” is stated rather than fully dramatized in the fire scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single-scene causal arc holds: inciting discovery of box → ridge reflection → re-weighting of box’s meaning. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost: “no longer an accusation, but a companion.” No orientation drift; moonlit ridge anchors early.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Moonlit ridge and cracked porcelain function as micro-settings that constrain stance; the fracture’s gleam under moonlight directly charges the final image. Sensory selection is POV-filtered and purposeful. One minor redundancy: “slow dance of celestial bodies” appears twice without new inflection.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—translate private grief into shareable truth—tightens once via the ridge reflection that reframes the box. Agency is interior (renaming the box’s meaning) yet carries visible cost: acceptance of permanent scars. No external antagonist needed; pressure is situational and coherent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: survival’s marks as quiet beauty. Subtext operates through the box’s shift from accusation to testament. Final image reweights prior material without moralizing. One near-miss: “bargained innocence” is named rather than fully enacted, but context rescues it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is consistent, weathered, and lyric without purple drift. Perceptual signature is selective (cool porcelain vs. searing memory). No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates cleanly. Rhythm breathes with ascent and descent of ridge path.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is lean yet textured; every sentence advances character or atmosphere. No loops or scaffold. Figurative language is sparse and precise (“dark vein against the milky porcelain”). Final paragraph crystallizes without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Firefighter-with-relic premise is familiar, but the inversion of the relic from trophy to mirror of shared fragility feels fresh. Specificity of forest-fire detail and porcelain fracture elevates it above template. Risk lies in quiet interiority, executed without gimmickry.</comment>
