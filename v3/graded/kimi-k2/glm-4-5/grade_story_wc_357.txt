<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Arion is sketched as competent, brave, and mission-driven but interior contradiction is missing; his emotions remain summary-level (“dread and wonder”) and no moment forces him into an on-page choice with visible cost. The arrow’s agency is more compelling than the pilot’s.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Causality is sound: inversion clock → water-navigate → echo-vision → seed-fragment reveal. Closure is an earned Resonant Reconfiguration; Verdantis’s future is recalibrated through gained knowledge. Arrow tip as seed-motif is cleanly seeded and paid off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Floating arches, reversed rivers, and the First Arch’s crystals are vividly tactile, supply navigational constraint, and supply the visual charge in the closure image. Landscape consistently affects tactics; “latticed shadows,” “aerial roads,” and echo-shimmer are sensory and purposeful rather than ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake (“source of resilience”) is declared early. Pressure mounts via inversion clock but actual escalation depends on external phenomena—arrow tip glow, echoes delivering lore—rather than protagonist choices driving cost or narrowing options. The cost of discovery is offloaded to the arrow’s lore dump rather than dramatized sacrifice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of ecological adaptation and memory emerges through events, arrow tip reprise, and collective orchard survival. Resonance is present but diluted because the protagonist’s personal stakes never bite—he gains knowledge, pays no personal price, so concept outweighs character cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Textured, elevated third-person lyrical. Syntax and diction flow cleanly with rhythmic variation—“sky-ship,” “whirling silence,” “aerial roads”—without overwriting. POV lens stays consistently above the protagonist. Distinctiveness is high, though voice remains safely literary-fantasy standard rather than sharply personal.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is supple, clear, and propulsive. Occasional stock phrasing (“ancient resonance,” “secrets whispered”) and slight metaphor drift into cliché, but no major loops or clarity artifacts. Reads cleanly aloud; momentum maintained.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</question>
<comment>Gravitational inversion as hourglass farm-raid is fresh, organic, and explored through ecological mechanism. Seed-arrow fragment neatly twists classic heroic relic into planetary life support tech. No derivative scenes—every image feels specific to this orchard skyscape.</comment>
