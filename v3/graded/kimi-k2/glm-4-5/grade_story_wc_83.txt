<comment>Elias’s grief-driven motives are visible, but interiority drifts into poetic labels ("strange cocktail of grief") rather than embodied stakes. Micro-choices—using the pod, placing the crystal—hold, yet emotional modulation flattens mid-beat. Final moment is an expansion, not renunciation, so cost stays abstract. Character still feels more emblem than singular individual.</comment>

<comment>Dominant lens is causal; each leg of the descent follows “coordinates calculated” therefore “pod descends” therefore “crystal absorbs.” Closure is Charged Poise crystallizing future purpose—clear on page. The shift from survivor to “harvester” lands as reconfiguration with future cost hinted, satisfying the drive. One circuit-breaker constraint recurs without loophole.</comment>

<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Floating observatory, ruined garden, and mutated amphitheater are anchored early, then revisited to shape moment-to-moment choices. The amphitheater micro-setting as “reservoir” constrains final placement and resonates with the absorbed potential. Sensation is vivid but selectively focused on the crystal, avoiding tourist list. One spatial slip: “pod landed softly”—weight/gravity not reconciled with floating altitude—only −0.1.</comment>

<grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Central stake: harvesting lost potential to redeem future. Stakes escalate from detection to retrieval, pressure tightened by cooling breakers and risk of shields. Agency remains Elias’s throughout; decision to descend is causal, not chance. Cost is present as continued exposure to a haunted wasteland but remains more conceptual than viscerally felt, capping band just below high.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Themes of post-traumatic salvage and human potential re-emerge via concrete absorption ritual, not dictation. Final image of becoming “harvester of hopes” reweights ruins without sermon. Complexity sustained—no tidy moral, just ambiguous promise of future transformation. Subtext is strongest in quiet handling of amphitheater absence rather than description.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Narrative voice steady in close third, perceptual signature leans toward lyrical technical diction blended with survivor fatigue. One syntax cluster “bleak exhilaration of his mission / the bleak exhilaration intensified” reads repetitive, not variegated, −0.4. Otherwise rhythm flows with pressure pulses.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry dual load of precision and atmospheric charge. Occasional modifier stacks (“intangibly tangible”) ride on edge of muddle but remain motivated by the conceptual object. No outright loops except the echo “bleak exhilaration”. Strong sensory specificity: “air thick with ozone and decay” lands clear and urgent.</comment>

<comment>Fusion of quantum-physics vocabulary with emotional mining of ruins creates fresh conceptual space. Framing drone-strike wedding survivor as solitary harvester reframes trope of post-apocalyptic pilgrim. Specificity (perturbation theory as navigational practice) ties method to motive, preventing generic overlay. Risk is in conceptual exposition but holds with internal consistency, earning a minor risk bonus.</comment>
