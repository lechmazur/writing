<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Anya’s interiority—her numbered days after the hatching—drives every seed placement; the contradiction between furious motion and tranquil intent is embodied, not stated. The final reach toward the vortex is earned by prior beat work and a visibly costly renunciation of cataloguing. Minor flattening appears in the phrase “her biological clock striking midnight,” a diagnostic echo.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the spiral of seeds plus cap opens the vortex and reconfigures Anya’s stance from observer to participant. Causality proceeds from entropy decrease → vortex → touch → becoming bridge; each step follows. Tight, no breaks; cost is the irreversible abandonment of her old saving ritual, palpable in her final reach.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The frost, crystalline ceiling, starlight and seed glass are selective and lived-in; the chilled floor bites her bare feet, constraining speed and forcing deliberate placement. The oak acorn cap, warmed by skin, counts as micro-setting charging the final image. No white-room gaps persist.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Single dominant stake—touch the texture of time before death—is signaled early. Escalation tightens as each perfect placement narrows escape routes and invests more of her lifespan in the pattern. The cost—forever leaving the safe archive model—is dramatized on the last beat, not merely declared.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from action: preservation vs experience, cataloguing vs living the moment. The final line—“the texture of borrowed time was none other than the texture of herself”—is earned by the concrete seed spiral and the physical touch, not stated as thesis. Ambiguity lingers rather than sermonizes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The lyrical, elliptical narration sustains a single perceptual signature; diction (“wild serenity,” “swirling gateway not to another place but to another time”) stays coherent. POV modulates with Anya’s physical rhythm—short breaths crystallizing—without leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet clear; the starlight “responding” or “seeking its roots” leans to lyric overwrite but stays within Anya’s heightened sensorium. One paraphrase loop: “the paradoxical state of furious tranquility deepening” is almost restated verbatim two sentences later; minor.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The seed-spiral-entropy-vortex construction is a fresh angle on familiar time-bend motifs. The synthesis feels inevitable—each beat literalizes abstract physics—yet risks a whisper of familiar “time is texture.” Marginally derivative, but the seed-coding specificity rescues it.</comment>
