<question>1</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Elias’s desire “to understand the weight of names” is dramatized through each etched zodiac glyph and the forging choice that redefines purpose; interior contradictions (failure vs redemption) are embodied in the foundry heat and luminous regret he bears in his hands, making the earned renunciation credible and weighed.</comment>

<question>2</question>
<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>A tight causal arc (“failed search → luminous regret → kintsugi forging → rebalanced purpose”) drives stakes; closure lands as visible Conceptual Repricing—the flawed coin is accepted as golden seam—showing a newly oriented stance with felt cost under Causal lens.</comment>

<question>3</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Foundry anchors texture and scope; rain-washed surfaces refract light to mirror Elias’s regret, while furnace heat enables pivotal beat of metal transformation that alters outcome—setting becomes constraint and resource rather than backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—the lost zodiac coin’s knowledge—is reweighted at climax when Elias forges a replacement instead of recovering original, narrowing options from external quest to internal redemption with visible price (flawed vs luminous).</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of “names as identity” emerges through the act of reminting glyphs and accepting their recast flaws; no didactic statement, but the final golden disc visually responds to the central question of identity after loss.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Clear single focalizer; syntax modulates from introspective memory to tactile forging beats; no head-hopping; dialogue distilled into internal heartbeat voiced with heat-forged metaphors.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Precise metallurgical diction and rhythmic shifts (“copper veins cooled into argument”) carry momentum without purple overload; no loops or scaffold detected—density is purposeful and propels the final glowing disc.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Kintsugi-framed redemption by forging a flawed replacement instead of recovering original feels non-obvious; transformation visible in the golden-seamed coin, avoiding cliché treasure recovery plots.</comment>
