<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maya's paradox—arsonist's child turned protector—drives every beat. Interiority shows contradictory impulses mid-action (e.g. touching black sand while fighting flames), and her final posture in the garden is earned by prior choices. The cost of heritage and chosen identity is legible at closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal chain is tight: volcanic sand coin → memory → garden graft → defensive fire-blanket → earned stance at lagoon. Closure (Charged Poise) reweights her legacy under Hybrid lens. No orientation lapses.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Black sand, kelp-drift lagoon, and volcanic breeze ground emotion and constrain tactics without clutter. Descriptions remain focused through POV urgency; the lagoon mirrors stakes and recharges the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—save grafted roses amid fire—narrows via wind shift and on-page costs. One escalation moment: wind-fed ember landing forces choice. Agency preserved without luck.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme "scars can sing" emerges from graft union to final lagoon reflection, never stated. Subtext in sand-coin redemption arc and adaptive roses; final image reframes legacy with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Voice distinct: sensory, tactile diction matches firefighter-alert state. Sensory narrowing under stress—smoke, heat, rose thorns—reads lived-in. No head-hopping; one POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Clean, concise, kinetic sentences rise with urgency. One small template cadence in smoke-description is forgiven. High density without clutter; final lagoon line lands as CR- worth image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Reversal-archetype (phoenix daughter) is made specific through sand-coin ritual and graft stakes. Ending transformation feels inevitable. No derivative drift.</comment>
