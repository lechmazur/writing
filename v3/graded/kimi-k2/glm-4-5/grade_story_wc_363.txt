<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“touched the amber bead each evening, feeling its warmth strengthen”), but her contradictory impulses remain largely summarized rather than dramatized in-scene. The final choice to sacrifice memories is foreshadowed yet feels slightly abstract because the cost is narrated rather than experienced in real time. The loom-spinner occupation is used atmospherically rather than as a crucible for choice, limiting depth. Still, the character arc from passive witness to active bearer of sound is coherent and specific.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens is taught early via the vanishing sounds motif and held through the pattern of sacrifices. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the world’s sound returns with conceptual cost—the bead’s extinction and Elara’s irretrievable memories. The puzzle-path mechanics are legible, and the final image reweights the premise without exposition. Minor ellipsis in the “three days” transition is acceptable under the lyric mode.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The bamboo forest and forgotten orchard are evoked with sensory precision (“sunlight filtered green-gold through ancient stalks”) and function as both physical and metaphysical space. The loom and amber bead serve as micro-settings that constrain choice. However, the orchard itself is more backdrop than active pressure; only the bamboo shoot at the climax directly shapes the final act, capping the score just below excellence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—restoring sound to a silenced world—is signaled early and escalates through each vanished noise. The puzzle-path sacrifices provide a meaningful tightening: each memory given narrows Elara’s remaining self. The cost is visible (memories lost, bead extinguished), but the external pressure remains somewhat abstract, limiting the visceral punch required for the 8.8+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: silence as presence, sound as communal memory. The amber bead’s transformation from vessel to spent catalyst reweights the motif without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture (touching the bead, stepping on puzzle pieces) rather than declaration. The final image—“weave not just threads but the very fabric of sound”—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the thematic question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>The lyrical third-person limited voice maintains consistent perceptual signature (“wistful,” “stoically sparkling”) and modulates rhythm under pressure. Compression (“time blurred strangely”) is taught early and paid off at closure. No dialogue appears, so voice coherence rests on narrative texture, which remains stable. Occasional elevated diction (“raveling silence,” “crystalline prison”) skirts purple but stays within the fairy-tale register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean and propulsive, with strong verbs (“etched,” “vibrated”) and selective sensory detail. A few loops (“the silence… the silence”) are minor. Metaphors are coherent; no mixed vehicles. The final paragraph’s cadence shift to shorter clauses mirrors the world’s reawakening, demonstrating rhythmic control. No artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of loom craft, vanishing sound, and puzzle-path journey feels fresh yet inevitable. The amber bead’s dual role as memory-currency and message-vessel transforms a familiar quest object into something specific. Risk-taking in the lyric time-slippage pays off. Only the orchard setting remains somewhat generic, preventing a higher score.</comment>
