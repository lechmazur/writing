<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The bride’s contradictory drive—tethered here yet reaching for release—generates credible tension in every act: choosing to conserve seeds, transmitting them, dying again. Embodied emotion peaks when her fingers manage transparent lift. Motivation rooted in lifetime debt remains consistent, informs micro-choices, and culminates in self-sacrificial cost. Interiority remains vivid, though a few stock phrasings leech specificity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: accumulative/textural; pattern—moonlit increment, bead pulse, seed release—tightens until the dying bead crystallizes a before/after. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: her dispersal into spiral bloom visibly bridges worlds, leaving greenhouse forever altered. Static reflection block at ~30% is anchored to present cues and alters her stance about timing the seeds, so BRR exception holds; pattern is taught early and pays off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>North window frost, moonlit vines, and cracked winter fields furnish tactile micro-pressures; greenhouse glass distorts starlight in a way that subtly contracts her options (cannot pass through). The spiral-shaped flower that breaks the snow at the end physically constrains future caretaker ritual. Spatial choreography is clean; objects recur as active tools. A few ornamental luminary calls linger, but environment ultimately serves the decisive act.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single dominant stake—settle the lifetime debt—escalates via accumulative resonance: bead strengthens her form for one harvest, each pulse widening cost of failure. Final release forecloses her remaining trace while birthing the impossible bloom, price paid on the page. No coincidences heal her; the new growth responds explicitly to her last full act. Pressure is coherent and intensifying under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of love-transcendent debt emerges from the specific spiral seed, not authorial commentary. Mourning and elation interweave in the greenhouse’s living paradox, crystallizing in the lone winter-bloom. Final image reweights the entire premise: love can span worlds, but only through obliteration of prior self. No sermonizing—the blossom’s spiral silently retroviruses meaning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lush yet distanced third-person limns a spectral vantage: syntax elongates in mournful droops, then snaps into clipped wonder at star-pulse. No dialogue, so authority rests on metaphor discipline and perceptual signature (pollen as “lovingly venomous”). One or two compound sentences veer toward ornament, but voice modulates under pressure without head-hop. Consistent celestial diction ties POV to bride’s liminality.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Rhythmic control: cascading clauses mimic drifting apparition; abbreviated cadences at climax mirror bead’s fracturing. Dense compression—single sentence sometimes roots setting, gesture, and mythic resonance. Few hedge words; only one redundant moonlight phrase. Final lines achieve crystalline clarity without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Turns the shop-worn ghost-lover tale into alchemical botany—spores, beads, spiral seeds—that fuse grief and resurrection in a concrete greenhouse ritual. The winter-bloom with spiral heart feels inevitable yet unforeseeable, retroextending its logic through every prior pulse. Risky lyric time-looping lands cleanly in one controlled image. Freshness resides in method, not surprise gimmick.</comment>
