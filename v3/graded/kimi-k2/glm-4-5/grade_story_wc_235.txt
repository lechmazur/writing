<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is rich and embodied (“trembling fingers,” “aching for a time he’d never known”), but the piece leans on summary rather than on-page micro-choices to show the shift from chronicler to cartographer of consciousness. The final renunciation (rolling the scroll) is legible, yet the cost feels generalized rather than specific to this man’s lived flaws.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias accepts his role and the scroll’s call, with the dawn image crystallizing a before/after. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of dream-records, scroll, aurora, dawn—but the Orientation Test is waived because disorientation is functional. One tightening beat suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mountain cabin, birch bark, and aurora are vivid and selective; the scroll itself constrains the final choice by glowing and demanding closure. Spatial anchors (rustic desk, 8,000 ft) arrive early; no white-room syndrome. Weather (upside-down snow) integrates with theme without cliché.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—make narrative sense of chaos—tightens when the scroll activates and Elias must decide to continue chronicling. Escalation is textural (glow, aurora, dissolution) rather than causal, but the lens permits this. Cost is conceptual (accepting endless recursion) rather than viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of mortality-as-cradle emerges from concrete particulars (own grave, moss-covered stone) rather than assertion. Final dawn image reweights earlier motifs without moralizing. Subtext operates in the scroll’s silence and the aurora’s indifferent beauty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet disciplined; perceptual signature is consistent (“snow sometimes fell upside down”). No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates with intensity. Diction stays within Elias’s plausible lexicon; no register drift. Rhythm breathes with emotional crests.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and musical, but occasional stacked metaphors (“feral nostalgia washed over him”) risk overwriting. No loops or scaffold; sentences advance story or atmosphere. Minor filter-verb clusters (“he felt”) appear mid-scene but do not dull closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Premise—lucid dream cartographer mapping his own grave—feels fresh and specific. Tropes (vision-quest, scroll of power) are transformed through Elias’s jaded wonder. Risky nonlinear time is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>
