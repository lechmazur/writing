<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is vivid—his “familiar pull toward the space that existed in between” anchors motive—but the ghost remains off-stage, so relationship-as-crucible is absent. Micro-choices (lifting the program, choosing to play) are embodied and escalate stakes. Final renunciation—program dissolves, silence transfigured—earns cost, though the ghost’s absence limits contradiction depth.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (water, lanterns, stains) thickens toward the final chord. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—music completes the suspended aria, cost felt as program dissolves. Orientation is swift; no teleporting props. One minor ellipsis: how piano stayed dry is unexplained but doesn’t break causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Flooded opera house is no postcard; water depth dictates wading gait, lantern flicker guides sightlines, piano’s untouched state becomes uncanny constraint. Micro-setting (floating debris as music stand) directly enables the climax. Final image—water stilled by music—recharges every prior sensory layer.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finish the ghost’s song—signaled early. Escalation is accretive: stains → notation → performance → dissolution. One tightening beat: decision to play forecloses retreat and costs the program’s existence. Agency is Elias’s alone; coincidence never rescues.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of liminality emerges through concrete pattern—water as threshold, music as bridge—never stated. Final non-literal answer: silence after the chord is no longer absence but completion. Subtext in wordless duet with unseen singer carries emotional aftereffect without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is lush yet disciplined, syntax lengthening with musical phrases, compressing under urgency (“tentatively at first, then with growing confidence”). Perceptual signature—musician’s ear for timbre, resonance—remains consistent. No dialogue, so no register drift; lyric elision taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose sings: “keys gleaming…like pearls in the deep” is precise, not purple. Rhythm modulates with scene pulse; no loops or scaffold. One mixed metaphor—“shimmering stars in a midnight sky” amid indoor lanterns—barely grazes clarity. High density, zero filler.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Flooded opera house + ghost aria + water-notated score synthesizes familiar tropes into fresh configuration. Risky lyric mode commits fully; payoff legible. Transformation test fails only if relocated, proving specificity. No close echoes of famous scenes.</comment>
