<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elena’s interiority is vivid—her “breath catching,” “fingers trembling with cautious exuberance”—but the story leans on summary rather than dramatized contradiction; the final walk to the chamber is the first micro-choice we actually witness. Motivation is clear and consistent, yet the cost of her “carefully reckless” stance is asserted more than felt until the last line.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: Elena steps toward the chamber carrying translations whose weight is legible (“bridges waiting to be rebuilt”). Causality is causal-lens: each translated promise tightens the stakes because/therefore until the final image crystallizes the cost. Orientation is anchored early; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The archive’s “dust motes dancing in the afternoon light” and the glass ink well’s glow create tactile atmosphere, but only the ink well constrains a late choice—its near-emptiness signals spent effort. Spatial anchors hold; sensory selection is purposeful and POV-filtered.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preventing permanent division—is signaled in paragraph three and escalates via each translated promise that narrows the diplomatic window. The final tightening occurs when Elena realizes the ceremonial text’s consequences; the cost is the ink well’s exhaustion and her own exposure as “dreamer or savior.”</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of reconciliation through linguistic truth emerges organically from the act of translation; no moralizing statement intrudes. The glass ink well’s final glow reweights earlier motifs of illumination and depletion, offering a resonant non-verbal answer to the question of whether words can heal silence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet disciplined, with rhythmic variation that mirrors Elena’s oscillation between caution and daring. Free-indirect style stays cleanly within her scholarly lexicon; no POV leakage. The prose’s texture—“symphonies of truth,” “latticework of relationships”—is character-specific rather than ornamental.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Sentences are propulsive and information-dense; occasional stacked metaphors (“symphonies,” “latticework,” “bridges”) risk overwriting but remain coherent under the lyrical lens. No loops or scaffold; minor filter-verb clusters (“she would pause, examining”) are voice-motivated and brief.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The premise—reconciliation via extinct-language marriage contracts—is fresh and grounded in specific philological detail. The risk of a quiet, non-confrontational ending pays off through the charged image of the nearly empty ink well. No derivative echoes; the synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
