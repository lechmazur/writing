<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Eleanor’s grief and archival compulsion are embodied in tactile micro-choices (adjusting the lamp, tracing dust). The final meeting with Benjamin crystallizes her arc from passive observer to active witness, paying the cost of reopened loss. Interiority is specific, but the dialogue exchange is slightly too tidy.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the button’s return reweights Eleanor’s solitude into shared witness. Dust-pattern forensics is taught early and paid off at the reunion. Causal chain holds under Accumulative/Textural lens; only minor ellipsis between file discovery and Benjamin’s arrival.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The foster-care file room is rendered through lived detail—drawer handles, dust signatures, yellowed papers—constraining Eleanor’s movements and shaping her method. Lighting and spatial layout guide the reunion staging. Micro-setting (the button) charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can Eleanor convert institutional detritus into human connection? Escalation occurs via the button’s mystery and Benjamin’s arrival, tightening her isolation into shared recognition. Cost is felt in the reopened ache of her own failed adoption.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of invisible kindnesses emerges organically from case-note marginalia and Benjamin’s gratitude. Final image of “two fractured souls” reframes archival labor as mutual rescue. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers in whether the healing is mutual or asymmetrical.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Voice is precise, archivist-cool, with selective sensory focus. Rhythm modulates between clinical cataloguing and quiet ache. Dialogue is minimal but natural; Benjamin’s “You found my button” carries subtext. No POV drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, information-dense, and propulsive. Metaphors (“dust signature,” “fractured journeys”) serve character lens. No loops or scaffold; occasional elevated diction (“tactfully hopeful”) fits Eleanor’s professional restraint.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh angle: bureaucratic dust as forensic empathy. Button-as-talisman repurposes military relic into civilian healing. Risky compression of decades into reunion is earned by dust-pattern logic. Specificity of foster-care micro-kindnesses feels lived, not researched.</comment>
