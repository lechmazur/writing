<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid (“homesick for lives she had never lived”), but her contradictory impulses remain stated rather than dramatized; the final stance crystallizes cleanly yet the cost feels abstract rather than embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara’s acceptance of chronicler duty carries conceptual cost. Causality is Accumulative/Textural; pattern taught early, closure reweights premise, though emerald-card dissolve is slightly convenient.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Derelict ship and greenhouse tree are rendered with selective, tactile detail; the tree’s emerald leaves charge the final image and constrain Elara’s choice to merge with the memories.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recovering lost identity—tightens when Elara realizes her purpose is to voice the forgotten. Pressure deepens via memory immersion, but escalation is more textural than causal; cost is felt yet diffuse.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of identity-through-others emerges organically from the memory threads; final image of Elara dissolving into the tree offers non-literal resonance without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lyrical, consistent third-person limited voice; perceptual signature is distinct (“blissfully aberrant”). No dialogue, but rhythm and diction modulate with emotional intensity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic; occasional figurative layering (“echoing emptiness”) flirts with overwriting but never stalls momentum. No loops or scaffold artifacts in final third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Chimera-twin conceit and memory-ship synthesis feel fresh; risk-taking in lyric structure heightens resonance without obscuring clarity. Avoids derivative tropes through specific emotional stakes.</comment>
