<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“tears froze on her cheeks”), her guilt-to-purpose arc is credible, and the final renunciation (staying as keeper) carries visible cost. Yet the “technically gentle” trait is asserted more than dramatized in the braiding scene, and the forgiveness backstory is slightly abstract.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Closure lands cleanly: the rope’s illumination and crystallized names constitute a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost (she stays, forever). Causal chain—card pattern → braid reconfiguration → auroral transcription—holds without gaps. Orientation is swift; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The icebound sanctum is more than backdrop; its cold literally preserves the names and forces her choice to remain. Aurora, rope-light channels, and frozen font converge in the final image, constraining action and charging closure. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserve forgotten names—is signaled early and tightened when the rope’s glow demands her permanent service. One decisive turn: she reconfigures the braids, irrevocably binding herself. Cost is explicit in her tear-tracked decision to stay.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of memory-as-atonement emerges organically from the rope ritual; no moralizing. The final image—names crystallized in ice—offers a non-literal answer to how guilt can be transmuted into custodianship. Subtext in the card’s new blank patterns suggests ongoing, unfinished work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with a perceptual signature attuned to craft (“technically gentle touch,” “wax caster’s fingers”). Syntax modulates with pressure; no head-hopping. Aurora and organ card return as charged motifs without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and mythic registers without redundancy. Metaphors (“snowmelt ardor”) are fresh and earned. No loops or scaffold; rhythm accelerates during the braiding climax and settles into the keeper’s quiet resolve.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The fusion of lost-wax craft, organ-card cryptography, and auroral memory-keeping is original and inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric compression pays off in the crystallized-names closure. No derivative echoes; the synthesis feels singular.</comment>
