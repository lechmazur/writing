<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Eliza’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her guilt over past silence is palpable in the final beat—but the “creeping normality noticer” trait is asserted more than dramatized; no moment shows her noticing a micro-change that then alters tactics. The micro-choice to leave the bread is earned and carries cost, satisfying the closure test.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of slow decay → guerrilla life → revelation → renunciation. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Eliza leaves the bread; the cost is the irreversibility of her own past silence. Orientation is clear by line 3; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Tea house, courtyard herbs, and rain on tin roof are selective, sensory, and filter through Eliza’s caretaker bias. The guerrilla garden constrains her identity and supplies the final herbal tea, charging the closure image. Spatial choreography is clean; no white-room drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—uncovering why the bakery vanished—tightens once when the letter reweights the moral calculus. The escalation is textural: each sensory layer (bread smell, rain, garden growth) intensifies the cost of knowing. Agency is Eliza’s decision to read aloud and later to relinquish the bread.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of “sacred in the ordinary” emerges through concrete particulars—bread, herbs, rain—without sermonizing. Final image of bread left for “whoever might need” reconfigures the earlier guilt into quiet service. Subtext in the letter’s revelation reframes decay as protective love.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet grounded in Eliza’s perceptual signature: “creeping normality,” “guerrilla gardening,” “tenuous absolution.” Syntax modulates with emotional pressure; no head-hopping. Free-indirect style stays coherent; diction never drifts into abstraction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is lean and rhythmic; each sentence layers sensory detail or interior motion. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. “Bread tasted different now, like forgiveness meant to be shared” is precise and resonant without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Familiar premise of vanished shop is transformed through the quiet lens of incremental noticing and guerrilla caretaking. The final reweighting—disappearance as act of love—feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Specificity of “Sweet Morning” paper and courtyard herbs anchors freshness.</comment>
