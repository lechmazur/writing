<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Kael’s interiority is concrete—his acoustic gift, the cracked bowl, the nightly stories—but the final choice to “unbind the silence” is more stated than dramatized; we see the family’s tears but not Kael’s internal contradiction or felt cost, so the change reads as affirmation rather than earned renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the chronic hush is reweighted from absence to “a different kind of music.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each nightly story, bowl placement, and violin note layers density until the final cadence—but the cost is collective wonder rather than a personal price exacted from Kael.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The greenhouse, shipwrecks, and bowl form a micro-setting that literally amplifies choice; placing the bowl against hull ribs turns wreckage into instrument. Sensory selection is biased through Kael’s acoustic perception, grounding us in tactile vibration rather than tourist visuals.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</question><comment>The dominant stake—can Kael wrest song from post-burn silence—tightens once when he realizes the hush is “a different kind of music.” Agency is present (he plays), but the escalation is more epiphany than irreversible trade-off; no visible resource is spent or path foreclosed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</question><comment>Theme emerges organically: beauty inheres in the unfinished. The cracked bowl, burned forest, and listing wrecks embody this without sermon. The final image of “magnificence in simplicity” reweights prior motifs, yet the absence of a personal moral cost keeps it from deeper resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</question><comment>Third-person limited stays close to Kael’s acoustic sensorium; diction is lyrical yet disciplined, avoiding purple drift. Rhythm modulates with scene pressure—longer cadences for reflection, shorter pulses during the final performance—creating a distinct perceptual signature.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</question><comment>Prose is clean, vivid, and propulsive; no loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated phrasing (“tapestry of sound”) is earned by context. Information density is high—each sentence layers setting, character, and theme without redundancy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</question><comment>The fusion of post-apocalyptic hush, shipwreck acoustics, and heirloom bowl feels fresh; familiar eco-grief tropes are transformed through Kael’s synesthetic vocation. The premise commits fully, and the risk of lyric stillness pays off in a coherent final image.</comment>
