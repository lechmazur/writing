<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s retrocognitive gift is shown in action—charting stars from ancestral memory—but her interior contradiction (hope vs. burden) is stated more than dramatized. The final climb and alignment carry embodied cost (trembling hands, dawn fatigue), earning the renunciation of permanent restoration. Yet the “thistle-blown hope” label feels externally applied rather than wrung from her body.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the beacon’s rekindling reframes collapse as transformation. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of star charts, prism glow, pavilion hum layers to a cadence shift. Cost is legible in “fragile light…would not last forever,” foreclosing permanence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Glass humming pavilion is more postcard than crucible until the final beat, when its sympathetic resonance with starlight charges the beacon’s rebirth. Spatial choreography is clean; the tower stairs, prism housing, and meteor streak are tracked without drift. The prism itself functions as micro-setting that constrains the alignment choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove coincidences have meaning—tightens through nightly charting and the decisive alignment. Escalation is steady but low-grade; no tangible resource loss raises the price beyond fatigue. The meteor revelation complicates rather than rescues, preserving agency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</question><comment>Theme emerges organically: pattern vs. chaos, silence as knowledge. Final image of “someone might see the light” reweights prior isolation without moralizing. Avoids tidy binaries—light is fragile, hope is thistle-blown—yet the shard of hush never quite escapes abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</question><comment>Voice is lyrical yet disciplined, with perceptual signature in “glass humming” and “thistle-blown.” Syntax modulates from long reflective cadences to the clipped urgency of “For a moment, nothing happened.” No head-hopping; POV stays interior and consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</question><comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; “the pavilion seemed to hold its breath” is earned. Occasional soft phrases—“merely a reminder,” “somehow survived”—dull edge but do not recur in closure. No loops or mixed metaphors.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</question><comment>Post-apocalyptic beacon-tender is familiar, but the retrocognitive star-mapping and shard-of-hush silence give fresh inflection. The transformation of collapse into “witness” rather than tragedy feels specific to this voice. Risk is moderate; execution elevates the trope.</comment>
