<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“fingers flew across the encrypted keypad”), but the pattern seeker’s contradictory impulses remain implied rather than dramatized in scene; the final stance crystallizes with felt cost (“speaking with clarity that belied the complexity of their burden”), satisfying the 9+ quick test at the edge.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the urgent transmission reconfigures the watcher’s stance and the community’s fate with undeniable pressure. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—density of anomalies and memory tighten the cadence toward the final act. One minor orientation wobble: “the ancient canopy” arrives before we know we’re airborne, but the effect serves the lyric disorientation and is waived.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The nocturnal arbor is rendered through selective sensory detail (“thin atmosphere where only birds and watchers dared”) and the parachute buckle functions as micro-setting that constrains the final choice. Spatial choreography is coherent; altitude and tether logistics track. The environment charges the ending image, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“preserve trust under pressure”—is signaled early and tightens once when anomalies contradict patterns, forcing the midnight transmission. Cost is visible in the solitary vigil and the dread-laden voice that “belied complexity.” Agency drives escalation under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of trust-as-burden emerges through particulars (buckle, static, star-whispers) without moralizing. The final image of the lone voice transmitting urgent truth reweights prior motifs into resonant ambiguity. No thematic drift; complexity is honored.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Distinct perceptual signature—“soundless echo,” “mathematics of survival”—sustains lyric compression. POV remains stable; psychic distance modulates with stress. No dialogue, so voice coherence rests on internal texture, which holds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, but occasional stacked modifiers (“infinite puzzle scattered across eternity”) flirt with overwriting without pattern pay-off. No loops or scaffold; momentum is intact. Minor register drift in “conceptual repricing”-type phrasing keeps it below 8.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: aerial arbor civilization, star-pattern meteorology, encrypted radio vigil. Tropes are transformed through tactile specificity and embodied duty. The parachute buckle’s reprise feels inevitable, not gimmicky. Risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
