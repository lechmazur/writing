<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Aria’s gift is vivid, but her interiority drifts into lyrical summary (“hushed blaze,” “echo of lives”) rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The final insight is earned, yet the cost is more asserted than dramatized—no visible forfeiture beyond a smile at sunrise.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each placed object layers density until the cottage tableau reweights the premise. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration—Aria’s stance crystallizes with conceptual cost (“path forward was clear”)—but the cost is felt more than shown.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Predawn bay town breathes through selective sensory cues (“dew-kissed streets,” “streetlights daydreamed”). The lighthouse cottage as micro-setting constrains the final placement and glows with returned memory, charging the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—why some houses feel alive—is signaled early and tightens through each ritual placement. The final tableau narrows options to acceptance, but the price (loss of mystery?) remains conceptual rather than visceral on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of lingering love as the true animating force emerges organically from ritual and image. Final sunrise reweights prior objects without moralizing, achieving quiet resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct lyric voice—“streetlights daydreamed,” “shard of hush”—maintains perceptual signature throughout. Compression and patterned elision are consistent; no POV drift or register clash.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is musical and dense, occasionally tipping into stacked metaphors (“hushed blaze,” “echo of lives poured themselves”) that dilute immediacy. No loops or scaffold, but overwriting nudges peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Familiar “objects carry memory” trope is refreshed through the perfumer’s orris root and the conceit of “shard of hush.” Specificity of bay-town predawn ritual makes the synthesis feel inevitable.</comment>
