<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Prophet’s interiority is lyrical but abstract; no contradictory impulse surfaces in-scene. The “mallet tightening in fingers” gesture is the only embodied beat. Closure choice (letting the storm skirt) is asserted rather than dramatized, so cost feels external. Still, her perceptual lens is consistent and occupation-specific.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the storm’s diversion mirrors her musical map, reweighting the orchard’s safety. Causality is soft—music as weather-control remains metaphorical—so the decisive change feels conceptual rather than mechanical. Orientation is clear by 3rd sentence. One transition (dusk→dawn) is legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Floating orchard, driftwood timbres, and mercury-blue hour are vivid and selective. The orchard’s sway and root-conduction of sound constrain how warnings travel, charging the final image. Micro-setting (the central driftwood slab) doubles as instrument and anchor. Sensory balance favors haptic and aural over visual, matching prophet’s craft.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—protect the drifting community—signaled early. Pressure escalates via cloud fractals and musical response, but the cost is collective, not personal; prophet never risks loss of mallet, limb, or authority. Agency is interpretive rather than interventionist, softening the tightening beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme of transformation-through-attention emerges organically from prophet’s practice; no explicit moralizing. Final image of orchard “humming with remnants” reweights earlier obstacles as ongoing instruments. Subtext resides in silence after the last note—community now attuned. Avoids tidy lesson yet feels slightly pat because stakes remain communal, not intimate.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to prophet’s sensorium; diction is lyrical yet precise (“fractal generating shapes,” “sketched resonance”). Rhythm modulates with long sentences for calm, staccato for storm mapping. No dialogue, so voice carries through percussive verbs and synesthetic imagery. Consistent perceptual signature.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense. Occasional soft filler (“longer than memory served,” “what others saw as challenges”) could tighten. Metaphors stay coherent; no mixed vehicles. Final paragraph drifts toward summary but retains cadence. No loops or artifacts in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Concept of musical weather-reading via floating orchard is fresh, yet echoes of “storm-singer” tropes linger. Transformation of driftwood into resonant warning system feels inevitable in hindsight. Specificity of xylophone mallet and root-conduction lifts it above generic mysticism. Risk is moderate; payoff is coherent.</comment>
