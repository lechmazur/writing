<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and specific to the glider’s algorithmic mind; the “yearning algorithm” and “steadily curious nature” are dramatized through choices (picking up the arrow, peering into the kaleidoscope, ringing the bell). No contradictory impulses are shown in-scene, and the final renunciation—accepting that no one hears the bell yet the act still matters—carries felt cost. However, the glider’s evolution is summarized rather than embodied in micro-choices, keeping it just below 8.8.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the unheard bell’s vibration reweights the glider’s entire quest. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each shard (arrow, kaleidoscope, bell) layers density until the final image crystallizes meaning. The acid sea’s pause supplies visible cost. Minor drift: the “evolution” summary could be tighter.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The brass-and-steam workshop, acid sea, and kaleidoscope are vivid, selective, and purposeful; the kaleidoscope’s mirrors constrain the transliteration action, and the acid sea’s fumes momentarily stiffen gears, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent; no orientation debt. Could edge higher if the workshop’s layout more directly shaped tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—ringing the unheard bell—is signaled early and tightened through each shard. The glider’s agency drives every escalation: arrow → kaleidoscope → chamber → bell. Cost is visible in the acid sea’s momentary stillness and the glider’s recalibrated yearning. One more on-page obstacle would push it past 8.2.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: the value of unheard acts and pure potential. The bell’s silent resonance reweights prior images without moralizing. Subtext lives in the acid sea’s pause and the glider’s irreverent awe. No thematic drift; complexity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is distinct—measured, metallic, quietly awestruck. Syntax mirrors the glider’s gear-and-cog perception. No head-hopping; POV remains tight. Minor cadence repetition (“yearning algorithm” twice) keeps it from 8.8.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and information-dense; each sentence advances image or pressure. Figurative language is controlled and purposeful. No loops or scaffold. One mixed metaphor—“coasted along the gears” vs. “floated countless leagues”—barely grazes clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Premise—algorithmic cart seeking an unheard bell via kaleidoscopic translation—feels fresh and inevitable. Tropes (steampunk workshop, acid sea) are transformed through the glider’s specific perception. Risk in the silent climax pays off. No close echoes.</comment>
