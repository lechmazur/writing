<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Eleanor’s emotionally rational stance is embodied in her methodical note-taking and camera work, but interiority stays general; the ledger discovery is a clear micro-choice that costs her scholarly detachment, yet the shift feels slightly announced rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each beat (letter → station → ledger) tightens options under the “recapture truth” drive; closure lands with the tangible cost of exposing corporate guilt, satisfying the Decisive Change test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The ivy-choked station is vividly anchored and constrains movement; the carved initials and loose floorboards directly enable the climax, though some descriptive passages drift toward postcard rather than pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“rescue truth from lies”—is signaled early and escalates as Eleanor’s parallels tighten; the ledger discovery forces an irreversible exposure, paying a visible social cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of “noble lies” emerges organically from the ledger’s bribes and erased names; final image of truth flourishing beyond ivy offers resonant reweighting without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Voice is consistent, slightly elevated academic register fitting a historian; compression is purposeful, though occasional filter verbs (“she sensed”) dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; minor loops (“truth…truth”) and one mixed metaphor (“pit of lies”) nudge it below the 9-band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Familiar “buried scandal” premise is refreshed by the illuminated-letter device and the historian’s emotionally rational lens; synthesis feels inevitable yet not radically novel.</comment>
