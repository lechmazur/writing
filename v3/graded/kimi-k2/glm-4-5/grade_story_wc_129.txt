<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara’s loneliness and yearning are embodied in tactile reed-work; her decisive carving of the sigil into the arbor shows earned change. Secondary characters remain functional rather than individuated, slightly limiting depth. Motivation stays consistent and intensifies under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the shared carving of the sigil reconfigures belonging with visible cost (the arbor’s altered heart). Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of shared effort reweights the stake. Orientation is swift; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Crystalline orchard and crater light filter every beat; the arbor’s volcanic strands physically constrain the final act. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-tinted. Spatial choreography holds across climbs and etching.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—belonging—tightens through the collaborative search; the sigil discovery forces a communal stance crystallization. Cost is felt in shared exhaustion and the irreversible alteration of the arbor. One clear escalation suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of kinship emerges from concrete joint labor rather than statement. Final image of the pulsing sigil offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. Subtext lives in glances and synchronized breaths.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays close to Elara’s reed-tuned perceptions; diction is lyrical yet disciplined. No head-hop. Rhythm modulates with scene tension, though secondary voices blur slightly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and propulsive; occasional stacked metaphors (“luminescent ache,” “spectral pulses”) flirt with overwriting but serve the accumulative design. No loops or scaffold. Strong verbs anchor action.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Familiar quest-for-belonging arc is refreshed by the alien orchard and obsidian arbor; the sigil-as-land-art twist feels inevitable in hindsight. Specificity of reed-engineering and crater physics grounds the concept.</comment>
