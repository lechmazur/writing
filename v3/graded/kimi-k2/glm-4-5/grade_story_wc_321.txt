<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Liam’s childhood-split trauma gives credible motive, and the hourglass-as-self symbol tracks his arc; yet interiority drifts into explanatory gloss (“he understood the physics…”) rather than embodied contradiction under pressure, muting the cost of becoming “permanent transient.”</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the merged ferry and filled hourglass crystallize a new state with conceptual cost—Liam’s wholeness traded for eternal transience. Causal chain holds under a lyrical-accumulative lens; however, the physics of “interconnected patterns” is asserted more than dramatized, softening the final beat’s punch.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The spectral grotto’s crystal stalactites and liquid-starlight water are vivid and selective; the translucent hull and three moons charge the final image. Spatial choreography stays coherent, but the grotto’s rules (sideways clocks, chronal energy) are delivered via exposition rather than discovered through action, limiting constraint on choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—unifying fractured timelines—signals early and tightens once when the parallel ferry appears. The merging act narrows Liam’s future to permanent transit, a visible price. Escalation is lyrical rather than causal, but pressure remains coherent under the chosen lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of healing through self-sacrifice emerges organically from Liam’s arc; the hourglass’s final state reweights earlier emptiness without moralizing. Subtext in the radio exchange (“ghost from the machine”) deepens resonance. A touch of explanatory theme-label (“destiny’s true intention”) slightly blunts the final image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet anchored in Liam’s perceptual bias—selective sensory detail, restrained wonder. Syntax modulates with emotional crests; no head-hopping. Occasional elevated diction (“spectral grotto under starlight”) fits the mythic register, though a few phrases edge toward poetic boilerplate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Prose flows with rhythmic variety and high information density; figurative language is mostly purposeful. Minor loop: “resiliently positive” appears twice in close proximity; “patterns glowed brighter…like a lover” is a stock simile. No artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The vanishing-ferry trope is refreshed by treating it as dimensional surgery rather than mere magic; the hourglass-as-self device feels inevitable in hindsight. Specific childhood fracture grounds the cosmic stakes. A bold, coherent vision that risks sentimentality but stays controlled.</comment>
