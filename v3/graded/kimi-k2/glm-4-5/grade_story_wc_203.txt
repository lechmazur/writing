<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Marcus’s “skillfully observant” trait is dramatized through the dust-sampling beat and the mainspring barrel choice, giving us embodied competence under pressure. Interiority stays concrete, but the final “weightless burden → calling” flip is asserted more than earned from visible contradiction or cost. Still, his professional lens (elevator/vertical space) consistently filters perception, keeping voice particular.</comment>

<comment>Causal chain holds: daily 4:17 silence → barrier thinning → barrel activation → ghost contact → acceptance. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the ticking after silence reconfigures his curse as conduit with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation is clean by 120 words; no lens ambiguity at end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Ticket-office dust, popcorn reek, and flicker rhythm are filtered through Marcus’s technician gaze, guiding his ghost-hunt. Ceiling-dust swirls and the glint of the buried barrel tether micro-setting to choice. Environment never constrains a late tactical option enough for 9+, but it steadily charges atmosphere.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“see versus engage”—is signaled early and tightens when he decides to raise the barrel instead of retreat. One visible cost: he forfeits the safety of mere observation, accepting permanent conduit status. Escalation is single-track but sufficient for 750-word scope; no reversal, yet option set narrows credibly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of “listening to what’s above” emerges through dust patterns, ceiling cracks, and the final ticking that stitches worlds—no moralizing. The reweighting of his “weightless burden” into instrument of repair lands as Conceptual Repricing, resonant but slightly rushed. Particulars carry the idea; abstraction is avoided.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Marcus’s technician sensorium; perceptual signature is consistent (vibration, verticality, tool weight). No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens under the fluorescent death-silence. Prose rhythm is controlled, though a few sentences flirt with template cadence not quite taught as pattern.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; sensory density is high without purple drift. One paraphrase loop (“weightless burden” repeated with identical phrasing) and a filter-verb cluster around “began to warm/began to sputter” slightly dull immediacy. Otherwise clean, propulsive, and error-free.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Fusing elevator repair, ghost-seeing, and horological dimensional tech feels fresh yet inevitable given Marcus’s vertical obsession. The circus setting is mostly atmospheric wallpaper—could be any abandoned venue—so the synthesis isn’t fully exploited. Still, the mainspring-as-key beats generic occult talisman tropes.</comment>
