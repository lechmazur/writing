<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elena’s arc is honest—her gradual shift from cosmic detachment to humble witness is embodied through micro-choices like photographing seedlings and saving a single wing dust—but her prior astro-work is summarized more than dramatized, limiting interior contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands in an image: Elena’s observation of a new butterfly crystallizes her stance; the shift from stars to soil is earned by intervening beats and carries a visible, quiet cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The greenhouse becomes a living crucible—glass shards, molding leaf-humus, and spiraling dust that mirrors galactic arms; every sensory detail pressures her choices or sharpens insight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Gradual change is the core stake; Elena’s daily documentation show each micro-choice tightening options from grand theory to reverent small observation, but external stakes remain mildly abstract.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of decay-as-renewal emerges via recurring dust patterns that end with the butterfly hatching, quietly repricing cosmic importance without declaring a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Lyric, reflective voice is consistent—scientific precision shifting to devotional delicacy—though repetition of phrases like “accumulated dust patterns” drags slightly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is restrained and sensorily rich, but occasional ornamental loops (“kindled humility” mentioned twice) and redundant trace-ability phrases are spotted; momentum stays mostly clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>The synthesis—neutron-star gaze directed at garden detritus—is fresh; synthesizing macro–micro without didacticism, though the butterfly-wing refrain risks cliché risk if untransformed.</comment>
