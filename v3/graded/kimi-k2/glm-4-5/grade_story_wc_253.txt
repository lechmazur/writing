<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction is present—blank face vs theatrical narration—and embodied in the whittling micro-choices. Motivation (“cultivate lightness in grief”) is stated but not dramatized through a single decisive beat; the performer’s stance crystallizes without visible cost, so it stops just short of 9.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the final image of “remade hush” reweights the entire mandate premise with conceptual cost. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—patterned ritual deepens until the final cadence shift. No orientation debt; causality is held through the ritual’s accumulation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Wind turbines and farmhouse form a charged micro-setting; the turbines’ moan becomes the literal remade hush that constrains the final image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through the performer’s grief-sharpened attention. Object-as-setting (dried flowers, pine block) actively constrains choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Dominant stake is the right to grieve authentically. Escalation is textural: each whittled figure intensifies the ritual until the final reconfiguration. Cost is conceptual—the performer’s blank endurance forecloses public joy—but not viscerally felt on the page, keeping it below 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the ritual: grief as resistance to mandated joy. Subtext lives in the contrast between blank face and ornate narration. Final image reweights the premise without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo; resonance is earned through particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>Voice is distinct—measured, archaic, performative yet hollow. Rhythm modulates with each whittling stroke. No head-hopping; POV stays locked to the performer’s filtered perception. Compression and elision are taught early and paid off in the final hush.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense. No loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated diction (“theater of existence”) is voice-motivated. Metaphors are coherent; mixed metaphors absent. No artifacts in closure beat. High information density with zero paraphrase loops.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise—post-mandate grief ritualized through whittling—is fresh and specific. Transforms dystopian trope into quiet, accumulative resistance. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable. Risk-taking (blank-faced narrator, anti-climax) heightens meaning without gimmickry.</comment>
