<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s blindness is embodied in tactile micro-choices (tracing feathers, finding tools by memory) and the final renunciation—letting the drone go—carries felt cost. Interiority stays concrete, but the “decode feedback into direction” motive is stated more than dramatized, muting contradiction. No second on-page character, so relationship crucible waived.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the hummingbird’s flight reconfigures Elias’s stance from solitary craftsman to unseen guide, cost legible in the thinning mist and his empty workspace. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of sensory pattern (mist, light, water) tightens toward the final image. Orientation is clear by 120 words; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The mist-coated depot, water bowl, and drone form a micro-setting that constrains diagnosis and charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective (steam, refracted light) and filtered through Elias’s tactile POV. Environment actively shapes tactics; no static postcard effect.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—restore the drone before the ship sails—is signaled early and tightened by the audible anchor lift. One meaningful deepening: the cracked sensor forces Elias to refine his water-refraction method under time pressure. Cost is the relinquishment of the drone and the unspoken farewell to his apprentice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of connection across absence emerges through concrete particulars (drone as bridge, mist as veil) rather than statement. Final image of the ship sailing reweights prior motifs without moralizing. Subtext in Elias’s soft “You’ll guide him” carries unspoken loss.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited adheres to Elias’s tactile perception; no head-hopping. Prose has rhythmic control (“steam rising… steam from the departing ship”) and distinct sensory signature. Dialogue is minimal but natural when present.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Strong read-aloud rhythm, high information density, and purposeful compression. Occasional lyrical overlap (“mist-coated… mist drifted”) is pattern-taught and pays off. No loops or mixed metaphors in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: blind technician using water-refraction diagnostics to repair a drone for an unseen apprentice’s voyage. Specificity of method and setting transforms familiar mentor-student trope. Risk in quiet, lyric closure pays off.</comment>
