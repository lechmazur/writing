<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is textured and embodied (“fingers trailing along cool pipes,” “smell of old books”), but the final renunciation—remaining hidden while guiding the tape to the surface—leans on summary rather than dramatized cost; the contradiction between lifelong invisibility and the need to be seen is stated more than enacted in the closing beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the dweller’s decision to intervene without revealing themselves crystallizes the stakes and reweights the premise. Causal chain is intact—tape fragment → recognition of Archive Series 7 → plan to seed discovery—yet the cost is implied rather than viscerally felt on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Library’s hidden arteries (pipe chases, crawl space, copper water pipe) are rendered with tactile specificity and constrain movement; the “sapphire hush” of pre-dawn outage is more atmospheric than functional, but the fragment’s warmth against cool metal charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to help without exposure—tightens when the tape fragment offers a path; pressure rises through the recognition that the building’s failing power can be fixed by this relic. Cost is conceptual (perpetual hiddenness) rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of invisible stewardship emerges organically from the dweller’s actions; the final image of the fragment as “a bridge between their hidden world and the library’s future” reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext in the hush and the fragment’s hum carries the emotional charge.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Voice is consistent, hushed, and methodical, with a perceptual signature attuned to darkness and texture (“delicate as a butterfly wing”). No dialogue, but free-indirect style stays clean; occasional elevated phrasing (“residual energy of whatever it once recorded”) slightly lifts register above the dweller’s likely lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose is fluid and sensory, with rhythmic variation; minor loops (“they had lived…they had been laid off”) and a few stacked modifiers (“kindly methodical grace”) slightly dull momentum. No artifacts in the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Premise of the library’s secret archivist living in the walls is fresh yet grounded; transformation of abandoned preservation work into living intervention feels inevitable. Specificity of the 1950s tape catalog number anchors the conceit.</comment>
