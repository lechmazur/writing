<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Alistair’s immortal ennui and sudden hunger for purpose register with visceral embodied beats (“pulsing against his skin,” “hushed thunder”). Micro-choices (brushing dust, aligning magnetic vectors) chart a credible arc from boredom to guardian stance, capped by embodied cost (“stepped through…escondite collapsing”)</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal chain cleanly threads from fragment discovery → magnetic field manipulations → portal creation → closure with visible forfeit; no loose magnets or teleporting props. Closure lands as Earned Stasis: immortality repurposed from curse to destiny at the price of leaving sanctuary forever</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>“Prismatic escondite” and shifting rainbow walls anchor POV in alien, tactile place while doubling as refractive metaphor for dimensional instability. Solar storm’s magnetic fingers exert literal force on amulet and space, tightening constraints rather than merely decorating.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Signed early stake—“question that had haunted him since losing Elara”—ramps into spatial mutiny threatening all realities. One decisive turn: trading immortality’s safe isolation for active guardian duty, with sanctuary collapse as felt cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Emergent theme—what follows ‘goodbye’—gains weight through Elara’s fractured amulet rather than authorial dictate. Final crystallization (“after goodbye was not an end but a continuation”) arises from specific dimensional journey ending at timeless threshold, recharging opener with earned resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Lush, controlled diction mirrors immortal perception: archaic cadences (“millennia,” “taffy”), scientific precision (“magnetic fields reaching tendrils”), crystalline cosmic register. Zero POV drift; perceptual signature remains coherent across shifting shards and non-standard dimensional syntax.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Rich figurative language (“dying rainbow,” “taffy of centuries”) packed with high density and zero clutter. No scaffold loops; sentences propel causality forward. Word-level rhythm adjusts without algorithmic monotony.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: immortality-boredom trope inverted so quest is to heal a multiverse grieving the loss of one lover. Final risk—cosmic-scale mutiny resolved through personal micro-rescue—lands as inevitable rather than gimmick. Specificity rescues from cliché.</comment>
