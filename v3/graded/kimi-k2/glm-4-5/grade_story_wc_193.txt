<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Maya’s survivor backstory is stated, not dramatized; the “virtuously mischievous” label is repeated but only shown once (rule-flouting descent). Interiority is generic (“scientific mind,” “desire for redemption”) and emotions are labeled rather than embodied. The bolt choice is motivated by abstract redemption, not a concrete, costly trade-off visible in the scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—pressure literally becomes diamonds—so the ending unit is valid. Causality, however, is external: glitchy texts feed every location and action; Maya merely follows. No meaningful tightening or reversal occurs between beats; escalation is additive description, not rising cost under a because/therefore chain.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The bioluminescent farm is vividly rendered through selective sensory detail (cool soil, spore-thick air, pulsing light) and directly guides Maya’s path. Spatial choreography is clean; the purple glow acts as a waypoint. The submarine bolt’s buried cold patch is a nice micro-setting cue. Environment constrains movement and finally charges the diamond image, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade>
<comment>Stakes are declared—turn past trauma into beauty—but never tested; no tangible cost or risk is attached to the descent. Pressure is static atmospheric wonder rather than rising opposition; coincidence (texts) drives every step. A single meaningful tightening or trade-off is missing, so escalation stays flat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of transmuting pressure into value is clear and emerges through the final image rather than exposition. However, the pyramid-scheme parallel is named, not woven, and the “quantum promise” concept stays abstract. The ending resonates but lacks prior textual groundwork to reweight earlier beats.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person POV is stable; perceptual signature is moderate (Maya notices efficiency, layout, hidden chambers) but drifts into editorial flourish (“shadowseam wonder,” “living dream”). Rhythm is serviceable; no dialogue to test. Glitchy text orthography is taught early and remains legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is generally clean and vivid, but repetitive sentence openers (“The mushrooms…,” “The texts…,” “Maya…”) create template cadence. Some metaphor overload (“silent song,” “living dream,” “quantum redemption”) without pattern payoff. No loops or grammatical slips, yet cadence monotony dulls momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Fusing a pyramid-scheme survivor with a bioluminescent mushroom heist and a literal pressure-to-diamond bolt is an unexpected, conceptually coherent synthesis. The parallel-dimension spam angle freshens the treasure-hunt structure. Execution leans on wonder tropes already common in solarpunk, but the specific combination feels idiosyncratic and memorable.</comment>
