<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is textured and embodied; the philosopher’s tactile net-work and moon-path ritual reveal a coherent worldview. Yet no contradictory impulse is dramatized—his stance merely deepens—so the “earned cost” bar for 8.8+ is not cleared.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: nightly pilgrimage layers pattern upon pattern until the final tea-whisk foam reweights the premise. Closure is a Charged Poise—appreciation as stance crystallized—but the cost is conceptual rather than viscerally felt, capping the band just below 8.8.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>River cabin, mossy parapet, and hemp nets are vivid and selective; the moonlit hexagonal net in the final image constrains the closing meditation. Spatial choreography is clean, though the moon-path mechanics remain lightly sketched.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“to appreciate hidden effort”—is signaled early and deepens through sensory accretion, but no live option is foreclosed; the tightening is purely perceptual. Meets the 600-word threshold for meaningful intensification yet lacks a palpable price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of imperceptible connection emerges organically from net-knots, firefly constellations, and moon paths. Final image of foam dissolving offers resonant, non-moralizing reweighting. One near-preachy line (“highest form of wisdom”) slightly blunts subtext.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is hushed, lyrical, and consistent; perceptual signature filters every detail through the philosopher’s patient gaze. Rhythm modulates with ritual pacing; no head-hop or register drift. Distinctive enough for 8.5 but not yet daring into 9+ territory.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; figurative language is purposeful. Minor scaffold in “hidden patterns” phrasing recurs without fresh pressure, and one mixed metaphor (“stars fallen to earth”) nicks clarity. No artifacts near closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Net-mender-philosopher fusion and moon-path pilgrimage feel fresh, yet the core arc—solitary sage communing with nature—leans on familiar archetype. Specificity of hemp knots and firefly Morse lends originality, but transformation test shows plot could transplant intact.</comment>
