<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is vivid—his tactile tracing of the shard, the burnished sorrow, the micro-choice to drape mirrors—yet the shift from revolutionary to poetic mediator feels slightly under-motivated; the cost of his new stance is stated rather than embodied in a final gesture.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the manuscript’s circulation reweights the dispute into shared reimagining. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each beat layers symbolic density until the shard becomes a communal relic—though the causal bridge from “I will write” to “they read with astonishment” is elided.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid is evoked in selective, sensorial strokes—spiraling gold filigree, floating libraries, temporal storm curtains—that constrain Elias’s tactics (covering mirrors, writing by storm-light). The shard itself functions as micro-setting, its glint guiding both action and closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reimagining civilization to heal a violent dispute—escalates via symbolic intensification: the storm thickens, the mirrors are draped, the manuscript accumulates weight. One clear tightening: the act of writing forecloses Elias’s neutrality, charging the shard with new communal meaning.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: history as malleable poetry rather than forensic truth. The final image of people gathering around the shard crystallizes this without sermon—an earned, non-literal answer that reweights prior archaeological claims into shared myth-making.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with rhythmic control (“burnished sorrow of lost causes”) and a consistent perceptual signature—Elias’s synesthetic attention to light, texture, and time. No head-hopping; free-indirect style remains anchored to his sensibility throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</question><comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; figurative language clusters in reflective beats rather than action, avoiding muddle. Occasional ornate cadence (“chaotic, beautiful tapestry”) risks overwriting, yet each image advances atmosphere or stakes. No loops or scaffold detected.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of baroque space opera, visible time, and post-revolutionary poetics feels fresh and inevitable. The shard’s transformation from evidence to mythic relic is a non-obvious reconfiguration that could not survive relocation to another setting or trope set.</comment>
