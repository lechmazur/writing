<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s involuntary honesty is vivid and embodied; her micro-choice to hand over the keycard carries visible cost. The supervisor’s despair is sketched with credible contradiction, but his late arrival limits depth. Relationship pressure is minimal because the bureau pair remain functional foils rather than crucibles.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: blackout → honesty → keycard → confrontation → restoration. Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the tower restarts, but Elara’s candor remains an irreversible price. One smooth transition up the staircase keeps scope tight.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The lightning chamber’s arcs and the charred transformer panel are tactile, selective, and directly constrain the final choice. “Nectar dusk” and “golden light” recur with purposeful modulation. Spatial choreography from booth to chamber is clean and lived-in.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restoring wonder without losing truth—tightens when Elara must choose disclosure over protocol. Cost is felt in her irrevocable candor. Pressure escalates cleanly under causal lens; no false reversals.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: wonder versus mechanical dependence crystallizes in the supervisor’s tears and the first returning bees. No moralizing; final image of “bridge between wonder and routine” is earned and resonant.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays anchored to Elara with consistent perceptual signature. Dialogue is spare but goal-driven; lacquer-box reveal carries subtext. No head-hopping; voice modulates with climbing tension.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is vivid and propulsive; no loops or scaffold. “Nectar dusk” risks poetic inflation but stays tethered to POV. Occasional elevated diction (“mechanical marvels”) slightly drifts from Elara’s lexicon but does not blur causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The blackout-triggered honesty trope is refreshed through Elara’s embodied cost and the supervisor’s despair. Specificity of drone beehives and lightning collectors grounds the premise. Final synthesis feels inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
