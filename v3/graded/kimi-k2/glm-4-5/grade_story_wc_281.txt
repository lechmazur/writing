<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Maya’s affectionate skepticism is embodied in her simultaneous awe and doubt toward the geode, but the interiority drifts into summary (“her affectionate heart ached”) rather than embodied contradiction. The brother’s off-stage suffering supplies motive, yet the on-page stakes pivot on the geode’s behavior more than her active micro-choices. The final shift from skeptic to believer is declared rather than dramatized with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Maya’s “protocol” crystallizes her stance and forecloses pure skepticism, with the geode against her heart as felt cost. Causal chain holds—static shock → geode activation → somatic mapping → protocol—though the brother’s rescue remains off-page. Orientation is clear within 120 words; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>The light-painting studio is vividly anchored through sensory detail (red/blue sweeps, lens flare) and functions as micro-setting: the equipment constrains how Maya interacts with the geode. Spatial choreography is coherent; the geode’s projections onto the wall integrate setting with stakes. No environmental detail charges the final image beyond the geode itself, capping at 7.6.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—healing pill-damaged minds—is signaled early and escalates through Maya’s iterative experiments. One meaningful tightening: the geode’s neural-network projection narrows her vague hope to a concrete protocol. Cost is conceptual (renunciation of pure skepticism) but less visceral than ideal for 8.8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of healing through empirical wonder emerges organically from Maya’s arc and the geode’s behavior. Subtext operates in the geode’s wordless light patterns rather than exposition. Final image avoids moralizing, but the “extraordinary potential of the human spirit” line edges toward platitude, tempering resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is textured and consistent—scientific diction (“somatic markers,” “neural networks”) filtered through lyrical compression. Perceptual signature is strong: Maya notices crystalline fractals and pulse synchronies in character-specific ways. No dialogue to test, but internal monologue avoids filter-verb clutter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; figurative language (“willowglass hope”) is sparing and purposeful. Occasional soft loops (“fractally precise” repeated) and elevated register drift (“conceptual physics”) nudge down from 8.0. No artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of muscovite geode, telepathy-pill fallout, and light-painting neuroscience feels fresh and specific. Tropes (mystic crystal, tech-gone-wrong) are transformed through Maya’s embodied empiricism. The final reconfiguration—skepticism transmuted into protocol-driven belief—grows inevitably from prior particulars.</comment>
