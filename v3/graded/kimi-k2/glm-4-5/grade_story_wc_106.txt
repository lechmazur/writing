<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lillian’s contradictory impulses—thief vs. historian—surface in real time when she re-aims the moonbeam jar toward her portraits; the turn from stealing to preserving is embodied, not proclaimed. Minor slippage: “destiny’s door” is abstract and unearned in a single reflection beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the moonbeams turn the crime into legacy—felt cost is the total forfeit of her former identity. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern plus final cadence shift reweights premise cleanly. Orientation, causality, and payoff all on-page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>“Emerald station” and “liquid silver light” are tactile, filtered through a thief’s gold-hour eye; tile color and moon sheen constrain her stealth and later the precise light alignment in the workshop. Slight distance when “museum headlines” arrive as unowned exposition.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—acquire moonbeams to decode the constellation—faces one clear tightening when the bouquet code buys entry, narrowing choices. Cost is recognized only after the theft; escalation is chiefly intellectual until the final lens flare instant.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of “time-light as archive” is discovered through action, never sermonized; the concluding assembly makes the meta-meaning legible without a word of explanation. Moral ambiguity—Lillian remains a thief yet becomes guardian—anchors complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice carries a distilled, luminous compression—“world dipped in melted gold”—without purple drift. Occasional poetic template run (“luminous disbelief” twice) momentarily flattens cadence under pressure but not at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High density verbs and concrete nouns; figuration is patterned and controlled—“portrait thief,” “liquid silver”—and propels rather than decorates. Zero loops; final line lands cleanly without overwritten flourish.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Familiar “art heist” frame is reversed—theft is data collection, not capitulation—culminating in a light installation that rewrites provenance rules. Fresh synthesis of heist path with elegiac archive; risk taken on illuminatory choreographic closure pays off elegantly.</comment>
