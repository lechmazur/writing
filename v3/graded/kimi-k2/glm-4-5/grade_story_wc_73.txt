<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s grim optimism is embodied in every micro-choice—rolling the dice, tracing equations, placing the chipped die at the fracture point—so the final bet feels earned. Interiority stays concrete (“Fate mocks me even here”) and avoids label-speak. The only drag is a touch of retrospective summary (“Years of his existence”) that blurs present urgency.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a decisive rupture with visible cost: the staircase shatters and Elias re-enters the casino with “wisdom of eternity in his eyes.” Causal chain holds: perpetual-motion proofs → locate flaw → die as catalyst → rupture → second chance. One micro-turn (hesitation → action) is cleanly executed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The infinite staircase is more than backdrop; its physics-defying symmetry constrains every tactic and is finally broken. Sensory detail is selective—echoing boots, central void, stone texture—filtered through Elias’s mathematical gaze. The chipped die later becomes micro-setting that charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—escape the endless ascent—is signaled early and tightened by each failed proof. The rupture is the single meaningful escalation that forecloses perpetual confinement and reopens finite possibility. Cost is felt: loss of the staircase’s certainty and the weight of eternity endured.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of second chances versus deterministic loops emerges organically from the perpetual-motion conceit and the chipped die’s imperfection. Final image—Elias laughing as the dice tumble—reweights the missed opportunity without moralizing. Subtext resides in the cracked die’s silent accusation and final redemption.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is consistent, slightly elevated diction fitting a mathematician-poet, with rhythmic control under pressure (“sound like shattering glass”). No dialogue, so focus stays on internal texture. Occasional template cadence (“grim optimism… balancedly daring”) nicks the score.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is mostly lean and propulsive, but suffers from mild synonym loops (“infinite staircase… endless ascent… boundless confinement”) and a few stacked modifiers (“grim optimism,” “balancedly daring”). No artifacts touch the closure beat, so momentum survives.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The perpetual-motion staircase as purgatory for a missed bet is a fresh synthesis; the chipped die as both flaw and key is elegant. Risky structure—abstract math breaking reality—pays off because the emotional cost remains legible. Derivative echoes are minimal.</comment>
