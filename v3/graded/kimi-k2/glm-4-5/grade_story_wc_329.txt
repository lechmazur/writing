<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elayn’s single-minded drive pulses through every musical heartbeat; her embodied micro-choice to ask a tree’s permission before uprooting crystallises motive. The decision forecloses the orchard as sanctuary and burdens her with guardianship, all dramatized on page with felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative lens: beats layer resonance (shell–bridge–orchard–bridge) until the final image reconfigures meaning—“a world balanced between precision and wonder” lands as earned Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost of permanent exile from orchard solitude.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>From metallic upper city to moon-veined orchard roots, spatial choreography is tight; each setting element—bridge cables, living statues, glowing sapling—actively constrains tactics or charges the final image where crystalline vines braid metal.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore wonder) escalates through beat-for-beat tests: statues’ censure, tree’s consent, escaping guardians, dawn deadline—each tightening narrows options until bridge becomes hybrid cradle; cost is felt at each step.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Beauty vs mechanical conformity emerges from cumulative imagery and final hybrid bridge—no explicit moralizing. Earned complexity: salvation demands personal exile, acknowledged by statues’ slow nod.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyric third-person-close carries violinist’s perceptual signature (“resonantly soft yet powerful enough to shake the foundations”) and pulse-signal motif without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is clean, textured, propulsive; slight repetition (“world… world…”) and occasional ornamental stacking are minor artifacts that never dull the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Non-obvious synthesis of steampunk mechanics with vegetative magic feels inevitable; heart-rhythm signalling and living statues transform familiar templates; bold fusion elevates stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
