<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Maya’s interiority is vivid—her weathered hands, the pulse of volcanic rock—but the “implanted destiny” feels externally pasted rather than internally wrestled; the final smile lands as tidy resolution rather than earned cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration: the embryo’s glow reweights tradition. Causal chain (kite → script → chamber) holds, though the kite’s sudden appearance edges coincidence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Hot springs, obsidian chamber, and kite fabric are tactile and selective; the volcanic heat literally powers the stakes. Final image of embryo in her hands charges the setting with conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—evolve tradition—tightens once when decoding the kite script narrows options. Cost is felt in the cracked obsidian and the irreversible step toward change.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of intentional evolution emerges through action, not sermon. Final image of embryo as living bridge between past and future offers resonant, non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is steady, lyrical, and age-true; perceptual signature shows in “plants humming their approval.” No dialogue, so no voice drift; compression is purposeful.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and propulsive; occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing”) slightly lifts register but stays within Maya’s learned frame. No loops or mixed metaphors.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: insurgent grandma, plant telepathy, geothermal destiny. Tropes are grounded in volcanic specificity; embryo-as-evolutionary-key feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
