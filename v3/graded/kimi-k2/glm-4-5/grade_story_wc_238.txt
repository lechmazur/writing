<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Eloise’s guilt and need for atonement are embodied in the tremor of her hands and the weight of the perfume bottle; the micro-choice to open it despite fear crystallizes her hierarchy of values. Beatrice’s spectral presence exerts immediate pressure, forcing Eloise to voice the apology and accept its incompleteness. The momentary merging of fingers—mist into flesh—renders the cost of irreversible loss palpable. Only the slight over-articulation of “wilderness of my conscience” keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the incomplete sheet of music left on the piano reweights the entire encounter, making the cost of unfinished reconciliation legible. Causal chain holds—perfume summons, current bridges, apology releases—without gaps. The orchard’s scheduled destruction supplies a ticking external constraint that sharpens the final image. One minor ellipsis (how the sheet arrives) is forgivable at this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The attic’s dust motes, copper wire, and piano form a micro-setting that actively constrains the ritual’s geometry; the orchard’s distant hum tightens the temporal frame. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: Eloise notices scent and texture before sound. The single beam of flashlight carving the dark charges the apparition’s first shimmer. Only the orchard’s description remains slightly postcard.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—deliver apology before orchard falls—escalates as the generator’s hum grows louder and Beatrice’s form solidifies. The tightening beat is Eloise’s decision to increase the rheostat despite risk of scattering the energy; this narrows options and raises cost. The price is the incomplete reconciliation symbolized by the unfinished composition. No reversals beyond the single, sufficient turn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of imperfect forgiveness emerges from the incomplete duet and the half-materialized reunion; no character states it outright. The jasmine-regret scent reweights from key to elegy without exposition. Final image of sealed perfume bottle and silent orchard offers resonant, non-moral answer: healing begins but never ends. One stray aphorism—“time tiptoes on broken glass”—leans close to thematic echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is textured, rhythmic, and POV-anchored: “melodies slept dormant in their paper coffins” teaches the lyric pattern early. Compression under pressure—“Their fingers merged like mist”—maintains clarity. No head-hopping; Beatrice’s speech is filtered through Eloise’s perception. Only a single elevated phrase—“wilderness of my conscience”—momentarily lifts register above Eloise’s lived lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers scent, sound, and electromagnetic detail without redundancy. Metaphors are precise—“paper coffins,” “shattered sandals”—and never mixed. No loops or scaffold; paragraph cuts are purposeful. One minor simultaneity hiccup—“As Eloise reached out, the induced currents created”—could be clearer.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The gossip-column exorcist premise is fresh, synthesized through concrete ritual mechanics rather than gimmick. Transformation test fails if names change: the duet, perfume, and electromagnetic séance are inseparable from these two women. Risky lyric compression pays off in the final image. No close echoes of famous scenes.</comment>
