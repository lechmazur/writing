<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation (folding grief into cranes) is clear and embodied through tactile craft; interiority is vivid yet occasionally drifts into abstract lyricism. The final release feels earned, but the “shadow detached” backstory is summarized rather than dramatized, muting the cost. Micro-choices (selecting the heart-gem, placing the lantern) reveal hierarchy of values. Flaws and contradictions are present but not deeply tested under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Single POV scene with one transition (workshop→basilica) cleanly anchored. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: lantern ascends, part of self detaches—felt cost in tears and grounded presence. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of polishing, folding, releasing intensifies to final cadence shift. One brief reflection block respects BRR and tilts present stance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Floating isle, glass basilica, tea garden are sketched with selective sensory strokes; basilica’s “descending while ascending” paradox reappears in closure image, charging the final reconfiguration. Micro-setting (workbench gems, protective basket) constrains handling choices. Spatial choreography is coherent; no white-room syndrome. Economy over breadth serves theme.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transform final grief into lantern and release it—signaled early. Pressure tightens once: last gem, last dream, last crane. Agency is renunciation/release with visible cost (tears, weight lifted yet heart heavier). No external antagonist; internal conflict escalates under Accumulative lens. One credible loss: the dream itself, now externalized and gone.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of transmuting pain into light emerges through craft imagery; no explicit moralizing. Subtext in the basilica’s paradox mirrors protagonist’s paradoxical ascent/descent. Final image of lantern ascending while he remains grounded offers non-literal answer to grief’s weight. Ambiguity lingers—grief not erased but reconfigured—without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited voice is consistent, lyrical yet precise; perceptual signature filters details through artisan’s gaze (gem fluorescence, paper creases). Rhythm modulates with emotional crests. No dialogue; interior monologue avoids filter-verb stacks. Occasional elevated diction (“ethereal substance”) slightly drifts from grounded POV but remains coherent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; figurative language is purposeful. Minor paraphrase loops (“grief was still raw, still luminous”) and one stock phrase (“with tears of relief and sorrow”) keep it from 8.5+. No scaffolding or overwriting in peak beats. Strong verbs and concrete nouns dominate.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Fantasy premise of dream-capture lanterns feels fresh via artisanal craft focus; avoids generic portal tropes. Paradoxical architecture and origami grief-craft are specific to this world. Slight risk in abstract lyricism pays off in final image. No close echoes of famous scenes. Transformation test passes—story would collapse without these exact elements.</comment>
