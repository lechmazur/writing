<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is textured and embodied; the weaver’s self-doubt and wonder feel lived-in. The moment of touching their own burden crystallizes contradictory impulses—witness vs. participant—yet the final “gift” epiphany arrives slightly fast, softening the cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each burden calcifies in a rising cadence that reweights the weaver’s stance. Closure lands as Charged Poise—boundary-lessly trapped redefined as boundary-lessly connected—cost felt in the extinguished lamp and the unending return.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Bronze grotto’s metallic shimmer and shingled hush are selective, sensory, and constrain movement; the lamp’s orange glow and starlight patches physically guide orientation. The final threshold crossing recharges the grotto as both prison and portal.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—collecting weights—tightens as each burden’s heft alters tactics; the weaver’s own burden raises the price. One clear deepening: the ancient civilization’s weight forces a conceptual reprice of the calling itself.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of bearing witness versus belonging emerges through the calcifying burdens and the weaver’s final reframing. No moralizing; the closing image of “collected light” offers non-literal resonance that reweights the premise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with fractal metaphors and tactile brass fitting the weaver’s perceptual signature. Rhythm modulates with pressure—longer sentences in reverie, clipped ones during calcification. No POV drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; occasional metaphor layering (“whalebone reverie,” “shingled hush”) risks overwriting yet remains legible. No loops or scaffold; final paragraph achieves quiet cadence without clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of geology, grief, and fractal cosmology; the burden-calcifying conceit feels inevitable. Risky lyric compression pays off in the closing reconfiguration. Minor deduction for faint echoes of “witness” tropes.</comment>
