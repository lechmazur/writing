<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied; the traveler's contradictory impulses—writing others' living obituaries while avoiding his own—are dramatized through tactile micro-choices (tracing the thread, uncapping the pen). The final turn toward self-obituary is earned by prior causality and carries visible emotional cost. Minor slip: "explained absences" drifts toward diagnostic label-speak once.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration: the traveler crystallizes a new stance—writing for the living who still have life—while the crimson thread reweights from anchor to compass. Causal linkage holds under Accumulative/Textural lens; each sensory saturation and memory shard tightens the emotional cadence toward the final shift. Cost is legible in the line "something beautiful and painful was beginning to heal."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Garden, thread, and notebook form a micro-setting triad that constrains choice: the thread's fragility limits memory access, the garden's decay mirrors the gardener's blindness, the notebook demands ink. Sensory hierarchy is POV-filtered and purposeful. Final image recharges the thread as compass, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can the traveler face his own absence—tightens once via the decision to write his own obituary. Pressure grows accumulatively through scent, memory, and starlight rather than causal reversals. Cost is felt in the phrase "mapping territories of his heart he had avoided."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of healing-as-geography emerges organically from concrete particulars; no moralizing. The final image of the thread as compass offers non-literal resonance that reweights prior material. Subtext operates in the silence after the last ship and the gardener's unseen presence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Distinct lyric texture with controlled rhythm; perceptual signature is selective and biased toward scent and touch. No head-hopping; POV remains tightly focalized. Compression and patterned elision ("after the last ship had sailed") are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>High information density; sentences advance multiple jobs. No loops or scaffold. Figurative language is disciplined—"thread...more fragile than spun sugar" is precise and earned. Rhythm modulates with emotional pressure; final paragraph breathes into longer cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Premise of obituaries for the living is fresh and fully committed to; trope of war-loss is transformed through the carpet thread. Specific synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric accumulation pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
