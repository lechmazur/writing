<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Clara’s interiority is textured and embodied—her fingers on the wood, the remembered weight of her husband’s hands—but the “hauntingly practical” trait is asserted more than dramatized; no single choice visibly trades safety for thrill. The final renunciation (serene lion, not snarling) is earned by the carving sequence and carries felt cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test. Minor slip: the phrase “harvest lessons from loss” edges toward label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density of rain, kettle whistle, and wood shavings accrues until the final image reweights absence as presence. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise in the crystallized moment “while the kettle boiled, she had captured eternity.” Cost is legible in the half-finished carving and the empty whistle. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rain-beaded skylight and ash blank are micro-settings that constrain choice: the light dictates where she sits, the grain dictates the cut. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—circus-tent rain, kettle hiss. Final image reuses skylight constellations to reconfigure meaning, meeting 9+ gate. One minor drift: “rust-hued peace” is more label than lived detail.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to hold grief productively—is signaled early and tightened once: tentative first cut → confident shaping → serene lion. The deepening is textural rather than causal, but under Accumulative lens the density of loss-made-present reweights the stake with visible cost (curls of wood = memories released). No external antagonist needed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of “here and gone” emerges through concrete particulars: the kettle’s whistle fading yet still hot, the lion’s closed eyes. Final image offers non-literal answer—love as simultaneous presence and absence—without moralizing. One soft echo: “rust-hued peace” is slightly abstract, preventing 9.0.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet disciplined; perceptual signature filters everything through tactile memory and tool knowledge. Patterned elision (“crystallized time”) is taught early and paid off at closure. Rhythm modulates with pressure—long sentences for reflection, clipped fragments during carving. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; each sentence layers image, memory, and action. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is selective (“rain-beaded skylight,” “ash wood carving blank”). One mixed metaphor—“crystallized time” is borderline—but context teaches the pattern. Final line lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fresh angle: lion-tamer’s widow carving absence into presence. Trope of grief-art is transformed by occupational specificity and the inversion of the lion from snarl to serenity. Risky lyric compression pays off in closure image. Slight deduction for familiar “rain on skylight” opener.</comment>
