<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Amelia’s interiority is vivid (“liquid dawn,” “pensive mirth”) and her arc from lost joy to communal rekindling is legible, but the shift feels externally granted by the fragment rather than wrested through contradictory impulses; no embodied cost is dramatized at the climax.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each light-reveal beat deepens pattern and culminates in a Charged Poise (“hope had taken root”). Closure is on-page, yet the cost is communal rather than personal—Amelia’s own stake is never foreclosed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fog-choked ruins, smooth fragment, observatory lamps—details are selective, sensorily rich, and tethered to action. The orchard fog literally obscures and is pierced by light, charging the final image with conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“rediscover lost joy”—is signaled early and escalates through each reveal, but pressure is external (council doubt, visitor wonder) rather than an internal trade-off; no option is foreclosed for Amelia herself.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of art resurrecting communal memory emerges organically from the light-reveal motif; the final line (“all ruins are just stories waiting for the right light”) offers resonant reweighting without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is painterly, rhythmic, and consistent; perceptual signature (“impossible colors,” “liquid dawn”) stays anchored to Amelia’s synesthetic bias. No head-hopping; compression is purposeful and legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is lush yet controlled; occasional soft loops (“joy that once flowed… joy had once filled”) are minor. High information density and no artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>“Painting with light” and “ruins as undeveloped film” synthesize familiar tropes into a fresh conceit; transformation test passes—story would collapse without these specific metaphors. Risk is moderate, not radical.</comment>
