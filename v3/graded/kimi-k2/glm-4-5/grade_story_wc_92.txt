<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s calm inventiveness is embodied in the sundial brushwork and pocketed quill, but interior contradiction is muted; the final “cradle of sparks” feels more thematic label than lived cost. Micro-choices (dip, stroke, pocket) are precise yet lack a visible personal stake or flaw-driven mistake. Relationship pressure with the Keeper is hinted but not dramatized on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: blackout → coded sundial completion → dawn rendezvous signaled, a Resonant Reconfiguration under Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality holds: blackout was anticipated, sundial message is the payoff. Cost is conceptual—risk of discovery—but felt only lightly; still, the lens is coherent and the ending reweights prior beats.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Luminous fort walls and bioluminescent flicker anchor place and mood early; the half-painted sundial functions as micro-setting that constrains the final action. Sensory selection is purposeful—wan glow, cool bronze, pigment scent—filtered through Elias’s priorities. Spatial choreography is coherent; no impossible moves.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—transmit coordinates undetected—is signaled early and tightened by the blackout clock. One meaningful deepening: blackout enables the sundial stroke. Cost is present but abstract (risk of exposure); pressure coheres under situational lens without external rescue.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of silent revolution through art emerges organically from Elias’s actions; no overt moralizing. Subtext in the “winking hush” and coded angles is effective. Final image of glowing embers beneath structure offers quiet resonance, though slightly generalized.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is consistent, slightly elevated but fits Elias’s keeper-of-secrets role. Perceptual signature is selective—angles, pigments, shadows—without head-hop. Rhythm modulates with tension; no register drift. Dialogue is sparse but carries subtext (“The Keeper requires your presence”).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, vivid, and propulsive; no loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated diction (“luminous fort,” “cradle of sparks”) stays within character lens. Metaphors are coherent; no mixed vehicles. Sentence variety supports momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Familiar rebellion-through-art trope is refreshed by blackout-as-canvas and angle-coded sundial. Specificity of bronze quill holder as both tool and talisman adds texture. Risk is quiet but coherent; no gimmicks. Transformation test passes: story would collapse without these exact details.</comment>
