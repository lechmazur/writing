<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elena’s “purposefully curious” trait is dramatized through micro-choices—adjusting camera settings, dissolving the grain, steadying her hand—yet interiority occasionally drifts into summary (“dawnlit melancholy settled deep in her bones”). The final endurance is earned, but the emotional layering feels slightly smoothed rather than contradictory under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elena completes the shoot, accepts the irreversible loss, and descends with the photographs as both trophy and shroud. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of light, sound, and memory tightens until the last spark vanishes. Cost is legible in the empty chamber and the mining team’s approach.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The moonlit summit is vividly anchored early and constrains every choice—camera angle, timing device placement, line of sight to the crater. Sensory selection narrows under pressure: breathing in the helmet, blue points of light, final warmth. The setting charges the closure image as sunlight erases the fireflies.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—document the last fireflies before extinction—is signaled in paragraph three and tightens once: sunrise is irreversible. Agency is endurance and precise action; the cost is the extinction itself and Elena’s solitary witness. No reversals, but the single deepening is sufficient under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of sacrifice for progress emerges through concrete particulars rather than statement. The final image—sunlit summit now stripped of wonder—reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext in the dissolved grain and approaching drills lingers effectively.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is controlled, with a perceptual signature filtered through professional precision and restrained grief. Syntax remains stable; no head-hopping. Occasional elevated phrasing (“celestial phenomena,” “testament to what was being sacrificed”) slightly drifts from the embodied POV but does not rupture coherence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense. Minor scaffold appears (“the dawning hush… the dawning hush intensified”), but momentum is not stalled. No figurative muddle in peak beats; sensory detail is selective and purposeful.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The lunar-firefly extinction premise is fresh, and the integration of a sand-grain timer as chemical trigger is specific and non-obvious. Risk is taken in the quiet, observational arc rather than a dramatic reversal, and it pays off through cumulative resonance.</comment>
