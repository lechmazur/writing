<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid (“borrowed starlight” lens), her motive to “salvage something pure” is consistent, and the micro-choice to expose truth gently shows earned cost. Yet the sabotage reveal is delivered as summary, not embodied contradiction, and the captain’s daughter backstory feels tacked-on rather than pressuring present choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the captain’s whispered thanks crystallizes the Resonant Reconfiguration, and the snow globe’s new glow marks the Decisive Change. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each shard of dream evidence tightens the pattern—though the mid-story jump from dive to shrine is only loosely bridged.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Frigid water, coral beams, and glacier shrine are sharply evoked and filter through Elara’s professional gaze. The snow globe’s warmth against ocean chill is a tactile pivot that later charges the altar scene, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restoring purity from tragedy—escalates as dream fragments tighten the noose around the survivors’ lie. The cost is conceptual: Elara risks shattering living descendants’ peace, but the price is stated more than dramatized on-page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><<comment>Theme of salvaging truth without vengeance emerges organically from the captain’s sacrificial act and Elara’s gentle dream diplomacy. The melted snow globe’s shift from warped relic to glowing conduit reweights the premise without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise—“borrowed starlight,” “ice forming”—and remains anchored in Elara’s perceptual bias. No dialogue appears, so no register clash; the free-indirect dream descriptions carry distinct texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; only minor filter-verb clusters (“she learned,” “she discovered”) slightly dull immediacy. No mixed metaphors or loops; final image lands with crystalline clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Ghost-whisperer wreck-diver is fresh, and the snow-globe-as-dream-window reframes a familiar trope. The sabotage motive is less surprising, but the method of restorative justice through dream fragments feels specific and inevitable.</comment>
