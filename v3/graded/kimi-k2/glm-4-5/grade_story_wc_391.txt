<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Interiority is poetic but abstract; the mapper’s motives (“sculpt patience from impatience”) are stated more than embodied. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene; choices remain observational rather than active. The final smile registers as affect, not earned cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Closure is a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration—dawn confirms the mapper’s theory and signals the start of the revolution—but the cost is conceptual, not felt. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern holds, yet the tightening is gentle rather than decisive. Orientation is clear early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Basalt sanctuary, frozen lake, and magnetic viaduct are vividly evoked and filter through the mapper’s precise attention. The lake-as-mirror and viaduct hum serve as micro-settings that constrain tactics and charge the final image. Sensory economy is strong.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore communal patience via celestial tracking—is signaled early. Pressure grows through accumulating moon-path data and the viaduct’s hum, but the mapper’s agency remains observational; no on-page trade-off or visible price is dramatized.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of patience versus haste emerges organically from celestial rhythms and frozen stillness. Subtext is carried by silence, wind melodies, and magnetic resonance. Final image of thaw at dawn offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited voice is consistent, lyrical, and perceptually specific to the mapper’s astronomical focus. Rhythm modulates with quiet intensity; no head-hopping or register drift. Distinct texture in phrases like “restrained wildness” and “polished obsidian mirror.”</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; figurative language is selective. Occasional poetic abstraction (“unyoke the people from their burden of constant haste”) edges toward summary but does not stall momentum. No loops or scaffold artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fusion of geomancy, quiet revolution, and magnetic moon-paths feels fresh and inevitable. Premise transcends typical eco-parable by centering on subtle energy alignment rather than overt conflict. Specificity of basalt sanctuary and viaduct grounds the concept.</comment>
