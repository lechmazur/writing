<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied ("fingers wrapped tightly," "warlike serenity etched"), but the mentor remains off-page, so relationship-as-crucible is absent. The druid’s contradictory impulses (guard vs. sacrifice) are shown through the blood-feeding of the seed, earning the final acceptance of truth with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the mentor’s true face revealed reweights the entire premise. Causal chain holds—seed feeds on blood, plant eats ice, glamour dissolves—under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is clear by line 3; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Swirling orchard vortex and cursed lake are tactile, constraining movement and anchoring the ritual. The flesh-eating plant’s roots become micro-setting that physically encircle the confession, charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—free mentor—signaled early. Escalation is textural: each expanding circle deepens density until the sixth reveals the frozen confession. Cost is the druid’s blood and the plant’s death, visibly paid on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of hidden identity emerges through the mirror that shows nothing, culminating in the mentor’s unmasked face. No explicit moralizing; the image of the “true face” reweights prior motifs without statement. Ambiguity lingers: was the lie protective or cowardly?</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lush yet disciplined, with rhythmic control (“swirling orchard vortex,” “concentric rings that mirrored her mental search”). Compression is purposeful; no POV drift. Distinct perceptual signature—druid’s sensory focus on plant, ice, and blood—holds under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; occasional stacked modifiers (“impossible spirals,” “ancient magic”) risk overwriting yet serve the accumulative design. No loops or filter-verb stacks. Final image is clean and uncluttered.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: flesh-eating plant as key to unlocking a glamour-based confession, set in a vortexed orchard. The mirror-that-shows-nothing trope is inverted into a literal absence of reflection. Risky lyric escalation pays off in the final reconfiguration.</comment>
