<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Maris’ interiority is concrete, her contradictory impulse (tension between duty and personal longing) is embodied through the dragon-bearing, and the final endurance carries clear cost. Secondary guides remain gestures rather than distinct individuals, keeping headcount manageable. The earned stasis (carrying dormant courage forever) satisfies the arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the punch transforms from fare marker to courage stamp, a crystallized new purpose. The drive lens is clearly Accumulative; the final image reweights every ferrying act that follows. The before/after is legible and tied to perpetual cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The veiled ridgeway’s rule-set (never the straight path) constrains route choice throughout, and the dragon chamber emerges as literal environment that charges closure. Spatial choreography is coherent; the ticket-punch itself functions as micro-setting/tool that shapes final gesture.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>One dominant stake—locating dormant courage—is coherent and steadily deepened. Agency remains gentle and poetic rather than urgent; the pressure curve flattens rather than spikes. Cost is visible (lifelong vigil with dragon weight) but lacks visceral teeth.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: courage is not heroic display but quiet latency. Final image reframes every previous ferry voyage without moralizing. Subtext lingers through image, not statement.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Lyrical voice is consistent, sensorial, and textured. Patterned repetition (“winding,” “softly”) is taught early and paid off in circular return. No head-hopping; collective “we” remains stable throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is supple and precise—“water that seemed neither liquid nor vapor.” Density is high without clutter. Only minor loop: repeated “gentle persistence” twice; negligible harm.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Premise feels fresh—courage as sleeping dragons tended by ferry folk. Avoids common heroic tropes. Specificity of dragon-chamber and ticket-as-star-stamp lifts it above allegory risk. Risk stays within lyric bounds without gimmickry.</comment>
