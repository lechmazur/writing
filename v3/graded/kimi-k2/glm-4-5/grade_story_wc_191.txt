<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elara's motives are clear and anchored in generations of stewardship, but her interior contradiction (desire to claim vs sworn duty to steward) is asserted rather than dramatized; the decisive act of preparing the throne for another is coherent yet lacks on-page anguish to charge its cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Closure holds—a resonant reconfiguration where Elara activates the throne and relinquishes personal power, foreclosing her own ascension. Causal chain from ruby’s resonance to mural map to elevator/awakening is intact. Cost: handing over the literal seat of sovereignty feels palpable, yet her emotional stake in the transfer is lightly sketched.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The kaleidoscopic waterfall, metallic orchard and crystalline descent are vivid, selective, and tether Elara’s perception, but the monolith elevator momentarily destabilizes physical logic (earth politely dissolves). That quiver aside, environment shapes access and final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Tension grows with sunrise countdown and progressively narrowing options; the mural puzzle and elevator reveal tighten agency. No false luck—Elara alone peels layers and triggers the sequence. Cost is real (time, relinquishing personal dream), though escalation is smooth rather than sharply intensified.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of stewardship over ownership surfaces organically through image of relinquishing the throne. A subtle reframe—duty eclipses ambition—without explicit moral. Ending re-prices “wisdom” as refusal rather than acquisition; resonance lingers but lacks the sharper sting of genuine loss.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited remains steady, with lyrical but precise diction that stays inside Elara’s sensorium. Occasional elevated phrasing (“earth dissolved politely”) risks tonal wobble yet reads as Elara’s ritualized reverence. No head-hop; compression suits the swift descent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Sentences breathe with intentional rhythm; minor figurative flourishes occasionally crowd beat momentum—e.g., “suspended between two eras” feels ornate rather than grounded. Otherwise crisp propulsion; objects handled tactilely. Few paraphrase loops but none in closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</question><comment>The retro-futurist orchard and crystalline elevator splice ancient feudal stakes onto post-ecological tech in a way that feels specific to this world. The ruby flake’s holographic guidance is a fresh device rather than generic maguffin, though themes of stewardship vs rule are familiar.</comment>
