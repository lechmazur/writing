<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied (“weathered innocence clung to him like the scent of old paper”), but the scholar’s choices remain largely observational; the final shift from preservation to translation is declared rather than dramatized through a concrete micro-choice, capping the score just below 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of pattern (“fractured sequences,” “testify”) tightens toward the resonant reconfiguration when the crystal’s tone reframes his mission. Closure lands with conceptual cost—he becomes the living dictionary—though the beat is slightly abstract.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Library and crystal function as micro-setting that constrains action; the dawn light charging the crystal’s facets in the final image reweights the entire scene. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered, though occasional atmospheric filler (“shadowed,” “dust motes”) edges toward the generic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decoding linguistic growth—intensifies as the scholar confronts extinction; the crystal’s pure tone crystallizes the cost of his new stance. One clear tightening suffices, but the cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt, keeping it shy of 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</question><comment>Theme of language-as-living-organism emerges organically through pattern and image; the final reconfiguration (“language never dies—it transforms”) offers resonant non-moral answer. Subtext in hush and crystal avoids overt statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Distinct lyric texture sustained throughout; perceptual signature is consistent and voice-motivated. Purposeful repetition (“fractured sequences,” “testify”) teaches its pattern early and pays off in closure without head-hop or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; occasional poetic overlap (“weathered innocence,” “suspended hush”) risks mild loop but serves cadence. No artifacts in closure beat; rhythm modulates with emotional rise.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise—last lexicographer using a sonic crystal to map linguistic evolution—feels fresh and inevitable. Risky lyric accumulation pays off in final tonal resonance; no derivative echoes.</comment>
