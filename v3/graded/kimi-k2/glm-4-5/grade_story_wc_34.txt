<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s empathy for the ghost is rooted in her childhood silence, but the interiority remains abstract (“deep empathy for those who couldn’t express themselves”) rather than embodied. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in scene; her choices feel predetermined. The final harmony is asserted rather than earned through visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of graffiti-message exchanges that deepen resonance. Closure is a Charged Poise—the ongoing “silent song” reconfigures meaning—but the cost is conceptual rather than felt on the page. Orientation is clear by 120 words; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The misty courtyard and flower-press bolt plate are vividly rendered and constrain action: the courtyard is the only place the dialogue can occur, the plate the only tool. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful. The setting subtly guides choice and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—mutual articulation of unspoken needs—is signaled early. Pressure tightens through each graffiti exchange, but escalation is more textural than causal; no single beat narrows options with visible cost. Agency is diffuse; the ghost’s loneliness complicates but does not force a decisive trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of connection across liminal divides emerges through the graffiti-code dialogue rather than statement. Subtext operates in the shifting graffiti images. Final image of the “silent song” offers resonant, non-literal reweighting. Avoids moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice is consistent, with perceptual signature (“driftingly alert”) shaping selective attention. Rhythm modulates with emotional intensity. No dialogue to evaluate. Compression and elision are purposeful and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lyrical yet clear, with high information density. Occasional elevated diction (“tinkersong wonder”) fits the fabulist register. No loops or scaffold. Metaphors remain coherent. Final paragraph could be slightly tighter but does not obscure closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Premise of AI-ghost communicating via graffiti is fresh and executed with conceptual integrity. Specificity of the flower-press bolt plate as analog-digital translator feels inevitable. Avoids clichés; the fusion of storm, code, and song is memorable.</comment>
