<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Leo’s motivation—using the locket to reconnect the neighborhood—emerges clearly, but interiority stays generic (“his motivation strengthened”). The final renunciation is earned yet cost is only implied, not embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the locket and letters reconfigure communal memory. Causal chain holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens, though the mailbox reveal feels slightly convenient rather than pressured.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>“Vibrant courtyard at dawn” is sketched with selective sensory detail; the locked mailbox is concrete. Neither object constrains a pivotal choice, but the courtyard’s communal space charges the final gathering.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single stake—healing through listening—tightens as demolition notices loom. Escalation is textural: memories accumulate until the mailbox delivers catharsis. Cost is communal, not personal, keeping it below 7.5.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme of communal memory versus erasure emerges organically from the letters. Final display avoids moralizing; resonance lingers in neighbors reading notes to their ancestors. Subtext in shared silence is effective.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Narrative voice is warm, stable, unobtrusive. Compression and free-indirect touches (“skateboarding barely slowing his words”) add texture, but overall diction remains neutral rather than character-specific.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Prose flows cleanly with rhythmic variety; occasional soft filler (“began to,” “realizing”) slows momentum. No loops or mixed metaphors; final paragraph achieves quiet cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Community-healing-through-antique-letters is familiar, yet the locket-as-catalyst and dawn-courtyard chorus give it fresh local texture. Risk is modest; execution is heartfelt rather than startling.</comment>
