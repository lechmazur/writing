<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Aris’s shift from bitter academic to humbled witness is sketched in reflective summary rather than embodied choice; the final smile registers but lacks a preceding micro-decision on the page. Interiority is evocative yet drifts toward thematic exposition (“cosmic joke nature had played”). Still, the flint arrowhead’s warming and the phone’s static supply tactile anchors that keep the arc legible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Aris’s stance crystallizes into witness rather than captor, cost felt in the forfeiture of prior ambition. Causal links are implied rather than explicit (arrowhead warmth → acceptance), but the accumulative pattern of sightings and celestial alignment tightens stakes. One transition (surface desk) is cleanly handled; orientation is never lost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The underground garden is rendered through active perception—fern disguise, star-vine watering, ceiling-root choreography—so space constrains movement and camouflage. Bioluminescent mushrooms and moon-petal flowers double as both wonder and tactical cover. The arrowhead on the desk mirrors constellations, charging the final image with cosmic scale.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will Aris expose or protect the cryptids?—tightens when celestial patterns imply irreversible change. No single reversal, but pressure accrues: each sighting raises the cost of revelation. The cordless-phone confessions externalize risk without resolving it, sustaining tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of “harmony untamed” emerges from observed symbiosis rather than lecture; the arrowhead’s constellation patterns reweight the premise from artifact to cosmic conduit. Subtext resides in Aris’s silence—each withheld report is a tacit covenant. Final smile reframes bitterness into reverent irony without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Voice blends scientific precision with lyrical awe (“gravitationally playful,” “frostbitten hope”) yet stays rooted in Aris’s trained perception. Static hiss and cordless crackle texture the soundscape; no head-hopping. Syntax flexes with wonder—long cadences for cavern grandeur, clipped fragments for phone whispers.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and musical, but occasional stacked modifiers (“sterilized labs where Aris had previously conducted failed experiments”) verge on purple. No loops or paraphrase drift; spatial choreography is clean. Final line’s hardy perennial lands with earned poise.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: cryptid fieldwork meets underground horticulture and cosmic alignment. The evolved cryptids defy taxonomy without violating internal logic. Risk lies in the quiet refusal of spectacle—no capture, no confrontation—yet coherence holds.</comment>
