<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid (“fingers tracing,” “terrifying yet intoxicating”), but her motives—curiosity about time’s texture—are stated more than dramatized. The final choice to merge with the garden is abrupt; prior beats don’t foreshadow such total surrender, so the cost feels under-earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: Elara’s body dissolves into the garden, reweighting the premise that the maze is time made flesh. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens; however, the fragment’s second appearance and the merger skip dramatized steps, leaving a thin linkage.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The living bridge garden is tactile and reactive (“subtle movements that mimicked breathing”), constraining every step Elara takes. Its hyperbolic geometry is shown through spatial impossibility rather than exposition, and the final image of her body dissolving into vines charges the setting with irrevocable cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—understanding time’s texture—tightens when the fragment traps Elara between moments. Each walk along a folded path raises the price of knowledge, culminating in bodily dissolution. Agency is present but abstract; the cost is felt yet not fully dramatized in the final beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through image rather than statement: time as living, breathing architecture that consumes its maker. The fading photographs motif reweights at closure—Elara becomes one herself—yet the insight remains slightly cerebral because her interior struggle is sketched more than embodied.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays close to Elara’s sensorium; diction is precise (“iridescent properties,” “hyperbolic geometry”) without drifting into jargon. Rhythm modulates with tension—longer sentences during reverie, clipped fragments at disintegration—maintaining coherent voice throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, vivid, and propulsive; only minor loops (“she realized,” “she understood”) intrude. Metaphors are fresh and internally consistent. No artifact touches the closure beat, preserving clarity as Elara’s form dissolves.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of hedge-maze designer, hyperbolic geometry, and retrocognitive entrapment feels inevitable and fresh. Risky bodily merger pays off conceptually, though the beat itself is compressed. The premise transcends its components through specific lived detail.</comment>
