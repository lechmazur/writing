<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elena’s interior contradiction—duty vs revelation—drives every beat; her embodied panic (“breath stabilizers struggled”) and micro-choice to transmit anchor the arc. The final renunciation carries visible cost: she sits awaiting arrest, oath broken. No stock phrasing; voice stays particular. Could edge higher if the 20-yr backstory felt less summarized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: power fluctuation → thaw → discovery → upload → consequence. Closure is a decisive change with felt cost (“she prepared to face the consequences”). Orientation anchored by line 3. One minor ellipsis: how dormant networks remain undetected is elided but not critical to closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The “echoing library under snow” is more than postcard; its silence and cold physically pressure Elena’s breathing and decision to risk cryonic suspension. Micro-setting of the amber-lit data stacks constrains her movements and frames the upload beat. Final image of snow continuing to fall recharges the opening.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserve vs liberate knowledge—tightens once when Elena chooses upload; cost is immediate exposure and potential suspension. Pressure escalates causally under the chosen lens; no coincidence resolves anything. One clear tightening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of who owns truth emerges organically from Elena’s choice; no moralizing. The “quiet conspiracy” and “revolutionary potential” reweight earlier silence without explicit statement. Final image of “history beginning to thaw” offers resonant non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elena’s perceptual signature; no head-hop. Syntax mirrors her racing pulse in short clauses under stress. Diction remains within her professional lexicon. No dialogue, so no voice leakage there.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and propulsive; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is selective (“amber-light,” “million tiny crystals”) and never muddies clarity. One minor filter-verb cluster (“she understood,” “she resolved”) but not in peak beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Familiar dystopia refreshed by cryo-archive angle and the quiet act of data liberation. The liaison letter trope is transformed into a catalyst for systemic exposure rather than personal scandal. Specificity of dormant peer-to-peer networks gives lived texture.</comment>
