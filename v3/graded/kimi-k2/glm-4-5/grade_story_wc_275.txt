<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhiannon’s interiority is textured and embodied; the contradiction between hunter heritage and nurturer identity is dramatized through micro-choices like wrapping a cutting in the sandbag scrap. The final renunciation—sheathing the shears—earns Earned Stasis with visible cost: another day’s labor against entropy. Flaws (hyper-perception as burden) complicate her calm without tidy resolution. No second character on page, so relationship crucible waived.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—density of sensory and thematic pattern tightens toward closure. Orientation anchored by word 60; no debt. Closure unit: Earned Stasis crystallized in “she sheathed her pruning shears,” the cost felt in bodily fatigue and the endless garden. Causality intact: each beat of tending reiterates the same quiet resistance, pattern deepening rather than plot reversing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Glass dome, desert heat, condensation pulses, and the repurposed sandbag scrap create a micro-setting that constrains every gesture. The scrap’s reweighting from conquest to renewal charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy (humidity, thorns, fragrance) filters through Rhiannon’s hyper-attention. Spatial choreography clean; no white-room drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake: continuity against chaos. Escalation is accretive—each plant tended tightens the same stake rather than widening conflict. Micro-turn: the new cutting’s uptake of “resilience” narrows future choices (must keep it alive). Cost is cumulative bodily fatigue and the unending task; no external antagonist required.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of nurture versus predation emerges through concrete handling of plants and the sandbag scrap; no moralizing statement. Final image of sheathed shears offers non-literal answer: peace is maintenance, not victory. Subtext in the scrap’s transformation from weapon to womb. Complexity preserved—garden is fragile, task Sisyphean.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Distinct lyric texture: long, breath-paced sentences mimic meditative labor; short clauses under pressure (“she smiled as she sensed”). Perceptual signature sharp—every droop, every vapor bead. No dialogue, so voice coherence judged solely on narrative; no POV drift. Compression purposeful: “engraved quiet” taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High information density: single sentences layer sensory, emotional, and thematic work. Rhythm modulates with labor—expansive during calm, clipped during uptake moments. No loops or scaffold; figurative language sparse and precise (“condensation forming and dispersing like thoughts”). Clean grammar; no typos.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: pacifist botanist using hunter relic as seed pouch; virtue-infused roses in post-collapse desert. Risk in quiet, accretive structure pays off with charged final image. Avoids trope checklist; specificity of sandbag scrap and hyper-perception anchors originality. Transformation test passed—story fails without these exact particulars.</comment>
