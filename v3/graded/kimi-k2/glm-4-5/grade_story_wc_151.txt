<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara’s contradiction—professional power vs. private longing—drives every beat; her final smile reconfiguring self-invention is earned and paid in surface-mail slowness, a Charged Poise that forecloses total anonymity with visible yearning cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causality holds: dawn light triggers reflection → chalk codes signal colleague → letter drop seals identity trade. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration, reweighting self-transformation against transparency under the Situational lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Golden arcade’s warmth and reflective metal create pressure for contemplation; the body clipboard and sidewalk chalk constrain tactics, but the environment itself isn’t leveraged in the final image as tightly as the objects.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Conflict tightens around the need to deliver meaningful identity mail before noon; stakes escalate once—the act cements Elara’s own transformation—but lacks further narrowing of options under the single-beat scope.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme surfaces fluidly: identity reinvention as resistance to surveillance emerges via concrete choices (mail vs. transmission) rather than statements; final golden drop offers a non-literal answer—transparency costs the sacred self.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual voice filters dawn through metal’s nostalgia; chalk-code language is taught early and achieves patterned payoff; no head-hops, only granular interiority under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose achieves lyrical compression without loops—every sentence pushes micro-choice or atmospheric charge; no scaffold dilutes the slow propulsion toward the mailbox’s inevitable reprise.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Uses the anachronistic mail system and chalk semaphore to re-envision genre tropes; the synthesis feels fresh and specific, the final golden logos irreplicable.</comment>
