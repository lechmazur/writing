<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lena’s interiority is embodied (trembling hands, spiral epiphany) and her adaptive trait drives the frost-plate experiment, but the shift from passive survivor to active exposer is asserted more than dramatized; the final resolve feels slightly pre-packaged.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the frost patterns decode the ledger and crystallize her mission. Causal chain holds—frost → revelation → resolve—though the “dream method” arrives without prior seeding, blunting the lens clarity a notch.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Canyon’s microclimate and starlit silence are filtered through Lena’s glass-maker’s eye; the glass plates and frost act as micro-setting that constrains her decoding and charges the final image. Spatial anchors are clear early and held.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—survival and exposure—tightens once when frost links ledger to mineral conspiracy. The tightening is single, coherent, and narrows her path to confrontation; cost is implied but not yet viscerally paid.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of transformation through art emerges from concrete particulars (molten glass → frost patterns) without sermonizing. The final image of artist-becoming-art carries quiet resonance, though the conceptual repricing could be sharper.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is glass-artist specific: light refraction, mineral vocabulary, tactile precision. Rhythm modulates between hushed canyon night and crystalline discovery. No POV drift; occasional elevated diction stays within her reflective register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is vivid, selective, and propulsive; no loops or scaffold. Metaphors of light and fracture are consistent. One mixed metaphor (“force of physical blow”) is minor and does not dull the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Frost-forensics as decoding device is fresh and non-obvious; links glass craft to criminal geology in a way that feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky conceit is fully committed to and pays off in the final spiral pattern.</comment>
