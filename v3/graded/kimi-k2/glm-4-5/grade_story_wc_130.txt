<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s buried optimism and inventive nature are embodied in her nightly ritual, but the interior contradiction between hope and caution is stated more than dramatized; the mentor’s absence is motive yet never complicates her present tactics. Micro-choices (tracing patterns, packing the eyes) are present but low-stakes. Closure is a soft “renewed purpose” rather than a path foreclosed with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: nightly repetition, pattern density, and final image of the reconfigured mosaic create a resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands as Charged Poise—new configuration offers “a path forward”—but the cost is only implied optimism, not dramatized forfeiture. Orientation is clear within 120 words; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The cavern orchard, dripping stalactites, and mosaic stone are vivid, selective, and filter through Elara’s priorities; the stone’s warmth and shifting patterns physically constrain her ritual and charge the final image. Micro-setting (glass eyes) also functions as tool. Meets 9+ gate for environment constraining choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—understanding loss via emotional mathematics—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs when the mosaic rearranges, but escalation is mild: options widen rather than narrow, and the cost is only potential hope. Agency is observational; no tangible price is paid on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of loss-as-puzzle emerges organically from ritual and image; the mathematics of emotion is explored through concrete pattern-work rather than statement. Final image of the reconfigured stone offers non-literal resonance, though the conceptual cost remains gentle. Avoids moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical, consistent, and filtered through Elara’s selective perception; sensory hierarchy favors light, texture, and mineral metaphor. Rhythm modulates with ritual cadence. No dialogue; internal monologue stays within POV lexicon. Distinct texture supports pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; figurative language is purposeful and sparse. Occasional soft filler (“seemed to,” “something deeper”) slightly dulls immediacy but never loops. No artifacts in closure beat. Strong sentence variety and paragraph economy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of taxidermy eyes + emotional mathematics + bioluminescent orchard feels specific and inevitable. Tropes (lost mentor, magical divination) are transformed through tactile ritual and mineral metaphor. Risk is moderate; payoff is quiet but coherent.</comment>
