<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Leo’s motivation (“serenade monotony”) and interiority about pattern calculation remain consistent; feelings stay embodied in breathing rhythms and micro-gestures. The bishop token reprise at closure crystallizes Earned Stasis—he knowingly forfeits the piece’s private meaning for the stranger’s emotional cost. Secondary pressure outside the woman is only hinted, so full relational crucible isn’t activated, but within the single-POV frame Leo’s hierarchy of values surfaces under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: Leo stands silent between acts, the cost made legible—“inside, he congratulated himself… would now become hers”—the moment reconfigures the token’s value and Leo’s private ledger. The causal lens holds: each setup (eaves-dropping on earbuds, timing footsteps) causally enables the intervention. No orientation debt; anchors arrive within 50 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The tidal arcade glass and marble acoustics constrain placement (string quartet positioning) and echo the mirrored finale, satisfying the 9-plus micro-setting gate. Vivid sensory specificity—salt-tinged breeze through glass arches—never stalls momentum. Spatial choreography is clean across Leo’s movements toward the woman.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Leo’s wager that the woman’s evening may be redeemed—is signaled early and escalated by the on-page arrival of the music. Escalation is a single deepening: the woman’s “anniversary” breaks composure under the exact song Leo seeded. Cost is visible: relinquishing the bishop token publicly; however, the price feels self-defined rather than externally threatening, capping at upper strong band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</question><comment>Theme emerges from particularities of pattern, music, and token; final image of stars “conspirators” reweights Leo’s covert craft without slogan. Avoids overt moral, invites ambiguous ethics of manipulation versus mercy. Could be stronger had Leo’s internal contradiction surfaced under pressure rather than after-moment self-satisfaction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: Leo’s “calculated wilderness,” “lightly attentive,” rhythmic micro-observation (“breaths between footsteps,” “tears refracted in marble starlight”). Voice remains controlled under pressure; sentence rhythm mirrors the staccato preparations and the long swell of the final refrain. No head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</question><comment>Rhythm mostly varied; occasional cadence duplication (“listened to…,” “listening to…”) appears in adjacent sentences without obscuring causality. Metaphor strain minimal; one soft overwrite “stars… wink conspiratorially” nudges sentimentality but does not infect closure. Density high; near-duplicative stems capped.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</question><comment>Fresh synthesis of street magician and game-theoretic compassion—chess bishop as token of diagonal trajectories—gives the concept original bite. Premise avoids trope catalogue; specificity grounds the familiar guardian-angel trope in tactile performance craft. Risk taken in quiet intervention rather than flashy reveal; coherence preserved as the final image reframes the bishop’s movement from strategic piece to gift.</comment>
