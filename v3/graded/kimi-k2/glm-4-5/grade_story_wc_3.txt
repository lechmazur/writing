<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—her pulse against the seed, the “second heartbeat” line—but the story leans on summary of predecessors’ madness rather than dramatizing her own contradictory impulses in scene. The final boarding of the vessel is a clear micro-choice, yet the cost feels generalized (“never felt less lonely”) rather than embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each analogy thickens the pattern until the seed’s vibration and the boarding beat crystallize the quest. Closure is a Charged Poise—options reconfigured, cost felt in the seed’s weight and the continuum she joins. Orientation is swift; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Cluttered study, seed’s walnut-smooth surface, and the Pamir-bound vessel are selective, POV-filtered details that constrain her next move. The magnetic arbor itself remains off-stage, but the seed’s pulsing and the mountain air act as micro-settings that charge the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—plant the seed to reach the arbor—tightens once: from scholarly decoding to embodied journey. The cost is the inherited burden and the risk of madness, but it is more asserted than viscerally staged; still, the boarding beat narrows her path irreversibly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of knowledge as both burden and transcendence emerges through the seed’s lineage and Elara’s refusal of obsession. Final image of continuum offers resonant, non-moralizing answer: she steps into an unbroken chain, reweighting prior material without explicit statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is scholarly yet tactile—“wedge-shaped indentations,” “static energy that made the air shimmer”—with rhythmic control under pressure. No dialogue, but free-indirect style stays coherent; perceptual signature is distinct and consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, vivid, and propulsive; occasional elevated diction (“proto-Indo-European languages”) fits the POV. One paraphrase loop around “transition” costs a sliver of momentum, but no artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fusion of cuneiform scholarship, atmospheric arboreal myth, and electromagnetic physics feels fresh and inevitable. The seed-as-continuum device transforms a familiar quest into something specific and haunting.</comment>
