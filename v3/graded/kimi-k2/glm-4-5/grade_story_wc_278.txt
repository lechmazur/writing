<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias’s deafened guilt and the baby-cry firmware anchor his inner contradiction through embodied micro-choices (tracing patterns, signing to the AI). The amber-insect’s repurposing and the lullaby breakthrough crystallize cost in Earned Stasis: guilt silenced at the price of never hearing her again. Interiority is specific to skin and circuitry rather than label-speak, though one beat toward “old guilt nested in his chest” nudges toward abstraction. All present criteria met without major slips.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens: firmware → amber → tether yields one decisive lullaby instead of phantom crying; cost is the irreversible knowledge that the song was never lived. Closure satisfies DC with felt price. A mild orientation waver on “where” in the laboratory until ~150 words, offset by sensory anchoring, nets −0.1. No causality breaks; time-fold serves the reversal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lab acoustics, antique cabinets, and micro-skin terrain are rendered through touch and vibration (“ink on arm,” floorboard throbs). The setting constrains choice (soundless environment) and recharges final image (constellation of notes). A slightly floating initial space docks minor penalty but is quickly anchored. No physical impossibilities; world rules remain tight.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Dominant stake—silencing guilt—tightens from firmware screams to the chosen lullaby. Single deepening, no external antagonist; pressure escalates via Elias’s own calibration. Closure renunciation is legible on page. Stakes never drift into abstraction; each calibration narrows options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Theme of sonic memory and irreparable loss emerges through amber, firmware, and constellation ink rather than statement. Closure offers non-literal re-weighting: guilt translates not into silence but into an unheard lullaby forever. Ambiguity is charged, not sentimental; no moralizing final paragraph. Motifs reprise with cost. One “dissonance of old guilt” label drifts close to diagnostic phrasing, minor impact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Voice is densely tactile, rhythmic, and specific: “hands as steady as the stars he inked,” firmware “whirred to life displaying code that looked like constellations.” Selective compression of time-fold is taught early by context cues, closure paid off cleanly. Minor run of repetitive prepositions in one beat docks slight polish. No POV leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</question>
<comment>Prose achieves compression and sonic texture without density overload. Metaphors remain precise (amber pulse like insect heartbeat); zero loops or synonym churn detected. One mixed metaphor “meteor hush fell” edges toward strain but is isolated.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</question>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of firmware-driven baby-cries meets amber-medium time-fold. Tropes are inverted: tattooist maps acoustic grief instead of skin, haunted server sings lullaby instead of scream. Specific detail grounds invention. Risk in time-fold tech is justified by coherent world logic.</comment>
