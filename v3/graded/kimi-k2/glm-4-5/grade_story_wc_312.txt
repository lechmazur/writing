<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The mage’s “lukewarm” self-concept is embodied in the final bell-tone and in his modest interiority, but the piece leans on summary rather than scene-level contradiction; the cost (his powers “beginning to warm”) is felt yet not dramatized in a micro-choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the bell’s silent-then-audible toll reconfigures the world and the mage’s self-worth; the Accumulative/Textural lens (pattern of dripping → rebuilding) holds. Orientation is immediate; no causal leaps mar the arc.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The sapphire viaduct, fractured bell, and dawn light are vivid and selective; the bell’s shifting state (broken → spectral → whole) constrains the mage’s tactics and charges the final image. Spatial choreography remains coherent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—restoring cosmic balance via the bell—is signaled early and tightens through the mage’s obsessive counting of drips; the final toll forecloses the era of silence. Cost is legible but abstract rather than visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: faith and futility refracted through “lukewarm” agency. The closing silence-that-becomes-sound offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext resides in the bell’s muteness and the sea’s stirring.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited voice is consistent, with a perceptual signature attuned to water, light, and cosmic rhythm. Syntax modulates to match the mage’s tentative awe; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is lyrical yet controlled; occasional elevated diction (“crystallized final segment clicked into place like settling stars”) skirts overwriting but stays within the mage’s wonder. No loops or scaffold; rhythm breathes with the dawn arc.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>The meteor-bronze bell rebuilt from water and intention feels fresh; the “lukewarm” mage subverts the prodigy trope. Specificity of dripping rates as cosmic code is inventive, though the ecological crisis backdrop is familiar.</comment>
