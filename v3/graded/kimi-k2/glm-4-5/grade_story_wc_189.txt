<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Maya’s interiority is textured—her hand on the cicada, the warmth “pulsing as if alive” anchors contradiction between fear and resolve. Yet the shift from funding panic to cosmic insight feels slightly epiphanic rather than earned; the cost of her new stance is asserted rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Maya’s reframing of “uncertainties as essential components” crystallizes under the Accumulative/Textural lens. The pause itself becomes the decisive beat; however, the causality between funding threat and conceptual breakthrough is more asserted than shown.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The grotto’s starlit pools and stone walls are rendered with selective sensory detail that mirrors Maya’s shifting attention; the jade cicada functions as micro-setting that constrains her final stance. Spatial choreography is clean; the pools’ reflections literally refract her insight.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—continuation of her life’s work—tightens through the funding threat; the pause deepens rather than reverses. Cost is conceptual (embracing uncertainty) but not viscerally felt on the page; escalation is intellectual rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of transition-as-substance emerges organically from tidal imagery and cicada metamorphosis; no overt moralizing. The final image reweights earlier pools/cicada motifs without explicit statement, achieving quiet resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays close to Maya’s perceptual signature—warm, observant, tangential. Syntax mirrors her circling thought; no head-hopping. Aris’s dialogue is minimal but distinct in its academic concern.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is lyrical yet disciplined; occasional density (“texture of time”) is earned by pattern. No loops or scaffold; rhythm breathes with the pause. A few near-abstract phrases (“conceptual repricing”) flirt with overstatement but don’t stall momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The tidal-pool-as-time metaphor and cicada-as-metamorphosis object feel freshly synthesized; not a stock ecological allegory. Risk lies in the quiet, interior pivot rather than external drama, and it pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
