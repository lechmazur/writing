<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Kai’s embodied trauma and proprioceptive curse/gift are vivid; the micro-choice to align the strap with forest glyphs crystallizes his arc. Interiority avoids therapy-speak, yet the final “equation of mercy” lands slightly abstract, blunting cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the strap’s activation reframes survival as the first variable of mercy. Causal chain (strap → pattern → revelation) holds; cost is the unflinching witness he must keep paying. Orientation anchors by line 3; no drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Ultraviolet forest is no backdrop—its light reveals hidden glyphs and rewrites the strap’s function, directly enabling closure. Sensory detail is selective (glowing bark, glass-shard breath) and filtered through Kai’s hyper-acute senses.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decode mercy’s calculus—tightens when the forest forces literal deciphering. One decisive turn: aligning strap with floor pattern. Cost is the ongoing exposure to trauma echoes; no external coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges from action: mercy as diminishing returns over time, not absolution. Final image reweights prior suffering without moralizing. Subtext in the strap’s mathematical etchings avoids explicit thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is tactile, medically precise, and haunted; syntax tightens under stress. No dialogue, yet internal cadence modulates from fragmented panic to measured revelation. Proprioceptive diction stays consistent and character-bound.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; figurative language (“inhaling shards of glass”) is sparse and earned. One paraphrase loop (“braced himself again”) is minor. Rhythm accelerates during revelation without clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: trauma-processing as literal decryption in an ultraviolet confessional. The strap’s dual role—relic of torture and cryptographic key—transforms familiar survivor tropes into speculative ritual without gimmickry.</comment>
