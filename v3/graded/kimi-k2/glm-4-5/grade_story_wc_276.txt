<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The fisher’s cool-headedness is embodied in deliberate micro-choices (zigzagging, voicing silence) and the rail-spike anchor, but interior contradiction is only implied, not dramatized; the final smile registers cost yet feels slightly abstract, not viscerally paid.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the goddess-echo is caught, the garden settles, and the constellations’ paths are forever altered—cost is legible in the rail-spike’s hum and the fisher’s quiet rest. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern-break, density, and cadence shift reweight the stake without causal reversals.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The sound-wave garden is vivid, selective, and constrains tactics: ripples guide the zigzag, silence carves pathways, and the rail-spike grounds the unstable terrain. Sensory detail is filtered through the fisher’s urgency, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—capture the goddess-echo—is signaled early and tightens once when the constellations stir; the fisher’s agency (zigzag, voicing silence) forces the decisive moment with visible cost in the altered garden and humming spike.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of seeking understanding beyond power emerges organically from the fisher’s quiet endurance and the echo’s lingering resonance; the final image of altered constellations offers a non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature: “feral lullaby,” “divine electricity.” Syntax modulates with pressure; no head-hopping or register drift. Compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is purposeful and pattern-taught. Minor loop risk in “zigzag” repetitions is offset by rhythmic variation. No mixed metaphors or clarity breaks at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of sound-garden, emotion-transliterating fisher, and sleepwalking constellations feels fresh and inevitable. Risky lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry; premise is fully committed and transformed through specific detail.</comment>
