<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s curiosity and guilt are vivid, but interiority slips into summary (“needed to find,” “determined to bring justice”) rather than embodied contradiction. The final act of downloading and disappearing feels earned, yet the cost is asserted rather than dramatized on her body or relationships.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands: Elara’s theft of the files reopens the case and forecloses her safety. Causal chain (numbers → breach → evidence) holds, but the 90-second countdown is resolved off-stage, softening the decisive change’s impact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The archive’s “digital necropolis” and “malevolent eyes” of warning glyphs are tactile and constrain access. The Stellaris patch as micro-object reappears with reweighted meaning, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—uncover truth behind vanished researchers—is signaled early and tightens through each forbidden breadcrumb. The breach moment narrows options irrevocably; cost (career/freedom) is stated but not viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of memory versus erasure emerges through the archive’s ghosts and the patch’s impossible survival. Final image of Elara underground reframes the quest without moralizing, though the refrain “archive doesn’t lie” edges toward thematic echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Voice is consistent, tech-noir lyric with controlled rhythm (“static electricity of forbidden knowledge”). Compression is purposeful; no POV leakage. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing”) slightly strains the focalizer’s lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Strong propulsion, vivid metaphor, minimal loops. One paraphrase loop (“whispers of information erased… screaming out to be found”) and a filter-verb cluster dull immediacy mid-scene. Otherwise clean, high-density lines.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Familiar conspiracy scaffold is refreshed by the archive-as-necropolis conceit and the Stellaris patch’s impossible timeline. Synthesis feels inevitable; risk lies in the compressed breach, not novelty of premise.</comment>
