<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—“empirically whimsical” nature vs. sacred duty—surface in beats (kneeling yet doubting her worth), and the luminous-doubt smile at the end shows endurance with cost, yet interiority occasionally slips into poetic summary rather than embodied tension under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>A single causal spine holds: dream interpretation → ridge descent → waterfall cave → stone circle → song → awakened memory; a visible cost appears in “luminous doubt” reconfiguring what Elara must now carry, satisfying closure under the Causal lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Anchor arrives in the first paragraph; the ridge, orchids, and monsoon sky constrain timing and pressure; the mossy cave stones and water curtain are tactile micro-settings guiding the climax—every sensory note earns its pay-forward.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The monsoon clock tightens choices after the knowledge seed glow intensifies; the act of singing under collapsing time forces the decisive turn that reweights collective memory; on-page cost is the permanent, overwhelming influx of ancestral voices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of memory-preservation as identity surfaces through ritual and song, not exposition; “luminous doubt” reconfigures the ending as a non-binary resolution, yet a slight drift toward overt pronouncement of heritage’s fragility leaches subtlety.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Third-limited voice is stable; lyric rhythms modulate under emotional pressure; occasional ornamental phrases (“beneath the curtain of water into cooler air and shadow”) verge on purple but stay within character-filter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Pacing breathes with descent and ritual; figurative language is selective and never jams the forward gear; minor loop of “long shadows across the ancient ridge” echoes twice yet without clarity loss.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: dream-guided seed rite melding mythic memory work with empirical wonder; risk feels organic, not gimmick, and the closure image cannot be swapped without fracturing the piece’s purpose.</question>
