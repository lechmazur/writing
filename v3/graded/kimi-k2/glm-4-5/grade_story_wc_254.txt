<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical but abstract; the poet’s “tremor of certainty” is stated more than embodied. The final transformation is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost (loss of physical form), yet contradictory impulses remain under-developed. Micro-choices are present but generalized (“reached out,” “stepped forward”) rather than character-specific.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the poet becomes the bridge between shadow and light, with the colonnade’s silence marking energy transferred. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of light/shadow imagery intensifies until the final image reweights the premise. Orientation is clear by line 4; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Cobalt stones and frozen lake are vividly selective, but only the colonnade constrains choice (touching it triggers transformation). Micro-setting (quartz pillar) functions as threshold object. Sensory hierarchy favors visual over tactile, yet the environment subtly guides the poet’s final step.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—freedom to transcend artistic limits—is signaled early and tightened when the poet physically merges with shadow/light. One meaningful deepening: the ban’s lifting is not enough; the poet must dissolve bodily boundaries. Cost is conceptual (loss of singular self) and legible in the final image.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of art as ungovernable spirit emerges organically from the poet’s transformation. Subtext operates in the colonnade’s silence and the lake’s thaw—no moralizing. Final image reweights prior material without statement: boundaries become thresholds, not walls.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is consistent, lyric, and perceptually specific (“lantern-moth hush,” “cloud-shadow nature”). Syntax modulates with emotional rise; no head-hopping. Compression is purposeful and taught early; closure remains legible under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; occasional stacked modifiers (“crystalline pillars vibrating with a melody only the aesthetically driven could perceive”) flirt with overwriting but serve the heightened register. No loops or scaffold; rhythm breathes with scene needs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Familiar liberation-of-artist trope is refreshed by cloud-shadow craft and quartz colonnade as literal gateway. Specificity of “cobalt atrium” and “humming quartz” anchors the premise. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
