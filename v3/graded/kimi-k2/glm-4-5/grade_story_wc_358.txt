<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elena’s professional drive is clear, but interiority stays at a cool remove—no contradictory impulses surface under pressure. The patch functions as talisman rather than crucible; her stance at the end is unchanged. No visible cost or micro-choice forecloses a path; she merely plans more work. Competence is foregrounded, struggle muted.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Closure is a restatement of intent (“Tomorrow would bring more measurements”) rather than a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, yet the final cadence merely reiterates earlier stakes without reweighting them. No felt cost crystallizes; the story ends on open continuation, not earned stasis.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The container labyrinth is vividly sketched—metal canyons, wind corridors, distorted air—each detail filtered through Elena’s investigative priorities. Spatial choreography is coherent; the setting actively narrows movement and channels observation. However, the environment never forces a final tactical shift or charges the closing image; it remains backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understand the silence—stays abstract; pressure intensifies only as data anomalies, not as narrowing options or visible price. Escalation is informational, not tactical. No reversal or trade-off occurs; Elena’s agency remains observational throughout.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Theme of foresight versus catastrophe emerges implicitly through Elena’s method, but the final paragraph edges toward explicit thesis (“to cultivate foresight in action was the ultimate goal”). The ambiguity of the phenomenon is preserved, yet the resonance is blunted by the non-closure ending.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Voice is crisp, professional, and consistent; perceptual signature is filtered through an investigator’s priorities. No POV drift or register mismatch. Compression is purposeful; sensory selection mirrors Elena’s focus. Rhythm remains steady rather than modulating with pressure, keeping tension cerebral.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, vivid, and information-dense; sentences advance both atmosphere and investigation. Occasional minor loops (“container canyon” / “towering labyrinth”) are forgivable. No overwriting or mixed metaphors. Clarity and momentum hold to the final line.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>The fusion of meteorological anomaly with architectural maze offers a fresh investigative frame. The mass-unconsciousness premise flirts with sci-fi but stays grounded in procedural detail. Risk is moderate; the piece avoids cliché yet doesn’t push formal boundaries. Specificity of wind-pattern forensics distinguishes it from generic disaster tales.</comment>
