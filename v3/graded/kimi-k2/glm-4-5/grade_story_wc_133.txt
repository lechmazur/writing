<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lena’s interiority is vivid and embodied (trembling hands, ghostly warmth), but her contradictory impulses (cling vs exchange) are summarized rather than dramatized in the moment of choice. The final renunciation is earned, yet the cost feels generalized rather than specific to her flaw.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Lena’s insomnia dissolves into purposeful work, with the amber brooch re-displayed as emblem of continuity. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each pigment and rain trail adds density until the final image crystallizes. One minor causality slip: the old woman’s arrival feels coincidental, not prepared.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The tidal island’s rain-carved trails and solar lamps are tactile and constraining; the amber’s warmth and the lighthouse sand ground the exchange. Weather and terrain subtly guide Lena’s movements and choices, charging the final studio image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transforming trauma into testimony—is signaled early and tightened when Lena accepts the pigments, foreclosing her nostalgic attachment to the brooch. The cost (loss of talisman, responsibility for rare colors) is legible, though the escalation is gentle rather than sharp.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: preservation vs creation, memory vs future. The amber brooch and pigments reweight each other without overt statement. Final line avoids moralizing, offering resonant ambiguity: “what might yet emerge.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is painterly, compressed, and consistent—rain trails “carved temporary paths,” pigments “from the continental gallery.” Free indirect style stays stable; no head-hopping. Distinct perceptual signature under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and rhythmic; occasional figurative layering (“labyrinthine corridors of her own trauma”) edges toward overwriting but never stalls momentum. No loops or scaffold; diction remains within Lena’s lexicon.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Post-climate-collapse artist colony is familiar territory, yet the amber-for-pigment exchange and rain-trail navigation feel specific and fresh. The synthesis of memory-objects and ecological art avoids gimmickry.</comment>
