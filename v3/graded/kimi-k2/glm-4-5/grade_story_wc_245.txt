<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elion’s tactile perception and grief anchor the story, yet his interiority occasionally lapses into abstract emotion-labeling (“quiet blaze”) and convenient pattern recognition in the climax. The transformation beats—ring warming, melody leading—feel externally driven rather than directly compelled by hard character choices. Earned stasis is present, but cost is muffled by lyrical exposition.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The causal chain relies on successive “then-elion” sequences propelled by an omniscient lyric voice; the pause of constellations is introduced late as a cosmic permission slip. Closure lands as Earned Stasis with emotional cost, but the motivation for successive discoveries (stillpoint, ring absorption, melody) remains underdramatized and lacunae-filled.</comment>

<comment>The ultrasonic forest is evocative, filtering POV bias through touch and silence; micro-setting (tree vibrations, pressure points) affects routing. Violated by late generic “clearing where the forest’s quiet blaze subsided.” Setting constrains choice only once, then becomes ornamental as the stillpoint arrives.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake (navigate inward grief) is signaled early. Pressure escalates only through an external trail of notes rather than narrowing options within Elion’s internal conflict. Final choice (kneeling, absorbing understanding) resolves a quest the trail solved for him; agency muted.</comment>

<comment>Theme of emotional cartography emerges from concrete sensory experience rather than sermon. Ending offers a resonant reconfiguration (quiet blaze becomes internal compass). Regular abstract phrases (stillpoint, uncharted depths) flirt with thematic echo but are not fatal.</comment>

<comment>Lyrical voice is consistent, perceptual signature strong, rhythm shifts under pressure. Purposeful elision (ring absorbs essence/understanding) serves closure. Occasional generic phrases (“the forest hummed”) dilute distinctiveness but do not break immersion.</comment>

<comment>Proselight loops minimal; figurative language dense at climax (“quiet blaze,” “ancient consciousness”) but pattern-taught. Rhythm propels scene until final paragraph slides into summary abstraction. No clarity breaks.</comment>

<comment>Blind mapmaker in ultrasonic forest plus constellation pause blends mythic and intimate stakes. Final crystallization (ring = internal compass) freshens grief mythology. Interior emotional map beats external terrain is inventive but hinges on well-worn “seeing without sight” trope.</comment>
