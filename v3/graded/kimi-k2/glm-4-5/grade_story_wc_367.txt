<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—her laughter as involuntary prophecy, her “shadowed elation”—but the prophetic trait is asserted more than dramatized; no moment shows her struggling to suppress or wield it. Motivation (“shape a new dawn”) is clear yet abstract; the cost of guiding refugees is felt only in summary. Micro-choices (aligning mirrors, tapping coordinates) are concrete, but stakes pivot on off-stage fleet safety rather than personal risk.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara’s stance crystallizes—“Tonight we guide them home”—with the felt cost of perpetual vigilance. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: nightly ritual, manuscript echoes, and beam choreography layer until the final sweep reweights the stake. Orientation is swift; causality holds. Minor ellipsis (how comet prophecy alters tactics) keeps it from 8.8.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The emerald lighthouse, glass lantern, and aurora-charged wick are tactile, selective, and constrain every beat; beam angles must be physically set. Nebulas and twin comets serve atmospheric scale without clutter. Spatial choreography is clean—mirrors, lenses, water paths track logically. Setting subtly guides choice: the hidden channel exists only through the lighthouse’s engineered light.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—safeguard refugee fleet—signaled early. Pressure tightens once: accidental prophecy raises stakes, forcing Elara to trust ancient manuscripts. Cost is communal (fleet survival) more than personal; her own risk remains abstract. Escalation is coherent under Accumulative lens, but personal price could be sharper.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of rediscovering lost wisdom through embodied ritual emerges organically from nightly routine and manuscript shadows. Subtext runs through laughter that predicts—power she neither requested nor fully controls. Final image of guiding “home” reweights “ancient shadows” as living resource, not nostalgia. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers in prophetic burden.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise—“laughing storm herald,” “shadowed elation”—with rhythmic control under pressure. Perceptual signature is consistent: Elara notices light angles, wind shifts, human migration charts. No POV leakage; diction stays within her intuitive lexicon. Compression (“Tonight we reveal the hidden channel”) teaches the pattern early and pays off.</comment>

<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; sentences advance multiple jobs. Occasional elevated phrasing (“luminescent properties,” “conceptual repricing”) edges toward register drift but remains within Elara’s manuscript-inflected voice. No loops or scaffold; metaphors stay coherent. One typo—“室白鲟”—breaks immersion and prevents 8.5.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: post-digital lighthouse keeper using pre-digital manuscripts and aurora physics to steer refugees. Premise avoids cliché through specificity of method (total internal reflection) and emotional texture (laughter as prophecy). Risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Could edge higher with deeper personal cost.</comment>
