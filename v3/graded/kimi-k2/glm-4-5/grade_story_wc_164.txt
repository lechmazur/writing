<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical and embodied; the recollectionist’s contradictory impulses—yearning to restore yet fearing the loss of memory—are palpable. However, her final epiphany arrives more as thematic summation than as a choice that visibly costs her something concrete on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: “disappearance often means becoming something more beautiful.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of seeds, glass, and light deepens until the final image reweights the premise. Cost is felt in the shift from anxious conjecture to elegiac acceptance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The iridescent cave is rendered with synesthetic precision and subtly constrains action: light guides planting, crystals cradle seeds, cheerful gloom modulates mood. Yet the cave never becomes an active obstacle or resource that alters tactics; it remains atmospheric backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—why paths vanish—is signaled early and tightens once: the planted seed forces a redefinition of loss into transformation. Pressure is coherent under the Accumulative lens, but the visible price (emotional surrender) is soft rather than materially altering her next move.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the seed-to-vision pattern; the final reweighting of “missing” into “metamorphosis” resonates without moralizing. Subtext lives in the hush between glowing petals and the recollectionist’s quiet tears—an earned, non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is consistently sea-foam delicate, with rhythmic control that mirrors the ebb of memory. Perceptual signature is vivid: “cheerful gloom,” “crystallized air.” No POV drift; compression and elision are purposeful and paid off in the final cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lush yet disciplined; figurative language is patterned early and never clutters the closure beat. Occasional soft filler (“she thought,” “she whispered”) and a few near-paraphrase loops keep it shy of the 9-band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of memory-keeper, crater glass, and migrating-bird oracle feels fresh and inevitable. The transformation of loss into luminous becoming is a non-obvious angle executed with conceptual integrity; no close echoes detected.</comment>
