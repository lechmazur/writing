<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied, but the “find the beginning in every ending” motive is stated more than dramatized; her micro-choices (tuning, releasing assumptions) feel procedural rather than driven by a visible internal contradiction. The final smile and descent show earned stasis, yet the cost is more conceptual than felt on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the towers re-awaken and Elara carries new knowledge, with a conceptual cost (the city will sleep again). Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of silence → resonance → hush again. Causality holds; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The suspended city, gorge mist, and rusted antennas are selectively detailed and filter through Elara’s signal-centric perception. The radio tower itself becomes a resonant body that constrains the tuning action, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decode the lunar signal or fail—is signaled early. Escalation is one deepening: silence achieved via shard of hush enables reception. Cost is the towers’ temporary awakening followed by inevitable return to slumber; agency is Elara’s deliberate tuning.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of cyclical death-rebirth emerges organically from the fragment’s journey and the towers’ reanimation. No moralizing; the final image of Elara descending while the city “sleeps again” offers a resonant, non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with a perceptual signature tuned to electromagnetic metaphor and cosmic scale. Syntax modulates under pressure; no head-hopping or register drift. Compression and elision are taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense. Occasional stacked modifiers (“serenely electric aura”) flirt with overwriting but remain within pattern. No loops or scaffold; clarity at closure intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of Hollywood stardom, cosmic debris, and radio-tower necromancy. The shard of hush and lunar perigee are not mere set dressing; they reconfigure the familiar quest trope into a quiet, cosmic rite. Specificity anchors the fantastical.</comment>
