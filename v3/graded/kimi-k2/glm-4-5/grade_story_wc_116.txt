<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The keeper’s interiority is vivid and embodied—“grip on reality, always loose, loosened further”—and the final refusal of stasis is earned by prior causality. Yet the character’s contradictory impulses are more asserted than dramatized in scene, and the cost of resisting the silence is only implied, not felt on the body.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the keeper’s return to the refuge reconfigures the stakes—silence is now a secret carried, not a temptation entered. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds; the final image reweights earlier motifs with conceptual cost. Orientation is anchored early; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Obsidian refuge, catacomb library, and the pocket of silence are rendered with tactile specificity—“smelling of ozone and ancient paper”—and the origami swan constrains the final choice. Setting subtly guides action; no white-room drift. Minor cap at 8.8 because the refuge itself does not evolve across beats.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—witness without succumbing to stasis—is signaled early and tightened once when the silence offers healing. The keeper’s renunciation carries conceptual cost, though the price is more abstract than visceral. Escalation is coherent under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of entropy versus preservation emerges organically from the keeper’s refusal to freeze time. The final notation and replaced swan offer a resonant, non-literal answer—silence archived, not inhabited. No moralizing; complexity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent—“reality sliding past like cold silk”—with controlled psychic distance. No head-hopping; diction stays within the keeper’s perceptual range. Compression and elision are purposeful and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet clear, with rhythmic variation and zero loops. Figurative language is selective; no mixed metaphors. One minor scaffold—“the refuge had weathered floods and droughts”—does not dull momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The regenerative-silence premise, origami-key method, and entropy-witness stance synthesize into a fresh, inevitable whole. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. No derivative echoes.</comment>
