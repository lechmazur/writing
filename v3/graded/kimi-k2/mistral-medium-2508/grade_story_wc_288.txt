<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lior’s contradictory impulses—guilt over ancestral extinction and his refusal to keep apologizing—are dramatized in the sundial moment; the final letting-go is earned by the feather-offering beat and carries visible cost (loss of the bird, opening of the door). Interiority is specific, embodied, and avoids label-speak. Only the bird’s agency is slightly under-motivated, keeping it just below 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Lior’s stance shifts from haunted isolation to chosen independence, crystallized when the library doors open. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of hum, reflection, feather, and door creak reweights meaning with felt cost. Orientation is anchored early; no causality breaks. One hairline slip: the “clock begins to chime” is new and untaught.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The tidal library, sundial, and floating shelves are vivid, selective, and constrain choices (books rearrange, sundial splits reflection). Micro-setting (brass surface, damp pages) charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; no white-room syndrome. Just shy of 9 because the atomically reflective trait is more label than lived constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to coexist with a ghost that remembers you—tightens when the bird strikes its reflection and the book dissolves into mirrors. Escalation is driven by Lior’s micro-choices (shielding with the sundial, opening the door) under Accumulative pressure. Cost is legible: he relinquishes the bird and the library’s safety. One more beat of external consequence would push it higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: memory’s burden vs. the right to move on. The final image—doors opening onto a world that has forgotten both species—reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext in the bird’s feather-offering and Lior’s smile carries the resonance. No thematic drift or echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with rhythmic control under pressure (“hum climbed to a pitch that made Lior’s teeth ache”). Perceptual signature is consistent—scholarly, guilt-tinged, sensory-rich. No POV leakage or register drift. Compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, musical, and propulsive; every sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Occasional elevated diction (“atomically reflective”) is voice-motivated. One near-repeat—“hum swelled, the shelves groaned”—is minor enough to leave closure untouched.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The extinct-bird-as-contemporary conceit is fresh, synthesized through specific sensory and emotional particulars. The tidal library and mirror-book feel inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. No derivative echoes.</comment>
