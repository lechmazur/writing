<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s gentle persistence is embodied in tactile bell-handling and midnight runs; contradictory impulses (risk vs care) remain internal yet visible. The final renunciation—never ringing again—carries felt cost and is earned by prior causality. Liora’s brief presence supplies external pressure that alters tactics. Minor: no second on-page character for status crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each bell-ring and food drop layers density until the twelve-fold challenge crystallizes community stance. Closure is Charged Poise—bell hung for wind to ring—reconfiguring survival into legacy with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation anchors within 120 words; no causality break.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Terra-cotta arbor, tarnished bell, and moonlit orchards are filtered through Elias’s urgent selectivity; the burned arbor later constrains the final choice to plant roses. Sensory economy favors scent of bread and chill frost—details that charge the ending’s resonance. Micro-setting (bell as handled object) also qualifies.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—community survival under sanctions—tightens when patrols torch the arbor, forcing Elias’s public twelve-ring defiance. Escalation is accumulative: each silent basket raises stakes until anonymity is no longer tenable. Cost is visible in the burned arbor and Elias’s silent renunciation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of quiet resistance emerges through concrete acts; no explicit moralizing. Final image—wind ringing the bell—offers non-literal answer to how legacy survives silence. Subtext in Liora’s note and elders’ humming deepens without overt statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays close to Elias’s sensorium; perceptual signature is tactile and nocturnal. Rhythm modulates from hushed stealth to the crashing twelve peals, mirroring rising stakes. No POV drift or filter-verb clutter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet textured: “calloused hands cradled the bell,” “thorns sharp as promises.” No loops or mixed metaphors; sentence variety supports momentum. Final paragraph cadence slows to crystallize legacy without slack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Familiar trope of covert resistance is refreshed through the bell’s acoustic legacy and generational relay. Specificity of terra-cotta tiles, salted fish, and climbing roses grounds the concept. Risk: public ringing as non-violent defiance feels inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
