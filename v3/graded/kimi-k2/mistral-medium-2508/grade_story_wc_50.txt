<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Interiority is embodied and conflicted; micro-choices (aligning gears to “listen,” pocketing the loose screw) show value hierarchy scaled to length. However, the central shift from fixing to remembering is somewhat internally summarized rather than dramatized under full pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Closure chooses to keep the timer running, an Earned Stasis that forecloses exit with felt cost; reflective blocks hover at ~25 % but anchor via concrete cues (“daughter had asked”). Orientation tight within the single cavern scene window.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Marble cavern with silver veins is present in multiple beats, constraining acoustics that enable the final echo harvest; reflections at dawn vs. dusk teach the pattern. Specificity in tool handling (charred stick for sketches) grounds POV.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserve waning echoes—tightens once: reverse-engineering successes prise open the past but make nothing new, heightening scarcity of wounded season. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; cost (daughter’s dwindling patience) signaled but less visceral than mechanic cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the tension between memory as solace vs. control; wonder is “stored” through mechanism rather than moral declared. Final image (timer’s soft tick) is a Conceptual Repricing that reweights the premise: love means letting time escape while grasping it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Reflective, textured prose with rhythmic variation (“cracked like a language half-forgotten”). POV remains stable, minor compression at peak stress. Dialogue minimal but voice distinct in locksmith’s thrift of words and tool-gesture detail.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>High information density, clear propulsion; only minor figurative clusters e.g. “harvest of echoes” used twice. No loops; sentence rhythm accelerates during the gear alignment sequence. Concrete, idiosyncratic detail (“loose screw as souvenir”) grounds line level.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Fresh twist: timer not for counting but for pausing memory itself. Specific synthesis of folklore “echo harvest” and personal grief feels inevitable. Uses unconventional structure (lyric accumulation) but remains legible under the chosen lens.</comment>
