<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical and embodied; the recollectionist’s contradictory impulse—yearning to recover lost paths yet fearing their cost—surfaces in the blood-glow moment. Micro-choices (plucking seed, pressing shard to ear, letting memories in) escalate stakes. Final renunciation of backward-looking is earned, but the “thousand half-remembered lives” summary edges toward label-speak, blunting cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: she accepts the missing pieces as internal, steps into new paths. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each shard adds density until the final cadence shift. Causality is lyric rather than tight because/therefore, yet the pattern is taught early and paid off. Cost is visible in the glowing blood and the geode’s sealing sigh.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Geode, seeds, and tide-foam are rendered with synesthetic precision; the cave’s “cheerful gloom” modulates with emotional pressure. Crater glass constrains every beat—map, wound, vessel—charging the final image. Spatial anchors are immediate; no orientation debt. Micro-setting (her bleeding thumb) functions as charged object.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recovering what’s lost before memory dissolves—is signaled early and tightened when the bird writes “hurry.” Escalation is accretive: each shard narrows her stance until acceptance forecloses retrieval. Cost is felt in the cut thumb and the geode’s sealing. Agency drives the final step; coincidence (bird) complicates but does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of loss-as-creation emerges through concrete particulars: shards map erased lives, seeds sprout new stories. Final image—door opening on horizon—reweights prior motifs without moralizing. Subtext operates in silence after the laugh; ambiguity lingers. Avoids tidy binaries; complexity is felt, not stated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is oceanic, salt-stung, and consistent; perceptual signature notices color-as-emotion and tide-regret. Syntax modulates with pressure—long lyrical coils compress into “She let them in.” No head-hopping; POV modesty maintained. Compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet fluid; figurative language is selective and purposeful. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Rhythm breathes with scene needs—hushed accumulation, then release. Occasional elevated diction (“transliterating”) fits the recollectionist’s vocation without register drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Premise—memory-miner in a geode of living shards—is fresh, synthesized through sensory specificity. Tropes of lost paths and guiding birds are transformed by embodied cost and iridescent blood. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens resonance without obscuring clarity.</comment>
