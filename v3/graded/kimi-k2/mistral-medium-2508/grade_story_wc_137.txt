<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Liora’s skepticism and grief are embodied in tactile micro-choices (tracing symbols, pressing the tile) and contradictory impulses (scoffing yet clutching). The final renunciation—letting the parchment go—earns its cost through prior beats and visibly forecloses the “summon” path. Interiority stays concrete; no diagnostic self-talk. One slip: “courageously kind” is label-speak mid-crisis, blunting the beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the tower’s stones soften, space folds inward, and Liora accepts the memory’s echo with felt cost—she releases the tile and the parchment. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern density (whale song, tile glow, ink bleeding) crescendos into the final image. No orientation drift; anchors set by line 3. One causal micro-turn: transcribing shifts from rebellion to door-making.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The open tower, salt wind, and whale song are filtered through Liora’s stargazer bias; every sensory note tightens the acoustic pressure that finally bends space. The tile’s obsidian warmth and the telescope’s lens act as micro-settings constraining her final choice to leave focus unfixed. No static postcard shots; environment evolves with the memory-fold. One minor over-description cluster mid-story (−0.3).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—sculpting space for her brother’s echo—is signaled early and tightened once: the transcribing shifts from skeptical ritual to irreversible memory-door. Cost is visible when she releases the tile and parchment, accepting the echo over resurrection. Pressure escalates under Accumulative lens via whale-song density and tile glow; no coincidence resolves. One beat could be sharper: the “courageously kind” thought is abstract, softening the peak.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: grief as tide, memory as constellation, listening as courage. The final image—tower humming at a frequency “only the brave or broken could hear”—reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture (letting parchment drift) and silence between whale calls. No thematic echo in final paragraph; resonance is earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is stargazer-precise yet salt-stung: “ink bleeding into the shape of his hands,” “tower’s bones.” Rhythm modulates with pressure—short clauses under whale-crescendo, longer breaths at dawn. No POV leakage; perceptual signature stays consistent. One register drift: “conceptual repricing” diction in the meta-thought feels academic, but it’s brief.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and motion. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is selective. One mixed metaphor—“tower’s stones softened like wax under flame”—momentarily blurs physical logic (−0.2). Otherwise clean, vivid, read-aloud ready.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Familiar grief-magic premise is transformed through stargazer specificity and whale-song acoustics. The memory-fold climax feels inevitable yet fresh; no close echoes. Risky lyric compression pays off in the final unfocused telescope beat. One derivative whisper—“the sea remembers”—but context reweights it.</comment>
