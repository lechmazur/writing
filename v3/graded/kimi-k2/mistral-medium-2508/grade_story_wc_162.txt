<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elias’s grief-driven urgency and Liora’s precocious certainty are embodied through tactile micro-choices (analyzing wood grain, folding the husk). The final surrender—“teach me the codes”—earns a credible renunciation of control, but the interior contradiction between architect-father and seeker could be sharper under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elias crosses the threshold, ladder holds, cost is the irreversible shift in paternal authority. Causal chain (logbook → husk note → sinkhole) is tight; one transition (terrace → maze) is clean. Orientation anchored by kerosene scent and flashlight beams within 120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Selective sensory triangulation—kerosene, salt, rain-slick rail—grounds the maze and terrace as lived spaces. The sinkhole’s candlelit quilts constrain the final choice; the drifting prism terrace reappears as echo, charging closure. Spatial choreography from porch to ladder is coherent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake: recover Liora vs. accept her chosen threshold. Escalation tightens once: maze search → sinkhole descent. Cost is Elias’s relinquished authorship over the labyrinth. Pressure remains coherent under Situational lens; coincidence (finding logbook) complicates rather than resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of sacred thresholds emerges through concrete particulars—corn husk boat, firefly Morse—without moralizing. Final image of father descending reconfigures the maze’s purpose from control to surrender. Subtext in Liora’s “Took you long enough” carries generational inversion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: tactile, almost synesthetic diction (“featherly determined,” “fractured hush”). Compression and patterned elision taught early (“the way the wind carried no trace”) pay off in the ladder’s creak. POV remains locked to Elias; no head-hop.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is selective (“bird deciding whether to take flight”) and never muddles causality. No loops or scaffold. Rhythm modulates from clipped urgency to the slowed, saccharine air of the sinkhole. Minor register drift in “sacred shake of the world” is earned by context.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms the missing-child trope into a mythic threshold tale; the maze as both literal and metaphysical construct feels inevitable. Firefly spiral as non-obvious synthesis of navigation code and child’s agency. Risk in quiet, lyric closure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
