<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lirien’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses—thief’s pragmatism versus “chivalrous” ethic—play out in the tactile swap of the sundial lid. The Keeper’s tremor when he finds his own name gives a credible cost. Minor: the “apprentice of wonder” label is slightly abstract, not fully dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the sky begins to mend, the spire sings, and Lirien steps into the unknown—cost is the forfeiture of certainty. Causal chain (swap → Keeper’s recognition → sky shift) holds. One micro-turn: the lid’s light changes color, reconfiguring stakes. No orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The ice spire’s slick face and violet sun are not backdrop but active pressure: footholds appear only after the swap succeeds. The pocket sundial lid doubles as micro-setting, constraining the final choice. Sensory detail is selective and urgent; no white-room syndrome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore the sky via the lid—tightens when the Keeper’s tear-name becomes the pivot. Escalation is one deepening: the wrong sky’s pulse slows as the lid’s light turns blue. Cost is explicit in the Keeper’s tremor and Lirien’s unguarded step into clouds.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of “amending time” emerges from the swap itself, not exposition. The final blue light reweights the wrong sky without moralizing. Subtext in the chess piece/knight exchange carries confession and cartography. Complexity lingers: the sky mends, but the map to “right” remains unknown.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise; “breath curling in shapes that weren’t quite smoke” teaches the pattern early. Compression (“She didn’t say it aloud”) keeps psychic distance tight. Dialogue carries subtext: “You think time is a thing to be stolen?” / “I think it’s a thing to be amended.” No head-hop.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; each sentence layers image and motion. Metaphors are coherent—“wrong sky twisting like a wound.” No loops or scaffold. Rhythm modulates with stress: short clauses under pressure, longer breaths at descent. Clean mechanics.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Familiar quest tropes are transformed: the thief returns rather than takes, the sundial holds a tear, the chess piece is both map and ransom. The violet sun and singing spire feel inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyricism pays off in the final reconfiguration of sky and self.</comment>
