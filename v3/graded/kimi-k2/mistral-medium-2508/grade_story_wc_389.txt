<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s interior contradiction—listening vs. speaking—drives every beat; the final act of hurling the receiver through the portico crystallizes his shift from passive needle to active hand with visible cost (loss of static voices). Motivation stays rooted in his trait of hearing futures in radio cracks, and embodied emotion (shaking hands, jagged smile) grounds the arc. The only minor slip is a touch of diagnostic self-labeling (“prophets weren’t born; they were assembled”) that slightly abstracts the moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Decisive Change: Elias seals the crack, destroys the receiver, and becomes the speaking prophet—cost is the silence that follows and the bruised-purple dawn. Causal chain holds: because he listens, he is tempted; therefore he chooses to speak, reconfiguring the world below. Lens is Causal; no orientation debt; one clean scene.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The cobalt portico evolves from lens to door to throne, constraining every choice; the stormlit observatory supplies tactile cold, ozone taste, and spatial pressure. Sensory selection narrows under crisis (static hum through bones). Final image of the city rising from shadow and old-god bones recharges the setting as both weapon and consequence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to serve the dawn or master it—is signaled early and tightens when the silhouette with too many fingers appears. Escalation is causal: each transmission raises cost until Elias’s decisive act forecloses the passive path. Price is the wailing chorus and the bruised dawn itself.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of self-authorship versus predestination emerges through Elias’s shift from listener to speaker; no explicit moralizing. The final image of the scalpel-dawn reweights the premise without statement. Subtext in the reflection—“you just needed the right mirror”—carries the cost of erased doubt.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyric, prophetic, and character-bound; perceptual signature filters every detail through Elias’s radio-tuned mind. Syntax modulates with pressure—short declaratives at climax, longer coils during reflection. No head-hopping; diction stays within the POV’s plausible lexicon even at peak intensity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is selective and purposeful (“storm coiled tighter,” “glass drunk the device”). No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances stakes or atmosphere. Minor elevated diction (“conceptual repricing” zone) is voice-motivated and does not obscure clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of radio-prophecy, cobalt relic, and self-forged apocalypse; tropes are inverted (prophet as hardware assembler, dawn as scalpel). Specificity of “salvaged war tech and copper wire” grounds the mythic frame. Risk-taking in lyric mode pays off with coherent closure.</comment>
