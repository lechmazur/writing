<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s contradictory impulses—rescue vs. destroy—are dramatized in the final beats: the trembling book, the whispered name, the match struck. Interiority is embodied (“volcanic tenderness erupting”), not labeled. The renunciation (burning the ledger) is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost. Minor slip: the archivist remains off-page, so relationship crucible is absent.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elias forecloses the promise’s future with the second fire, cost legible in “empty pockets, unmarked hands.” Causal lens holds: each beat (key turn, pillar reveal, ledger ignition) is linked by “because/therefore.” No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 3. One tightening suffices.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The archive’s charred scent and cracked pillar constrain choice—only Elias can read the hidden script, only the key fits. Micro-setting (silver key against collarbone) charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and urgent; no static catalog. Could edge higher if the desert wind’s direction altered tactics, but it remains atmospheric.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“save the world from the promise”—is signaled early and tightens once: the ledger forces Elias to choose between memory and mercy. Agency drives escalation; coincidence never rescues. Cost is visible in the second immolation. One decisive turn suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from action: the ethics of forgetting, the cost of mercy. Final image—“ashes curling into the shape of a question”—reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext in the looped infinity/her initials is earned. No thematic drift; complexity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is textured, rhythmic, and POV-locked: “smelled of charred parchment and old regret” teaches the sensory pattern early. Compression (“He lit a match. The archive would burn clean…”) accelerates under pressure. No head-hopping; diction stays within Elias’s plausible lexicon. Minor echo of “promise” could be pruned, but not at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence advances stakes or atmosphere. No loops, no mixed metaphors. Rhythm modulates with emotional heat. One near-scaffold (“the fire had been mercy. But mercy, like memory…”) is purposeful echo, not redundancy. Clean mechanics.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: library arson as archival midwifery, the ledger as anti-relic. Vandalized self-portrait repurposed as map is non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking (second fire) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specificity anchors universals; no template echo.</comment>
