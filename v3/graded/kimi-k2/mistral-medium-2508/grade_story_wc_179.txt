<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lior’s contradictory impulses—resentment vs. the need to release—are embodied in the pin’s handling and the ghost-brother’s taunts. The final micro-choice (pressing the pin back, then letting the box fall) earns the renunciation with visible cost. Interiority is specific, never diagnostic. Only the “scheming pacifist” label is never dramatized, capping the score just below 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the pin restored, the brothers walking away, silence now a chosen space. Causal chain—break pin → confront ghost → reinsert pin → leave box—holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is immediate; no teleporting props. Cost is legible in the final image of the empty spinning cylinder.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The sanctuary’s breathing walls and scent of rain constrain Lior’s memory access and force the confrontation. The music box itself functions as micro-setting, its broken cylinder dictating action. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered. While vivid, the environment does not quite charge the final image; the pin does.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—release resentment or remain bound—is signaled early and tightened when Kael demands why the pin was broken. One decisive deepening: Lior reinserts the pin, foreclosing vengeance. Cost is the relinquishing of the box and the years it symbolized. Agency drives every turn; coincidence is absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Grace emerges as an earned, non-literal space between brothers; no moral is stated. The broken-then-whole pin reweights the premise without exposition. Subtext saturates the ghost’s teasing and the final shared exhale. The ending’s quiet reconfiguration invites reflection without sentimentality.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded, with rhythmic control that modulates under pressure (“walls breathing inward, then out”). POV stays locked to Lior; no head-hop. Dialogue carries subtext (“Grace doesn’t keep to schedules”). Distinct perceptual signature throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, propulsive, and free of loops or scaffold. Metaphors are precise (“silence—thick as wool, heavy as regret”). No register drift or mixed vehicles. The final cadence shift—single sustained note to shared exhale—lands cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The ghost-brother who ages in flickers and the soundless sanctuary offer a fresh angle on reconciliation. Familiar tropes (music box, ghost) are transformed through embodied memory and shifting walls. The synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
