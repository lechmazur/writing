<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Liora’s contradictory impulses—stay to protect the roses vs. flee as her father urged—are embodied in the thorn-prick and the knife that carves bark instead of flesh. The micro-choice of tying the sandbag scrap to the sapling crystallizes her renunciation with visible cost: she forfeits escape for continuity. Interiority is concrete and specific, though the father’s voice edges toward summary rather than dramatized memory. The final stance is earned and irreversible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each repetition of “quiet” and each tactile handling of the sandbag intensify the dominant stake—preserving continuity against collapse—until the final image reweights it. Closure arrives as Charged Poise: Liora’s ear to the earth crystallizes her stance while the cost (world burning outside) remains palpable. Orientation is swift; causality holds without gaps. The tower’s fall is the single transition, framed as aftermath.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The dome, sandbag scrap, and roses function as micro-setting that constrains every choice: the cracked pane, the warm glass, the thorns. Sensory detail is selective—salt-rust taste, canvas bite—filtered through Liora’s priorities. The setting evolves with the fissure that refuses to spread, mirroring her refusal to flee. One minor slip: “sun that had once baked the desert” drifts into exposition.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserve the roses’ continuity against global collapse—is signaled in paragraph one and tightened when Liora sheathes the knife into soil, renouncing violence and escape. The pressure deepens as the wind rattles the cracked pane, but coincidence never resolves; her endurance is the only buffer. Cost is visible: the world burns while she kneels in dirt. One more beat of external threat inside the dome would push this higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: continuity carved into bark, quiet stitched into seams. The final image—ear to earth, waiting for plants to speak—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to how life persists after towers fall. Subtext operates in gesture (sandbag scrap as tourniquet for a sapling) rather than statement. The piece avoids moralizing; the cost of continuity is left raw.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded, with rhythmic control that accelerates under pressure (“the world outside was a scream of dust”). Perceptual signature is sharp: Liora notices thorn-bite, salt-rust, cracked glass—never tourist detail. No dialogue, so no voice contamination. Occasional elevated diction (“senselessly perceptive”) feels earned within the lyrical frame.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; sentences carry multiple jobs (“She pressed the sandbag’s fabric to her lips, tasting salt and rust and the ghost of her father’s sweat”). No loops or scaffold. Metaphors are precise—tower “crumbled like a child’s sandcastle”—and never muddle causality. One filter-verb cluster (“she would take… and stitch…”) is minor.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The synthesis—bounty hunter turned plant-whisperer, pacifist daughter carving continuity into bark—feels fresh and inevitable. The sandbag scrap as both relic and tourniquet transforms a war object into a life-anchor. Risk is quiet: no spectacle, yet the lyric intensity carries. A near-echo of “quiet like the wind before dawn” is the only familiar phrase.</comment>
