<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Liora’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the crocodile-tooth memory anchors her grief without slipping into label-speak. Her choice to scatter petals and trade jokes with the ghost is a micro-choice that reweights the stake and carries felt cost. The modest fearlessness trait is shown, not told, in her refusal to startle. Only the ghost’s voice remains slightly generic, preventing 9.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the gorge’s sigh becomes a shared laugh, reconfiguring the ghost’s fate and Liora’s burden. Causality is tight—each pluck of the harp advances knowledge and narrows options. The lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of laughter-as-healing intensifies to final cadence shift. Cost is legible in the lighter satchel and the lingering note.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Echo Gorge is rendered through selective sensory detail—wet earth, warped echoes—that constrains movement and mood. The harp itself functions as micro-setting, its misaligned strings guiding Liora’s tactic of distorted harmony. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions. The gorge’s final “standing tall” recharges the opening image, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—integrate the ghost’s laughter into healing—is signaled early and tightened through each pluck and joke exchange. Escalation is Accumulative: each wrong-right note deepens the pattern until the final chord harmonizes distortion. Cost is visible in the spent petals and the ghost’s contented sigh. No reversals needed; one meaningful deepening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of grief-as-collection and laughter-as-integration emerges organically from the ghost’s need and Liora’s ritual. Subtext lives in the tooth’s warmth and the gorge’s sigh—no moralizing. Final image of the lingering note offers a non-literal answer: healing is not erasure but shared dissonance. Complexity is honored; no tidy moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with controlled rhythm that accelerates under pressure—“notes bending into something that made her teeth ache.” Perceptual signature is consistent: Liora notices through sound and weight. No POV leakage; the ghost’s voice is filtered through her perception. Compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. Figurative language is selective—“laughter like a cracked harp string”—and never muddles causality. No loops or scaffold; no mixed metaphors. Final line “the echoes laughed” crystallizes the pattern without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise of a soul-collector who heals by trading jokes is fresh, grounded in tactile detail. The misaligned harp as instrument of integration is a non-obvious synthesis. Risk-taking—lyric mode, minimal cast—heightens stakes without gimmickry. Transformation test: story collapses if harp or tooth is swapped.</comment>
