<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses (compliance vs. truth) are dramatized in concrete micro-choices—tracing the ledger, hesitating, inputting the flood command—each with escalating cost. Her interiority is embodied (pulse scandalizing the hush) and her final smile under gunfire crystallizes Earned Stasis. The “bravely conflicted” trait is not label-only; it visibly constrains and then enables the decisive act.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a sharp Decisive Change: the flood command irrevocably rewrites the archive’s power balance and costs Elara her life. Causal linkage is tight—letter → recognition of purge → system flood → martyrdom—under a Causal lens. The ending beat (“the archives *spoke back*”) reconfigures meaning with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The snow-muffled library is not postcard scenery; its hush and pneumatic tubes actively shape stealth tactics and the final alarm breach. Frost-laced ledger and isolation chamber function as micro-settings that constrain choice. Sensory selection (ozone, gunpowder) narrows under crisis, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth vs. institutional erasure—tightens through each beat: letter’s hook, anomaly recall, flood command. Agency is continuous; Elara’s decision forecloses survival and forces a systemic reckoning. Cost is visceral (gunfire) and conceptual (martyrdom label on terminal).</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from action: memory as resistance, silence as violence. The final image of “archives spoke back” reframes the entire premise without moralizing. Subtext in the letter’s burnt-copper ink and the Overseers’ gunpowder scent carries the ethical weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is crystalline, with a perceptual signature attuned to cold, hush, and latent threat. Syntax modulates from languid (“vaulted halls swallowing sound”) to staccato under pressure (“screens flared—alarms wailed”). No head-hopping; POV remains locked to Elara.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet textured; each sentence advances stakes or atmosphere. Metaphors (“snow…tiny shroud”) are precise and purposeful. No loops or scaffold; rhythm accelerates with crisis. Final line (“echo”) recharges opening hush with new weight.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The cryo-archive-as-panopticon premise is freshly synthesized; the contraband-truth rebellion feels inevitable in hindsight. Specific details (pneumatic tubes, thaw protocols) ground the speculative frame. The martyr ending avoids cliché by embedding cost in the archive’s own memory.</comment>
