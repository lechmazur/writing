<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elias’s silent pivot from extraction to reciprocal offering is embodied micro-choice: the hush, the palm-to-palm pass of the shell, the jump through the moment’s split fruit. Interior contradiction shows in the comparison between trapped pocket suns and the act of letting them burn themselves out. Liora’s status as shared catalyst remains seamlessly legible through gesture, not exposition. Only Liora’s final tease “Took you long enough” skirts diagnostic summary, shaving the edge.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands in unmistakable Conceptual Repricing: dropping the shell creates a before/after rewrite of what light-giving means, weighted by the city’s cooling amber bridges as visible cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density is transferred from the shell’s equations into the seams of their coats and the gap between ribs—without any looseness in causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The ember nexus bridges constrain action: warm railings conduct pulse, steam vents dictate where one can stand unseen, cooling gold-to-amber signals the closing window of choice. Micro-setting—the shell heated in palm—functions as tactile location. Only the initial skyline sketch leans touristy before pivoting to lived-in pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“capture the density of presence”—is tested, inverted, and foreclosed when Elias actively refutes the premise, costing him prior definition of success. One tightening: letting the shell drop rewires the entire equation, legible under Accumulative lens with ambient bridges cooling as felt price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: presence is not hoarded but mutually produced in the exchange of selves, never preached. Repricing the shell re-weights every previous attempt at bottling light, embedding a quiet refusal of extraction ideology that feels earned rather than asserted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Distinct sci-fi lyric voice—“molten copper,” “secret passed like a current”—remains consistent; no head-hops. Liora’s clipped murmur contrasts with Elias’s denser interiority, intentional at closure as voices converge in heartbeat resonance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>No loops or template cadences; each image either advances motive or re-weights motif. Compressed lines—“the moment splitting open like a fruit”—carry volitional force. One minor blemish: “palette of resolve” used twice in four lines but paid off in closure, limiting loss.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Familiar alchemist trope is renewed through the reverse move: not bottling light but pouring it back, diffused into relational fabric. Risk of lyric excess kept honest by fleshing “density” as warmth in coat seams and weight between ribs, newly specific.</comment>
