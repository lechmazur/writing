<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is convincingly specific—worn dent, thirteen-year exile, and a lived reluctance to “play at all when the stakes are invisible”—but the daughter never rises beyond prop-level innocence; their status dynamic lacks pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; images and beats layer until the jagged, luminous re-patterning of the board crystallizes a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost—yet the “Opening of the Eclipsed Covenant” is narrated rather than dramatized, keeping entry below 8.8.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Twilight and magnetic shimmer are lyrically anchored and, crucially, constrain the board’s final luminous pattern; however, spatial anchors are sparse, allowing fractional doubt.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—beauty in difficult silence—tightens as each tremor translates into potential sacrifice; Elias’s refusal-into-renunciation costs him his habitual distance, visibly paid when he hands the worry stone away.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Beauty wrestled from silence emerges through concrete images—gaps, pauses, tremors—rather than didactic statement; final re-patterning reframes the “covenant” without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Cadence is taut, syntax mirrors the chess tempo (“moved, then stopped”), and focalization remains locked in Elias’s seasoned hesitation; lyrical register is consistent and unstrained.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Lines are lean, musical, purposeful; occasional elevated diction like “regnant” edges purple but recedes before dulling the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The chess-as-silence metaphor feels inevitable yet fresh; the magnetic nexus re-purposed as living board avoids cliché and lands as a new synthesis.</comment>
