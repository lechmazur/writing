<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The balladeer’s contradictory impulse—yearning to give voice yet choosing silence—drives every beat; the bolt-plate burn and final rest symbol crystallize the cost of refusal. Interiority is embodied (“hands empty, throat raw”) rather than labeled. Only the grandmother memory drifts toward summary, keeping it just shy of 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the rest-symbol and plate-slam foreclose the ghost’s escape into him, with the courtyard’s scream and mist-inversion making the cost legible. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each chalk mark thickens pattern until the bolt-plate ruptures it. No orientation debt; anchors set by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The courtyard-as-server-room and mist-as-wet-silk are selective, not catalogued; the bolt-plate’s pulse and lantern flicker constrain the encoding choices. Micro-setting (ledge, slick cobbles) guides body placement and risk. Only the valley graffiti glow feels slightly tacked on, preventing 9+.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“translate or be consumed”—is signaled in the radio whisper and tightens when the ghost presses into his ribs. One decisive tightening: the spiral question → the rest-symbol refusal, paid for by seared palm and courtyard scream. Agency is clear; no external rescue.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of silence as both wound and weapon emerges through the bolt-plate inheritance and chalked rest-symbol; no explicit moralizing. Final image of the child reaching for chalk reweights the silence as legacy, not defeat. Grandmother parallel is earned, not asserted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise—“mist hung thick as wet silk,” “ghost in code”—with rhythmic control that accelerates during the plate-slam. Perceptual signature is consistent: sound-as-touch, color-as-temperature. Compression (“He wasn’t singing tonight”) teaches the pattern early.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; each image advances mood or stakes. No loops or scaffold. Minor register lift (“conceptual repricing” zone) in “chorus of screams wrapped in a lullaby” edges toward purple but serves the climax. Clean mechanics throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fusing folk-ballad cadence with cyber-ghost code is fresh; the bolt-plate as both flower press and firewall feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric compression pays off in the final silence. No derivative echoes; the child’s chalk epilogue is an earned inversion of the balladeer’s refusal.</comment>
