<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira’s contradictory impulses—guilt, calculation, and sudden protective instinct—are embodied in micro-choices (writing names, grabbing the girl’s wrist) that escalate to the final renunciation of her father’s ledger. The interiority is specific and character-bound, though the girl’s arrival feels slightly convenient rather than earned by prior causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The causal chain holds: stolen ledger → ink pot → erasure of debts → breach of rules → escape. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the ink’s dissolution of debt reweights the premise, and the cost is the blank ledger and Lira’s exile. One minor ellipsis (how the girl found the prep room) does not break causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The embalming table, ink pot, and mortuary paper are tactile, selective, and constrain choices; the pot’s serpent motif recurs to charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; the room softens under the ink’s spread, mirroring internal collapse. One brief white-room beat when the girl first enters is quickly corrected.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—twelve lives versus one ledger—tightens when Lira realizes the math is rigged against her. The ink’s liquefaction of names is the decisive turn that forecloses the old ledger-world and forces flight. Cost is visible: the blank ledger and permanent ink stains on her skin.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: the impossibility of “fair” trade in a system built on deceit. The ink’s erasure of debt becomes a resonant, non-literal answer—chaos as the only justice. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in the girl’s map and the uncounted future.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, tactile, and biased toward calculation and mortuary detail. Syntax tightens under pressure (“Black liquid surged… the room softened”). Dialogue is sparse but goal-driven; the girl’s line “You count what’s missing” crystallizes subtext. No POV drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence advances stakes or atmosphere. Figurative language is controlled (“ink… like sugar in tea”). No loops or scaffold. One mixed metaphor—“the pot’s serpent had no end”—is minor and thematically apt.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The con-artist’s child rewriting debt via magical ink is a fresh synthesis of noir and fabulism. The asylum frame grounds the fantasy in urgent stakes. The final reconfiguration—chaos as fairness—feels inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
