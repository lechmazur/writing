<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Liora’s interiority is textured and embodied; the contradictory pull between memory and present duty is dramatized in her micro-choice to hand the sea glass to the child. The final renunciation—passing the “pearl of stillness”—is earned and carries visible cost in the relinquishing of sole guardianship.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer thickens until the grotto’s mist recedes, crystallizing the Resonant Reconfiguration. Closure lands on the page when the girl’s fingers close around the glass, reweighting Liora’s lifetime of quiet tending into legacy.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The grotto’s serpentine walls and breathing mist are not backdrop; they press inward, guiding Liora’s polishing ritual and later sheltering the transfer of light. The sea glass itself becomes micro-setting that constrains the final choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to keep light without fire—tightens once when the child appears demanding apprenticeship. The cost is the surrender of exclusive custodianship, felt as Liora presses the warm shard into small hands.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of light-as-presence-not-consumption emerges through tactile ritual and inheritance rather than statement. The final image of two quiet keepers reframes the village’s bonfires as noisy failures without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet disciplined, with rhythmic control that mirrors the slow friction of polishing. Perceptual signature is consistent: Liora notices by texture, temperature, and withheld glow, never by generic sight.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but never purple; each sentence layers sensory and emotional information without redundancy. Metaphors (mist as serpent, glass as trapped storm) are precise and paid off in the closing exhalation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The inversion of fire-as-light into stillness-as-light feels fresh and inevitable; the grotto apprenticeship myth is specific to this coastal matrilineage. Risky lyric compression succeeds without obscuring causality.</comment>
