<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is vivid—her trembling fingers, the burn in her throat, the laugh that finally escapes—yet the shift from lifelong avoidance to decisive song feels slightly compressed; one more beat of embodied resistance would have sealed the arc at 9+. Still, her contradictory impulses (safety of stories vs. arbor’s need) play out in real time, and the cost of her renunciation of silence is palpable.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the living arch and Mira’s whispered promise reweight the premise with undeniable conceptual cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each image (brittle vines, plumping gourds, copper wings) layers density until the final flare. No orientation debt; causality is lyric but legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The arbor’s verdant dawn light, the copper-winged automaton, and the pulse in the soil are not mere backdrop; they constrain Mira’s choice to kneel, press palm to earth, and finally sing. The setting evolves causally—vines sag, then stir, then weave overhead—charging the final image with living architecture.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“the arbor dies if the last note fades”—is signaled early and tightened through Mira’s cracked first note to the final verse. One meaningful escalation: the vines’ audible unfurling narrows her option to finish the song despite throat-burn. Cost is visible and felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: the price of silence versus the generative risk of truth. The final image of Mira as “keeper of songs” offers a non-literal answer—no moralizing, only the charged poise of next year’s louder singing. Subtext hums in every rustling leaf.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lush yet disciplined: liquid gold, “brittle as old parchment,” “sound like stretching silk.” Syntax modulates with pressure—long lyrical lines yield to short gasps as Mira sings. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is Mira’s throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is almost loop-free; only “the scent of ripe earth filled the air, rich and deep…” edges toward redundancy. Otherwise, every sentence advances image or stakes. Metaphors are coherent and purposeful; rhythm breathes with the scene’s pulse.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Familiar tropes—dying land, forgotten songs—are transformed through Mira’s clockwork hummingbird and the arbor’s mechanical yet organic response. The synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight; risk lies in trusting lyric escalation to carry causality, and it pays off.</comment>
