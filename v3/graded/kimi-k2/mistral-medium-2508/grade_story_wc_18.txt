<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The mirror maker’s contradictory impulses—clinging to memory yet seeking erasure—are embodied in micro-choices (tracing the sextant, breathing the fog). His final renunciation of boundaries is earned by the tactile cost of dissolving the sextant and stepping through the sky-door. Interiority stays concrete; no diagnostic self-talk. Only the brother remains off-page, so relationship crucible is waived.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the sky becomes a door, reconfiguring the premise with undeniable conceptual cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each breath thickens pattern until the mirror shifts from blank to portal. Orientation is immediate; no drift. Causality is lyric but legible: breathing pattern → fog shapes → sextant liquefies → mirror opens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Frost, fog, and orchard are not backdrop; they press against skin, dictate breathing rhythm, and finally bear star-fruit that charges the exit image. Micro-setting (sextant, mirror) constrains every beat. Sensory hierarchy is POV-bound—cold brass, melting frost—never touristic. Spatial coherence is flawless; no impossible moves.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake: erase the boundary between earth and memory to rejoin the lost brother. Escalation is one deepening: fog thickens → sextant bends → mirror opens → sky becomes door. Each step narrows options until only dissolution remains. Cost is palpable: the sextant liquefies, the self disperses into starlight.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: boundaries are grief’s architecture; erasing them is both loss and reunion. The orchard’s star-fruit and the sky-door reweight the opening image of skeletal trees without moralizing. Subtext hums in silence and mirrored absence. Final image reframes “grounded” as another kind of flight—earned, not declared.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is crystalline, tactile, and rhythmically controlled: long sentences for fog, fragments for star-picking. Perceptual signature is artisanal—glass, frost, brass—never generic. Compression is taught early (“the fog that coiled…”) and paid off at the end. No POV leakage or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet limpid; every line does two jobs (“frost clung… like shattered glass” sets both texture and stakes). No loops, no mixed metaphors. Syntax modulates with pressure—breath units lengthen as the sextant dissolves. Final paragraph is artifact-free, propelling the leap.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Familiar grief-of-loss arc is reforged through glass-worker cosmology: mirrors that refuse reflection, sextants that liquefy into memory. The star-fruit orchard and sky-door feel inevitable yet unforeseen. Risk—lyric dissolution instead of confrontation—heightens stakes without gimmickry. Transformation test: could not swap tools or setting without collapse.</comment>
