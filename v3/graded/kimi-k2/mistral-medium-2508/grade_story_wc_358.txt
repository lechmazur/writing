<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Veyra’s interior contradiction—data-driven resolve vs. intuitive dread—is embodied in the frayed patch and the vibrating container; her micro-choice to strike the flare costs her the patch and the anemometer, foreclosing the old self. The moment she writes “Listen” crystallizes earned stasis with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the city’s adaptive wind system is revealed, Veyra’s stance shifts from documentation to listening, and the cost (lost patch, shattered instrument) is on the page. Causal lens holds—each beat tightens because the containers learn faster than she does.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The port’s silence, rust-streaked grates, and leaning containers are not backdrop; they constrain every move and charge the final image when the labyrinth exhales. Sensory detail is filtered through Veyra’s engineer gaze, grounding stakes in tactile metal and wind pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove the wind is intelligent—tightens when the anemometer shatters and the flare buys one heartbeat of stillness. Agency is her decision to run, then to listen; cost is the lost patch and the city’s faster adaptation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of human foresight versus adaptive systems emerges from the wind’s pulse and the containers’ lean; no moralizing, only the final word “Listen” reweights the premise with conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is precise yet haunted, mirroring an engineer’s data eye under dread; compression like “the wind screamed” and rhythmic control under pressure keep POV tight. No head-hopping, diction stays within Veyra’s lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and propulsive; each sentence advances stakes or atmosphere. No loops, mixed metaphors, or register drift; the final line “Listen” lands clean and resonant.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The living wind and adaptive container labyrinth feel fresh, not trope; the synthesis of meteorology and urban sentience is specific and inevitable in hindsight. Risk in treating the city as learning organism pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
