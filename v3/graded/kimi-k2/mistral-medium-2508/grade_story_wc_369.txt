<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is vivid and embodied—his stinging hands, the tear-tracked cheeks—but the final renunciation (returning the sorrow to the trees) is more asserted than dramatized; we see the choice but not the immediate cost on him, so the Earned Stasis feels slightly under-pressured.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the sextant’s grief is transferred, the labyrinth exhales, and Elias steps lighter. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each fragment’s pulse thickens the air until the final image reweights the premise. Cost is legible in the trees’ new weight and Elias’s emptied palms.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The tower, moonlit mortar, and oaks are not backdrop but active vessels; the crack in the north wall literally weeps dust, guiding Elias’s final act. Micro-setting (the workbench grid of brass shards) constrains his ritual and charges the ending.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to bear the sextant’s quantified sorrow—tightens once: from discovery to transfer. The pressure deepens as each loosened screw thickens the air, but the final beat is more release than trade-off, so the cost feels diffuse rather than sharply foreclosed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of sorrow’s transmutability emerges through concrete particulars: brass arcs, oaken rings, moonlit mortar. The final image—trees “heavy with stars”—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext in the labyrinth’s sighs and Elias’s hummed lullaby deepens the emotional aftereffect.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is tactile and lyric, with a perceptual signature rooted in stone dust and salt-fogged glass. Syntax modulates from long, breathing sentences to the clipped “He set the mirror down,” mirroring Elias’s shift from absorption to action. No head-hopping; compression is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive—“brass arms bent like a dying spider” does triple duty: image, mood, foreshadowing. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. Occasional elevated diction (“quantified sorrow”) is earned by context and never muddles clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The fusion of astronomer’s grief, living labyrinth, and arboreal absorption feels inevitable yet fresh. The sextant’s reincarnation as tree-ring memory is a non-obvious synthesis that reweights the entire premise. Risky lyric accumulation pays off in the final image without gimmickry.</comment>
