<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“her breath curling like ink”), but the dreamer’s contradictory impulses remain largely implied rather than dramatized in scene; the final renunciation is earned and carries felt cost, yet the confidence man’s off-stage presence limits relational crucible pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the watch’s theft of future moments is paid for by the dreamer’s decision to speak, reweighting the premise. Causal chain holds under Accumulative/Textural lens; one transition (library → waking desk) is clean and serves the deepening.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The glowing, mist-eaten library is rendered with selective sensory detail that constrains movement and choice; the watch as micro-setting object charges the final image when left on the sill, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“document the unspoken before the second letter erases regret”—is signaled early and tightens once when the second letter posts; the cost (library’s collapse, watch’s silence) is visible, though escalation is more atmospheric than causal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of speaking the unsaid emerges organically from the dreamer’s arc; the final image of the silent watch reweights earlier motifs without moralizing, achieving Conceptual Repricing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Distinct lyric texture—“ink bloomed beneath her skin”—maintains perceptual signature under pressure; purposeful elision (no dialogue) is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; only minor scaffold (“the mist pressed closer, hungry”) and no loops or mixed metaphors in peak beats; final paragraph crystallizes without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of epistolary regret and time-reversed cipher; the library of unspoken words feels inevitable yet non-obvious, with risk-taking (collapsing setting) that heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
