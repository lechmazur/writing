<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s interior contradiction—protective archivist vs. man still grieving his own unread file—drives every micro-choice; the trembling hands at the printer embody cost. The final act of mailing the packet renounces his habitual detachment, foreclosing the safety of emotional distance with visible, felt price. No stock therapy-speak; motives stay anchored in tactile objects and bodily reaction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elias chooses to intervene for the next file, accepting the ongoing ache of connection. Causal chain—button discovery → research → mailing → pivot to Maria—tightens options under an Accumulative/Textural lens; the final image crystallizes a reconfigured stance with undeniable cost. No orientation drift; time and place remain legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The file room’s sour-coffee air and yellowed paper constrain Elias’s movements and mood; the brass button functions as micro-setting that literally rolls onto the desk and later charges the final envelope. Sensory selection is POV-filtered and purposeful, never touristic. Environment shapes the choice to mail the packet—proximity to archives and discharge papers makes the act possible.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether Elias will keep observing or risk attachment—tightens once when the button forces a decision; the cost is the reopened wound of his own unread history. Escalation is a single deepening under Accumulative lens: each artifact adds weight until action becomes inevitable. No coincidence resolves the tension; agency remains Elias’s.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of “small kindness as resistance to institutional forgetting” emerges through objects and actions, never stated. The button’s journey from attic relic to mailed talisman reweights the premise without moralizing. Final image of Elias opening Maria’s file offers a resonant, non-literal answer: stories can be kept alive, but only at personal cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is precise, tactile, and consistent—Elias’s diction (“bureaucratic silt,” “contraband histories”) reflects archival precision and quiet grief. No head-hopping; psychic distance stays tight. Rhythm modulates with emotional pressure, accelerating during the cross-referencing, then settling into the deliberate cadence of the note.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and propulsive; every sentence advances story or atmosphere. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Sensory nouns and strong verbs (“ran his fingers along the spines,” “dust patterns settle like fallen snow”) carry double duty. Final paragraph’s shift to shorter sentences mirrors Elias’s resolve without syntactic monotony.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Foster-care archives as emotional battleground feels fresh; the button’s WWII provenance reframes a familiar lost-orphan trope into intergenerational haunting. Specificity of manila folders and Polaroids grounds the concept. Risky quiet ending pays off by recharging the opening image of unread files.</comment>
