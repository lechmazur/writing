<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is vivid—his hands “rough as bark,” the lacquer box “smooth from years of handling.” The curse of truth is embodied in the throat-burn moment before he speaks to the child. The final choice to plant the seed and accept disbelief carries felt cost. Minor slip: the father-to-son box history is summary, not dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration: the drones’ chaotic flight rewrites the city’s sensory map. Causal chain—riddle → seed → hive reboot—holds without gaps. Orientation is immediate: lightning tower, blackout, warm copper ribs. The final image of sunrise “wild” crystallizes the new stance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The tower’s copper ribs and ozone scent anchor every move; the lacquer box and seed function as micro-settings that constrain the climax. Spatial choreography is clean—ladder rungs cold, drones docking node. Environment guides choice: only the tower apex allows the seed insertion. No slips.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore wonder—tightens when Elias chooses to plant the Last Wonder despite fear of failure. Escalation is one decisive beat: seed into node → hive reboot → city gasps. Cost is visible: engineers will disbelieve, but the child’s grin proves the trade-off. No coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: routine starves wonder, uncertainty feeds it. Subtext in the child’s tug and Elias’s answer (“So we’d remember to look”) reframes blackout as invitation. No moralizing; the drones’ firefly dance is the non-literal answer. Resonance lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Voice is tactile and weathered—“boots scuffed from a decade of counting steps.” Sensory diction (“burnt sugar” ink) stays within Elias’s lexicon. Rhythm modulates: long reflective sentences, then clipped “Then another. And another.” No head-hopping; POV remains tight.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet textured: “hummed like a struck tuning fork” sets tone without overwriting. No loops or scaffold. Sentences advance both image and causality—“the air thick with the weight of something about to change.” Final line earns its lyric lift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: blackout as engineered invitation, drones as pollinators of wonder. The seed-as-relic and riddle-as-code feel inevitable, not contrived. Risk taken: quiet, non-violent climax that still reconfigures stakes. No derivative echoes.</comment>
