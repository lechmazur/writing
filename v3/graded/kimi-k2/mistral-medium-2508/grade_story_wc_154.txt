<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lena’s contradictory impulses—healer vs. survivor, innocence vs. shrewdness—are embodied in her tactile handling of coral and cast; the final gift of coral to the boy crystallizes her shift from translator to grafter with visible cost (aching ribs, relinquished talisman). Interiority is specific, never diagnostic. Only the boy’s pressure is on-page, so relationship crucible is minimal; this caps the score just below 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (mist, coral, smudges) thickens until the final image reweights grief as translatable. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Lena walks into the mist having foreclosed rest for herself and gifted the boy a new sentence. Cost is legible in the glowing smudges and her aching ribs. Orientation is anchored by dusk, atrium, bench within 120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The mist-clad atrium, coral fragment, and plaster cast function as micro-settings that constrain choices: the coral’s ridges ground Lena, the cast’s smudges demand decryption, the mist enfolds the final exchange. Sensory detail is selective and urgent—violet dusk, cool ankles, fogged breath. No spatial drift; props track cleanly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—grafting meaning onto irreparable loss—tightens when the boy appears and Lena must choose to give away her last anchor (coral). One meaningful deepening: from decoding static to authoring new static. Cost is the ache in her ribs and the emptied hand. Agency drives escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of translation-as-survival emerges through concrete acts: decoding crayon spirals, tracing negative space on a defaced photo. Final image of glowing smudges offers non-literal answer—grief can be re-inscribed, not erased. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in the siren beyond glass.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded in Lena’s perceptual signature—radio static as storm, coral grooves as memory. Syntax modulates with stress: longer coils for reflection, clipped fragments for pain. No head-hopping; boy’s speech is distinct and child-thin. Compression (“I unknot them”) is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and emotion without redundancy. Metaphors (bruise of violet, ivy like barbed wire) are precise and purposeful. No loops or scaffold; rhythm breathes with scene needs. Minor elevation in register (“labyrinthine grooves”) stays within Lena’s translator lexicon.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise—conflict-zone translator who decodes grief itself—is fresh and specific. Coral fragment reappears as memory-engine; smudged cast becomes palimpsest. Risky lyric structure pays off in final image. Transformation test: story collapses without these exact objects and voice.</comment>
