<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lena’s contradictory impulses—her hunger to decode versus her refusal to claim the chip—are embodied in micro-choices (drone claw, stilling fingers). The final hand-taking renounces prior isolation with visible emotional cost. Interiority is specific, never diagnostic. Minor slip: pilgrim’s backstory is summarized rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the constellation projects a shared sky, reweighting loneliness into connection. Causal chain—chip triggers door, door reveals map, map redefines belonging—holds under Accumulative/Textural lens. Cost is the forfeiture of sole possession. Orientation is immediate; no drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The observatory’s dusk light and stone seams physically constrain choices—only at this angle does the door open. Micro-setting (chip slot, drone shadow) functions as extension of character desire. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven: Lena notices tremors others miss. Final star pierces dome, charging image with cost.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—belonging versus solitude—tightens when Lena’s drone theft forecloses solitary decoding and forces shared witness. Escalation is one deepening: from solitary pursuit to mutual recognition. Cost is the loss of exclusive knowledge. Agency drives every beat; coincidence only reveals, never rescues.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of “missing pieces” emerges through concrete action: the chip is useless alone, the pilgrim incomplete without witness, the sky unfinished until two shadows merge. Final constellation offers non-literal answer—belonging is a shape, not a sound—without moralizing. Subtext in silence and starlight.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is perceptually specific—“brilliant dimness,” “indigo bruise”—and rhythm modulates with emotional pressure. No head-hopping; drone’s camera remains Lena’s proxy. Compression is taught early (“half-erased star trails”) and paid off in final circling drone. Distinct idiom sustained.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, vivid, propulsive; every line advances image or stakes. No loops, no mixed metaphors. “Stone beneath them groaned” is tactile and causal. Final sentence lands with crystallized cadence. Minor filter verb (“she felt it too”) does not dull closure.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: drone archaeology meets medieval pilgrimage, star trails as code, belonging as geometric shape. Risky lyric compression pays off in resonant closure. No stock tropes; even the chip’s symbols resist easy decoding. Specificity makes the premise irreplicable.</comment>
