<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lysan’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the half-mask and peripheral awareness feel lived-in. Her choice to endure rather than confront the prophet is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost in the final image. The contradiction between public mask and private honesty is dramatized in micro-choices, not labels. Minor slip: “strangely honest” is stated rather than fully embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Lysan’s refusal to fight the prophet forecloses direct confrontation and the cost—exhaustion, the clearing’s fragility—is legible in the final breath. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of sensory density and cadence shift reweights the stake. Orientation is anchored early; no causality breaks. One transition (kneel → stand) is clean.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The kinetic parapet functions as micro-setting: its warm metal curve constrains her posture and its song charges the final heartbeat image. Pavilion silk, dunes, and scent of crushed mint are selective and POV-filtered. Spatial choreography is coherent; no floating props. Environment subtly guides choice through tactile contact and peripheral awareness.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve the echo of wisdom against the prophet’s fire—is signaled early and tightened through sensory erosion. One meaningful deepening: the clearing’s borders blur, forcing her to act. Cost is felt in the parapet’s fading song and her own exhaustion. Agency is endurance; no coincidence resolves the tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: wisdom survives in peripheral silence, not proclamation. Subtext operates in gesture—the half-mask, the unspoken dialogue with the pavilion voice. Final image of the desert remembering offers resonant, non-literal closure without moralizing. No thematic drift; complexity embraced.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet controlled; perceptual signature is distinct (“peripheral awareness,” “second heartbeat”). Syntax modulates with pressure—long breaths versus clipped final line. No head-hopping; POV remains tight to Lysan. Dialogue is minimal but subtext-rich; silence carries weight.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; every sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. Metaphors are fresh and coherent (“storm before the clouds gather”). No loops or scaffold; rhythm varies naturally. Minor elevated diction (“consecrate,” “kinetics”) fits the elevated register without drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: desert mysticism meets kinetic relics, filtered through a half-masked line walker. Tropes are transformed—prophet as fire, wisdom as peripheral echo. Specificity anchors universals; the kinetic parapet is irreplaceable. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
