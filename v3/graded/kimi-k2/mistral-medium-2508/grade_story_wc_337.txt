<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias’s interior contradiction—restorer vs releaser—drives every micro-choice; the moment he lets the needle drop embodies the cost of renouncing his inherited role. Embodied emotion (“rough with disuse”) and the bracelet of threads mark a visible, irreversible change. The flaw (belief in mending) complicates the climax and is confronted, not balanced away.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the net dissolves, spirits rise, and Elias becomes “a door,” a reconfiguration that forecloses the path of restoration. Causality is accumulative/textural—each knot unraveled tightens the silence until the final release. Cost is legible in the shattered prisms and the town’s fogged mirrors. Orientation is clear by line 3; no ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary’s fractured light is not backdrop; its shattering under pressure literalizes the conceptual cost of release. The net itself functions as micro-setting, its knots constraining every motion until they give way. Sensory detail is selective—salt, kelp, starlight—filtered through Elias’s tactile craft. The final image of silver water recharges the opening starlight.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to bind or free the drowned—tightens once: the last knot. Elias’s agency drives the escalation; no coincidence resolves it. The cost (loss of the town’s illusion of peace) is visible in the fogged mirrors and unlatched doors. One decisive deepening suffices and lands.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the refusal to “fix” what must be let go; the interlaced hush shifts from curse to gift. Subtext lives in gesture—threads as shackles, then bracelets. The final image of spirits “pulling him through” offers a non-literal answer without moralizing. Complexity lingers: blessing and haunting are the same act.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded in craft: “spider’s patience,” “salt of forgotten tides.” Syntax breathes with pressure—long sentences for accumulation, fragments at climax. No head-hopping; POV stays locked to Elias’s perception. Dialogue is sparse, subtextual, and advances the turn.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; every image does double work (e.g., “fractured rainbows” foreshadow shattering). No loops or scaffold; rhythm modulates with tension. Metaphors stay coherent within maritime/craft lexicon. Final line “Then the tide turned” lands clean, propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of net-mending and spirit-release feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Familiar tropes—restorer, sanctuary, ghosts—are transformed through tactile specificity and the refusal of heroic repair. Risky lyric compression pays off in the final reconfiguration. No close echoes; voice is singular.</comment>
