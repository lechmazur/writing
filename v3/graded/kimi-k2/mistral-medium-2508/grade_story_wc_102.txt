<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Elias’s contradictory drive—questing to locate lost love yet fearing the memory that delivers it—remains embodied in the jade test and micro-choice to press it to his chest. Interiority is richly sensorial and specific, the prior-life as plague physician and masked failure grounding his present stance. The final renunciation—turning the camera away from recording to carrying the reclaimed love—pays off with on-page cost: the jade vanishes into weightlessness, his laugh a felt after-shock. Secondary “woman with hands outstretched” is more projected memory than active agent, so relationship pressure is implied rather than enacted.</comment>

<comment>Closure is earned reconfiguration under a Causal/Accumulative hybrid: the memory ruptures when Elias breathes against the jade, foreclosing the option to merely observe and redirecting him to custody instead of discovery. Linkage from twilight images of drifting embers → camera obscura → vanishing jade → new keeper stance is causal yet lyrical. Cost is legible in the literal loss of the charm and the audible humming of the viaduct stones. The final child-shadow projects future recursion without diluting present arc.</comment>

<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The viaduct’s spine-stones, twilight fog, wet-jasmine air, and petal-hazed arches cohere into a single micro-setting that constrains Elias’s next choice: the arch where he kneels and the river where embers rise force the switch from witness to custodian. Sensory selection (scent of iron rain, camera brass warming his palm) is character-filtered, never decorative. Recurring breath-images (petal-breath, breath as silver thread) evolve meaningfully and tie the closure image of inhaled embers. Spatial anchoring (central arch, moss shard, camera angle) remains internally consistent without exposition dump.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—“where unused love goes”—is signaled in the second sentence and intensifies until the live reconfiguration; no secondary dilution. Escalation moves from chase → contact → revelation → renunciation as each breath test reduces Elias’s options and redefines agency: he must carry instead of catalogue. Cost is the irretrievable surrender of the jade and the newly opened, endless vigil the child’s shadow requests. No resolving coincidence; all progression roots in his micro-choices under the chosen lens.</comment>

<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges seamlessly: love not lost but archived, healing as memory reclaimed and transported rather than repaired. Subtext carries in tactile gesture—jade pressed to sternum, camera turned from sky to face an unasked question—avoiding overt statement. Final image of embers ascending to living lungs resonates an ethical and emotional aftereffect without didacticism. Ambiguity (is she real or mnemonic?) deepens rather than confuses. No late meta-commentary undercuts resonance.</comment>

<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is controlled, lyric compression that teaches its pattern early (photographer of edge-images) and sustains cadence under pressure. Perceptual signature persists: selective attention to temperature of brass, taste of wet iron, sonic feel of breathing. POV stays locked; no head-hop to the woman; “her voice the sound of petals unfurling” is focalized through Elias’s perception of memory. Rhythmic modulation—longer exhalation of revelation, clipped inhalation of decision—tracks emotional arc. Register remains grounded: no forced elevation into pseudo-poetic diction.</comment>

<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is vivid and efficient: “stones hummed,” “jade…burned, then weightless,” high information density without scaffolding. Minor lyric overgrowth appears in a few adjacent clauses (“twilight’s violet haze…damp air…wet earth and something older”) but resolves into sensory payoff that drives the choice under the viaduct. Sentence variety controlled; no loops or synonym stacks. Opening line anchors lens and stakes; closing image—“river’s embers rose like fireflies, drawn to the breath of the living”—recharges motif cleanly.</comment>

<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Premise transforms familiar quest myth into fresh custodial stance: the pilgrim does not retrieve love but becomes its vessel. Memory-as-plague angle feels newly particular, not stock. Camera obscura as spiritual kinetoscope is clever yet grounded, integrated into the central metaphor. Risky second-silhouette device justified by memory frame, not gimmick. Conceptual risk deepens stakes without losing clarity. Transformation test: story would collapse if Elias were merely amnesiac lover; occupational and ethical specificity keeps generic at bay.</comment>
