<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s guilt is embodied in the brass cuff, the watch hand, and the driftwood; his micro-choice to hurl the hand and accept tomorrow’s summons crystallizes a credible renunciation with visible cost. Interiority is specific—memory clings to objects, not minds—but the final beat leans slightly on abstract “weight of withheld truth” rather than a fresh contradiction, capping the score just below 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elias’s decision to meet Harkin tomorrow forecloses the path of perpetual erasure and carries the felt cost of seven years’ evasion. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each sensory layer (cobalt tiles, driftwood, surf) tightens the pattern until the note reweights everything. One causal hiccup: the paper’s appearance is pure coincidence, but it complicates rather than resolves, so the lens remains intact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The cobalt terrace, driftwood bones, and watch hand function as micro-setting that constrains Elias’s movements and charges the final image; the sea’s whisper and the splitting wood literalize the siege of hush. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered, though “bruise beneath the dusk” edges purple. Environment actively shapes the choice to discard the hand and retrieve the note.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—atonement versus continued erasure—is signaled early and tightens when the note forces a live choice. Pressure escalates through pattern accumulation rather than causal reversals; the final beat narrows options to confrontation or perpetual flight. Cost is felt in the hurling of the watch hand and the trembling paper, though the escalation is more atmospheric than visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: the cost of manufactured memory and the impossibility of unspeaking truth. Subtext resides in objects—the watch hand, the driftwood, the unmarked paper—rather than exposition. Final image of Elias walking into the dark reweights the premise without moralizing, achieving resonant ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is textured, rhythmic, and character-specific: “the siege of hush” and “driftwood bones” reveal Elias’s forensic, guilt-soaked perception. Compression and elision are purposeful and paid off at closure. No dialogue, so no voice contamination; POV remains stable and internally coherent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is selective and pattern-taught. Minor purple tinge in “bruise beneath the dusk” and “cobalt terrace stretched” but never muddles causality. No loops, no scaffold, high information density; the final paragraph’s cadence shift earns the score.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Premise—black-market genealogist who erases bloodlines—feels fresh and is grounded in tactile detail. The siege-of-hush concept and object-memory linkage avoid cliché. Risk lies in the near-lyric mode, but it heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Slight deduction for driftwood-as-message device edging toward contrivance.</comment>
