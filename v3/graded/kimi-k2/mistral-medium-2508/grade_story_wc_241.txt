<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lila’s contradictory impulses—obedience vs. risk—are dramatized in the lantern choice; the final leap is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost (“her palms stinging”). Interiority is concrete, embodied, and character-specific, though the father remains off-page, limiting relational crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Lila steps into the woven light, reconfiguring her stance toward chance and responsibility. Causal linkage holds (subway scrawl → library → lantern → leap) with felt cost. Orientation is anchored early; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The rainwashed library and fractured mica pane constrain choice (blue vs. gold path) and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective, POV-filtered, and evolves with action; micro-setting (lantern) functions as setting.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to risk widening perspective—tightens through the lantern choice and leap. Escalation is causal: each scrawl narrows options until the final contradiction forces stance crystallization with visible cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from Lila’s wager against her father’s certainty; the ending’s non-literal answer (“pulse of a world where luck wasn’t a lie”) reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture and image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, lyric, and consistent; perceptual signature (“smelled like rain on hot pavement”) is character-bound. Compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure. No dialogue, so no voice leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is purposeful and patterned. No loops or scaffold; rhythm modulates with pressure. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing”) fits POV’s academic heritage.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of probability theory and magical realism; the lantern-as-portal feels inevitable in hindsight. Specific details (burnt-clover scent, mica reflections) create memorable texture. Risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
