<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lena’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her shaking hands, the patch pressed to her chest—but the final surrender reads slightly abstract; we feel the cost more in concept than in body. The contradiction between duty and love is present, yet the pivot from detachment to self-erasure could be sharper on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the archive’s silence after the data flood reframes the entire premise. The causal chain—numbers → server location → crystal extraction → deletion flag—is tight, and the cost (her termination) is legible in the final line.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The archive’s “ghost-light” and recursive “echo of forgotten songs” are textured and specific; the micro-setting of Server Farm 26-9-418 physically constrains her final move. Sensory hierarchy narrows to the vibrating patch, charging the last image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recovering the erased—escalates from curiosity to existential risk. The single tightening beat (crystal upload) forecloses retreat and triggers the termination flag; the price is unmistakable.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of memory vs erasure emerges through action: each restored file is a small rebellion. The final silence is a resonant, non-moralizing answer—what survives is the song, not the singer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Voice is sleek, corporate-cold yet haunted; diction like “data graves” and “algorithmic star” fits the POV. Compression is taught early (“archive hummed like a dying star”) and paid off in the final hush. No head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; metaphors are consistent and purposeful. One minor loop—“the archive was silent / the archive shuddered”—but it occurs mid-scene and does not dull the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The fusion of corporate data-erasure with personal grief feels fresh; the recursive number motif and “echo of forgotten songs” transform familiar sci-fi tropes into an intimate elegy. Risky structural compression pays off.</comment>
