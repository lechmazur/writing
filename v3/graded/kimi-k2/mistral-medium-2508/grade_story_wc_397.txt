<question>1</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Lior’s contradictory impulses (rumination vs. reflexive rescue) play out in present-tense beats; her quiet renunciation of suicide feels earned because the dog’s nuzzle and the etched-steel talisman charge the parasol tip’s closure. Flawed interiority is particular to Iceland’s ice hum, not therapy-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question>
<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Causal lens holds from ice-walk tension to final listening beat; the unseen overnight change reframes stakes without showing totality, landing a Charged Poise where patience folds into solace; cost is the postponed clinic and the soaked future she now stays for.</comment>

<question>3</question>
<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>marina plates groaning under hull, salt-rain scent, silver parasol divining ice thickness—details pressure choice and embed POV; ice thickness tested for the dog route is irreplaceable; some broader Icelandic cues remain functional but not unique.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—postpone the booked appointment—narrows each interim choice; ice splits force the real crossing whose success reweights survival and forecloses suicide path ending; stakes stay legible without external coincidences.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from patience folding into solace: lace silver recharged from heirloom talisman to lens re-pricing; no tidy moral, the final image—windborne salt she pictures staying for slow drift—reweights endings matter. Emotional specificity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Distinct perceptual signature—ice hummed like a held breath—pervades interiority; compression under pressure when she tests ice with parasol tip; voice stays coherent through chill, fissure, and earned laugh; no explanatory omniscience.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with scene intensity—short staccato during ice-walk, longer undulations as white hush settles; dense sensory nouns leave zero redundancies; minor filter-verb hiccup (“realized finally”) capped at −0.2.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Lyric drift-ice rescue reframes euthanasia-travelogue trope into quiet renunciation; risk is pivoting on unseen overnight change yet delivered charged poise; final image reconfigures “endings matter” lace miraculously without gimmick.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>6.1</grade>
<comment>Initial contemplation of clinic cancellation is early signal; the ice-walk choice cancels the appointment—beat involvement prepares the delayed closure—but interior cost could be sharper mid-scene.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Parasol tip divines safe passage to the dog, reappears etched with “E.M.”—chaining two beats plus closure; its silver reweights the grandfather’s motto; minor diffusion as final talisman rather than direct instrument.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Fold in patience embodied as Lior testing each step across ice and choosing to stay; transforms her suicidal want, but concept echoed more than enacted in every beat.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>5.0</grade>
<comment>“Grips reality loosely” allows ice-walk confidence yet manifested only in label and warrant for risk rather than visible trade-offs under physical paucity.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Trawling for stories defines initial entrance, stakes the delayed clinic appointment, and seeds the ice lesson; still could be rephrased to “volunteer observation” without breaking causal spine.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>5.2</grade>
<comment>Disaster volunteer displacement is signaled early and frames daily tasks but does not pressure the climax choice—used more as backdrop than constraint.</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Drift-ice marina pressure choice via plank tests and hull groans—actual ice thickness gates action; ambient description tapers utility after dog rescue.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>5.8</grade>
<comment>Overnight change anchors narrative time but not tracked as live tension; instead used as pre-scene setup; later same-day beats utilize present urgency.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Want to “learn the sound” is explicitly dramatized by final silence-listening beat; choice to stay versus euthanasia exposes friction between want and survival hope.</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Windborne solace modulates from hush to salt breeze, echoing in final listening; tone syncs with ice’s crystalline patience and works toward closure.
