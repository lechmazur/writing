<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Veyne’s guilt-driven recklessness and concrete embodiment (“second skin” of the scent) are vivid; interiority is character-specific and escalates to the climactic song, earning renunciation with visible cost on-page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The hybrid Situational/Accumulative lens holds: the oath translations split the kingdom (setup), pressure tightens as torches approach, and the restored chorus reconfigures meaning—closure arrives via resolute song with felt cost of her voice.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Archive scent, decaying scrolls, and vibrating ink-shard function as micro-setting tools that literally constrain tactics and power the final Chorus, grounding stakes in tangible specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—restoring broken promises before dawn—looms from torchlight arrival; the tightening, charged song at climax narrows options and reconfigures trust at high cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>The chorus of promises as living language reconfigures the premise without sermon: trust is not stated but sung into legibility, culminating in a quiet yet resounding reweighting of every vow kept or broken.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Distinct lyrical cadence (violets/decay, careful recklessness) under tight POV; purposeful compression teaches the Chorus pattern; the narrator’s voice remains singular and rhythmically alive under peak pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>No loops or scaffold; vivid sensory specificity (“copper rain,” “indigo mist weaving light”) accelerates tension; metaphor never muddies crucial choices or the final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: extinct language re-spoken as living promise, symphonic truth as bridge—retains emotional heft without gimmickry; risk heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
