<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias’s color-blindness and plant-language are embodied in tactile choices; the dandelion “awaken” and thorn “patience” are micro-decisions that cost him vulnerability. Liora’s shift from listener to co-author is legible in shoulder-brush and hand-squeeze. The old woman’s bargains externalize stakes without exposition. Interior contradiction—fear of silence vs. need to speak—drives every beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each sensory layer (embers, basil, cracked vase, reed tongue) reweights the stake until the final concertina note crystallizes “imperfect beauty” with felt cost—the debt of two paintings. Orientation is anchored in first 60 words; no causality breaks. Closure is Charged Poise: options narrowed to “stay,” cost is the owed art and exposed heart.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Courtyard’s residual heat, kiln crack, and moonlit ash form a micro-setting that constrains every choice: the kiln’s flaw decides the vase’s fate, the embers dictate when they can speak. Sensory hierarchy favors touch and scent over sight, consistent with Elias’s POV. Final image of dandelion seeds catching wind recharges the ash motif.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding voice without color—tightens through escalating plant-messages and the broken reed; each exchange with Liora raises the cost of silence. The decisive tightening is Elias’s choice to teach, foreclosing solitary safety. Cost is explicit: two paintings owed, emotional exposure sealed by hand-squeeze.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of imperfect beauty emerges from cracked vase, wheezing concertina, and color-blind sight; never stated, always enacted. Subtext in plant lexicon and unspoken debts. Final image of seeds aloft reweights earlier ash without moralizing. Complexity lingers: beauty is loss, loss is beginning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyric compression taught early (“embers flickering… like trapped fireflies”) and sustained; POV remains tactile and synesthetic. Distinct cadence—long breaths for reflection, staccato for plant choices. No head-hopping; old woman’s voice is filtered through Elias’s perception. Dialogue sparse, subtextual (“Again” carries multitudes).</comment>

<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence layers scent, texture, or sound. “Concertina’s wheeze more melody than discord” does triple work. Metaphors are precise (reed tongue = pulse/promise). Rhythm modulates with emotional pressure; no overwriting in peak beats. Clean mechanics throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Color-blind painter using plant-language to court amid phoenix ash feels fresh yet inevitable. Tropes (phoenix, cracked vase) are inverted: rebirth is quiet, flaw is perfection. Synthesis of mythic and intimate scales without gimmickry. Risky lyric density pays off in closure image.</comment>
