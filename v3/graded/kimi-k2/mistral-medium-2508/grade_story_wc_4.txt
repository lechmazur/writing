<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The archivist's interior contradiction is embodied in the soft "boots barely disturbing," the gentle theft of lavender, and the weight shift from "ache" to "promise." Yet the final micro-choice—the shutter click—reads more symbolic than felt, so the cost is visible but not viscerally stinging.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>A textbook accumulative/textural arc: each handled photograph, lavender sprig, and vine adds layer until the final photo becomes the Charged Poise. The pattern is taught early, then fulfilled with undeniable conceptual cost as the town's collective memory is re-stitched into a new constellation of guidance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lavender field and rusted fence function as living archive and breathing wound, constraining where she can stand and composing the final shot. The vines' slow climb subtly anchors the "thirty years ago" without exposition; the sensory palette is selective and purposeful, never catalogued.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The single dominant stake—collective grief reframed into bearable memory—tightens each time she handles an artifact or waits for light. No false reversals: every beat either adds density or crystallizes the final constellation; the cost is the shared exposure in the bakery’s window.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of transformation-through-witness emerges strictly from particulars: the shift from lunch-pail to dough-stained hands, from whistle to shutter click. No explicit moral; the final photograph stands as non-literal answer, reweighting ruin into guidance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice glimmers with quiet compression: "a breath held too long," "metal bones half-swallowed." Focalization stays tight; pronouns and temporal stance consistent. Lyric patterns are taught early then fulfilled at closure—purposeful, not ornamental.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sentences do multi-duty: lavender scent foreshadows the final light, vines and shadows compose the closing image. No loops, no redundant scaffolding; the rhythm breathes exactly where stakes are highest without dragging.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The premise—photographer as archivist of collective pain using pre-existing photographs—feels fresh because the execution grounds it in tactile detail: crushed iron scent, lunch pail, butterfly. The "masterpiece" idea risks cliché, but is rescued by specificity.</comment>
