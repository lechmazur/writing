<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lena’s interior contradiction—scientist vs. keeper of ancestral memory—drives every micro-choice; the final step onto the road is earned by eleven years of embodied ritual and visible loss of the atlas page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each fragment layers until the pattern break (road revealed) reweights reality; closure is a Charged Poise—Lena’s first step carries undeniable conceptual cost as the station dies behind her.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The station’s tide gauges, the warm barnacled stones, the dissolved ink in seawater—all constrain choice and charge the final image; micro-setting (the road itself) becomes the decisive arena.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“why some paths disappear”—tightens through each rhythmic tap; the final depth-zero reading and wading out force a trade-off between safety and revelation, cost legible on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of memory vs. erasure emerges from the concrete fragments; the ending’s non-literal answer (paths wait to be re-called) reweights prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature—scientific precision braided with mythic cadence; rhythmic control mirrors rising tension; no head-hopping, diction stays within Lena’s lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High information density, zero loops, figurative language purposeful; “ink running like tears” lands because it recharges the atlas motif at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of climate grief and folk magic; the “eternal tides” concept feels inevitable yet non-obvious; risk-taking (road beneath vanished ocean) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
