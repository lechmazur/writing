<comment>Elias’s interiority as a stoic undertaker is convincingly embodied and threaded through salt-cracked hands, anemone-light, and micro-choice to swim the lighthouse. Stubbornness shows in the quiet decision to *add his own name* at the end, a renunciation that carries cost and satisfies the Earned Stasis test. However, the interior contradiction between “didn’t believe in signs” and immediate conviction by bone-deep vibration remains slightly under-examined in scene, keeping it from 9+.</comment>

<comment>Closure is CR: the final ledger gesture reweights the central theme—rest is acknowledgment, not escape—with visible conceptual cost. Cause-to-effect holds (lens warmth → climb → stillness signal → restored dead → accepting self-name) under the hybrid lens that becomes Textural/Resonant at the end. The one micro-turn (adding his name) crystallizes stakes without contradiction.</comment>

<comment>The waterlogged library dome, the tidal stairs, the kelp-choked lighthouse rungs—every physical contour directly constrains Elias’s vertical choices and final lens assembly, charging the stillness image. Salted books and bioluminescent jars feel inventoried yet selective, never mere postcard.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—the obligation to grant the dead durable rest—tightens through one clear intensification: the lens’s warm pulse forcing the night swim. Pressure crystallizes rather than cascades; cost is the swim itself and the final inscription, sufficient for this word span.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</comment>
<comment>Theme—that rest is not cessation but acknowledgment—emerges from the specific texture of drowned ledgers and luminous anemones without ever stating a moral. Subtext carried by the ledger accepting Elias’s own name provides a resonant, non-literal closure free of the echo penalties.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</comment>
<comment>Consistent salt-stung lyricism: “ghostly blue of deep water,” “pulse slow, like the breath of a sleeping beast.” Perceptual signature remains anchored to Elias’s undertaker tactility; no POV drift or explanatory padding. Rhythm accelerates on the climb and breathes into stillness at the lens activation.</comment>

<comment>Lines carry dual freight—“cracked from salt and sorrow” performs characterization and texture simultaneously. Minimal redundancy; “pulse” returns three times but each reprise reweights the living anemone motif, earning the repetition. Strong variation in sentence shapes: short hammering verbs during climb, elongated hush at the end.</comment>

<grade>8.4</comment>
<comment>Inverting the drowned-apocalypse trope into a requiem for *ledgers* and lenses feels sharply specific. The image of an undertaker’s pen writing himself into the dead catalog achieves a fresh conceptual repricing absent cliché; risk is measured and paid off.</comment>
