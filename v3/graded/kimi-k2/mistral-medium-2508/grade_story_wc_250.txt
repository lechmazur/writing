<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The Listener’s interiority is conveyed through embodied action—mirror tilts, shutter rhythms—rather than labels; her renunciation of speech and final smile carry visible cost. The boy’s shame is shown in trembling hands and hitched breath, not told. Both characters remain distinct and flawed; the father’s off-stage shift is credibly implied. Only the father’s interior arc is off-page, keeping the cap below 8.8.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the mirror’s starlight reweights the boy’s shame into acceptance, and the father’s silent placement of the mirror the next day crystallizes the cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—patterns of light/dark build density until the final image reconfigures meaning. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no causality breaks. Cost is legible in the boy’s steadier steps and the father’s unclenched shoulders.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The cobalt dock’s slick planks, fogged canal, and lantern glow constrain movement and visibility, shaping the mirror’s reflections. The dental mirror itself becomes micro-setting, its silvered surface dictating where light can fall. Weather and spatial choreography remain coherent; no static postcard shots. Dock and mirror jointly charge the final image, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will the boy release his shame?—is signaled early and tightened when the guardian’s light-patterns force him to kneel and see the stars. One meaningful deepening suffices; no reversals required. Cost is visible in the boy’s lighter pockets and steadier gait. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; coincidence does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: empathy as reflection rather than speech. The mirror’s starlight offers a non-literal answer—“darkness isn’t the absence of stars”—without moralizing. Subtext operates in the boy’s whispered “He used to tell me their names.” Final image reweights prior material with conceptual cost; no tidy moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise: “the canal’s breath fogged the air,” “fractured star.” Syntax mirrors the guardian’s spiraling calm; no head-hopping. Dialogue is sparse, subtextual, and goal-driven. Distinct perceptual signature sustained under pressure; elision of speech is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid: every sentence advances image or stakes. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Rhythm modulates with pressure—short pulses during mirror flashes, longer breaths in aftermath. Zero artifacts in closure beat; high information density without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—silent empath uses dental mirror and starlight to heal shame—is fresh, non-obvious, and fully committed. Tropes of magical mentor and prodigal son are transformed through tactile specificity: stolen nails, fogged mirror, shutter rhythms. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
