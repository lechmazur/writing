<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lian’s interiority is embodied and specific; the trembling fingers, scars, and pulse-press anchor her fear and desire. The contradiction between fear of crystallization and the need to carve runes is dramatized in the moment she presses the quill to her wrist. The final choice—shedding the tip into her scar—earns the transformation because earlier beats link scars to flawed glass and stories. Cost is visible: the quill is now tip-less, the scar sings, and the storm is unwritten.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the rune blooms, the scar becomes light, and the platform descends with felt cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each image (quill, frost, feather) layers density until the final cadence shift. Orientation is clear by line 4; no drift. The grandmother’s superstition is seeded early and paid off when Lian whispers the rune’s true name, tightening the pattern.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The floating rock, mist, and residual rain are vivid but selective; every detail (worn edges, ozone scent) filters through Lian’s urgency. The platform itself constrains choice—its slow descent forces the final act before the storm returns. Micro-setting (quill, feather, scar) functions as setting when the crystallized tip and feather become new tools. Weather evolves causally, mirroring internal shift.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—transform scars into stories before the storm—signaled in paragraph 6. Escalation is accretive: each rune attempt raises the cost of failure (crystallization). The decisive tightening occurs when the quill sheds its tip; this forecloses retreat and redefines the scar as ink. Cost is legible in the tip-less quill and the singing scar.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the tension between memory as wound and memory as bridge. The grandmother’s whisper reweights from superstition to lived truth without moralizing. Final image—rain as welcome, not warning—reconfigures the premise non-literally. Subtext operates in the crow’s gift and the feather’s sharp edge.</comment>

<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; syntax lengthens under calm, compresses under pressure (“She laughed, the sound dissolving…”). Perceptual signature is consistent—selective attention to texture, temperature, scent. No head-hopping; POV remains interior to Lian. Diction stays within her scholarly lexicon; no register drift.</comment>

<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and consequence. No loops or scaffold; metaphors (scars like flawed glass, onion heart) are specific and coherent. Rhythm modulates with stakes—short clauses at climax, longer breaths during reflection. No artifacts in closure beat.</comment>

<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of rune magic, scar-as-story, and meteorological pause feels inevitable yet non-obvious. The crow quill and feather transform familiar symbols into active agents. Risk is taken in the lyric structure, but coherence is maintained. The premise would collapse if any element were generic.</comment>
