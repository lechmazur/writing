<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Veyra’s interiority is vivid—her pulse-synced blooms, the gear’s weight in her palm—but the memory-for-transit trade is declared rather than dramatized; we feel the loss conceptually, not viscerally. Still, her contradictory impulses (preserve vs. share) act simultaneously in the final beats, and the choice forecloses return with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the gear’s last stilling reweights the premise—light can travel without burn—while the sacrificed memory is the felt price. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern density increases until the cadence shift at “the pattern broke,” reconfiguring meaning without causal reversals.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The nebula garden is never backdrop; its petals constrain movement and supply the resonant medium the gear manipulates. Micro-setting—the gear’s brass worn smooth—functions as tactile anchor and final image charger. Spatial coherence is flawless; the transit bridge emerges from the same luminous physics already established.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—share light without fire—tightens once when the gear demands a memory fragment, forcing a trade-off. Escalation is a single deepening under Accumulative lens: each sonar ping adds luminous thread until the path solidifies and the old cycle is foreclosed. Cost is legible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the tension between preservation and transmission; the final image of “a new garden that did not fear the dark” reweights the ancestor’s borrowed-light ethic without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture—the gear’s stilling, the unlooked-back final petal—rather than statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is crystalline, lyrical yet precise: “petals of ionized gas drifting in the slow gravity of forgotten stars” teaches the pattern early and sustains it. Syntax modulates with pressure—short clauses at the transit step, longer breaths in reflection—without ever losing coherence. No head-hop; POV remains locked to Veyra’s perceptual signature.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence layers image, emotion, and world-rule. No loops, no mixed metaphors, no register drift. The final cadence—“the gear stilled at last, its work done”—lands clean, crystallizing the closure image without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The premise—light shared through resonance instead of combustion—is fresh, and the generational-cycle twist feels inevitable once revealed. Risky lyric compression pays off: the nebula as both cradle and cage, the memory-for-transit barter. Specificity throughout prevents any sense of template.</comment>
