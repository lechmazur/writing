<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’ interior contradiction (duty vs fear) is vividly embodied—shaking hands, cold fingers—yet the final choice (“sketch the pattern of his own fear… bury it beneath the oldest tree”) relies more on mystic inertia than on decisive agency; cost is atmospheric rather than palpably renounced. Interior texture is specific, but the hinge identity never challenges his competence beyond mood. No relationship or status pressure is tested on-page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density layers (wax shaving, prophecy, garden memory) tighten until the final charged poise of listening buries a latent future. On-page closure crystallizes as Elias seals the future inside roots—conceptual cost of becoming the hinge accepted—but the escalation stays almost wholly tonal; no causal choice narrows options after the voice speaks.</comment>

<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The rooftop orchard is alive as constraint: pear roots hold centuries of vows, wind carries subway hum, elevation exposes choice to weather. Specific tool-object (wax shaving) and living micro-setting (each tree as living archive) reconfigure the final image directly.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Single clear stake—preserve emotional patterns—signaled early; pressure deepens as accidental prophecy threatens the archive itself. Lacks a discrete decision or visible loss; instead, the deepening mood forecloses passive silence as the only option. Coherent under Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of memory-as-archive and time-as-wound emerges through pear trees, phonograph ghosts, and Elias as hinge; ambiguity lingers without moral. Final image (Elias listening) reweights earlier motifs rather than preaching. A hairline drift toward oracular summary in the Akkadian verse costs it the final 0.2.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person close stays velvety, hushed, specific to Elias’s lexicon: “salt-thick,” “tongue numbed by dead syllables,” rhythm pulsing with fog-muted city heartbeat. No perceptual leakage; lyric compression is taught early, paid off in final stillness.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is textured, taut, and propulsive—every clause advances image or pressure. One mixed metaphor (“brittle as old bone” layered with “root breaking stone”) grazes clarity without derailing. Near flawless cadence control with only a faint loop in “Elias would listen” echoed twice; caps the score just beneath 9.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Transforms the trope of archive-keeper by fusing antique phonograph to living rooftop grove, turning wax ghosts into subterranean prophecy roots. The synthesis feels inevitable, the risk deliberate—no market-ready urban-fantasy cliché survives this graft.</comment>
