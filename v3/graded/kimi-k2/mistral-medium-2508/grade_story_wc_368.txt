<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied; the heart’s foreign rhythm and the ache in the market square anchor motive. Micro-choices—pinning the wing, painting the first stroke—are character-specific and escalate stakes. Final renunciation (silence as invitation) is earned and carries felt cost. Minor slip: traveler’s “watchful” label is slightly abstract.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the silence in the tea house becomes an invitation, reweighting the entire quest. Causal chain holds—wing → ink → village epiphany → return—each beat tightening options. Cost is legible in dissolved wing and burnt arms. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Floating rock, mist, and colored-glass lanterns are selective and atmospheric. Tea-house beams groaning underfoot and dye shimmering like the wing integrate setting with action. Final mist-thickened silence recharges earlier valley imagery. Could use one more tactile detail to hit 9+.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—why stories magnetize people—signaled early and tightened through each village painting session. Escalation is accumulative: each dyed revelation costs pigment, stamina, and ultimately the wing itself. Agency remains with the dye master; no coincidence resolves the arc.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: stories fill the cracks in people, not the teller. Subtext operates in the villagers’ wordless reaching and the final question-mark steam. Final silence offers non-literal, resonant answer without moralizing. No thematic drift or echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise; perceptual signature filters every image through dye master’s craft-trained eye. Syntax modulates with emotional pressure—short clauses under awe, longer breaths in reflection. No head-hopping or register drift. Dialogue from traveler is spare and subtextual.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; every sentence layers image, emotion, and forward motion. Metaphors are fresh (“steam curling into the shape of a question mark”) and never muddle causality. Zero loops or scaffold. Minor elevated diction in “iridescent caution” phrase but fits voice.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—dye master with borrowed heart learning to illuminate stories—feels inevitable yet wholly fresh. Combines medical-fantasy, artisan craft, and mythic quest without cliché. Final silence as invitation is a non-obvious synthesis that reweights all prior beats. Risky structure pays off.</comment>
