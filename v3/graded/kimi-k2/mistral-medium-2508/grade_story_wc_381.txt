<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied; the summoner’s contradictory impulses (yearning for silence yet fearing its cost) play out in micro-choices—pressing the wing to water, lunging for the thread. The final renunciation of solitude is earned by the prior failure and the visible burn on her hand. Only the absence of a second on-page character prevents the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the origami wing returns “lighter…quiet,” reconfiguring the prophecy from scream to sigh. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each sensory layer thickens until the final cadence shift releases tension. Cost is legible in the seared skin and the tattered wing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The brook, reeds, moonlit stones, and the wing itself form a micro-setting that actively constrains tactics: water stills when touched, lattice of light hangs above it. Sensory selection narrows under crisis—cold burn, silver bleed—charging the final image. One notch shy of 9 only because the broader geography remains lightly sketched.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“to hush the prophecy”—is signaled early and tightened when the thread escapes; the summoner’s agency shifts from pursuit to acceptance, foreclosing further chase. The cost (burned palm, tattered wing) is visible and alters tactics. Escalation is single but decisive under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of silence as both refuge and erasure emerges through concrete action: mapping silence, cradling its weight, finally letting it breathe. The final sigh reweights all prior hush without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture—the wing’s tremble, the reeds’ bow—rather than statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with a perceptual signature attuned to hush and shimmer. Syntax modulates from long, breath-held sentences to the snapped “snap” and fragmented shards. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens under stress. Compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; each image advances atmosphere or stakes. Occasional stacked metaphors (“terrestrially cosmic tension”) flirt with excess yet serve the pattern. No loops or scaffold; rhythm breathes with the brook’s pulse. One mixed metaphor—“tranquil blaze”—keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The fusion of origami magic, prophecy-as-silence, and nocturnal ecology feels fresh and inevitable. Tropes (chosen one, mystical artifact) are transformed through tactile specificity and the inversion of noise as threat. Risky lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring causality.</comment>
