<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Eldrin’s interiority is vivid—stone against skin, breath fogging ice—and his preservation motive escalates to the climactic choice to invite rather than fight. The final heartbeat-press shows embodied cost. Minor: no contradictory impulses voiced in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the storm becomes lullaby via Eldrin’s conjuring of the bloom, paid for by the stone going dark and the ice fissure. Causal lens holds—each beat because/therefore—without orientation drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Harmonic caves and echo-chamber stone constrain every move; the bloom’s sphere is charged in the final image. Sensory selection is urgent—quartz veins, spiral fractures—tied to POV priorities. No spatial confusion.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve the last unbroken verse—tightens when the beings’ song threatens it. One meaningful deepening: resistance becomes invitation, cost paid by stone’s extinguished glow. Agency clear.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of listening as preservation emerges from action, never stated. Final image of caves “feeling like home” reweights prior alienation without moralizing. Subtext in silence and heartbeat.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Eldrin; perceptual signature in ripple-marks, trapped lightning, bloom of hush. Rhythm modulates with pressure—short clauses under storm, longer breaths at rest. No head-hop.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and information-dense: “stone remembered every tremor” does triple duty. No loops or scaffold; metaphors (trapped lightning, bloom of hush) stay coherent. Clean mechanics.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fusion of seismology, music, and metaphysics feels fresh; “bloom of hush” as non-violent resistance is non-obvious yet inevitable. Specificity of ripple-mark mapkeeper and echo chamber stone anchors the concept.</comment>
