<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s interior contradiction—once a scent-reader, now scent-blind—is embodied in tactile micro-choices (crushing lavender ghosts vs. measuring ticks). The screw exchange crystallizes a value hierarchy: witness over repair. Cost is felt when he sketches the trembling hands, renouncing his own recovery. Minor slip: the aromatherapist label is asserted more than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: fog density, ticking drops, and the screw’s reprise tighten the emotional stake until the final image reweights “time isn’t repaired, it’s read.” Closure is a Charged Poise—Elias’s stance crystallizes with visible cost (lost sense accepted as map). No causality breaks; orientation anchored by mist and harbor light.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Shop, fog, and water clock form a micro-setting that constrains choice: the clock’s drip paces Elias’s decision to witness rather than fix. Sensory selection is POV-filtered (damp wood remembered, not smelled). Final image of light bending around brass edges charges closure. Could be sharper if the clock’s mechanism actually resisted adjustment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to read unspoken grief—tightens once when Elias translates the screw’s history into “tighten or trust.” Pressure grows via accretion of ordinary objects, not external antagonist. Cost is the renunciation of restoring his own sense. Sufficient for length, though escalation is more textural than causal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from particulars: the ethics of witnessing vs. fixing. Subtext lives in gesture—screw pressed into palm, fingers curling like roots. Final image of sketching trembling hands offers non-literal answer: some things are passed on, not solved. Avoids moralizing; resonance lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Distinct perceptual signature: synesthetic metaphors (“scents crushed to release ghosts”), rhythmic control under pressure (“The clock dripped. The morning waited.”). POV modesty maintained—no knowledge beyond Elias. Compression taught early (“smelled of nothing and everything”) and paid off at closure. No head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High density, zero loops. Figurative language is selective and purposeful (“threads worn smooth as river stones”). Rhythm accelerates with fog lifting, then settles into final cadence. Minor register drift—“conceptual repricing” risk in “ordinary miracles” phrase—but context justifies. Clean mechanics.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: aromatherapist robbed of scent becomes reader of temporal artifacts. Screw-as-language avoids cliché by focusing on torque and trust. Risky quiet ending lands because prior texture earns it. Not transformative at scale, but specific and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
