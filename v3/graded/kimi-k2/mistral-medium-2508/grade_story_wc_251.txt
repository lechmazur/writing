<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s quiet resolve and tactile relationship with the pawn and filings are vivid; the interior contradiction between chess foresight and civic resistance is embodied. Yet the children remain off-stage instruments, so relationship pressure is absent and the final “conversation” line feels slightly abstract rather than earned through prior micro-choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the council’s notice and the town’s synchronized motion crystallize a new stance with visible cost—the library’s survival and Elias’s changed lessons. Causal chain (grotto pulse → filings → window displays → council retreat) holds under Accumulative/Textural lens; only a faint ellipsis in how the filings actually seal the doors keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The cobalt library, mist, and grotto are rendered with selective sensory density that constrains tactics (magnetic filings align to stone pulse, windows reflect the board). Micro-setting—the pawn warmed in a pocket—functions as charged object. Spatial choreography is clean; the only minor slip is an untracked shift from pre-dawn hush to “by midday” without intermediate anchor.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“save the library”—is signaled early and escalates through pattern intensification: whisper → displays → humming chains. One decisive tightening at noon when the hammer blow sings back shifts the cost from possible loss to undeniable social reconfiguration. Agency is collective but Elias’s orchestration remains causal driver.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of quiet resistance emerges organically from concrete acts; the final image of the town moving “like pieces on an unseen board” reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext in the window displays and the grotto’s breathing stone deepens the question of what is worth preserving. Only a faint echo of “forests of second thoughts” skirts thematic label-speak.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet disciplined, with rhythmic control that modulates from bruised noir to hushed wonder. Perceptual signature—Elias’s chess-tuned noticing—remains consistent; no POV leakage. Compression and elision (“slipping notes into the hands of his students”) are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is selective and purposeful (“windows bleeding muted light”). No loops or scaffold; occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing”) is justified by the reflective close. One mixed metaphor—“mist swallowed the cobblestones whole”—is minor.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>The magnetic grotto as civic nervous system, chess-as-civil-disobedience, and silent window-gambit campaign synthesize into a fresh, non-obvious whole. Risky lyric compression pays off in the resonant final image. Transformation test passes: the story would collapse if any core element were genericized.</comment>
