<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elira’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the contradiction between reverence and rebellion is dramatized in her micro-choices (hand on quartz, whispered line). The final renunciation—stepping back into the spiral as something “fluid and flickering”—is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost (loss of prior identity). Minor slip: “no longer afraid” edges toward label-speak, blunting the embodied contradiction at the climax.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the atrium is “unfolded,” the lake “answers,” and Elira’s stance crystallizes with undeniable conceptual cost (the elders’ fear proven right). Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density and cadence shift reweight the stake. No causality breaks; spatial/temporal anchors are clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Frost-kissed stone, humming quartz, and thawing lake are selective, sensory, and filtered through Elira’s biased perception. The quartz colonnade and lake actively constrain choices (hum rewrites her; thawing ice mirrors internal shift) and charge the final image. One minor drift: “cobalt atrium” remains more color label than spatial anchor.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—returning to reclaim certainty—tightens when Elira realizes the ban was to contain the atrium, not the poets. One decisive deepening: the quartz rewrites her, foreclosing the option to remain unchanged. Cost is legible in the final image (she is “no longer just a poet”).</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of sacred boundaries as fear-driven constructs emerges organically through Elira’s embodied experience and the lake’s thaw. Final image reweights the premise without moralizing: “the world, at last, would paraphrase itself.” No thematic drift; ambiguity is purposeful and resonant.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with rhythmic control that modulates under pressure (“the hum climbed an octave, the lantern-moth hush… giving way to something brighter, something hungry”). Perceptual signature is consistent and character-bound; no POV leakage. Compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is patterned and purposeful. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Minor register lift (“conceptual repricing” risk) avoided; diction stays within Elira’s plausible lexicon. Final cadence shift is clean and earned.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise—poet returns to transform a sacred, humming atrium—feels fresh through specific sensory and conceptual execution. The inversion that the ban protected the atrium from poets, not vice versa, is non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
