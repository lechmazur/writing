<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s contradictory impulses—lifelong invisibility vs. sudden need to reach out—are embodied in micro-choices (wedging the tape, stepping into light). The final offer of the key carries visible cost: surrender of anonymity. Interiority is concrete; no diagnostic speak. Only the woman’s side of the relationship stays off-page, so status crucible is muted.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias’s stance crystallizes from unseen archivist to visible guide, cost paid by the loss of lifelong concealment. Causal lens holds: each beat (outage → tape → photo → key) tightens options. Orientation is anchored in first 120 words. No teleporting props or retroactive patches.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Library’s crawl spaces, stained-glass dawn, and the vent as conduit all constrain tactics and charge the final image. Micro-setting (tape on grate) functions as pivotal object. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elias’s tactile bias. No white-room syndrome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Elias’s need to remain unseen vs. urge to connect—tightens once the outage cracks his routine. Agency drives escalation: he risks exposure with each cached gift. Cost is legible in the final step into light. No coincidence resolves the tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of bearing witness and reciprocal recognition emerges through action, not statement. The laugh and photograph reweight from archival solitude to shared memory. Final image of dawn light on two figures offers non-literal answer: visibility is both gift and wound. No moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is textured, rhythmic, and consistent with Elias’s lived-in lexicon (“calloused fingers,” “cobalt hush”). Perceptual signature is selective—sound of tape, feel of metal—without head-hop. Compression and elision are purposeful and paid off at closure. Dialogue minimal but natural.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers action, sensation, or stakes. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Rhythm modulates with pressure—short clauses during the outage, longer breaths at dawn. Clean grammar and spatial tracking.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Premise of subterranean memory-keeper who returns the past to its owners feels fresh yet inevitable. Transformation test fails: names/places could swap, but the specificity of tape, vent, and dawn light anchors it. Risk in quiet lyric closure pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
