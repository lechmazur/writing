<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority is textured and embodied; the potter’s contradictory impulses—returning to ruin yet shaping hope—are dramatized through micro-choices (pressing glass into wet clay, leaving the bowl). Motivation stays consistent and intensifies to the final renunciation. Cost is felt in the act of leaving the glowing bowl behind, but the beat is slightly under-dramatized, keeping it just shy of 8+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the bowl glowing amid ruins crystallizes the reconfiguration—“resistance is remembrance”—with conceptual cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of thrum, light, honey accretes until the final image reweights meaning. Orientation is clear by 120 w. Minor slack: causality between bee landing and final insight is more lyrical than driven.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Desert, hives, kiln, and lantern glass are rendered with tactile specificity; the shard literally embeds into the bowl, constraining the final choice to leave it. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered. Only the beekeeping mechanics remain lightly sketched, preventing 9+.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—why places resist change—tightens via the potter’s iterative returns and the final act of leaving the bowl as witness. Escalation is accretive rather than causal: each sensory layer (smoke, thrum, honey) deepens the question until the stance crystallizes. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral, capping below 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the potter’s practice: creation as remembrance, fracture as wholeness. Subtext resides in silence, light, and the bee’s wordless answer. Final image reweights premise without moralizing. A touch of lyrical abstraction keeps it from 8.8+.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is lyrically compressed yet coherent; perceptual signature (phototropic to kindness, clay memory) is distinct. Syntax modulates with heat and light. No dialogue, so no voice convergence issues. Occasional elevated phrasing (“prismatic ghosts”) slightly lifts out of the potter’s lexicon, preventing 9+.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic; figurative language is purposeful, not ornamental. No loops or scaffold. Minor mixed metaphor (“split like wet clay under too much pressure”) and one filter-verb cluster (“he felt the thrum again—deeper this time”) slightly dull immediacy at peak.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: post-apocalyptic beekeeper ruins as kiln, lantern glass as memory shard, phototropic kindness as survival trait. Risky lyric structure pays off in the final reconfiguration. Transformation is specific; premise would collapse if details swapped.</comment>
