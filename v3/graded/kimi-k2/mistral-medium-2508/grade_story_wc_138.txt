<comment>Lysander’s boredom-driven choices create the key turning beats (dropping the fragment, stepping into the corridor). Flaw: interiority occasionally drifts into grand abstract sighs rather than specific micro-choices under pressure. Morphs cleanly from ennui to liberating curiosity with earned cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Accumulative residual-earnings lens: escalating "boredom paradox" tightens toward spatial mutiny → letting go turns into a decisive release. Closure is a crystallized charged poise—Lysander’s goodbye reconfigures the void’s geometry. No causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Escondite’s violet/bruise texture and shifting floors provide micro-terrain that pressure choices (gravity flickers, corridor birth). Magnificent evocation slightly tips toward static wallpaper early; final dissolution reconciles it.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Spatial mutiny escalates from passive “light shivers” to active corridor-swallowing void. Stakes crystallize into personal extinction/ transcendence; the choice to drop the fragment anchors the decisive change.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme—immortality’s slow poison and the terror of honest saying goodbye—emerges through particulars (seeing geometry “go feral”). Subtext whispers in the storm of copper traces rather than stating metaphysics.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Distinct salt-storm syntax and metallic cadences stay under pressure. No head-hopping; POV compression serves immediacy. Minimal dialogue; what does appear (“Alright,” dropped) lands like a gong of surrender.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Lyrical density never occludes propulsion; veins spring, copper thrum, knives of light. Some ornate phrasing on sound (“struck bell”) pays off in last diction. Zero loops; every sentence advances tone or choice.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Bored immortal meets rebellious geometry is a fresh collision; the curiosity-curse reframes classic immortality tales. Specific decision—dropping amulet—amplifies stakes uniquely. Rare fusion of cosmic fantasy with interior reckoning.</comment>
