<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s tactile, dust-reading expertise and quiet resolve are vivid; the final renunciation to “unmake” the mechanism is earned by his embodied horror at the child-laugh pendulum. Interiority stays concrete, but the ghosts’ dialogue edges toward explanatory label-speak, blunting full contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a decisive CR: Elias’s dismantling reweights the entire premise—circus was paused, not dead—at visible cost (ghosts solidify then fade free). Causal lens holds: each loosened bolt tightens the irreversible release. No orientation drift; anchors clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The ticket office’s popcorn-sawdust ghost-smell and the dust-as-language micro-setting actively constrain Elias’s reading of cracks; the final gold dawn through the broken skylight recharges the opening darkness. Environment and tool (mainspring barrel) jointly shape the climax.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—free the ghosts by stopping the mechanism—tightens once when Elias shifts from diagnosis to sabotage. The cost is palpable: child-laugh shatters, gears fall like dead stars. Agency drives escalation; no coincidence resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of unburdening the past emerges through concrete particulars (dust grammar, child-laugh pendulum) without moralizing. Final image of cracks “just cracks now” offers a resonant, non-literal answer: release is irreversible and weightless.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is tactile, restrained, and haunted; perceptual signature filters every detail through Elias’s professional gaze. Syntax modulates with pressure—short clauses during dismantling, longer breaths in aftermath. No head-hopping; ghost speech is framed as whispered intrusion.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet textured; every sentence advances atmosphere or action. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful (“dust motes hung like forgotten acrobats”). No loops, no mixed metaphors, no filter-verb stacks. Rhythm breathes with scene tempo.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The “paused circus” premise and dust-as-language conceit feel fresh and inevitable; the mainspring barrel’s re-purposing as key/weapon is a non-obvious synthesis. Risky choice to make the antagonist a mechanism rather than a person pays off in conceptual weight.</comment>
