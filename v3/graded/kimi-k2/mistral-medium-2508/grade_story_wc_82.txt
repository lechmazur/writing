<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The lantern maker’s interiority is vivid—grief embodied in trembling fingers, the quartz “pulling” at her skin—but the final surrender feels slightly under-motivated; the leap from recording dreams to self-sacrifice is more lyrical than causal. Still, her contradictory impulses (preserve vs. release) are dramatized in the moment she presses the gem, and the cost is palpable.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the basilica’s transformation and the isle’s reversal are legible on-page, charged by the gem-bite and the cranes’ flight. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each image layers density until the final cadence reweights the premise. No causality breaks; the dream-recording rule set is consistent.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The floating isle, tea garden, and basilica are rendered with selective, sensory precision; the cranes’ shift from paper to dream-substance constrains the climax and charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean, and the environment evolves causally with the isle’s “unfolding.”</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—recovering the daughter’s voice—tightens when the gem bites and the maker must choose absorption over mere recording. One decisive intensification suffices; the cost is visible in her physical dissolution and the cranes’ luminous flight. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Grief’s transformation into living dream is the emergent theme, never stated but enacted through the cranes and the basilica’s breathing glass. The final image reweights the premise without moralizing: the isle rises “into the place where dreams are kept.” Complexity lingers in the cost of that transcendence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct—tactile, lyrical, and compressed: “steam curled like unspoken promises.” Patterned elision (e.g., the shadow’s detachment) is taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains consistent under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is purposeful, never ornamental. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. The final paragraph’s cadence mirrors the isle’s reversal, achieving Charged Poise without clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The dream-recording basilica, grief-folded cranes, and descending-while-ascending isle synthesize into a singular vision. The premise feels inevitable in hindsight; risk-taking (lyric surrender as climax) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. No derivative echoes.</comment>
