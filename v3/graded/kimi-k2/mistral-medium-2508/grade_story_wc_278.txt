<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory drives—her wish to silence old grief clashing with an irrepressible need to witness it—are rendered in embodied ache and micro-decisions (feeding the paper, touching the amber, choosing ink again). Her shame manifests in trembling hands, a cracked relic, and the final needle, making her moment-by-moment choices legible and costly without resorting to therapy-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal—“if you feed the machine…” The closure beat (“She reached for the baby”) is a decisive change that loops time back through guilt and out the other side, showing felt cost: she now bears witness forever. Cause/effect chains taught early (feed → hush → crack → tether → reversal) hold without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Lab of rusted speakers, constellational walls, the split amber—each constrains tactics (where she stands, how she manipulates the amber) and is charged again at closure when the mosquito’s wings sing, locking the setting to the cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</comment>
<comment>Dominant stake—“erase what she owes” vs. pay the debt—narrows sharply when the firmware refuses silence and births the doubled scene of witness. One meaningful tightening: from erasure to endurance. Price is palpable: perpetual vigil beside the cry.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Guilt as preserved fossil amber is organically enacted, not stated; witness supplants erasure, and the final non-literal image (the insect “singing”) crystallizes the reconfiguration, leaving an open-ended moral cost that avoids tidy didacticism.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Free-indirect lyricism stays intensely filtered through Elara’s grief-stung sensory logic; compression like “the whispers didn’t forget” and rhythmic refrain “—were singing” create distinctive texture under pressure without head-hop.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Rhythm rises and falls with on-the-pulse urgency; near-zero scaffold, zero paraphrase loops (“amber… amber… amber” re-appears with new valence). Figurative language serves each beat; no mixed metaphors. Final three-word line lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Old ghost-machine trope transformed into a private moral ledger where time folds like cloth and guilt is a singing insect; the risk of retro-scifi cliché is undercut by emotionally specific wound-keeping. Synthesis feels inevitable only after it has happened.</comment>
