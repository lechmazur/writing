<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is textured—her tactile handling of lenses, parchment, and reels shows a map-maker’s precision—but the final “quiet certainty” arrives with minimal embodied cost; we feel her shift more as insight than forfeiture.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each film layer and sensory detail thickens until the tear in the map re-stitches itself in her mind’s eye, a resonant reconfiguration that reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The vault’s damp stone, the henge’s hum, and the rain-scoured frescoes are not backdrop—they constrain her method (silence, light, vibration) and charge the final image where the vault “exhales” and the map becomes key.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether the unknown is void or conversation—tightens through each reel comparison; the deepening pattern of shifting shadows and flickers narrows her stance until she chooses listening over crossing, with felt cost in the withheld step.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the concrete act of aligning three temporal slices: silence is not absence but a language one must earn the right to hear. The final image of the map as “key” offers a resonant, non-moral answer to the central question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is precise, tactile, and restrained—fitting a cartographer who measures “quiet spaces between what was recorded and what was remembered.” Rhythm modulates with pressure, and no line drifts from Elara’s perceptual signature.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet sensorily rich; every sentence layers texture or advances the pattern. No loops, no mixed metaphors, no filter-verb stacks—just high-density clauses that accelerate toward the vault’s exhalation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of cartography, silent film, and acoustic henge feels inevitable and fresh; the conceit that a map tears at the threshold of “when” rather than “where” reframes familiar exploration tropes without gimmickry.</comment>
