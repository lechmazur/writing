<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is embodied and specific (“her molars ache,” “blood hummed”), but the final sacrifice feels slightly pre-explained rather than discovered under pressure; the contradiction between logic and emotion is stated more than dramatized in the moment of turning the key.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the beam becomes hymn, her body becomes harmony, cost is visible (“ragged, wet gasps”). Causal lens holds—every beat follows because/therefore from thinning ice to final tuning.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The drift-ice marina is not backdrop; its groaning language and fracturing geometry actively cage or channel the sphere’s energy, constraining her tactics and charging the final image of “new pattern” ice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—prevent sphere resonance—tightens once: ice thinning → must tune or world breaks. Agency is hers; cost is cellular unraveling. One clear escalation, no safety valves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of absolution-as-matching emerges through action, never sermon; final image of “forgiven by physics” reweights monks’ dogma into lived bodily cost. Resonates without tidy moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is winter-steel precise, salted with technical lyricism (“reverse lightning strike”). Perceptual signature stays locked to her sensorium; no POV leakage, rhythm modulates with vibration intensity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and conceptual work. One mixed metaphor (“peeled the salt from the air”) barely grazes clarity; otherwise zero loops or scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Transforms familiar “sacrifice to save world” through sonic engineering and glacial acoustics; the drift-ice dampener cage feels inevitable yet wholly fresh. Risky bodily dissolution earns its transcendence.</comment>
