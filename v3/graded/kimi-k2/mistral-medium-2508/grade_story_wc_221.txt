<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira’s contradictory impulses—clinging to the station yet leaping toward the light—are embodied in the warming compass rose and the torn sketch; the final renunciation is earned and carries visible cost. Interiority is concrete, but a touch of diagnostic self-awareness (“she felt like an observer again”) nudges the score down from 9+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Lira’s step off the railing crystallizes the new direction “through” time, with the compass needle snapping into place as the felt cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density and cadence shift reweight the stake—and the station’s single chime seals the before/after legibility.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The frost-bitten railing, dulled compass rose, and thinning air are vivid, selective, and directly constrain Lira’s final choice; the observation deck itself becomes the charged object that enables the leap. Micro-setting detail is woven through action without stalling momentum.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether to stay or to trust the anomaly—tightens once when the compass warms and the sketch aligns; the cost is the irreversible abandonment of the station. Escalation is driven by Lira’s agency under the Accumulative lens, with no reliance on coincidence to resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: “Home” as direction rather than place is reweighted by the final leap, offering a resonant, non-moralizing answer. The sketchbook and compass rose accumulate meaning without overt statement, and the closing image braids past and future threads without sentimentality.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with a perceptual signature rooted in Lira’s trained observer’s eye; compression and elision (“the stars, for once, didn’t lie”) are taught early and paid off. Rhythm modulates with emotional intensity, and no head-hopping occurs.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; each sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors mar the peak beats. The final paragraph’s cadence shift mirrors the temporal dilation, earning high-band placement.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of abandoned space station, inherited sketchbook ritual, and relativistic “true north” feels inevitable and fresh. Risky temporal imagery is fully integrated, not gimmicky, and the premise would collapse if any element were swapped.</comment>
