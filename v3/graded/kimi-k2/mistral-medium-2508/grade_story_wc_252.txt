<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s contradictory impulses—stoic endurance vs. the ache to unfold—are embodied in salt-stung palms and the scrimshaw’s pulse. The final transformation is earned by the tactile history of the carving and the whale’s call, with the cost of leaving every human tether legible in the dockworkers’ averted eyes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Decisive Change: Elias’s body literally reconfigures, the island-cage dissolves, and the scrimshaw returns to source. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each sensory layer tightens until the final image reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost: “Veyth had never been an island. It was a cage.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The sublittoral fringe, salt-stiffened ropes, and fog-thick harbor are not backdrop but pressure: the tide gnaws boots, the trench unravels roots, the planks groan like old grudges. The setting constrains every choice until the water itself becomes the only viable path.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—freedom vs. belonging—tightens once: the whale’s second call forces Elias to choose irreversible transformation. The cost is visceral (bright, clean pain) and permanent (island vanishes); agency drives the escalation under Accumulative pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: a stolen bone carving, crumbling docks, a whale’s name. The final image—“the door was wide open”—reweights the entire narrative without moralizing, offering resonant ambiguity about cages, keys, and chosen bonds.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is salt-raw, rhythmic, and character-bound: “salt-stiffened ropes biting into his palms like old grudges.” Compression and elision are taught early (“He didn’t jump. He unfolded”) and paid off in the lyrical final dive. No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains singular.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: every sentence layers sensory, emotional, and mythic work. Figurative language is disciplined—no mixed metaphors, no loops. The final cadence shift (“the water welcomed him. The past did not.”) crystallizes momentum without clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The disappearing-island-as-cage premise, whale-key mythology, and stolen scrimshaw cohere into a fresh synthesis. Transformation feels inevitable yet surprising; risk-taking (body-horror metamorphosis in <800 words) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
