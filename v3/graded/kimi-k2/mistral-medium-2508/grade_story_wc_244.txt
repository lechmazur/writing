<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lena’s contradictory impulses—pragmatic logistician vs. myth-maker—surface in the moon-rock trade-offs; her final renunciation of ownership carries visible cost (“she left the rock…”) and reframes her loneliness. Interiority is embodied (boots crunch glass, rock cold as promise) and avoids label-speak. Secondary characters (Mira, Carter) apply pressure that alters her stance, satisfying crucible test. The only drag: Carter’s reveal as forger/poet feels slightly expository rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Lena’s gift of the rock reweights reciprocity from leverage to gift, with felt cost (she boards “NEXT STOP: POSSIBLY” without the talisman). Causal chain holds—each favor trades for information, culminating in the ledger reveal—under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is anchored by dawn arrival and dusk departure; no drift. One minor ellipsis (how Carter’s list cures loneliness) is allowed under lyric compression.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>The station’s ivy-choked platforms and rusted padlock constrain access and echo abandonment; the freight car’s camphor smell becomes a sensory pivot. Micro-setting (moon rock in pocket) functions as portable environment that charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean—bench, tracks, desk—without white-room gaps. Weather isn’t needed; interior decay suffices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Dominant stake—find the loneliness cure—tightens when the “cure” is revealed as a communal ledger, forcing Lena to choose possession vs. circulation. Escalation is driven by her micro-choices (fixing radio, trading bread) that accrue social credit. Coincidence (Mira’s arrival) complicates but doesn’t resolve; agency remains hers. Cost is visible: relinquishing the rock forecloses her mythic leverage.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</question><comment>Theme emerges through the moon rock’s shifting value: from commodity to gift, from isolation to transit. Subtext in Mira’s limp and the child’s mitten carries unspoken need. Final image—“the rumor had already changed”—reweights reciprocity without moralizing. Complexity preserved: loneliness isn’t solved, only transmuted into motion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Voice is textured, lyrical yet grounded (“desperate jocularity of someone who’d long since accepted…”). Free indirect style stays clean; no head-hopping. Dialogue sparse but subtextual (“You’re looking for the doctor,” not asking). Rhythm modulates with pressure—short declaratives at closure. Diction remains within Lena’s plausible lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</question>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density (“platforms choked with ivy and the stubborn ghosts of timetables”). Metaphors precise (rock “cold as a promise”). Sentence variety supports momentum; no register drift. Final line crystallizes without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</question>
<comment>Premise—cure for loneliness as communal ledger—feels fresh yet inevitable. Moon rock trope is transformed from MacGuffin to catalyst of gift economy. Specificity of disused railway culture grounds the myth. Risk in lyric ellipsis pays off; no derivative echoes.</comment>
