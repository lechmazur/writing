<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lena’s contradictory impulses—fear of water vs. need to reclaim identity—are embodied in trembling grip, jagged shell edge, and the ledger choice. Micro-choice to bleed on the shell crystallizes her hierarchy of values. The girl’s presence forces status shift and immediate pressure. Closure cost—walking out with proof but still terrified—is earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each beat (shell whisper → cast clue → ledger discovery) narrows options toward the decisive act of taking proof. Orientation anchored by line 3. Closure is on-page: she forecloses erasure by physically claiming the ledger, cost felt in the shell’s warmth and her still-intact phobia.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rusted library’s groan and sagging shelves mirror Lena’s erasure; starlight outside becomes the recharging image. The shell and ledger function as micro-settings that constrain choices. Spatial choreography is clean—ladder groan, atlas tug. Sensory detail is selective and urgent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove legal existence—signaled in paragraph 2. Tightening occurs when the cast message redirects search; cost is the reopened betrayal wound and the literal blood on the shell. Agency drives escalation; coincidence (girl’s appearance) complicates but does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of vulnerability as power emerges through embodied action—bleeding on the shell, climbing the ladder—not statement. Final image of diving into fear without conquering it offers resonant, non-moralizing answer. Subtext in shell’s silence after proof is taken.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is muscular, tactile, stunt-world specific: “pressure here, pivot there.” Rhythm tightens under stress—short clauses, no filter verbs. Distinct perceptual signature: Lena notices frayed ropes, faulty harnesses, smudged crayon. No head-hopping; girl’s dialogue carries subtext.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High information density: “the studio had whispered liability” compresses backstory and stakes. Metaphors are precise—shelves “sagging like old bones.” No loops or scaffold. Sentence rhythm accelerates during ladder climb. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing”) stays within Lena’s analytic stunt mind.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: stunt double erased by her own contracts, proof hidden in a half-shell ledger system. Tropes—ghost identity, whispering object—are grounded in concrete stunt-world detail. Risky choice to keep phobia unconquered heightens stakes. Feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
