<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Li Wei’s interior life is rich: his hands ache not from work but from the weight of unwritten fate, and we track the precise micro-shift when he moves from scribe to conductor. The fracture on the nautilus aligns with his own crack, an embodied emblem of time he can’t return to.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single-scene causal arc: dawn light splits the lake mirror → Li Wei reconfigures silence into music. Closure lands as he raises his hands to shape the air, an earned stance that forecloses the quiet path with visible cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>The glass spire’s hum is both literal sound and metaphorical tuning fork; the lake’s groaning fractures supply both literal ice-song and thematic overture. Micro-setting—the broken nautilus shell—becomes the score sheet itself.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: seize silence before exhaustion hits. Pressure tightens as the mirrored horizon unzips and ice-songs begin; Li Wei’s final act crystallizes his stance without external salvation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme of time as cracked mirror culminates in the final image—Li Wei becomes the silent pause before first music. No homily, only the shell’s fracture shadow recharging all prior grief.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Percipience is precise: Li Wei notices the nautilus’s hairline shadow and the ice’s timbre with musician ears. Interior lyricism (“the song before the silence”) is earned, not ornamental.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is compressed and rhythmic—“a horizon that refused to stay still”—with zero loops. Figurative language is tuned like strings; no mixed metaphors cloud Li Wei’s final gesture.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: fortune-cookie scribe turned conductor of dawn’s first note. No stock tropes; the mirrored horizon and homesickness are made specific through embodied cost.</comment>
