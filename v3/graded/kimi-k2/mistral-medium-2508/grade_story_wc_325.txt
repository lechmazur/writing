<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s fear of small spaces is stated but never embodied; the “distant scream” of claustrophobia is the only nod. His decision to cross the phase seam is credible because the codex key and detector spike give immediate cause, yet we never feel the internal contradiction between terror and curiosity. The final renunciation—returning for “the quiet things”—is stated rather than dramatized, so the cost is more asserted than felt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias exits with the blue-glow drop, the facility “breathes,” and the world above remains unaware—an earned shift that reweights the premise. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each beat thickens atmosphere and stakes until the final crystallizing image. The only drag is a brief orientation wobble at the ladder descent; space and time anchor within ~120 words, so no penalty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The drowned facility is rendered through rust, silt, and pulsing blue light that constrains movement and signals danger. The “crushing dark” and “phase seam” function as micro-settings that gate every choice. Sensory selection is urgent—headlamp flicker, damp walls, detector hiss—tightened to Elias’s goal. The final image of the glowing drop charges the entire atmosphere, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—retrieve and bear witness to the unremembered—is signaled early and tightened by the tidal clock. The phase seam crossing is the single decisive escalation that forecloses retreat. Cost is visible in the “weight of the invisible light in his bones,” though the price could be more viscerally dramatized. Agency is Elias’s alone; coincidence merely complicates.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme—memory as ethical obligation—emerges through concrete action (crossing the seam, carrying the drop) rather than statement. The final image of the gold fleck “like an eye opening” reweights the codex key from map to witness, achieving Conceptual Repricing without moralizing. Subtext hums in the cables’ song “not for him, but for the thing he carried.” Complexity lingers: no tidy redemption, only responsibility.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is tactile, compressed, and slightly archaic (“the tide had just begun its slow retreat”) yet stays within Elias’s plausible lexicon. Rhythm modulates with pressure—short clauses under the earth, longer cadences at the surface. Perceptual signature is consistent: Elias notices seams, hums, and glows, not tourist details. No dialogue, so no voice leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and propulsive; each sentence layers atmosphere or advances choice. Figurative language is selective—“coiled serpents of copper,” “crashing hush”—and never clutters high-pressure beats. No loops, scaffold, or register drift. One mixed metaphor (“the weight of the earth above him was a living thing”) is minor and does not blur clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The fusion of drowned server farm, phase-shifted space, and ethical haunting feels fresh yet inevitable. The gold fleck’s transformation from map to witness is a non-obvious synthesis that reconfigures meaning. Risky compression—lyric leaps, elided mechanics—heightens stakes without obscuring closure. Only a faint echo of Lovecraftian abyss keeps it from 9.0+.</comment>
