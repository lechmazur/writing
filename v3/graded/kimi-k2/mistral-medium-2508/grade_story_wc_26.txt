<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Liora’s interiority is specific—her “sharp-eyed dusk noticer” trait is embodied in the way she tracks shadows and light. The final choice to trade her shadow is foreshadowed by her lifelong habit of noticing thresholds, making the renunciation earned. The curator’s single line of dialogue is too brief to create a crucible, so relationship pressure is minimal. Overall, a strong single-POV arc with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of archival footage, stone, and shadow builds density until the final image reweights the premise. Closure is a Charged Poise—Liora’s shadow merges with the poet’s, the library breathes, and the cost (her own shadow thinned) is legible. Orientation is clear within 120 words; no causality breaks. One minor ellipsis (how she “knew” the stone’s nature) is paid off by footage comparison.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The floating library is sketched with selective sensory detail—light-blooming books, cloud-level hush—yet remains coherent. The stone on the sill and the shifting shadows function as micro-setting that constrains the final choice. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions. While grand, the setting never stalls momentum; every detail feeds the luminous atmosphere that charges the ending.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: preserve hope’s shape vs. personal wholeness. Escalation is textural—footage pattern intensifies until Liora must act. The tightening beat is her conscious offer of her own shadow; cost is her thinned silhouette. Coincidence (stone appearing) complicates but does not resolve. One meaningful turn suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the tension between preservation and self-sacrifice; no explicit moralizing. The poet’s line and the stone’s pulse reweight hope as something that outlives its bearer. Final image—shadow curled like a sleeping cat—offers non-literal resonance. Subtext in the curator’s lie and Liora’s half-empty shadow deepens complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; perceptual signature centers on thresholds of light and shadow. Syntax modulates with emotional intensity—short clauses at the climax (“She set the stone… She opened her palms”). No head-hopping; POV stays tightly bound to Liora. Compression (“Some stories don’t need words”) is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but never purple; each sentence advances image or stakes. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Rhythm accelerates during the shadow-transfer beat. Occasional elevated diction (“metamorphose,” “luminous”) fits the library’s mythic register. Clean grammar and unambiguous pronouns.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise—shareable dreams birthing autonomous emotions—feels fresh yet internally consistent. The “shadow unbound” trope is transformed through archival footage and stone-as-vessel. Specificity of the dusk noticer trait and the poet’s single-line legacy anchor universals. Risky lyric structure pays off in the final image without gimmickry.</comment>
