<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lira’s embodied pragmatism (“calloused fingers,” “oil-stained vest”) and her contradictory calm under existential threat create a vivid, specific interiority; her micro-choice to kneel and feed the hourglass is earned by prior causal hints and visibly costs her the grotto route. The lone ghost passenger functions only as atmospheric foil, so relationship crucible is minimal, but Lira’s self-contradictory stance—accepting impermanence while desperately stitching timelines—drives every beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the ferry’s “everywhere-at-once” beat snaps into a single sky, the hourglass now “full of something that wasn’t sand,” and Lira’s final grin acknowledges irreversible exile. Causality is lyric-accumulative; each pattern-alignment beat tightens until the grotto’s collapse forces the decisive merge. Orientation is taught early via the sideways clocks and spectral starlight, so disorientation serves closure rather than confuses.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The spectral grotto’s bioluminescent algae, liquid-silver water, and mutable constellations are rendered through Lira’s practiced gaze; these details constrain her steering choices and literally collapse into the final merged sky. The hourglass itself becomes micro-setting, its void-to-full transition anchoring spatial and temporal stakes. Selective sensory economy (tactile rope, warm glass, starflower plucked from air) keeps atmosphere taut.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prevent the ferry’s unraveling—is signaled in the radio warning and escalates via Lira’s pattern-merging gambit, which costs her the grotto route forever. Agency is continuous: every adjustment of wheel or hourglass narrows options until the irreversible merge. Coincidence (grotto collapse) complicates but does not resolve; the resolution arises from Lira’s stance crystallization with visible exile as price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of impermanence-as-resilience emerges through concrete action: the empty hourglass refilled with “rising” sand embodies the paradox of transient permanence. No moral is stated; the final starflower behind Lira’s ear reweights earlier spectral blooms into a quiet emblem of continuity-through-loss. Subtext operates in gesture—the radio’s unanswered final call—rather than exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Lira’s voice is salt-rough, rhythmic, and sardonic (“Course is relative, Cap”), with perceptual bias toward tools and tides. Compression (“seventeen years, or maybe seventeen minutes”) teaches the lyric pattern early; closure pays it off with sand that “rises.” No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates from wry distance to charged poise without register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet textured: “ferry…cut through black water like a blade through silk” sets sensory propulsion without purple drift. Sentence rhythm accelerates under grotto collapse, then breathes into the final quiet. Zero loops, zero scaffold; each image (starflower, liquid silver) does double duty for atmosphere and stakes. Grammar and spatial choreography are flawless.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The sideways-time commuter ferry is familiar SF territory, but the treatment feels fresh: the hourglass as vacuum-threader, the starlight constellations as shifting gears, and the deckhand’s pragmatic mysticism transform trope into lived myth. Risky lyric compression pays off in the final image of rising sand. No derivative echoes; the synthesis feels inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
