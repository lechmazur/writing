<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“ink shimmered, alive”), but the tide dancer’s contradictory impulses remain largely abstract; the final renunciation is earned yet the cost feels more conceptual than visceral. Micro-choices (pressing moonstone to wrist, dipping fingers for Orion) are concrete, but the stakes pivot on a lyric leap rather than a crucible of conflicting desires.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the verse becomes a second pulse, reconfiguring exile into chosen aperture. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each image layers density until the final crystallization. Orientation is swift; causality is lyric rather than linear, but the pattern is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The twilight garden, blackened pond, and moonstone dust are not backdrop but instruments: the pond supplies Orion’s reflection, the dust bites skin to anchor the verse. Micro-setting (wrist vein, nightshade scent) constrains the ritual and charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; sensory hierarchy mirrors urgency.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—transform exile into agency via cosmic inscription—tightens through each beat. Pressure escalates by accretion: nostalgia ban, moonstone hunger, garden’s held breath. The final stance crystallizes with visible cost: skin no longer hers alone. No external antagonist needed; internal conflict suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: exile as aperture, memory as drowning, ink as home. The moonstone’s return at closure reweights nostalgia from loss to tool. Subtext lives in gesture—heron vanishing, lilies clenched—never exposition. Final image offers resonant non-literal answer: “exile was just another word for a door left ajar.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct, lyric, and controlled: “the sky jealous,” “obsidian grace.” Compression and elision are taught early (“she had been exiled by choice—not cast out”) and sustained. Perceptual signature is consistent; no head-hopping. Syntax modulates with ritual intensity; final cadence is earned.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence layers image or stakes. No loops or scaffold. Metaphors are precise (“waterlilies curled like clenched fists”). Rhythm accelerates toward the final line without clutter. Minor risk of overwriting in “cosmic verse etched into mortal flesh,” but it serves the ritual crescendo.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Familiar tropes—exile, ritual tattoo, star-magic—are transformed through tactile specificity and lyric restraint. The synthesis feels inevitable: tide dancer becomes the gap itself. Risk-taking (non-linear causality, accumulative closure) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. No derivative echoes.</comment>
