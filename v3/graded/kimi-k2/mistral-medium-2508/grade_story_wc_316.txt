<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael’s contradictory halves—jar-bound and embodied—generate immediate, embodied tension; the micro-choice to bleed onto both jars crystallizes his hierarchy of values (wholeness over legal survival). Veyra’s pressure sharpens the crucible, forcing a visible cost. Interiority stays concrete, though the “defeat the numbness” line edges toward label-speak, blunting full 9.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Decisive Change: the merged mind rewrites the Emperor’s timeline and Kael’s own ontology. Causal chain—blood → dissolution of jars → storm breaks & banners burn—is legible, felt, and irreversible. Lens is Causal; every beat links because/therefore. No orientation debt; spatial anchors arrive within 60 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The floating dojo’s moss-slick edges and storm-wracked valley anchor mood and constrain escape; the tatami mat becomes the micro-setting where the merger occurs. Weather and altitude subtly mirror Kael’s internal fracture. One detail—moss under Veyra’s boots—grounds the space in tactile specificity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—self-integrity versus legal erasure—tightens once: the custody hearing countdown forces the irreversible merger. Escalation is causal and visible: each pulse of the jarred brain raises the cost of delay. The final image (banners burning) externalizes the price paid.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of fractured identity and manufactured history emerges through the brains’ silent argument and the Emperor’s rewrites. Subtext lives in gesture—Kael’s palm on glass, Veyra’s bruising grip. Final line “defeat the numbness” is the only overt statement; its earnedness keeps it from moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is tactile, slightly archaic, and consistent; syntax tightens under stress (“Pain lanced… tearing silk”). Distinct perceptual signature: Kael notices amber fluid, wet footprints, dagger warmth. Dialogue is spare and subtextual. No head-hopping; POV remains locked.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet textured; each sentence advances image or stakes. No loops or scaffold. Metaphors (“sound like tearing silk”) are precise and earned. Minor elevation in diction (“vivify the severed”) fits monk register without drift. Final paragraph cadence mirrors the uplift of the dojo.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Brain-jar custody battle is a fresh synthesis of biopunk and legal thriller, grounded in monastic myth. The merger ritual feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Specificity—amber fluid, Schism scar—prevents generic slip. Risky choice to dissolve both brains pays off with conceptual repricing of identity.</comment>
