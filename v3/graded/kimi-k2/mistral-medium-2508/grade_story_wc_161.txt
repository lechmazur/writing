<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s tremor when unfolding the letter, the way he pockets the meteorite before Madame Holloway arrives, and the final micro-choice to hum all embody contradictory impulses under pressure. The interiority is specific—ledger ink “the color of dried roses,” dust read “like sheet music”—and the cost of reopening song is felt when his rusty voice cracks. The only cap is that Luca remains off-page, so relationship-as-crucible pressure is muted.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elias hums, accepting the cost of imperfect song, and the attic’s silence is reweighted. Causal chain—meteorite → letter → pigeon → returned sheet music—holds without gaps. The lens is Causal; each beat tightens options until the final refusal to stay silent.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The attic’s slanted walls, pigeon feathers “like crumpled sheet music,” and the meteorite’s moonlit edge all constrain choice: the skylight’s dust swirls literally guide flight calculations. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—pipe-smoke ghosts, bergamot perfume—anchoring who/where early. The setting charges the final image when the attic “smelled less like smoke and more like the sea.”</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can Elias risk trusting sound again—is signaled by the letter and tightened when he whispers “Find him.” The returned scrap of sheet music forces the trade-off: imperfect hum or eternal silence. Cost is visible in the rusty, wrong notes he lets himself sing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of echo versus absence emerges through concrete particulars: meteorite as “older than memory,” dust motes as “notes from a broken record.” The final hum offers a resonant, non-literal answer—song can be imperfect and still survive—without moralizing. Subtext in Madame Holloway’s sigh and Luca’s scrawl carries more weight than exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct—musical metaphors woven into tactile detail, syntax that modulates with stress (“wings cutting through the dust-mote constellations”). Perceptual signature is consistent: Elias reads wind patterns like scores, smells time passing. No POV leakage; even Madame Holloway’s entrance is filtered through bergamot and cane taps.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “ledger ink the color of dried roses” does triple sensory work. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances. Figurative language is controlled—meteorite “glinting like a misplaced star” appears once and pays off. Rhythm breathes with beats, accelerating at pigeon launch, softening at dawn.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: courier pigeons as paper trail, dust motes as musical notation, meteorite as relic of pre-loss self. Tropes of grief and reinvention are grounded in occupational specificity. The risk—trading arpeggios for flight patterns—pays off in the earned, imperfect hum.</comment>
