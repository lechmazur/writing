<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Lior’s internality is textured and embodied; contradictions between performance and motive ring true. The “lightly attentive” stance evolves from posture to practiced calculus, but a micro-choice where the bishop cracks against his palm is vivid. Relationships are absent, so status and secondary pressures null; the score rises on solitary interior precision.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The Accumulative lens (pattern → re‐weight → felt cost) holds cleanly: every sonic variable is aligned with outside events before the torch-gutter/tide alignment. Closure lands as Earned Stasis—the decision not to chase coins crystallizes in the bishop-pocket move, conceptual cost audible in “until the stars burn out.” One 120-word cue (“The tidal arcade hummed…”) anchors orientation; slight drift past that is forgiven because disorientation serves the climactic pattern.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The tidal arcade is vivid—salt-smell, slick cobbles, torch flame—but never becomes a spatial trap that actively constrains choice. When water cools Lior’s ankle, the moment tightens tactics (bow speed linked to wave slap), satisfying micro-setting use. No broader environmental payoff, capping below the higher bands.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>One dominant stake—composing serendipity until pattern and audience click—escalates as wave-torch-gasp alignments narrow options. Agency is renunciation: Lior refuses coin-acceptance at felt cost (tide-clock running, stars finite). Pressure obeys Accumulate/Deepen curve; no external reversal needed.</comment>

<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Theme (order concealed within chaos) emerges in the interplay of tide arithmetic, torch flare, violin variables. Statement is avoided—final insight “order hiding” lands as image, not sermon. Complexity lingers without overt moral, yet slight risk of abstraction from audience’s unread reaction keeps it just under 9+.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice remains tight, specific, modulating from humid salt-rhythm to bow-wire hiss under peak pressure. No speech, so dialogue risk erased. A single filter-verb cluster (“lifted his bow. / The first note happened”) is forgiven because rhythm teaches compression. Perceptual signature (noticing every angle of chance) is unmistakably owned. Nears mastery.</comment>

<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is economical and propulsive; synesthetic detail slots without clutter. One overwritten flourish—“serenade not for the audience but for the gaps between them”—edges toward art-speak but momentum absorbs it. Zero loops or scaffold; sensory hierarchy by POV maintains. Small tonal inflation docks 0.2.</comment>

<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fusing street-performance with epistemic sleight-of-hand (orchestrated randomness) is quietly audacious. The bishop–tide–violin triangulation feels inevitable after first reveal; risk heightens stakes without losing clarity. Fresh angle rather than gimmick: 9+ earned.</comment>
