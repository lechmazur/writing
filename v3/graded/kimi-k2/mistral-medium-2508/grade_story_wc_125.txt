<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is textured and embodied (“his own breath hitched”), but the ethical-playful trait is asserted rather than dramatized; the final carving of the ladder is earned and costly, yet the prisoner remains off-page, limiting relational crucible pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the rope becomes a ladder, reweighting every prior choice; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern density tightens until the grotto’s resonance snaps the rope and reconfigures meaning with visible cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The terra-cotta grotto’s warmth, clay scent, and star-sieved sky are selective and POV-filtered; the rope’s texture and the beings’ light constrain the final carving, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“what to do with a thread once pulled”—is signaled early; pressure tightens through the rope’s hum, the beings’ added strand, and the final snap that forecloses escape and forces creation; cost is felt in burned hands and the unknown climb.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of impossible choice emerges organically from rope, beings, and ladder; final image reframes prior motifs without moralizing, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded, with rhythmic control (“tick—what was. tick—what could be”); perceptual signature is distinct and consistent; no head-hop or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is purposeful and patterned; no loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; final paragraph crystallizes without clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of prison-rope, energy beings, and pattern-weaving; the ladder-as-question feels inevitable yet non-obvious; risk-taking (lyric ellipsis, beings as silent listeners) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
