<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is embodied and specific; the contradiction between “hands remember” and “likeness always slipped” drives every micro-choice. The final renunciation—letting the coin fall—earns its cost through prior obsession with containment. One minor slip: “she understood” is a touch declarative amid otherwise visceral cognition.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the empty page becomes the first “true portrait,” reweighting the entire pursuit. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each glass cut and light shard layers density until the collapse reframes meaning. Cost is legible in the stillness of her fingers and the swallowed coin.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The oak’s wound, sap scent, and groaning beams are tactile constraints that shape every cut and channel. The fracturing dawn light through glass is not mere backdrop but the final instrument of meaning. Micro-setting (coin indentations) doubles as map and memory, charging the ending.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—containment versus surrender—tightens once: from carving faces to carving light. The single deepening (realizing the guild’s containment failed) forces her final stance. Cost is visible in the collapsing ceiling and the blank page that follows.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: the impossibility of holding the infinite. The blank page and swallowed coin offer a resonant, non-moral answer. No thematic echo lines; meaning accrues through image and action alone.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded in tactile perception—“her fingers twitching with the muscle memory of a thousand failed portraits.” Compression and elision are taught early and paid off in the final unpainted portrait. No POV drift; perceptual signature remains consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers texture without redundancy. Metaphors (“catch smoke in a net,” “river of gold fracturing”) are precise and earned. No loops or scaffold; rhythm modulates with urgency.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise—artist who forgot faces yet carves sky into wood—is fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The transformation of failure into blank-page acceptance feels both surprising and earned. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
