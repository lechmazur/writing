<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority is specific and embodied; the chronicler’s sideways sidling is dramatized in the grotto beat rather than asserted. Final act of pressing the cicada into the fisherman’s hand sells her definitive choice without speech; loss of verbal intimacy is the felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; micro-pressures (drip, cicada warming, exhalation) tighten stakes to a Charged Poise. Closure crystallizes a shared silence that forecloses explanation—felt loneliness is the clear price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Grotto’s damp stone, moon-ink, and single water drip are vivid micro-settings; the jade cicada as embodied constraint warms to pressure choice. The night sky returns in the final image, now charged with unspeakable cost.</comment>
<question>4</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant grief-stake is signaled early; the beat of pressing the cicada completes the tightening without ever naming the loss. Cost is the silence she gifts and must bear, legible on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question>
<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of time-as-texture is rendered through image, not aphorism; final pool-ripple dream reprises and darkens the earlier ripple, reweighting “transitions are never over.”</comment>
<question>6</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Tidal-chronicler diction is tactile—“salt-cracked hands,” “sea reconsidering the shore”—and held steady under lyric compression. Fisherman’s brief line carries weathered economy without voice bleed.</comment>
<question>7</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is rhythmic and compressed; figurative phrases are sparse and payoff-driven (“sound like a pinprick through fabric”). No loops or register drift; each sentence moves character, image, or cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Familiar grief/healing arc is revitalized by ecotone lens: chronicler reads human grief through tide-pool mechanics. Non-obvious synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight—yet remains rooted in abdominal specificity.</comment>
