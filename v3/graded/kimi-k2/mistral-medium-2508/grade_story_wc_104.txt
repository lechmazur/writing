<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lena’s contradictory impulses—caution versus recklessness—surface in the deliberate poppy-seed trap and the final scattering of seeds. Her interiority is embodied (“hands stained with dirt and purpose”) and her micro-choice to plant irregularly shows a hierarchy of values. The renunciation of the next vault visit tomorrow forecloses safety with visible cost. Only a hairline slip: the phrase “chained liberator” risks label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the wall forgotten, the future armed with life. Causal lens holds—every beat is linked by “because/therefore” logic from key sequence to planted seed. The cost is legible in the emptied pockets and the guard’s shouts fading behind her. Orientation is anchored within 120 words and never drifts.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The carnival’s rotting prizes and rusted piano bench constrain tactics (hidden vault, pit trap). Sensory detail is selective—yellowed keys, fogged breath—filtered through Lena’s urgent priorities. The broken sign’s creak recharges the final image. Environment directly shapes the final choice to scatter seeds irregularly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—plant resilience before capture—tightens when the wall falls and the guard appears. One decisive escalation: floorboards give way, narrowing escape routes. Cost is visible: empty pockets, hands stained, guard still behind her. Agency drives every turn; coincidence complicates but does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from concrete acts: patience as weapon, grace as strategy. Final image of poppies blooming wild reweights earlier symbols without moralizing. Subtext in the piano note’s “wrong” resonance and the sign’s ironic promise. No tidy moral; complexity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct—compressed, lyrical, urgent. Syntax tightens under pressure (“She didn’t wait to see him climb out”). Perceptual signature is selective: Lena notices rust, scent of rain, fletching texture. No head-hopping; POV remains locked and confident.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, propulsive. No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances. Metaphors are precise (“jagged scar of concrete and rust”). No overwriting; density high. Final line’s cadence crystallizes the reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: post-wall seed insurgency staged in a ruined carnival. Tropes of liberation and resistance are inverted—quiet seeds, not explosives. The arrow’s corn-husk fletching and piano key trap feel inevitable in hindsight. Risky structure pays off; no derivative echoes.</comment>
