<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Liora’s contradictory impulses—protect the island vs. preserve self—are dramatized in the seed-bite beat; the cost (loss of personal identity) is embodied in her violet-stained teeth and alien gaze. Interiority stays concrete, but the “reality checker” label is asserted more than shown in prior action, capping at 8.7.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the ridge’s memory subsumes Liora, reweighting the premise that dreams are mere echoes. Causal chain—seed → bloom → island voice—holds; cost is legible in her unrecognizable eyes. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The ridge, nightshade, and storm are not backdrop but agents: soil fissures guide seed placement, rain timing forces the bite. Micro-setting (seed in palm) constrains the decisive act. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve collective memory—tightens when Manik forgets his daughter, forcing Liora’s irreversible trade. One meaningful escalation: seed ingestion narrows options to total surrender. Cost is visible in her altered gaze and the ridge’s tremor.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: memory as living, predatory archive. Final image (Liora as island voice) reweights prior dream logic without moralizing. Subtext in the violet-stained smile carries the cost of communion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; perceptual signature (“taste like the first question ever asked”) is unmistakable. Compression and patterned elision are taught early and paid off. No POV drift; tense and stance stable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language serves pattern and closure. One minor loop—“the ridge trembled in agreement” echoes earlier personification—does not dull the final image. No register drift or clarity loss.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—memory as island organism—is fresh and fully committed to. Transformation test: story collapses if ridge/memory link is removed. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
