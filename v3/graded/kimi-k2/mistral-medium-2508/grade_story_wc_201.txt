<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Liran’s embodied trauma and micro-choices (pressing the strap as tourniquet, kneeling at the basin) are vivid and character-specific; the final renunciation of the equation is earned through prior sensory memory and carries visible cost. Interiority avoids label-speak, but the grandmother’s aphorism edges toward convenient wisdom rather than lived contradiction, capping the score just below 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the strap’s snap and the shift from ultraviolet to gold reweight the premise that mercy is absence, not formula. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each sensory return intensifies pattern until the final cadence shift. One causal link (forest pulls → clearing → basin vision) is slightly elliptical but coherent under lyric compression.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The ultraviolet forest’s bruise-colored glow and sap-blood bark constrain every step; the basin’s black water becomes the micro-setting that charges the final image. Spatial choreography is tight—roots coil, pillars ring, strap darkens—anchoring the POV without exposition. One minor drift: “first true dawn” arrives without earlier temporal cue, but the glow shift serves closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—whether Liran will surrender the mercy equation—tightens when the vision accuses him of unbrokenness. The pressure deepens via harmonic resonance that peels skin, forcing stance crystallization. Cost is felt in the strap’s bite and the forest’s exhalation; no reversal, but the deepening is sufficient for length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the concrete: mercy as the gap where numbers fail. The grandmother’s whisper and the final silence between bird-notes reweight the premise without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture—strap as restraint → strap as reminder—creating resonant ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded in proprioceptive detail (“every nerve a live wire”). Patterned elision (“three months of questions carved into his ribs”) is taught early and paid off in the final silence. No POV drift; diction stays within Liran’s fractured sensorium.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; figurative language clusters in low-action beats and breathes during crisis. No loops or scaffold; “sap, something like blood” risks mixed metaphor but fits the hallucinatory register. Rhythm accelerates into the harmonic resonance, then settles into the dawn hush.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of ultraviolet interrogation, mathematical mysticism, and embodied penance feels fresh and inevitable. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring closure; the mercy-as-absence concept reconfigures genre tropes into singular vision.</comment>
