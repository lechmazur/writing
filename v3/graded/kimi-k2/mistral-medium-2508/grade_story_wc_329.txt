<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Protagonist’s contradictory need—to revive wonder yet fear of discovery—lives in trembling bow and heart-signalling. Embodied emotion (“her own chest that had also been waiting”) and micro-choice (shell pressed to breastbone) anchor motivation; final renunciation (walking into the grove, violin resting) shows visible cost. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels; flaw (fatalistic resignation transformed into hope) alters final decision credibly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Inferred Accumulative/Textural lens: beats layer density—shell pulse, gear sloughing, ground crack—until final image reweights premise. Closure effect: statues melt into living roots. Cost legible because “the sky-bridge groaned” under wing weight, not decay; causality holds: her played heartbeats summon rebirth sequence. Only minor slip: causality between violin music + heartbeat + botanical miracle remains lyrical rather than literal, accepted under lyric lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Selective sensory filtering (rusted cables, brass petals, sap instead of oil) is vivid and tied to POV; enchanted orchard constrains options by mechanical patrol. “Tallest tree still wept sap” acts as micro-setting anchor that finally receives human seeding, charging the closure image. Consistency maintained across scale (individual tree to orchard sweep).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake (“to reawaken beauty vs machine routine”) signaled early. Tightening occurs when her heart-signal cracks the earth and statues grind toward her, forcing her final stance—keep playing, then renounce surveillance. Cost visible: brass gears shed, statues lose human form, personal instrument left behind, proving escalation under lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Emergent theme arrives via inversion: machine rule → living orchard. Non-literal answer in statuary roots becoming veins of new life. “World remembered listening” charges final image without moralizing. Some sentimentality in “the orchard exhaled” remains hairline acceptable.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Lush synaesthesia yet voice stays consistent—filtered through musician ear (cadences, vibrations). Metaphoric compression (statues remember wounds), near-fairytale syntax, taught through pattern early (metallic petals → organic pulse). No POV leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Varied rhythm—staccato sentences heighten tension before longer lyrical descent into root systems. Occasionally decorative metaphors “brass gears like dead skin” but justified by imagery. Zero loops; info density high across beats; final lines breathe with earned cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Synthesis of clockpunk orchard + heart-pulse music feels inevitable; transformation of cold statutes into living compost is non-obvious at outset yet foreshadowed. Distinct risk: lyrical disbelief willingly suspended because pattern taught early and closure rewards.</comment>
