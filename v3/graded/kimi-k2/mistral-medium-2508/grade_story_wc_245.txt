<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elian’s interiority is embodied and specific—salt/copper synesthesia, ring warmth, bone rune—yet the grief remains abstract until the final chord; the renunciation of external guidance is earned and costly, but the contradictory impulses (seek silence vs carry song) are stated more than dramatized in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the stillpoint is internalized, the ring cools, the path becomes chosen. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each absorbed note layers density until the final cadence reweights the premise with felt cost (“his heart full, hands empty”).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Ultrasonic forest is vivid and selective—sound-bent light, humming bark, cupped-branch clearing—yet the setting’s constraint on choice is mostly atmospheric; only the ring’s temperature and the bone rune directly alter tactics, keeping it just shy of the 9-band gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—mapping inner grief via outer silence—is signaled early and tightens once when the music stops; the cost is the surrender of external navigation, but the escalation is more accretive than sharply tested, satisfying the single-turn requirement for this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: grief cartographed rather than cured. The final image—melody carried in bone, silence equated with language—reweights prior motifs without moralizing, achieving Conceptual Repricing that lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet disciplined; synesthetic diction (“taste—salt for sorrow”) and rhythmic control under pressure create a distinct perceptual signature. Compression and patterned elision are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; figurative language is purposeful and patterned. Minor scaffold in the mirrored “didn’t walk so much as unfold / didn’t look back” costs a hairline slip, yet clarity at closure remains intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of synesthetic cartography and grief navigation; the ultrasonic forest and stillpoint concept feel inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, rewarded under the within-band bonus.</comment>
