<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The keeper’s interiority is vivid—embodied in moss, swan, and breath—but motivation (“to witness change without judgment”) remains a static mantra rather than a tested choice; no contradictory impulse is dramatized, so the final renunciation feels pre-ordained rather than earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each beat thickens the hush and decay until the final image crystallizes the keeper’s Earned Stasis—“let the library swallow them whole.” Closure is on-page, cost is felt, pattern taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Library, refuge, river, and paper birds are rendered with tactile specificity; the obsidian seam and backward-flowing water constrain the keeper’s access and final surrender, charging the closing image with irreversible weight.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—surrender to silence—intensifies via density and cadence shift rather than causal reversals; pressure tightens once when the swan dissolves, but the keeper’s agency is largely observational, so the cost is atmospheric rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of regenerative silence emerges through image and ritual rather than statement; final reconfiguration reweights the library from archive to womb, inviting reflection without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is distinct—lyric, patient, sensorily precise; rhythm modulates with the river’s pulse, and perceptual signature (“edges blurring”) remains coherent under pressure. No dialogue, so no voice leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid; metaphors serve atmosphere without crowding beats. Occasional soft phrases (“something older—regenerative silence”) risk abstraction, but no loops or artifacts mar the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Familiar tropes—ruined library, time-locked sanctuary—are transformed by the origami key and backward river; synthesis feels inevitable, not gimmicky, though risk level is moderate.</comment>
