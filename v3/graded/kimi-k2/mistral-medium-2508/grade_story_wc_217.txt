<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is textured and embodied; the poet’s contradictory impulse—yearning for completion yet cherishing incompleteness—drives every micro-choice. The final renunciation (“We are all just woven dawns, coming undone”) is earned by the prior handling of the feather, kite, and notebook. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible not tested. Flawed passivity is balanced by visible cost: the poem left deliberately unfinished.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure is a Charged Poise: the poet’s decision to leave the poem—and himself—unfinished reconfigures meaning with felt cost. Causality is lyric rather than plot-driven; each object (feather, kite, notebook) accumulates symbolic weight until the final line crystallizes the stance. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cobalt lagoon, rain-lifted air, and broken mussel shell are vivid, selective, and filtered through the poet’s perceptual bias. The feather and kite function as micro-settings that constrain choice: the feather becomes quill, the kite’s snapped string becomes wrist-bound reminder. Final image of “gold spilled across the lagoon” charges the closure with environmental recognition.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Dominant stake: whether to finish the poem or let it remain incomplete. Pressure tightens when the kite snaps and the poet chooses retrieval and reflection over completion. Cost is the deliberate surrender of closure—both artistic and personal. Escalation is subtle but legible under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: beauty resides in incompleteness, and acceptance of fracture is itself a form of wholeness. Subtext operates through objects (feather, kite) and gestures (wading in, tying string). Final line offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. No thematic drift; every image reweights the premise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric, controlled, and consistent; perceptual signature is poet’s synesthetic attention to color, texture, and sound. Syntax modulates with emotional intensity—long, flowing sentences calm, then tighten at the snap of the kite. No dialogue, so voice purity remains intact. Elision (e.g., “He didn’t write it down”) is purposeful and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet clear; figurative language is disciplined, never muddling causality. Rhythm breathes with scene needs—e.g., “the rain just lifted, the air still thick…” No loops, scaffold, or register drift. Final line lands with crystalline precision.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Premise—beauty in brokenness—is familiar, but execution is specific and risk-laden: the refusal to finish the poem is the climax. Objects (feather, kite) are transformed from detritus to instruments of meaning. No close echoes; synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
