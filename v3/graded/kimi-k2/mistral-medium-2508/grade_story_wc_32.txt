<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority—"stole because the crozier’s ruin mirrored his own"—anchors motivation in embodied shame, not labels. Contradictory impulses (renounce vs prove) act simultaneously as he feeds memories and doubt into the serpent’s crack. Micro-choice to whisper forbidden incantation crystallizes the hierarchy of values under cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the image of “a garden of glass petals” reweights the entire premise—creation is the refusal of death rather than its opposite. Drive lens holds as Causal—each because/therefore chain (feeding → fracture glow → silent explosion) culminates in this crystallized stance with visible cost (scar erasure = lost past).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The ember nexus’s copper veins, frozen violet bloom, and final garden all act as environmental constraint—the retort crystallizes into the very flower that bars the guild’s return. Consistent tactile grounding: cracked stone, frost breath, warmth-drinking eye-socket. Micro-setting success.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—interrupt stifling destiny—tightens as Elias trades memories & doubt for unmaking the past; visible price is the erasure of his scars and guild exile. Single escalation: from feeding doubt to final refusal of ashes-cage, agency intact, no off-stage rescue.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Theme emerges through refracted action: creative destruction becomes life-rescue rather than nihilism. Refusal to preach—“Some men are born to tend fires, not light them”—replayed by Elias now “to tend the fire and light it” is earned reversal. Resists tidy moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is compressed, lyrical, pattern-taught: “time stuttering like a damaged clock,” “penny-drop” recurrence carried across arc. No head-hopping; POV stays interior and sensory-certain, diction matching alchemist’s obsessive precision.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with tension—long spirals feeding the crozier, then clipped sentences at climax. One minor scaffold: “hummed... pulsed... trembled” near-start could trim, but doesn’t recur. No mixed metaphors in final bloom image—sustains clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Transformation of vivification from classic alchemy trope into mid-fall death interruption feels inevitable in hindsight. Crozier’s hunger, nexus’s cold, frozen petal garden—specific, non-generic. Risk (guild heresy punishment) fully embraced and charged.</comment>
