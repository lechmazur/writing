<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The locksmith’s interior contradiction—rule against opening vs. magnetic pull of the hair—drives every beat; her micro-choice to “listen” instead of pick crystallizes the arc. Embodied emotion (“hair pulsed warm as a living thing”) anchors stakes. Final renunciation (“letting the locked thing decide”) costs her certainty and earns stasis. Minor slip: the man’s motivation stays off-page, so relationship crucible is thin.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the map reweights the premise—locks may protect the world from the girl, not vice-versa—felt in the shop’s dissolution and reassembly. Causal chain holds: ribbon resists tools → meteorite pick → memory cue → ribbon self-unravels → map blooms → man vanishes. Cost is the locksmith’s shaken ontology (“shop tilting like a ship”). No orientation debt; disorientation is taught early and pays off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The nexus, lamplight, starlight, and meteorite pick form a micro-setting that constrains choice: celestial alignment cues the unlocking method. Sensory hierarchy (ozone, parchment scent) narrows under crisis. Spatial choreography clean as walls dissolve and reassemble. Final star-smudge behind grime recharges the motif with cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—whether to open the prison of fear—is signaled by the man’s demand and tightened when the map reveals the girl’s unasked question. Escalation is one deepening: from physical lock to conceptual prison. Protagonist’s agency drives the turn; cost is the loss of her rule-bound certainty. No external reversals needed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: freedom is not release but choice reclaimed by the imprisoned idea. Subtext in the ribbon’s bruised color and the locket she still cannot open. Final image—ordinary hair in pocket—reweights earlier motifs without moralizing. Complexity lingers: the girl’s awakening and the city’s held breath resist tidy closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise: “city’s alleys bled into silence,” “ink pooled like a wound.” Perceptual signature filters every detail through the locksmith’s tactile craft. Rhythm modulates with pressure—short clauses during dissolution, longer cadence in reflection. No POV drift; even cosmic moments stay anchored in her senses.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence layers image, emotion, and forward motion. Metaphors are fresh and coherent (“star sharp as a needle’s eye”). No loops or scaffold; occasional elevated diction (“ontology”) is justified by the conceptual climax. Final line hums with earned resonance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise—locksmith who opens metaphysical locks—is familiar, but the inversion that locks keep the world out feels new. Specificity of meteorite pick and bruised ribbon transforms trope. Risky cosmic dissolve pays off by reconfiguring stakes. Synthesis of craft, memory, and starlight is inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
