<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s interior drive—“deliver the storm to absences, then to the next alley”—rings true and threads every beat; the storm bottle becomes a lens on his refusal to quit. Lira’s foster-work shows a second, mirrored flaw that refracts Elias’s choice and costs her the last flicker of hope. The arc lands in a credible Earned Stasis: he walks straight through the drone shadow because he has already accepted he can never stop. Minor: the “respectfully rebellious” label is voiced rather than dramatized once, blunting the micro-choice moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: image layers (bottle, drones, letters) tighten stakes until the final image reconfigures meaning—“some borders aren’t meant to hold.” Closure appears on-page in a Charged Poise: Elias whistles across the line, accepting perpetual, unpaid cost. Directional causality is lyric, so small skips (teleporting the scar memory) are allowable; the pattern teaches itself. No orientation debt; temporal anchor arrives cleanly at “the last bell… twilight bled violet” ~65 words in.</comment>

<comment>The twilight median, cobalt arcade neon, and drone search-lights are specific to POV urgency and literally shape the timing of every move. The bottle’s “cool against palm” and “scent of rain on hot asphalt” constrain tactics and imprint the final image. Spatial rules stay consistent—drone sweep intervals, alley blind spot haunted by undelivered mail—to the last beat. Environment and object together charge the ending without ornamental overload.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: deliver a storm that maps broken promises. Stakes tighten when Lira shows that the letters are “waiting,” not lost; choice narrows to—carry this weight forever or abandon Lira. One credible reversal: storm’s revelation shifts mission from “heal” to “remember.” Cost is visible in Elias’s compulsion to cross borders anew—price paid before the reader’s eyes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Thematic question—“what do we owe the absent?”—is encoded in storm, letters, border. Emergence: the closing image reweights earlier motifs—drones, median, mail—into “constellations of absences” that compel continued motion. Subtext in Lira’s shaky fingers and drone hum avoids moralizing. One late echo (“constellations”) borders on explicit but is anchored in concrete particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice stays in Elias’s observational grit: “the air tasted like the moment before an apology,” perceptual and compressed. Diction matches a wind-worn courier; no register drift. Micro-editing rhythm rises during drone passes—short, clipped sentences—then opens into lyric calm once storm unfolds; pattern is purposeful and legible. Dialogue minimal; what exists serves subtext and status.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry multi-job loads: “storm unfolded, a slow peel of thunder… until the air tasted like rain.” One moment of overwriting—“respectfully rebellious”—but single use keeps penalty light (-0.3). Rhythm and punctuation accelerate with approaching drones, then exhale with the closure stasis. Minor filter cluster “he realized” twice, yet stakes never dull. Overall strong, clean propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</question>
<comment>Concept—bottled literal storm for emotional cartography—feels inevitable in hindsight and unique to this postal landscape. Tropes (dystopia drones, forbidden border crossing) are filtered through a compassionate courier myth stripped of cool-gadget glamor. Quiet ingenuity: the storm is both metaphor and operative tool, not a narrative gimmick. No near-echo sources; freshness intensifies stakes rather than distracting from them.</comment>
