<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Liora’s interiority is vivid—ink as bruise, moss reluctant to release her boots—but the brother’s apparition is too lightly sketched to exert crucible pressure; the final unfastening lands as earned renunciation yet lacks a visible relational cost because the brother remains spectral.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the saucer shatters, the glade exhales, and Liora’s unfastening forecloses the path of eternal mourning; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds—time pools, then releases—though the ledger-map beat could be one sentence crisper.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The midnight glade above clouds is rendered with selective sensory density—moonlight “bled,” moss “spongy”—and the saucer itself becomes micro-setting that constrains the final choice; however, spatial choreography of the apparition is momentarily vague.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—recovering lost time—tightens when the ink-ledger reveals each crack as a stolen year; the pressure deepens under Accumulative/Textural logic, and the cost (shattered saucer, acorn in palm) is legible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of hoarded grief versus released time emerges through concrete particulars—ink, acorn, unfastened clasp—without sermon; the final image reweights the premise in a quiet Conceptual Repricing that lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet disciplined: “slow unraveling of regret,” “time… waits”; perceptual signature is consistent, and purposeful compression (“She didn’t weep. She unfastened.”) heightens the final cadence without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; only one mixed metaphor (“ink… viscous as a starless sky” beside “roots”) momentarily jars; no loops or scaffold, and the final paragraph’s rhythmic hush is flawless.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Familiar motifs—lost sibling, cartomancy—are transformed through the specific conceit of time as accumulated substance; the acorn’s return feels inevitable yet fresh, and the risk of lyric abstraction is fully realized without gimmickry.</comment>
