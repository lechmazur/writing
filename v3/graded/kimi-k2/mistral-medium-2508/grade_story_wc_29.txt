<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Liora’s cautious hope is embodied in trembling fingers and calibrated dials; her contradictory impulses—risk vs. institutional exile—play out in real time. The micro-choice to transmit subsonics costs her plausible deniability and any return to academic grace, a visible price. Secondary characters appear only as distant reverberations, so relationship crucible is N/A; interiority is specific and unflinching.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: “because the signal changed, therefore Liora trespasses; because she transmits, therefore the campus conflict pauses.” Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise—where the signal’s new curiosity and her own uncertain reply crystallize stakes. Cost is legible: permanent exile implied by “Tell them I was just fixing the radio.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The basement radio station is tactile—dusty dials, ink-smudged charts, ventilation rattle—yet never catalogued. Charts and console act as micro-setting that constrains her every adjustment. Spatial choreography is clean; the building’s shiver under the first pulse is felt through the soles. No weather, but the hum in her teeth becomes environment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake: prove humanity is not a pawn. Pressure tightens once—signal’s pattern → Liora’s counter-melody → signal’s curious shift—each step narrows options and raises social cost. Agency is hers; coincidence complicates but does not save. The final silence on campus is a felt price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the weave: knowledge as contested territory, institutions as brittle as dying stars. Subtext lives in the signal’s laughter and the dean’s “interference” memo. The ending reweights the premise—communication possible, but at what institutional cost—without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: did she win or merely change the game?</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is precise, scientific yet haunted—“nest of angry stars,” “threading through the noise like a needle.” Syntax tightens under pressure: fragments when the pulse hits, longer breaths in reflection. POV stays locked; no filter-verb clutter. Dialogue is minimal but subtextual—“Tell them I was just fixing the radio” carries institutional dread.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every line advances stakes or atmosphere. Metaphors are fresh and consistent—“nest of angry stars,” “building’s bones.” No loops or scaffold; rhythm modulates with tension. Clean grammar, strong verbs, zero filler.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The cosmic-signal-as-institutional-mirror is a fresh synthesis; trope of alien contact becomes commentary on academic fracture. Specificity of subsonic counter-melody and ink-smudged charts makes the premise irreplaceable. Risk in blending hard SF with campus satire pays off; no derivative echoes.</comment>
