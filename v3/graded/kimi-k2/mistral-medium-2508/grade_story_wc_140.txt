<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Daniel’s interiority is vivid—his ghosted identity is embodied in tactile rituals (tracing ridges, pressing label to steel). The final renunciation—tearing his name from the ledger and sealing it into the container—carries visible cost and is foreshadowed by his earlier collecting of fragments. One slip: the “odd clarity” line risks diagnostic self-labeling, though it is quickly re-anchored in sensory action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Daniel’s self-erasure becomes a deliberate offering, reweighting the premise from victim to archivist of the forgotten. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each fragment collected tightens the pattern until the final layering in the crack. Causality is intact: the misfiled death certificate triggers the collecting, which in turn enables the ledger discovery and the final act. Cost is legible in the water closing “without a ripple.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The port labyrinth is rendered through Daniel’s biased perception—salt, rust, diesel, and corrugated steel become extensions of his body. Containers “lean in” and “sigh,” constraining movement and finally accepting his offering. Micro-setting (the poison label, the ledger crack) charges the final image. One minor drift: the stevedore’s lunch anecdote is vivid but slightly generic, not fully filtered through Daniel’s idiom.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to exist when officially dead—escalates via Daniel’s accumulating fragments and the discovery of his own crossed-out name. One clear tightening: the ledger forces the choice between reclaiming identity or completing the erasure. The cost is felt in the act of tearing the page and sealing it away. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens; no coincidences resolve the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of erased histories emerges organically from Daniel’s collecting ritual and the port’s forgotten cargo. The poison label’s warning reweights from literal hazard to metaphor for unswallowable pasts. Final image—label turned “something like gold”—offers a non-literal answer: some poisons must be absorbed to be transformed. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in the silent water.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and consistent: lyrical compression, maritime diction (“groan of cranes,” “tide’s drag”), and perceptual bias toward texture over name. Syntax modulates with fatigue—longer cadences collapse into short, breathless clauses as sleeplessness peaks. No head-hopping; POV remains tightly interior. One near-slip: “odd clarity” momentarily lifts to an abstract register, but the surrounding sensory anchoring rescues it.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each line layers image and theme (“the labyrinth’s maw,” “language of rust”). No loops or scaffold; redundancy is zero. Metaphors are precise and internally coherent—poison label as second skin, water closing without ripple. Minor: “odd clarity” is the only phrase that edges toward cliché, but its context limits the drag.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The bureaucratic death-error premise is transformed into a ghost-archive myth specific to the port’s container maze. The collecting of overheard fragments as existential glue feels non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric compression pays off: the final image recharges every prior fragment without gimmickry. No close echoes of famous scenes; the synthesis is singular.</comment>
