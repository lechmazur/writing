<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction is present—he guards silence yet is asked to surrender it—but embodied emotion is more gestural than visceral; final endurance reads as credible renunciation. Late reliance on retrospective “travelers came later” summary dulls immediate cost. Trait “tranquilly perceptive” is shown through the wind-gaze but not materially tested beyond stillness. Micro-choices (finger tracing box, exhale onto glass) are specific and character-bound.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands: Earned Stasis—he remains silent but releases covenant with visible environmental bloom as cost. Causality is accumulative/textural lens; pressure deepens through image density rather than plot linkage. One transition (time jump forward) is allowed and the shift to future blooms retroactively pays image of handprint on glass. Orientation clear within three sentences.</comment>

<comment>Environment—oasis sand ribs, melted wax tears, fractured stained glass—constrain every beat. Single prop (box) doubles as setting anchor and spiritual vault; its cracking seam provides tactile hinge for release. Spatial grounding (“on his lap”, “atop the oldest hive”) tracks cleanly. Final raindrop in desert reprises without falling into cliché.</comment>

<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake is explicit: release vs preserve the covenant; pressure tightens when ghosts solidify and seam shivers. Agency rests in his decision not to speak aloud but to exhale (action) and open box (renunciation). Cost legible: lifelong silence cannot be reclaimed once breached, even though renunciation is inaction.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from silence as preservative rather than absence; final hum of bees + wind now carries “his” name without spoken voice (non-literal answer). Subtext refrains from moral statement. Ghost transformation from regret to carried memory subtly reweights prior guilt without exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric compression: “skeletal frames...ribs of buried giants” lands concrete image. Perceptual signature is hushed with tactile precision. No head-hopping or POV drift. Ellipsis taught early and legible at closure (wind speaks bees’ name).</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences varied rhythm: “box had no hinge” three beats tighten line. Occasional poetic density (“pressure made his teeth ache”) risks overwriting but constrained within single emotive beat. No loops, no redundant paraphrase. Final raindrop phrase economical.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.7</question>
<comment>Transformation of haunting into covenant-release is non-obvious and feels inevitable. Silence-as-preservation angle reframed into environmental resurrection without cliché. Risk of magic-realist bee ghosts earns coherence because introduced early and carried to ecological payoff.</comment>
