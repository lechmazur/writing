<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s contradictory impulses—restlessness to leave vs. duty to the library—are dramatized in the violet hand-off; renunciation of flight costs him the name he keeps molting. Interiority is embodied (“itch behind his ribs”) and specific. Maren’s status as ex-librarian applies immediate pressure; their shared silence hums with stakes. The micro-choice to stay (and lie about it) forecloses escape with felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elias’s lie and the violet exchange crystallize a choice to remain, reconfiguring the stake from flight to rooted resistance. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each salvaged book, poem, and name layers density until the final lamp-lit image reweights the premise. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by 120 words. Cost is visible in the tightening of his throat and the quieting of the “itch.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The rusted library, violet, and tin function as micro-settings that constrain choice: the tin’s false bottom hides contraband poems, the violet becomes a promise token, the library’s broken bars let moonlight in. Sensory detail is selective—fogged breath, groaning shelves—filtered through Elias’s scavenger priorities. Weather and decay guide action (hunkering under the awning, sorting books by lamplight). Final image recharges the setting as a “rusted heart beating.”</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether Elias will flee or stay to nurture the library’s resistance—is signaled early. Escalation is one deepening: the violet’s arrival tightens the emotional cost of departure. Agency drives the turn; coincidence (Maren’s arrival) complicates but does not resolve. The final renunciation carries a visible price—the lie and the surrendered name—under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of beauty forged from anarchy emerges through concrete acts: salvaging discarded poems, pressing violets, memorizing the dead. Subtext in the violet hand-off and the lie about “only as far as the next cart” carries more weight than any statement. Final image of “planting something fiercer than fire” offers a resonant, non-literal answer. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in the guards’ inevitable arrival.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded in tactile detail—“ink made from soot and rainwater.” POV remains tight to Elias; no head-hopping. Syntax modulates with pressure: longer cadences in reflection, clipped fragments when the itch flares. Dialogue sparse but subtextual (“Some of us bloom in the dark”). Distinct perceptual signature—his scavenger’s eye for salvageable beauty—persists to the final line.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; sentences often do two jobs (“the moon clawed free of the skyline” sets time and mood). Occasional lyric inflation (“silver wound in the sky”) skirts overwriting but stays within voice. No loops or scaffold; pronouns and spatial tracking clean. Final paragraph’s rhythm—short clauses building to the lamp-lit image—earns its cadence shift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Familiar post-collapse library trope is transformed through the penny poet’s monthly molting and the violet-as-promise device. Specificity of soot-ink and waterlogged Frankenstein roots the world. The synthesis of prison discard poetry and pressed flowers feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk in lyric compression pays off; no derivative echoes.</comment>
