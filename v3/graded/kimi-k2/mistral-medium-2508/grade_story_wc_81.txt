<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is precise and embodied—his pulse stays steady, his fingers “trace” and “brush” with tactile purpose. The contradiction between his stated desire for stillness and his compulsive pursuit of hidden truth is dramatized in micro-choices (testing the stamp, leaving the chamber untouched). The final Earned Stasis—returning to the table, now burdened by foreknowledge—carries visible cost in the “ghost of a touch.” Minor slip: the ledger of future decisions is accepted too smoothly, blunting the shock.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elias steps back into the water, the library “no longer silent,” the blackout’s purpose revealed. Causal chain holds—stamp → coordinates → chamber → book → choice—without gaps. The blackout’s engineered nature is inferred rather than declared, satisfying the lens. One hairline slip: the book’s predictive list is presented without prior seeding, slightly straining causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The sunken library is evoked through selective, pressure-driven detail—“water lapping at his knees,” “rust-eaten shelves,” the pressure lock’s hiss. Environment constrains every move: rising water, sealed doors, the lamp’s narrow cone. The final image of the ocean’s “slow breath” recharges the opening stillness with new weight. No orientation drift; spatial anchors remain crisp.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth versus curated silence—tightens when Elias realizes the blackout is deliberate. One decisive turn: discovering his own future mapped in the book, which forces the choice to leave the chamber intact. Cost is felt in the closing line: “Some stillness wasn’t meant to be shared.” Pressure escalates under causal logic; no coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of reclaimed stillness emerges from action: stillness as complicity versus stillness as weaponized knowledge. The stamp’s reprise in the blank page offers a non-literal answer—silence chosen, not imposed. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in the unread ledger. Subtext operates in the final refusal to speak: “They never asked why.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is spare, tactile, and consistent—Elias notices “warped pages,” “salt and old paper,” never drifting into exposition. Syntax tightens under pressure: “He closed the book. The blackout would end soon.” No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains anchored in Elias’s methodical lens. The final cadence—“Elias turned the page”—echoes the opening motion, now reweighted.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and propulsive; every sentence advances stakes or atmosphere. No loops, no scaffold. Figurative language is sparse and precise—“ghost of a touch” lands without overwriting. Rhythm modulates naturally; paragraph breaks serve emotional beats. One minor filter-verb cluster (“he adjusted,” “he readjusted”) could tighten further.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The premise—post-flood archive as panopticon—feels fresh, synthesized through Elias’s archival obsession rather than exposition. The predictive ledger twist is seeded just enough to feel inevitable. Risk lies in the quiet ending; it pays off by recharging the opening stillness. No derivative echoes; specificity anchors the concept.</comment>
