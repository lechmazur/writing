<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Liora’s contradictory impulses—clinging to the sundial yet dropping the ledger—are embodied in micro-choices (steering toward marshes, pocketing vs. discarding). The final renunciation carries visible cost: she forfeits the map and the auction gold. Interiority stays concrete; no therapy-speak. Only the “architecture of lies” phrase edges toward label-speak, but it’s brief.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the sundial’s inward-pointing shadow reweights the premise, and the ledger’s sinking is a felt cost. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of reflection and cadence shift carry the turn. Orientation is clear by line 4; no causality breaks. One transition (canal split) is clean. No late rule changes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Canal, mist, algae-slick piling, and the sundial as micro-setting all constrain choices: the split path, the warmth cue, the final steering into light. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered. Environment evolves with action; no static postcards. The sundial’s final charge on the image earns the 8+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding vs. relinquishing her father’s lies—tightens when she drops the ledger; the option to decode is foreclosed. Pressure grows through reflective density rather than external reversals, fitting the Accumulative lens. Cost is visible: loss of map and gold. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the tension between salvage and surrender; the sundial’s reprise crystallizes it without moralizing. Subtext in the inscription and the radio’s last broadcast deepen resonance. Final image of steering into uncertain light offers non-literal answer. No thematic drift or sermonizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded in tactile detail (“brass edges pitted with age”). Perceptual signature is consistent—Liora’s selective noticing of light, water, and decay. No head-hopping or register drift. Rhythm modulates with emotional beats; compression is purposeful and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; sentences do multiple jobs. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful (“blade through old parchment”). Clarity remains high even under lyric pressure. Minor elevation in diction is voice-motivated and consistent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: post-apocalyptic salvage quest reframed as interior archaeology. Sundial-as-key-that-fits-no-lock is a non-obvious twist. Specificity of canal culture and the radio’s last broadcast feel lived-in. Risk in quiet, reflective closure is earned and coherent.</comment>
