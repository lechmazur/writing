<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lena’s interior contradiction—yearning to salvage the lost while believing salvage impossible—drives her midnight choices. Embodied moments (hand warming bronze, exhale fogging metal) ground her grief. Endurance is earned: she stays on the cliff, re-mapping absence, accepting the cost of never leaving. One detail felt therapy-adjacent: “ache in her ribs” teeters near label-speak but is rescued by the tide analogy two words later.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Lena chooses to keep building instead of returning inland, cost written into “the weight in her chest felt lighter”—a felt shift from anchor to duty. Causal chain holds: moon call → cryptic coordinates → new map → dialing a next voice; no teleportation of props. The final image of fresh paper in the typewriter crystallizes stance: still building, still listening. Minor ellipsis—how Lena translates riddles to ink in real time—is implied rather than shown, but ambiguity doesn’t rupture tension.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Station and cliff function as live set: salt wind shears at antennae, groaning metal tightens stakes. Micro-setting (censer foot) constrains choices—its warmth decides when the next call is real. Time, weather, and crumbling cliff all evolve with the scene and charge the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake (reverse migration for the dead) is signaled early and deepened each lunar cycle. Each midnight call is a tightening: the voices grow clearer or dissolve, forcing new coordinates. Final cost is articulated—the footsteps in the sand belong to a stranger now walking inland—foreclosing Lena’s chance to leave.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from specific objects and actions—maps as anchors rather than escape routes. No sermon, no moral. Final image of bronze fogged with breath reweights loss as continuing labor instead of closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Distinct cadence—long salt-laced sentences modulate to terse phone fragments. Dialogue carries subtext: “Is this the way back?” answered only “Start walking,” both threat and lifeline. Free indirect style slips seamlessly into Lena’s noticing—every sensory filter is hers.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Craft is vivid but borders overwritten in two spots: “antennae swaying…humming with the ghosts” stacks metaphor. No paraphrase loops; pronouns clear; rhythm accelerates without clutter. One typo risk: “pulses faintly when the moon swelled”—tense stutter. Minor, not closure-dulling.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Transforms the rescue trope inside-out: the guide refuses sea rescue to help the drowned *return inland* through maps. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight. Specificity—rusted antennae, oxidation bloom—grounds the metaphysical twist. Risk (elliptical mapping device) pays off.</comment>
