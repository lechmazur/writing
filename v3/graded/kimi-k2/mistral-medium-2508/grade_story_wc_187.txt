<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Summer-Quill’s preemptive nostalgia is embodied in tactile micro-choices—kneeling, pressing fingers to stone, tracing absent shadows—culminating in the earned renunciation of her dam-building impulse. The contradiction between collecting memories and letting them flow is dramatized, not labeled, and the final smile carries visible cost: she forfeits the archivist’s need to name and pin. Interiority is character-specific, sensory, and avoids diagnostic jargon. The lone flaw: the “vision” of her older self edges toward convenient epiphany rather than discovered contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the shift from sculpting identity to surrendering to the river of memory is legible, felt, and irreversible. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each image (flags, spear, rain) accrues weight until the final hush reconfigures meaning. Causality is preserved: the tactile examination of shadows triggers the offered memory that dissolves her method. Cost is on-page: she leaves no footprints, abandoning the compulsion to record.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The stormlit observatory, crystal flags, and breathing fog are not backdrop but active constraints: the flags hum under rain’s afterecho, the fog’s solidity dictates when she works, the Spear’s shadow bleeds and twitches. Micro-setting (stone under palm, refracted rain) charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; weather affects choice. Only the brief “market long dissolved” risks postcard nostalgia.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—identity versus archival control—is signaled early and tightens through sensory pressure: each crystal flag’s borrowed memory raises the cost of possession. The decisive turn is the offered memory that forces renunciation; agency remains hers. No external antagonist needed; coincidence complicates (shadow twitches) but does not resolve. The price—leaving no footprints—makes the cost visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from action: memory as river, not vault. Subtext lives in gesture—tracing absence, smiling at absurdity—never in thesis. The final hush reweights the premise without moralizing: the past makes room, and she accepts the silence. Complexity is honored; no tidy moral is offered.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise: “the breath of the unspoken,” “stormlit panes,” “afterecho” create a perceptual signature consistent with an archivist who tastes language. Syntax modulates with pressure—long cadences for reflection, clipped fragments for the shadow’s twitch. No head-hopping; POV remains tightly bound to Summer-Quill’s senses. Compression is purposeful and taught early.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive: each sentence layers image, emotion, and concept without redundancy. Figurative language is controlled—no mixed metaphors or purple drift. Rhythm accelerates toward the final hush, then exhales. Minor risk of overwriting in “frosted glass” and “smoke below,” but these serve atmospheric pressure rather than ornament.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of archivist, memory-river, and preemptive nostalgia feels fresh and inevitable. The transformation of shadow-measurement from timekeeping to identity-sculpting to surrender is non-obvious yet grounded. Specificity anchors universals: crystal flags, fog-solidity, footprints. No close echoes of famous scenes; the vision of her older self is earned, not gimmick.</comment>
