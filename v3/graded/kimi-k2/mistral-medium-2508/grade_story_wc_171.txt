<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Veyra’s interiority is embodied and specific—thumb on the soft new notch, pulse tremor masked by training. The contradiction between hope and cynicism is dramatized in the moment she admits “Probably” to Kael, not summarized. Micro-choice hierarchy is clear: she chooses to keep the clipboard and walk away, foreclosing vengeance. Cost is felt in the weight under her arm and the rain she refuses to watch.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the signature dries, the terrace exhales, and the stake shifts from “end the war” to “pay the next installment of redemption.” Causal lens holds—every beat is because/therefore, no off-stage resolution. Orientation is anchored by line 3. Cost is legible in the soft wood and the rain coming.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The terrace’s stones, lavender scent, and skeletal vines constrain the ritual space and echo the dead. The clipboard functions as micro-setting: its weight and notches guide Veyra’s grip and decision. Sensory selection is urgent—gunpowder and crushed lavender, not tourist catalog. Final image of gold shadows and approaching rain recharges the setting with surrender and renewal.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“the price of stopping”—is signaled early and tightened when Kael’s hand shakes over the blade. One meaningful turn: the signature forecloses immediate violence and reweights the cost of future betrayal. Agency is Veyra’s; coincidence only complicates. Price is visible in the soft notch and the rain that will wash the terrace clean.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of redemption as installment plan emerges from the clipboard’s notches and the ritual’s repeated failure, never stated. Subtext in Kael’s “Next time, bring stronger ink” and Veyra’s refusal to look back. Final image of gold shadows offers non-literal answer: surrender is also beginning. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise—“operatively gentle,” “quiet violence of hope.” Syntax modulates with pressure: longer cadence for ritual, clipped fragments for Kael’s laugh. Perceptual signature is Veyra’s: she notices callouses catching on grief, scent of rain, weight of ebony. No head-hopping; focalization stays locked.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; every sentence advances stakes or atmosphere. Figurative language is selective—“dark as the void between stars” once, not stacked. No loops or scaffold; “lavender, dust, the ghost of something like peace” compresses three senses in five words. Rhythm breathes with the ritual’s slow dance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Familiar war-treaty frame is transformed by the clipboard-as-archive-of-failure and the ritual’s recycled relics. Fresh angle: redemption priced in installments, not absolution. Specificity of ink from ashes and pen from olive root grounds the concept. Risk in lyric mode pays off; closure remains legible.</comment>
