<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lena’s contradictory impulses—vengeance and restraint—are embodied in the silent fob and the withheld knife; her final renunciation of violence carries visible cost as the harbor claims Veyne. Interiority is specific, never diagnostic, and micro-choices (letting the fob dangle, laughing softly) reveal value hierarchy under pressure. The only drag is a touch of competence smoothing: she never missteps, which blunts flaw-driven tension.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each beat (false ledger, baited map, named rival) tightens Veyne’s noose until the truce of hush snaps. Closure is a Charged Poise—the quiet after the break—whose cost is legible in the dawn smoke and the market’s unspoken verdict. Orientation is immediate; no teleporting props or retroactive patches.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The pier’s groan, salt-bleached planks, and anise breath ground every move; the fob itself becomes micro-setting that constrains Lena’s tactics. Sensory selection narrows under pressure—only the watch chain’s glint and Veyne’s twitching left hand matter. Weather and spatial choreography remain coherent; no static cataloging.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—capture the sound of trust breaking—escalates through each feint until the final crack narrows Lena’s path to silent witness. Agency is hers: the ledger, map, and rival are all deployed to force Veyne’s betrayal. Cost is felt in the harbor’s inevitable dawn reckoning.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the particulars of hush, debt, and inheritance; no moralizing. The fob’s silent weight reconfigures meaning at the end—some debts aren’t paid in coin. Subtext thrives in the market’s held breath and the unspoken rule of the tide.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is salt-rough, rhythmic, and character-bound: “curiously steadfast gaze” and “syrup-thick murmur” feel lived-in. Compression and elision are purposeful; no POV leakage. Dialogue is sparse but subtext-laden, each line pursuing goal or concealment.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is lean yet textured; every sentence advances atmosphere or tactic. No loops, no mixed metaphors. Rhythm modulates with tension—short clauses under pressure, longer breaths at dawn. Occasional lyric lift (“smoke curling into the pale morning like a question”) earns its place.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Familiar revenge frame is transformed through the sonic conceit of “the sound of trust breaking” and the inherited fob’s silence. Specificity of the pirate market and moonshine routes keeps it from template territory. One fresh inflection: vengeance achieved by letting the market’s own code devour the villain.</comment>
