<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lior’s interiority is textured and embodied—her intake of salt-tinged air, the weight in her palm—but the contradiction between “intuition map” and “anchor weight” only stated, not dramatized during the crisis moment, softening the cost. The shift from observer to bridge-bearer feels declared, not struggled.</question>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The chosen Accumulative/Textural lens holds until the luminous reprise where the lens fragment reframes the past as “current to navigate.” Closure lands with felt cost—the market dims and the crowd freezes—yet the price on Lior remains emotional synopsis rather than embodied dent.</question>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The swaying rope-market is sketched with economical sensory hooks—“ropes groaning,” “groan of lantern light”—and the rooftop edge constrains final motion. Spatial coherence is clear even though the city below is abstract.</question>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—uncover overlooked histories—is tightened when the lens embeds Elara’s log, then re-tightened when Lior pockets the brush, foreclosing return as mere observer. The escalation is single but meaningful under the chosen lens.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of memory-as-current quietly threads via the lens, the brush, the eternal instant; no exposition intrudes. The final lullaby reframes the past as “a current,” a resonant non-literal restatement free of moralizing.</question>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Lyrical compression (“the ropes singing the music in it”) is distinct while remaining legible. A single micro drift occurs—“they’d all been here before”—but re-inscription in the closure image earns it as intentional echo.</question>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Prose sings but occasionally stacks metaphors in tight succession; line “salt, oil lamps burning low, of a child’s hand slipping” flirts with overload yet the rhythm is purposeful rather than clogging. No loops dull momentum.</question>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The suspended alchemist market and lens-as-instrument turn familiar tropes of memory-quests into a fresh weight-bearing metaphor. The closing motion of “step forward into the turn” feels inevitable yet unexpected, earned by tonal patterning rather than plot gymnastics.</question>
