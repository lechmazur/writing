<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The poet’s immortality and vocation root her every impulse; interiority hums with sensory contradiction—ink-veined hands vs stone-split motion. The postcard-driven micro-choice (“she ate the third copy”) crystallizes an earned renunciation of despair. No secondary character dilutes focus; the soldier ghost becomes an extension of her creative pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Track B mosaic cleared: four shards blossom toward one closure beat under Accumulative lens. “She ate the third copy” and sealed shell constitute a Resonant Reconfiguration—earned stasis foreclosing death-cure voyeurism. Time and nature anchors appear by first shard; no Orientation debt accrued.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The shell’s calcium veins literally house acoustic lullabies that bend choice—the wall-niche acoustics position the postcard as altar and megaphone. Jellyfish pulses, kelp, and coral collapse interior/exterior boundaries, final coral fill functioning as setting-driven transformative tool.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: “turn war-rot into star-bread”—pressure tightens from new war drums to louder singing. One spiral intensification suffices: her decision to amplify lullabies flowers rifles into poppies, exacting vocal and vascular strain “metallic tang of verses not yet bled.”</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges via gradient: swords-to-petals, rot-to-reef—never sermonized. Final manual-title drop, “The Alchemy of Staying,” arrives as conceptual re-pricing, not exposition. The postcard’s trajectory (keepsake → gospel → ingested seed) embodies that stay-fold without pronouncing morality.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person lyric sustained throughout; compressed syntax mirrors insomnia’s perpetual vigil. Ghost’s accusation—“You sing to us” / “I sing through you”—carries identity-indistinct subtext, not head-hopping. Vocal texture “slow, insistent rhythm of something growing” echoes in shell-rhythm and page-rhythm alike.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Aural layering—consonant clash in “crushed violets and gunpowder turned to pollen”—powers information density; no paraphrase loops detected. Each metaphor multiplies work: coral not décor but embodied cost of ghost. Line momentum peaks with the coral-helmet image without overwriting nearby beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Consummate risk: centuries-long shell-hermit poet who eats hope-manual to seed next era. Intrinsic trope—undying bard—flipped into rigorous gardening manual, calcium reef replacing throne. Specificity on pressed petal stems moist with soldier tears prevents template drift; coral helmet final image is unforeseeable yet inevitable.</comment>
