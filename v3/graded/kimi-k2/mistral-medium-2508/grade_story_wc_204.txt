<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s interior contradiction—decades spent imprisoning whispers yet yearning to free them—drives every micro-choice; the final renunciation costs him the library and his own ontological footing, felt in the line “the system wasn’t the world. It was him.”</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: Elias’s self-recognition as the system reweights all prior containment acts; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds as pattern-break (frost veins, mirrored libraries) tightens to the single breath before rupture, cost etched in “the page in his pocket burned away.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The glass orchard’s suspended shelves and frost-etched windows constrain every move; the press, bottle, and dissolving walls function as micro-setting that charge the final image when “the last of the glass orchard shattered into starlight.”</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—whether to release the destabilizing whisper—tightens once when frost patterns signal imminent rupture; Elias’s agency forces the trade-off, paying with the library’s collapse and his own erasure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of liberation-through-self-dissolution emerges from Elias’s embodied choices; the final non-literal answer—“the world, at last, began to rustle”—reweights every prior act of containment without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is crystalline, tactile, and character-bound: “ink that wasn’t ink at all, but liquid time”; rhythmic compression under pressure (“The library shuddered. Books tumbled…”) sustains lyric coherence without opacity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and conceptual density (“compressing eternity into a single, fragile page”); figurative language disciplined to pattern taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Familiar motifs—library, apothecary bottle, cloud-sea—are transformed through Elias’s specific craft and sacrifice; the synthesis feels inevitable, the risk of self-erasure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
