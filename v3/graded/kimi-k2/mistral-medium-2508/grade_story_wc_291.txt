<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elias’s contradictory impetus—the cold method against the pull of buried empathy—simultaneously act inside the quarry scene; his micro-choice to speak Liora’s name and pocket the sketch charges the final renunciation. The face-blind “portraitist of the invisible” reads specific and lived; no therapeutic self-diagnostics intrude. Closure cost: carrying guilt that cannot be remedied yet compels the next case.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. Pressure steepens via density of sensory returned memory, culminating in a Charged Poise where Elias accepts unpayable tribute. The ending reconfigures what “witness” costs without a tidy epilogue. Closure holds: on-page warmth of the lance brands the memory, final line steps toward undeniable next weight.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Quarry mist, lance, ribbon, and damp stone act as extensions of body and memory, forcing tactile choices and charging the final image. Early anchoring within 90 words; spatial choreography tight. Not every sense is cited, yet the embodied texture suffices for stakes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake: give erased dead a witnessed name. One decisive intensification—vision of Liora’s struggle—compresses pressure and solidifies Elias’s stance. Agency drives the tightening; external silence does not resolve conflict, only crystallizes cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of bearing unpayable witness emerges through concrete echo-motion and the warming lance; no authorial commentary. Final pocketed ribbon and scarf adjustment offer a non-literal answer: carry, don’t fix. Complexity intact: mayor’s impunity acknowledged without moral cartoon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is distinct Elias: sensory-obsessed, compressive, running metaphors of surgical memory. Rhythmic control under pressure (“furrowing hush”) and selective detail (only her shoulder curve noted) create perceptual signature. No dialogue intrusions; lyric fragment sustained.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>High-density lines that scaffold nothing: each image threads to goal or theme. No loops, clichés, or overlaid metaphors muddy peak beat near closure. Natural cadence variation supports quiet but resounding ending.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Lyric resurrection of an unsolved murder through face-blind art memory offers non-obvious synthesis, grounded in tactile quarry wounds. The metaphoric “wounding = remembering” feels inevitable, not contrived. Innovation heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
