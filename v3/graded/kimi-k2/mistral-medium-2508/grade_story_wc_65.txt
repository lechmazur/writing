<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Liora’s interior contradiction—wanting neither prophecy nor control yet choosing to “coax” the future—drives every micro-choice; the earned hesitation before the first dot shows visible cost and anchors her stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: dot→spread→song→confirmation maps clear because/therefore linkage; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—the ink settling “brighter, surer” publicly reweights the stake and pays the cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The spire’s surface swallowing dawn, the comet-ink blooming, and the ice ledger constraining where pressure may be applied all integrate setting objects into choice; however, the bridges and domes remain described, not enacted.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—“the future is malleable, a clay pot”—tightens once: hesitation → dot → confirmation; the price—the spire’s song vibrating her bones—makes the cost visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</question><comment>The theme of creative humility emerges via concrete particulars: the kingfisher’s dive trusted before sight; the final image of footprints being only the first offers a resonant, unspoken answer without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The prose is a controlled lyricism—“brighter, surer”/“trust the ripple of air”—with rhythmic propulsion; POV bias is flawlessly consistent, teaching the reader patterned elision early and holding it.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Only micro lapses—“malleable, a clay pot on the wheel” leans slightly generic—but every sentence thickens meaning without overwriting; no clarity lost in the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</question>
<comment>The ignorance-cartographer premise, comet-ink medium, and predictive-map-as-conversation cohere into a distinctive, non-obvious synthesis; the world is memorably different without drifting into gimmick.</comment>
