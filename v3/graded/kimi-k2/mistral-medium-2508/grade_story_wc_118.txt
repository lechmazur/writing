<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is vivid—his tactile handling of the tapestry and the diary ashes shows embodied contradiction between preservation and surrender. The final smile is earned by prior renunciation of balance, but the cost is more atmospheric than viscerally felt, capping the score just below 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the world tilts, the tapestry warms, and Elias accepts unbalance. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each object and diary fragment layers resonance until the final image reconfigures meaning. Cost is legible in the ash words and the hook behind his ribs.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The silo’s metal skin, the fireplace’s cold mouth, and the dragons’ re-ignited fire all constrain Elias’s choices and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered; the reclaimed grain bin as library is economically anchored and causally active.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—collect stories before they vanish—tightens when the tapestry’s axis moves and the world tilts. One decisive intensification: Elias lets the displacement hook him, trading balance for story. Cost is visible in the ash of the diaries and the bronze-quiet hum.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of memory versus forgetting emerges through tactile objects and embodied action; no explicit moralizing. The final image—Elias walking into wind with dragons pulsing in his pocket—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to what remains after dreams die.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; perceptual signature is Elias’s sensitive fingertips and rust-hinge exhalations. Patterned elision (“the walls remembered”) is taught early and paid off at closure. Rhythm modulates with pressure, no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. No loops or mixed metaphors. Minor scaffold in “the dragons were waiting. So was he.” keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Post-apocalyptic librarian collecting stories in a grain-bin archive feels fresh; dragons as axis of a displaced world is a non-obvious synthesis. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring closure.</comment>
