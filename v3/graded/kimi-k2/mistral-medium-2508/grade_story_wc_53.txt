<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira’s contradictory impulses—clinging to fragments yet refusing to be reclaimed—are embodied in tactile micro-choices (camera wheel to temple, jump into lagoon). The final renunciation carries visible cost as the lagoon “remembers” and pulls her under, foreclosing escape. Ghost-Lira’s taunt crystallizes the internal conflict without overt exposition. Minor: age drift never constrains an on-page choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Lira yields to the past’s embrace, cost paid in surrender to the lagoon’s hands. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of ghost-images and camera frames intensifies until the blank final frame reweights meaning. Orientation is taught early via the rusted carousel and mist surface. One causal micro-turn: jump tests whether the lagoon will “catch her differently.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Carousel, lagoon, and camera wheel are rendered with selective sensory detail that constrains choice: the brass horses’ chipped paint mirrors Lira’s erosion; the lagoon’s thickness determines the physics of her final leap. Micro-setting (camera wheel) functions as charged object that reappears in the blank frame. Spatial choreography is coherent; no white-room syndrome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—refusing to let younger selves follow—tightens when ghosts surface and demand accountability. Escalation is accretive: each camera frame adds pressure until the blank frame voids the possibility of reconstruction. Cost is visceral: surrender to the lagoon’s memory. Agency remains Lira’s; coincidence (ghosts emerging) complicates rather than resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of eroded ambition emerges from concrete particulars: blueprint turned secret, bridge left skeletal. Final image—blank frame and remembered hands—offers resonant non-moral answer about irreversible loss. Subtext in ghost dialogue (“bring something better than a camera”) reframes regret as inadequate currency. No sermonizing; complexity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise: “wind that never ceased,” “ink in rain.” Compression taught early (“kinetic lagoon”) and paid off in final leap. Perceptual signature filters every detail through Lira’s scavenger bias. No POV drift; ghost speech is external, not ventriloquized interiority. Rhythm modulates with pressure—short clauses at climax.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: every sentence advances image or stakes. Metaphors are controlled (“gears groaned,” “bones snapping”). No loops or scaffold; blank frame lands clean. Minor: one mixed metaphor (“ink in rain” beside “white static”) but does not blur closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Carousel-as-memory-engine and lagoon-as-memory-substance synthesize familiar tropes into fresh emotional architecture. Risky jump into memory-liquid reconfigures the premise without gimmickry. Specificity of scavenged artifacts (half-melted candlesticks, washed-out letters) anchors universals. Transformation test: story collapses if carousel or lagoon is replaced.</comment>
