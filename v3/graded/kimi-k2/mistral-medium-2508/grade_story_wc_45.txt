<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Liora’s “forgiving skeptic” trait is embodied in her calm handling of the tooth and the changeling; contradictory impulses (yearning vs. caution) play out in the forehead-press beat. Micro-choice—offering the tooth while holding the needle—reveals hierarchy of values. Closure shows earned cost: she trades certainty for her brother’s return and keeps the humming needle as permanent reminder.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: hedge gap → garden → tooth → memory transfer → bargain → brother restored. Each beat tightens options; the well’s rising water is the decisive change that reconfigures reality. Closure image (needle humming against ribs) carries felt cost. No orientation drift; anchors clear by 3rd sentence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Garden is vivid, selective, and purposeful: “waxy green,” “crushed mint and iron,” vines that tremble and reveal the changeling. Micro-setting (the well) constrains the final choice and supplies the star-map water. Sensory hierarchy matches Liora’s bone-setter eye for texture and damage.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recovering her brother—signaled early via the burned reed-body. Tightening occurs when the tooth dissolves and the changeling sheds its skin; options narrow to “make it right.” Cost is the permanent crack in certainty and the needle’s lingering hum. Pressure stays causal and coherent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of mending what’s broken emerges through bone-setting motif and literal act of “setting the world.” Subtext runs in the silence after the brother’s return—no moralizing, just woodsmoke and possibility. Final image reweights earlier wounds as navigational stars without stating a thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is distinct: tactile, medically precise, quietly lyrical (“teeth ache,” “iron left in the rain”). Compression taught early (“a riddle no one bothered to solve”) and paid off in final line. No head-hopping; perceptual signature stays consistent under stress. Dialogue minimal but subtextual: “You’re late.”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every line advances image or stakes. No loops or scaffold. Metaphors stay coherent (“garden sighed,” “crack in the world’s skin”). Sentence rhythm accelerates during memory transfer then settles into quiet closure. Clean mechanics; no typos or tense slips.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Familiar changeling tale is inverted: the creature is lock, not thief, and the human negotiates repair rather than revenge. Specificity of bone-setter occupation and the needle as lingering artifact create freshness. Risk in quiet magical realism pays off—world-mending feels earned, not gimmicky.</comment>
