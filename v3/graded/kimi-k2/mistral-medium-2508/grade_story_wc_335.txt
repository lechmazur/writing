<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elspeth’s interiority—her deliberate slowness, the shard-mirror habit—embodies contradiction and stakes; Kael’s tremor and tea-trace reveal doubt under pressure. Their mentor/apprentice status shift is staged through micro-choices (mirror shard, cup swirl) that foreclose retreat. Cost is felt: the shadow’s lunge and Elspeth’s withheld truth about “the cost of coming back.” Minor slip: Kael’s interiority drifts toward label-speak (“What if I get it wrong?”) before it’s embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Kael’s annotations bind the shadow-door and crystallize his apprenticeship; the cost is the unspoken price of return. Causal chain holds: tea-geometry → annotation → containment. One transition (shadow lunges, is yanked back) is legible. No orientation debt; anchors clear by 120 words. Lens: Causal, taught early and intact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Library’s sagging shelves and single unbroken pane act as active constraint: geometry of the room yanks the shadow back. Wax scent, cracked leather, and playground hush filter through Elspeth’s selective attention. Micro-setting (teacup, shard-mirror) constrains tactics. No white-room syndrome; spatial choreography clean. Could edge higher if the playground’s hush had altered the final beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—teaching Kael how to return—tightens when the shadow tests the room’s angles. Escalation: shadow lunge → binding annotation → library’s sigh. Agency is Kael’s tracing; cost is the shadow’s contained hunger and Elspeth’s withheld warning. One meaningful deepening suffices. Coincidence absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of reversible exile emerges through the library’s doors and Elspeth’s pedagogy: return is possible but priced. Subtext in shard-mirror (“sharp enough to draw blood”) and combative tenderness. Final image of glowing annotations reweights the premise without moralizing. No thematic drift; complexity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct, tactile, and rhythmic: “counting the ribs of a sleeping beast,” “shadow hissed.” Compression taught early (“walked backwards when nervous”) and paid off. POV remains single and coherent; no head-hopping. Dialogue carries subtext (“Lies are where the interesting truths hide”). Syntax modulates with pressure; no register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “shadow caught in the library’s single unbroken pane pulsed like a held breath.” No loops, no mixed metaphors. Sensory specificity (“smelled of wax and old promises”) integrates with action. Minor scaffold: “deliberate slowness” could tighten, but does not stall momentum. Clean mechanics.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Reversible exile as literal library principle feels fresh; not mere metaphor. Shard-mirror mentor and tea-geometry divination synthesize into a singular world. Transformation test: swap names and the arc collapses. Risk in backward-walking trait and shadow-door pays off without gimmickry. No close echoes.</comment>
