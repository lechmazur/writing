<question>1</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Liora’s motivation precedes every scene choice, but interiority is summary and ornamental. No appreciable contradiction or trade-off under pressure; her arc is pre-determined rather than earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern shifts (portraits, flowers, moonbeams) reweight meaning at the end. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise as destiny answers—but orientation remains misty and head-hopping into the mirror threatens causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>The emerald station is rendered with lush, selective detail—brass rails, captured moon-light—that constrains stealth routes and supplies final lighting; micro-setting works even as metaphor. A few temporal skips dilute spatial clarity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>A single dominant stake—steal time before it runs out—tightens fast: the moonbeams pulse like a countdown, the dahlia tilts, the countdown turns. One decisive intensification, cost is visible (portrait shatters → station vanishes).</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>The theme of reweighting stolen moments crystallizes through symbolic resonance without moralizing. Some closure fatigue when destiny speaks literally “You’re here to listen” reduces subtlety.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Distinct lyric-rhythm prose—‘gilded edge,’ ‘breath of golden sunset’—harnesses line-level propulsion. Compression and pattern-teaching paid off; final mirror silence lands with Charged Poise.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Flow is musical and quick; occasional overwriting—“time pressed your ear”—but no loops or scaffold. Density waxes during the portrait reveal, then crystalizes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>The illuminated-moment concept and moonbeam heist synthesize familiar tropes through insistently specific sensory choices, but the station-stationmaster loop feels faintly recycled. The final leap into ill-defined fate tilts toward cool gimmick.</comment>
