<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Liam’s contradictory impulses—yearning for meaning while insulating with facts—are embodied in the tactile handling of the grille cloth and the micro-choice to pocket it. The final renunciation of certainty is earned by the widow’s flinch and the quarry’s indifference, costing him the safety of detachment. Interiority is specific and sensory, avoiding label-speak. Only the foreman’s dialogue feels generic, slightly flattening status dynamics.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Liam accepts uncertainty and drives into the dark, the scrap in his pocket charging the final image with felt cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each sensory echo (dust like lighters, radio crackle) reweights the stake until the stance crystallizes. Orientation is anchored early; no causality breaks. The only minor slip is the slightly convenient timing of the radio song.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The trailer’s damp cardboard scent and quarry blasts function as micro-setting, constraining Liam’s mood and pacing. The grille cloth itself becomes portable setting, its texture guiding memory and choice. Selective sensory detail (dust motes as lighters) mirrors interiority without overwriting. The quarry’s “wound in the earth” image is fresh and thematically apt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding worth after failure—tightens when the scrap forces Liam to choose between appraisal detachment and personal claim. The escalation is textural: each sensory echo increases the cost of remaining a spectator. The final choice forecloses the path of certainty with visible cost (the truck’s headlights as unanswered question).</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: value is assigned, not discovered, and the silence after applause is where identity forms. The widow’s microphones and the quarry’s void serve as non-literal answers without moralizing. Final image of driving into unmarked dark reweights earlier motifs with conceptual cost. No thematic drift or sermonizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is textured, road-worn, and consistent—syntax mirrors Liam’s habit of cataloging to avoid feeling. Perceptual signature is sharp: “dust motes looked like a crowd raising their lighters.” No POV leakage or register drift. Dialogue is sparse but natural; foreman’s lines could be more distinct yet serve their purpose.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and propulsive; every sentence advances mood or stakes. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful (“ghost of a drum machine”). No loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing”) is justified by Liam’s appraiser mindset. Final paragraph cadence mirrors the open-road exhale.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The premise—ex-roadie hunts value in landfill nostalgia—feels lived-in rather than trope-driven. The grille cloth as relic and the quarry as void offer fresh angles on aftermath. Risk is taken in the quiet, lyric ending that trusts accumulation over event; it pays off. No close echoes of famous scenes.</comment>
