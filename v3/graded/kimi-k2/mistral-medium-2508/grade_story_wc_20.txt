<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Liora’s interior contradiction—rivalry vs. reverence for Veyra—drives every beat; the coin’s heat on her wrist and the vial’s memory dramatize embodied cost. The final choice to transmute herself is earned by prior causality and carries visible, felt price. Minor slip: “weight of a name” drifts toward abstraction mid-scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Liora’s stance crystallizes when she feeds the vial to the crucible, gilding her own cracks. Causal lens holds—each beat because/therefore tightens options until the final image reweights meaning. Cost is legible in the warmth that leaves her “lighter” yet still carrying the weight.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The foundry’s rain-washed ribs and scorched crucible constrain every move; the coin’s golden vein sealing the seams charges the final image. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered. One micro-slip: “weeping rust” edges toward overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—understanding what Veyra died for—tightens once when the coin answers with heat, forcing Liora to risk self-transmutation. Escalation is causal and cost is visible: potential annihilation traded for earned insight. No reversals needed; one decisive intensification suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of “names as chosen scars” emerges organically from the coin, the vial, and the act of gilding cracks. Final image—Liora lighter because she carries the weight differently—offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext in gesture and silence throughout.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is alchemist-precise, tactile, and rhythmically controlled; perceptual signature filters every detail through Liora’s trained eye. No head-hopping; compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure. One near-drift into elevated diction—“luminous regret”—but context justifies.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence advances story or atmosphere. No loops, no mixed metaphors, no scaffold. Occasional lyrical heightening—“golden vein threading seams”—serves the closure image and stays within POV lexicon.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: alchemy as emotional kintsugi, rival’s death transmuted into self-repair. Specificity of bronze coin, scorched retort, and vial-memory prevents trope drift. Risky quiet ending lands with undeniable reconfiguration.</comment>
