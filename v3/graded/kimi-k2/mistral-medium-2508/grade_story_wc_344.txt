<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is embodied and specific; the ache for “that precise click” grounds motive. The sister-loss backstory is compressed yet causally tied to the final reach into the mirror. Micro-choices (kneeling, scattering gears, whispering to a stubborn tooth) reveal hierarchy of values. Cost is felt when the child dissolves and the hall shudders—loss of the reflection that might have been the sister.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the watch warm against her ribs reweights the premise—time’s absence, not time itself. Causal lens holds: each gear slot tightens the mechanism that opens the valley door. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (“spiral staircase”). No teleporting props; the pocket watch is foreshadowed in the child’s hand before the locksmith grasps it.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The frozen library is not backdrop; its frostbitten iron frame and salt-stiffened boots constrain movement and tool handling. The water-mirror’s black stillness becomes the micro-setting that literally receives her hand and reconfigures reality. Sensory selection narrows to touch and breath under pressure. Final image—“the morning was… bright and brutal and new”—recharges the ice-silver motif with earned thaw.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—retrieve what the eclipse stole—is signaled in paragraph 3. Escalation is causal: each gear turned tightens the clock, foreclosing the option to leave empty-handed. The tightening culminates in the hum of the mirror and the dissolution of the child—visible price. No coincidence resolves; the door opens because she completes the mechanism.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of mending what time breaks emerges through the locksmith’s tactile labor, never stated. The final image—“she felt like the key”—offers non-literal resonance: identity fused with function, cost accepted. Subtext in the child’s silent “you’re late” carries accusation and absolution simultaneously. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in the “quiet space between what was lost and what could still be mended.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise: “breath curled like old ink,” “salt-stiffened leather.” Perceptual signature is the locksmith’s synesthetic attention to mechanical sound and texture. POV remains tight; no head-hop. Compression (“She didn’t ask for what. She knew.”) teaches the reader to accept elision, paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; each sentence layers image, motion, and stakes. No loops or scaffold. Metaphors are controlled—“veins of hauntingly bright silver” is vivid yet brief. Rhythm accelerates during gear insertion, breathes during mirror contact. Final paragraph lands with crystalline clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Clock-library as broken timepiece is fresh; the water-mirror as gear-slot is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Transformation test fails if names/places swapped—details like “fish-skin book” and “salt-stiffened leather” are irreducibly specific. Risk in lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring causality.</comment>
