<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lena’s “functional creativity” is embodied in every beat—jury-rigging, mapping, repurposing—so the trait feels lived, not labeled. Her contradictory impulse (fix vs. let go) surfaces when she chooses a pedestrian bridge instead of a restored spaceport, paying the cost of lowered horizons. Interiority is concrete and specific to her engineering lens; no stock phrasing. The final renunciation is earned and carries visible social cost (the town gets “through,” not “away”).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the terminal’s resurrection is redirected, not completed, and the cost is the foreclosed dream of escape. The Causal lens holds: each beat (find sextant → map flows → reroute water → repurpose structure) is a because/therefore linkage. Orientation is anchored within 120 words. No teleporting props or causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The terminal’s corroded steel ribs and algae-thick reservoirs are tactile and constraining; the sextant recess in the hydroponics bay literally redirects water and choice. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Lena’s engineering gaze. The final image—the weather vane pointing to the horizon—recharges the setting with new meaning. Environment, tool, and body together shape the final tactic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can the town salvage belief in departure?—is signaled early and tightened when Lena repurposes the terminal into a bridge, trading escape for passage. One clear escalation: the sextant’s redirection of water pressure triggers doors and redefines options. Cost is visible on the page: the spaceport stays grounded. Agency drives every turn; coincidence only complicates.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: hope as redirection rather than destination. The equation “Hope = Flow × Resistance” is earned through concrete action and reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext operates in the sextant’s hum of “intent” and the terminal’s sigh of resurrection. Final image—the weather vane pointing to the horizon—offers a resonant, non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is precise, tactile, and filtered through Lena’s engineering cognition; syntax mirrors her problem-solving rhythm. No POV leakage or register drift. Compression is purposeful and taught early (“Structurally Unsound: Do Not Enter” primes the reader for elision). Final line “I’m recalibrating” crystallizes voice and stance in one word.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence advances story or atmosphere. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful (“sky the color of old bruises”). Information density is high—e.g., “water pressure could trigger the doors” compresses cause and tactic. Rhythm accelerates under pressure without clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of carnival aftermath, abandoned spaceport, and civil-engineer logic feels fresh and inevitable. Tropes (ruin, hope, maze) are transformed through Lena’s functional creativity and the sextant’s redirection mechanic. Risk-taking in structure—maze as circuit board—heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Final reconfiguration of the terminal into a bridge is non-obvious yet grounded.</comment>
