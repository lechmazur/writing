<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The knight’s seven-year silence and welded gauntlet are embodied through tactile micro-choices—brushing the stem, breaking the seal—culminating in a credible renunciation of silence that costs him literal shadow. Interiority is specific and contradictory: memory of siege as performance collides with present refusal to applaud. The final smile “hurt like holy fire” crystallizes earned cost. Minor slip: “he had been there, once. Or he would be” edges toward convenient temporal slipperiness rather than character-bound knowledge.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the threads reweave from manacles to wings, the stage invitation reweights the entire siege-as-performance premise. Causal chain—program → threads → unsnap → voice—holds under Accumulative/Textural lens; each beat intensifies pattern density rather than linear cause. Cost is legible in spilled shadows and first spoken sentence. Orientation is taught early via sensory anchors; deliberate disorientation (time slippage) pays off in final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The greenhouse is no backdrop but an active constraint: glass weeps, plants trace sigils, roots spell half-remembered oaths. Micro-setting (gauntlet, program) doubles as charged object that enables the final unsnap. Sensory hierarchy is POV-biased—condensation like tears, scent of crushed silverleaf—guiding choice. One minor drift: “sky began to mend” outside is inferred, not anchored in immediate perception.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—break silence or remain bound—is signaled in line 1 and tightened when threads cinch his wrists. Escalation is pattern-deepening: each image (moths, threads, program) reweights the cost of speaking. Agency is renunciation of silence via unsnap; price is shadows released and first words spoken. Coincidence (program date smudged) complicates rather than resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of allegiance to possibility rather than silence emerges through image pattern—moths, threads, stage—never stated. Final smile “hurt like holy fire” offers non-literal answer: the shape after silence is performance itself. Subtext in program’s single word “UNSNAP” and shadows’ eagerness avoids moralizing. Resonance lingers in singing moths and mending sky without tidy moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is knightly yet lyric, syntax mirroring slow unfolding: “the plants here didn’t grow; they unfolded.” Perceptual signature is selective—he notices patina, sigils, half-remembered oaths. Compression taught early (“sky split like rotten silk”) pays off in final curtains parting. No dialogue; internal monologue stays character-bound.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “greenish patina of neglect, the metal whispering” does triple work (visual, auditory, metaphor). No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Metaphors are coherent—threads of gold and rot, sugar in rain. Minor elevated diction (“alchemical orchard”) is justified by fantastical frame.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Siege-as-performance premise is fresh; moth-banners dissolving into prompts subverts epic fantasy tropes. Specificity—“echo of a color no human eye had named”—grounds the surreal. Transformation test fails if relocated: the knight’s welded gauntlet and seven-year silence are inseparable from this world. Risk in lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring closure.</comment>
