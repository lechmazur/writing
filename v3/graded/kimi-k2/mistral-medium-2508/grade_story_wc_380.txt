<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses—need to recover vs. truth of extraction—are vivid, but the loss-renunciation lacks visceral embodiment on the final dock; we watch him pour away the means rather than himself. Interiority is concrete yet never over-explains. Final choice is earned but the price reads abstract.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mosaic-accumulative lens holds cleanly across shards; closure is a Charged Poise that reweights memory as ‘stored’ and future as inevitable sacrifice. Pattern is taught by early ground-reading and crystalline “pull”; final image of tide-swallowed residue nails cost despite physical subtlety. No teleporting props or causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Salt crystals and low-tide rot are never scenic; they leak into lungs and pockets, turning setting into active antagonist. Whale bones, lantern oil, and the stone’s weight constrain every move—inventories matter, distances legible. Chamber walls literally tilt the world underfoot, charging the final image of “gravity that is always hungry.”</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“to exhume her”—is declared early and relentlessly tightened from wildflower curl to stone dissolution. One decisive deepening: knowledge that memories are not lost but *taken* forecloses easy grief and reroutes him toward ledger-search with mortal cost already tasted. Agency stays internal; pressure never dissipates.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme that grief and industrial extraction of memory are the same process emerges solely from salt crystal logistics and the lighter’s failure. No moral spoken, only a hush under lanterns. Final tide offers a concrete, non-moral repricing: grief is now *inventory* he’ll willingly die to audit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is salt-stained, metallic, quiet—perceptual signature notices brass clicks before bones. Compression (“rotting kelp thickened by the whale”) teaches lyric density without obscuring causality. Consistent psychic distance; no head-hop; diction never drifts into exposition.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Each sentence harvests multiple senses and motives; no paraphrase loops, no mixed metaphors. Density stays high—“hum and old pennies” layers air, time, and cost in four words. Closing cadence slows with tide-thud precision, zero scaffolds or line-level fog.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</question>
<comment>Marries maritime gothic with physics-tilt hallucination; memory-theft via crystalline gravity pockets feels fresh yet inevitable. High-stakes inversion turns grief into industrial horror without ever naming metaphor. The conceit commits fully—no safety nets, no derivative rescue twist.</comment>
