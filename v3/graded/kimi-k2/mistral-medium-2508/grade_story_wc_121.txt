<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s interior contradiction—conquest vs. self-fragmentation—is embodied in the mirrored confrontation; the merging costs him the tablet and the eternal loop, a credible renunciation. Motive intensifies from abstract lineage to visceral need to be whole. Minor slip: “conquer the labyrinth of self” edges toward label-speak mid-text.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the viaduct vanishes, gravity finally claims him, and the cost is the tablet’s dust on his skin. Causal lens holds—each retrace tightens options until sideways rewind becomes irreversible. No orientation debt; disorientation is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The viaduct’s wet stone and neon shards are tactile constraints that force sideways movement; the tablet’s warmth and final crumble charge the ending. Selective sensory detail mirrors Elias’s narrowed perception under pressure. Micro-setting (tablet as handled object) functions as environment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—becoming whole—escalates through each retrace; the final merging forecloses eternal return with visible loss of the tablet and the loop. Pressure tightens once, decisively, under causal lens. Cost is legible in the settling weight of gravity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of self-integration emerges from the procedural loop and the merging; no moralizing, only the resonant image of the vanished viaduct. Subtext in the hollow-eyed double carries the cost of endless recursion. Final dawn reweights prior darkness without statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise—“gravity hesitated around him” teaches the pattern early. Compression and elision (“the drop had become the ripple”) are consistent and paid off. No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains Elias’s throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; figurative language is patterned and purposeful. One mixed metaphor—“shattering glass in reverse”—is minor. No loops or scaffold; rhythm modulates with pressure. Final line lands clean.</comment>

<comment>Procedural-generation bridge as crucible for self-conquest feels fresh; the sideways rewind and merging beat are inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes without obscuring closure. No derivative echoes.</comment>
