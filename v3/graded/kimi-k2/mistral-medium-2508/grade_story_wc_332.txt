<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“fingers stained with the ghosts of ink”), but the decisive renunciation (“Stay”) feels slightly under-motivated; the cost is present yet abstract. The librarian’s contradictory impulses—archival order vs. dream empathy—are dramatized in the final beat, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the photograph pulses, the dream pleads, the librarian refuses return, and the palette flares—cost is visible in the erased footprint. Accumulative/Textural lens holds; each sunrise beat intensifies the longing pattern without causal leaps.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Archipelago and palette are rendered with tactile specificity; the watercolor smear at the end constrains the next expedition, meeting the 9+ gate. Spatial anchors arrive early; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover or release the runaway dream—is signaled in paragraph two. Escalation tightens through failed photograph, living image, and final refusal; the cost is the librarian’s self-imposed exile from certainty.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of choosing ephemeral life over archival death emerges through action, not statement. Final image reweights the premise: “luminous absence between dawn and memory” offers resonant non-moral answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; perceptual signature (“saltwind,” “ozone and old parchment”) remains consistent. No POV drift; patterned elision (e.g., “cipher of longing”) is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; no loops or mixed metaphors. Rhythm modulates with pressure—short clauses at climax (“once, twice—like a match in a hurricane”). Minor elevation in diction stays within librarian’s plausible lexicon.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Premise—librarian who re-captures dreams with sunrise photography—feels fresh and inevitable. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; transformation test passes.</comment>
