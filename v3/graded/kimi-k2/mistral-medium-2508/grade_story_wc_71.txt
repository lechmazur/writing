<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Liora’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses—curiosity vs. reverent restraint—play out in micro-choices (placing the shard, leaving it). The final renunciation carries felt cost: she forfeits ownership to gain listening. Minor slip: “inadvertently profound” is asserted rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of noticing → ritual → relinquishment tightens the stake of how to carry silence. Closure is a Charged Poise: the bay’s sigh and her softened tread reconfigure meaning with undeniable cost—she trades possession for attunement. No causality breaks; orientation is swift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The bay, dock detritus, and orris shard function as micro-setting that constrains choice: the tide-gifted objects become ritual tools, the shard’s scent steers the final relinquishment. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered. Weather and light evolve causally with the ritual beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</question>
<comment>Dominant stake—how to relate to living silence—tightens once: from seeking explanation to embodying it. Escalation is textural: the hush thickens, streetlights deepen, the bay stills. Cost is visible in the act of leaving the shard; agency drives the turn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</question>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: silence as reverent listening rather than absence. Subtext lives in gesture (spiral arrangement, key pressed into wood). Final image reweights the premise without moralizing—houses feel alive when they listen, and now so does she.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</question>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; perceptual signature is consistent—salt-softened wood, “hush” as tactile presence. Syntax modulates with emotional rise and fall. No POV drift; free-indirect texture is clean. Compression and elision are taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is patterned and purposeful (“scent…like the first moment before a held breath”). No loops or scaffold. Rhythm breathes with ritual pacing. One mixed metaphor—“cup holds light”—is minor and doesn’t cloud closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</question>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: a quiet ghost-story premise transformed into a meditation on listening as habitation. Specificity of perfumer’s orris, tide-gifts, and grandmother curtains grounds the uncanny. Risky lyric structure pays off in the final reconfiguration.</comment>
