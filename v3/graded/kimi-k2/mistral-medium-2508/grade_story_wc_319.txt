<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyssa’s contradictory impulses—guard vs. release—are embodied in micro-choices (tracing the book, pocketing the pendant, handing it over). The final renunciation costs her the only identity she had; the ache in her teeth and the “hungry cold” give visceral stakes. One slip: “they were shouting” is summary, not embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each image thickens the metaphysical frost until the garden literally unravels into a page. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Lyssa lets herself be “drunk” by thirsty light—cost paid in identity and certainty. Orientation is taught early via the mist and skeletal trees; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>The frozen garden, the pendant’s cold hum, and the thawing soil are not backdrop; they constrain every move and finally dissolve into the “breathing page.” Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—frost first, then the ache of cold inside bone. One minor drift: “sickly dawn” is generic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—keep knowledge caged vs. free it—tightens when the librarian offers “boundaries of light.” The pendant’s weight and the hum escalate pressure; handing it over forecloses the guardian path with irreversible cost. No reversals, but the single deepening is sufficient under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</question><comment>Theme emerges from the concrete: cages outgrown, knowledge that wants release, friendship with uncertainty. The final image—darkness “like a friend”—reweights the spiral symbol and the library’s ashes without moralizing. Subtext in silence and gesture carries the emotional aftereffect.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise: “the mist inhaled,” “words lifting from her bones like birds.” POV stays locked in Lyssa’s perceptual signature; no head-hop. Compression and elision are pattern-taught early (“time had gone slippery”) and paid off in the unraveling.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; every sentence layers texture without redundancy. Metaphors are coherent—spiral eating itself, thirsty light—and serve the metaphysical stakes. No loops or scaffold; rhythm modulates with pressure. One near-purple line: “vast, breathing page” barely stays on the safe side.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The premise—books as dimensionally homesick entities—feels inevitable yet fresh. The spiral pendant, the unraveling garden, and the librarian’s mouth of missing teeth synthesize into a singular vision. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring closure.</comment>
