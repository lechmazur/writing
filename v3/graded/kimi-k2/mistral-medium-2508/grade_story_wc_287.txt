<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lena’s interiority is embodied and specific—her breath misting, thumb bleeding, soil pressed. Contradictory impulses (tending vs. guarding) act simultaneously in scene. The final choice to “let herself believe” is earned by the gauge-tooth exchange and the seedling’s defiant break. Cost is visible: the blood offering and the relinquished lock.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the two gauge teeth become “keys to a lock neither needed anymore,” crystallizing a before/after shift. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of light, scent, metal, and hush accrues until the final image reweights the premise. Causality holds: every object and gesture seeded early returns charged. Cost is legible in the shared silence and the harbor’s pulse.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The fire escape, harbor moonlight, and gauge tooth function as micro-setting that constrains every move—light angle dictates planting, salt wind wilts basil, metal teeth dig. Sensory hierarchy is POV-biased: Lena notices what thwarts or enables her tending. The setting evolves with the wind shift and lantern glow, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: whether Lena can risk opening again. Pressure tightens once—Elias offers the second tooth, forcing her to accept or refuse connection. The tightening is driven by her micro-choice to press the seed and accept the tooth; cost is the blood and the audible hush. No coincidence resolves; the seedling’s break is earned, not lucky.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of guarded vulnerability emerges through concrete particulars: thorns, teeth, blood, seed. No direct statement; resonance arises from the final image of two keys left in soil. Subtext in Elias’s scarred knuckles and Lena’s humming carries the emotional aftereffect. The ending reweights prior motifs without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet grounded: “moonlight silvering the water like a blade left too long in the rain.” Syntax modulates with pressure—short clauses under stress, longer breaths in reflection. Perceptual signature is Lena’s: she sees light as carveable, smells thyme as memory solvent. No POV drift; Elias’s interiority is inferred only through gesture and dialogue.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; each line layers sensory, emotional, and symbolic work without redundancy. Metaphors are precise and consistent—“blade left too long in the rain,” “sugar in tea.” No loops or scaffold; no mixed metaphors. Rhythm accelerates at the seedling’s break, then exhales into the final hush.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</question>
<comment>The fire escape gardener who uses lock-picking tools to plant seeds is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis. Tropes of post-war healing and tentative romance are transformed through tactile gardening and metallic teeth. The final image of two gauge teeth as “keys to a lock neither needed anymore” feels inevitable yet surprising. Specificity anchors universals; no template echoes.</comment>
