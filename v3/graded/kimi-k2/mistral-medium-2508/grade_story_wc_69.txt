<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is embodied and specific—his tactile attention to the rosette, the “expectantly resigned sigh” memory, and his decision to hum silence rather than melody all reveal layered motives. The four remaining singers are sketched with economical, body-based detail that makes their presence felt under pressure. The final micro-choice—humming the shape of absence—earns the quiet renunciation of “loud” harmony with visible cost. Minor: the “hatred” backstory is slightly abstract and risks flattening the stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (scent of paper, amber light, leaf-fall) accretes until the rosette’s vibration reconfigures meaning. Closure is a Charged Poise—the shimmer of “what they were learning to hold” crystallizes the new, fragile stance. Cost is felt in the admission “They weren’t a choir anymore.” Orientation is anchored within 120 words; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The velvet library’s stained-glass amber and oak-leaf scent are selective, character-filtered, and return in the final image as the wind “rattling the panes.” The rosette serves as micro-setting that constrains the final action: its remembered hollowness shapes the decision to hum silence. Spatial choreography remains clear among five bodies around one table. Weather outside mirrors internal stripping without cliché.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can remnants of a broken choir still create meaning without volume? Pressure tightens as each sensory subtraction (lost voices, dulled inlay) raises the cost of trying again. The final hum is an act of agency that forecloses “loud” forever, accepting fragility. No escalation missteps; coincidence is absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: harmony is possible not by adding but by listening to absence. The rosette’s shift from “dulled” to “remembering” reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture—fingers brushing wood, scarves damp with rain. Final image offers resonant, non-literal answer: shimmer of held silence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s perceptual signature—music teacher’s synesthesia of light and sound. Rhythm modulates from long, leaf-fall sentences to the spare final line. No head-hopping; choral voices remain external. Distinctive diction: “lacewood petals,” “bullet-scarred folder.”</comment>

<comment>Prose is lyrical yet dense: “stained-glass windows bleeding amber” does triple sensory work. No loops, no mixed metaphors. Sentence variety mirrors breathing; the final paragraph’s fragmentation mimics tentative voices. Occasional elevated diction (“expectantly resigned”) is earned by context.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: a choir reduced to silence uses negative space as instrument. Familiar autumnal imagery is re-cast as “notes falling silent.” The rosette’s journey from discarded fragment to resonating vessel feels inevitable. Risk taken in quiet ending pays off.</comment>
