<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Liora’s interior contradiction—duty to guide vs. need to stay—surfaces in embodied beats (punch pressed into her own palm). The final renunciation is earned: releasing the tool concretely forecloses her old role. Minor slack: the vigil-keepers are sketched more as chorus than crucible, muting relational pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each image of stamped/unstamped tickets layers density until the dropped punch crystallizes the reconfiguration. Closure—Earned Stasis—lands with felt cost: “Now you’re one of us.” Orientation is clear by 120 words; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The veiled ridgeway, damp sand, and vigil fires are vivid, selective, and tethered to choice: the shoreline’s lullaby modulates Liora’s breathing, the punch’s arc into the shallows charges the final image. Micro-setting (palm-imprinted star) constrains her decision to stay.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—unused courage for staying—tightens once: from guiding others to releasing the tool. The deepening is driven by her agency under the Accumulative lens; cost is visible in the relinquished punch and accepted vigil identity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the tension between movement and stillness; the unstamped tickets become a resonant image of deferred crossings. Final image reweights the premise without moralizing: “some things are meant to remain unticketed.” Subtext in silence and firelight sustains ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays close to Liora’s perceptual filter; salt-damp wool, brass cold, star-bite are character-specific. Rhythm modulates with emotional crests; no head-hopping. Dialogue is sparse but subtextual: “You’ve come back” / “I never left” carries history without exposition.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet textured: “the land hesitated before becoming water” does double duty. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Occasional lyrical lift (“twilight bled into the horizon”) is earned by pattern consistency and does not obscure clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Ferry-guide vigil trope is refreshed through the inversion of the guide who stays; the star-shaped punch evolves from tool to scar to relinquished talisman. Specificity of the ridgeway’s “indirect routes” and “veiled” threshold keeps it from generic limbo. Risk is moderate but coherent.</comment>
