<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“taste the shape of ideas”), but the philosopher’s contradictory impulses remain largely poetic rather than dramatized in scene; the final renunciation of wandering is felt yet causally under-motivated by prior micro-choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of listening → gear-turn → translocation tightens through cadence shift. Closure is a Charged Poise (“the frontier wasn’t out there”) with conceptual cost, but the gear’s agency feels slightly external rather than earned.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mechanical rainforest is rendered with tactile specificity (“brass trunks,” “binary rustles”) and constrains the final stance; the gear left turning on a branch recharges the setting as living engine. Spatial anchors are clear early.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—rediscovering untamed mind—escalates via sensory deepening rather than external reversals. One tightening beat: gear pulls him into fractal clearing, foreclosing passive listening. Cost is conceptual (loss of edges) rather than visceral, but legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of mind’s wildness emerges through concrete particulars; final image of walking “with” the hum offers resonant, non-literal answer. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers productively.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct lyric texture—compressed, synesthetic, rhythmically controlled. POV remains stable; perceptual signature (“taste the shape of ideas”) is consistent. No dialogue, so voice coherence is internal only.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; occasional stacked metaphors (“chorus of probable miracles”) risk overwriting but pattern is taught early. No loops or scaffold; final cadence lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses cyber-mythic rainforest with philosophical quest in non-obvious synthesis; gear-as-talisman and translocating dreams feel inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
