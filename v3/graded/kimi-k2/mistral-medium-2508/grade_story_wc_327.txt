<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Veyra’s hunger to translate is vivid, but her interiority drifts into summary (“she understood too late”) rather than embodied contradiction at the climax; the copper-veined trait is ornamental until the final line, never constraining choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Veyra’s voice becomes the echo she sought to capture, cost paid in her erasure. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—patterned bird-flight and bone-song tighten until the final image reweights silence itself.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The canyon, bone towers, and diamond function as micro-settings that actively constrain tactics; the towers’ song and the diamond’s warmth guide every beat. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—capture the dying language—is signaled early and escalates through the diamond’s pulse and the birds’ collapse. One decisive tightening: the moment Veyra answers the canyon, options vanish and cost becomes irreversible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of forbidden knowledge emerges organically from the texture of sound and the price of translation; the final whispered “You were never meant to understand” offers a resonant, non-moralizing answer that reweights all prior motifs.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with controlled rhythm and patterned elision taught early (“the wind carried voices that no living throat had shaped”). Perceptual signature is consistent; no head-hopping or register drift under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; figurative language is selective and never muddles causality. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. The final “echoes…that have forgotten how to die” crystallizes without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of starling-cipher, bone-tower choir, and cursed diamond feels inevitable and fresh; the premise transforms familiar “last speaker” tropes into a textured meditation on untranslatable loss. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
