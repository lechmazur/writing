<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Vivid interiority and embodied emotion (bare feet feel hum of ancient soil), but the closure turn—“she was also the stag’s steadiness, the phoenix’s fire”—arrives as assertion rather than fully forged choice; the contradictory impulses are sketched rather than waged in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Taxed as Accumulative/Textural: beats layer scent, moonlight, ash, disclose mounting grief-density, then crystallize in a Charged Poise where Liora accepts the bridge role; felt cost is the abnegation of retrieving her brother, but the RR beat is one sentence—slight under-cadence keeps it from 8.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Silver moonlight, spiced air, root-laced soil guide every micro-movement; setting is not backdrop but pressure source—vanilla, nutmeg, clove literally enable and later exact cost. Spatial tracking is flawless; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—should she breach death’s law—is signaled in the fortune-cookie epigraph and escalates via two conjuring attempts; each inflicts hotter, then colder, contact burn. Second conjuring forces a conceptual repricing: her own shape becomes the currency of grief. Cost is legible, but only one full beat of turn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of transformation-as-grief emerges from sensorial too-much rather than thesis; ending non-moral line—“she was the bridge”—reweights prior material with quiet social cost. Slight poetic abstraction keeps it shy of 8.5.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Liora’s wary stillness braided with scent-memory; rhythm modulates between star-stretch lyricism and clipped refusal. No POV leakage; minor impedance when the stag “speaks” via root-language is brief, taught early.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Scaffold is mostly absent; imagery is dense but purposeful until the abstract shimmer finale, where metaphor strings (“the orchard held its breath”) edge purple. Few sentences advance multi job, but momentum intact; still, one overwritten climax clause nudges score down.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Phoenix-risen, never-setting moon, grief-driven metamorphosis fuse in a non-stereotypical fairy-tale palette; voice and sensory scheme feel singular. Transformation yielded by conjuring over elder-bone roots lands inevitable in hindsight. Slight familiar “thin-veil” trope holds score from 8.5.</comment>
