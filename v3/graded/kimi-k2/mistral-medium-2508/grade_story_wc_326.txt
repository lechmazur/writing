<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lena’s interior contradiction—clinging to a bureaucratic ghost while yearning for cosmic repair—is embodied in the porcelain shard and the heartbeat count. The final sync with the observatory’s pulse is earned by prior micro-choices (pulling the files, accepting the ink’s offer) and carries visible cost: she renounces correcting her death certificate, accepting a shared heartbeat instead. The shard’s shift from sharp to warm literalizes the change. No relationship crucible is on page, but single-POV interiority is specific and pressured.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Lena’s stance flips from isolated fear of erasure to shared pulse with the observatory. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each broken transmission stitched into the ink pattern reweights the stake until the final loop. Cost is legible in the blank printout and warm shard; no teleporting props or causality breaks. Orientation is clear by line 3; deliberate lyric compression is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The opal dome, frost-laced window, and porcelain shard all constrain choice: the dome houses the ghost, the window offers the final image, the shard mediates pain. Sensory selection is urgent—auroras like a dying heartbeat, snowflakes as fragments—filtered through Lena’s obsession. No white-room syndrome; spatial anchors are immediate. Environment charges the final image when snowflakes become “whole.”</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—identity erasure vs. cosmic connection—is signaled by the death certificate in paragraph 2. Escalation is Accumulative: each defragmented file tightens the pattern until the heartbeat sync forecloses the option of reclaiming her bureaucratic self. The cost is the certificate left forever unresolved. No coincidence resolves; pressure is coherent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from particulars: failed transmissions, a misfiled death, a shard once sharp now smooth. The final image—snowflakes “finally whole”—offers a non-literal answer: identity is not fixed data but shared pattern. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers. Thematic resonance is built from the ghost’s whispered “Now you know what the static hides.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric, compressed, and consistent: “auroras that pulsed like a dying heartbeat,” “ink bleeding across the console.” Perceptual signature is Lena’s—scientific precision laced with grief. No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates with stress. Dialogue is absent, so no register clash. Patterned elision (“the static isn’t empty. It’s waiting”) is taught early and legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: every sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. No loops, no filter-verb stacks. Metaphors are precise—“ink darkening like a heartbeat mirrored.” Rhythm accelerates with the ink surge, then breathes at the window. No scaffolding or redundancy. Clean mechanics; no typos.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise—an observatory ghost born from lost data—feels fresh yet inevitable. Tropes (ghost, haunted tech) are transformed through the shard, the heartbeat count, and the bureaucratic death. Specificity anchors universals: porcelain shard from mother’s teacup, opal dome under snow. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without gimmickry. Final reconfiguration is unforeseeable yet earned.</comment>
