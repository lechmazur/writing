<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s contradictory impulses—precision as atonement vs. silence as complicity—are embodied in the rake notches and the slowed pendulum; the final micro-choice to carve his own name costs him the council’s wrath and splinters the handle, earning the renunciation. Interiority stays concrete, never lapses into label-speak. Only the sister’s backstory is slightly summary, keeping it just under 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each added notch thickens the moral density until the cadence shift in the final chime reweights the village’s time. Closure is a Charged Poise—the pendulum drags the past, acknowledged not absolved—felt cost is the tower’s groan and the handle’s fresh splinter. Orientation is immediate; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The tidal obsidian ridge, salt-slick tower stones, and the rake’s fractured grain all constrain Elias’s footing and choices; the pendulum’s mirrored surface becomes the charged micro-setting that receives the confessional touch. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered. Environment guides the final act without ornamental drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—forcing the village to feel its unspoken debts—tightens once when Elias slows the clock; the cost is immediate social exile and the audible groan of overburdened gears. Escalation is driven solely by his agency under the Accumulative lens. No coincidence resolves; pressure crystallizes in the lagging chime.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of incremental absolution emerges through the rake’s accumulating weight and the altered cadence; no moral is stated, yet the final image of villagers pausing mid-task offers a resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext lives in the silence between ticks and the unopened locket. Complexity is honored—guilt is neither erased nor redeemed, only balanced.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is tactile, salt-bitter, and rhythmically controlled; the pendulum’s hush and the rake’s splinter carry distinct perceptual signatures. No head-hop; psychic distance tightens under pressure. Diction stays within Elias’s weathered lexicon, and the final “searing reverie” modulation is earned.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence layers sensory, moral, and mechanical detail without redundancy. Metaphors (“brass teardrop,” “tide gnawing”) are precise and non-contradictory. No loops or scaffold; the final line lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The rake-as-ledger and clock-as-conscience synthesize into a fresh moral instrument; the incremental absolution concept feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Specificity of tidal obsidian and salt-slick gears anchors the universal. Risk in slowing time itself pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
