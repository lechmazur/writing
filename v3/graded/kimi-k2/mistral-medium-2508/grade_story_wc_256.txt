<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Liora’s longing for “texture of connection” is embodied in every micro-gesture—pressing the lens, turning it, leaving the bell—so motive stays concrete. The final renunciation (leaving the bell) carries visible cost: she forfeits ownership of the sound she sought. Interior contradiction is light; more could be mined from her fear that connection might remain impossible. Still, the arc earns its quiet stasis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the hum becomes felt connection, reweighting the premise without exposition. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each sensory layer (warm wires, golden shadows, bell’s bloom) deepens the same stake. One transition (door-clustered researchers) is handled cleanly. No orientation debt; anchors are set by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The laboratory’s “forgotten acoustics” and copper-warm wires are tactile and selective, never touristy. The carbide-lens-as-micro-setting constrains every choice: its refraction literally shapes the resonator’s path. Spatial choreography stays coherent—hand, dish, shadows, bell. Sensory hierarchy narrows under pressure: only hum and gold remain at the end.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“texture of connection”—is signaled early and tightened once: the dish’s hum forecloses the need for audible proof. Cost is felt (she leaves the bell) but could be sharper if the researchers’ skepticism pressed harder. Escalation is single, coherent, and sufficient for length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through pattern: sound as space, not signal. The final image (unpolished bell that listens) reweights the entire quest without moralizing. Subtext in “some pilgrimages weren’t meant to be finished” invites counter-readings. Only minor drift: “texture of connection” flirts with label-speak once.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise—“shattered constellation,” “slow bloom of a question”—and stays within Liora’s perceptual range. Rhythm modulates with pressure: long sentences swell, then fragment at closure. No head-hopping; free-indirect style is clean. Distinctive diction avoids purple overload.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; every line advances image or stakes. No loops, no mixed metaphors. One scaffold risk—“the sound of between” skirts abstraction—but context saves it. Final paragraph’s cadence crystallizes the Charged Poise.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: extinct instruments + carbide lens as acoustic prism + pilgrimage without destination. Risky lyric structure pays off in the bell that listens. Not entirely novel, but specificity (miner’s echo-measure song) transforms trope. Avoids gimmickry.</comment>
