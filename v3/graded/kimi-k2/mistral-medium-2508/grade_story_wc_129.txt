<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Reed’s interiority is embodied and specific—her hands “remembering” reeds before her mind does—but the final shift from sculptor to searcher is slightly under-motivated; the leap from “I need a dedication” to “I must find Syl” feels more thematic than character-driven. The cost of belonging is felt, yet Reed’s flaws remain gentle rather than complicating.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the arbor’s surface becomes a living constellation of handprints, reweighting “kinship” from object to collective act. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each tag and handprint layers density until the final image crystallizes the cost of shared witness. One transition (crater lip to dawn festival) is clean and earned.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The crystalline orchard and Shimmer Crater are not mere backdrop; their refracted light and lost-language hum constrain Reed’s path and charge the final image when the arbor drinks in those same glimmers. Spatial choreography is precise—Reed’s breath syncing with the crater’s pulse—anchoring the lyric flights.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“how to make belonging real”—is signaled early and tightens when the arbor’s incompleteness forces the search. The deepening is driven by Reed’s agency: organizing the pairs, choosing to go alone, accepting Syl’s co-authorship. Cost is visible in the violet-stained hands and the dawn constellation of prints.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through the arbor’s transformation: kinship is not found but made, a current that moves through touch. The final tag “Stay. We’ll find you” reframes the earlier “I was here” into an open invitation, reweighting the premise without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture—handprints in wet paint—rather than statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded in tactile specificity—“obsidian rippling with trapped starlight,” “scars like reed-marks.” Patterned elision (no quotation marks, fluid shifts between narration and thought) is taught early and paid off in the final collective silence. Distinct perceptual signature holds under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and stakes—“the crater’s glow bled into the sky.” No loops or scaffold; figurative language is selective and purposeful. Rhythm modulates with emotional intensity, accelerating during the search, slowing into the dawn tableau.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of street-art tagging with ancient orchard/crater myth feels inevitable and fresh; the arbor as communal palimpsest is a non-obvious resolution to the kinship question. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the final reconfiguration grows organically from prior particulars.</comment>
