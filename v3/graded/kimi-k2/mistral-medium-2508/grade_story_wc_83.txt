<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lena’s contradictory impulses float between vengeance and tender memory; the geode against skin, the upward veil, and the final tapestry reprise crystallize her choice. Flaws and interior contradiction ping till the end, bleeding cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the before-choice re-weighted in the white-screen dissolve. Perturbation lens holds: past unmade is re-experienced but not overwritten, paying felt price in renunciation.</comment>

<question>3</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Observatory’s groan, geode-refraction emergency lights, and storm-lattice form a micro-setting that pressures every beat. Physical constraint shapes exit choice; locale is actively weaponized in charge.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake is the unmade past’s price; one deepening beat (console frequency tweak) escalates through causality, narrowing options. Emotional disequilibrium at closure shows cost crystallized under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Thematic field: unfiltered awakening emerges not through thesis but through Lena hunting residual time; the final white flash re-sites the concept’s price. No abstract moral, only syncretic image.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Voice stays anchored in geologist-kin perception; deliberate ellision at tension peaks (“Now, three weeks later”) is taught early and legible. Syntax modulates naturally, no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Constant tension in rhythm (“geode cold again”) without scaffold; light mapping and sensory propulsion clear. Minimal loop fear; warm → cold crystal mirrors internal decay smoothly.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Fresh inflection: the unmade-past hunt reweights well-trodden redemption arc without cliché. Synthesis feels inevitable; risk increases stakes; reticent of full novelty to cap.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Lena’s drone-strike survivor stance is tested at the control console; narration links the veil float to direct choice, foreclosing her path in the ending beat with visible emotional cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Geode appears three times (pocket, console, cold hand) each with escalating warmth → weight → cold trace; its reprise recharges the final image and seals choice identity.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Unfiltered awakening shapes every toggle of past versus present; the concept constrains Lena’s viable moves and charges the closure rather than label.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>Intangibly tangible veil moment gives a visible cost (invisible fabric floats) yet directly enables the predator wait reprise pattern in tone memory.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Hunt: each beat from encounter to storm-trace to screen white follows Lena’s pursuit of unmade time; narratively indispensable and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Perturbation frequency mechanics signalled early via father’s notes, then applied to choose console frequency, narrowing options; the final gain is causally driven by them.</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Floating observatory actively pressures tactics—dome groan limits evac, geode console becomes the focal pressure node—the setting is not ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Breaker-cool clock is noted and tightens console action window, enabling the white flash conclusion; not benign background.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Lena’s desire to find unused potential shapes her every console choice and is directly reweighted after the white screen, turning cost into consequence.</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Bleak exhilaration modulates from storm calm to white blast catharsis; the tone tightens across pressure peaks, charging the final image without sentimentality.
