<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lior’s contradictory impulses—yearning to guard yet compulsively severing—are embodied in the trembling doorknocker and the cold shadow’s grip; the final renunciation carries visible cost as he steps through a door that dissolves the only refuge he has left. Interiority is specific, tactile, and unflinching. The only cap is that the shadow’s dialogue edges toward explanatory, preventing a 9+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the threshold’s dissolution is the decisive change, and the cost—loss of sanctuary—is legible in the final image of rain-tasting air. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of burned bridges tightens until the sanctuary itself becomes the last bridge to burn. No causality breaks; orientation is anchored early and paid off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The ashen sanctuary, starlight through cracked dome, and bronze doorknocker are not backdrop but active constraints: the charcoal dust coats lungs, the starlight shapes alien silhouettes, the ring’s warmth signals the moment of irrevocable choice. Micro-setting (scars in the wood) functions as tactile memory map. One hairline slip: “ink in rain” simile feels slightly generic amid otherwise precise imagery.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—whether to keep the dead out or release them—tightens through the sanctuary’s literal fade; the final act of stepping through forecloses retreat. Pressure escalates via Accumulative pattern: each burned bridge increases the weight of returning shadows. Cost is visible in the sanctuary’s exhalation and Lior’s irreversible exile.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of relinquishment versus guardianship emerges through concrete particulars: the doorknocker’s warmth, the shadow’s plea, the smoke that teaches breathing. Final image reweights the premise without moralizing—burning bridges becomes the only way to learn breath. Subtext in silence and gesture avoids any thematic statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded, with rhythmic control that accelerates under pressure (“thick as the charcoal dust coating his lungs”). Perceptual signature is consistent: Lior notices temperature, texture, and silence in a way that reveals his vocation. Compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence layers atmosphere, memory, and stakes. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is selective and purposeful. One minor register drift—“conceptual repricing” risk in “the smoke taught you how to breathe”—but the line earns its loft by landing the closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The premise—guardian who must burn his own sanctuary to free the dead he once abandoned—feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Familiar motifs (haunted sanctuary, burned bridges) are transformed through tactile specificity and the final inversion that exile equals mercy. Risk in lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
