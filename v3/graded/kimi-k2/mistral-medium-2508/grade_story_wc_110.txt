<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lena’s interiority is embodied and specific—thumb pressing cracked lens, pen hovering—yet her decisive act (sliding the ticket) arrives with only implied cost; the couple’s change feels more observed than compelled by her agency, capping the score just below 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: rain’s afterglow, ticket doodles, and lens-light fragments layer until the final image reweights the premise. Closure is a Charged Poise—tickets luminous, mistrust thawed—felt cost legible in Lena’s lighter heart and relinquished silence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Crystal forecourt’s hush and refracted light constrain acoustics and mood, guiding Lena’s eavesdropping and the ticket’s luminous payoff; micro-setting (lens, tickets) functions as extension of place, charging the final image without clutter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—thawing mistrust—tightens once when Lena’s doodled ticket forces the couple’s recognition; pressure is situational, crystallized by the ticket’s wordless honesty. Cost is felt but diffuse, keeping it shy of 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of honesty without words emerges organically from ticket-doodles and lens-light; final image of “shape of truth, drawn in ink and trust” offers resonant non-moral answer, reweighting prior material with quiet conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyric, controlled, and perceptually specific—“ghost of rain,” “thread pulling taut”—with purposeful compression taught early; no head-hopping, consistent psychic distance, rhythm modulates with emotional pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet clear, each sentence advancing image or interiority; no loops, mixed metaphors, or register drift. Minor scaffold in “the world was speaking plainly / And so, at last, was she” is earned by cadence shift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: wordless honesty via salvaged projector lens and concert tickets transforms familiar heartbreak trope; risk in lyric stillness pays off in resonant closure without gimmickry.</comment>
