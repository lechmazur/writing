<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s quiet persistence and refusal to monetize the flower root the story; his micro-choice to replant rather than display the seed crystallizes the thematic arc. Lina’s receptivity is shown, not told, through her tilted listening and return alone. The final hand-squeeze carries understated relational cost. Interiority stays concrete; no therapy-speak intrudes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elias renounces commercial success, choosing communal tending over profit, with the brook’s murmur as felt cost. Causal chain (seed → replant → wait → bloom → gathering) is tight; each beat narrows his options. Orientation is anchored early; transitions are legible. No plot amnesia or off-stage resolution.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The brook’s whisper and willow shelter constrain the final choice—replanting must happen where water sings. Micro-setting (glass case, back-door sign) guides action. Sensory detail is selective, filtered through Elias’s quiet attention. Spatial choreography holds; no white-room drift.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—safeguarding a space for slow, unsettling growth—is signaled in paragraph two and tightened when business slows to a halt. Agency lies in Elias’s renunciation; the cost is visible in empty appointment slots and shared vigil. No coincidence resolves; pressure coheres under situational lens.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the seed’s patient unfurling: innovation cannot be forced, only tended. Subtext lives in gestures—the hand-squeeze, the shared silence under the stinking bloom. No moralizing; the final image reweights earlier puzzles as communal ritual. Ambiguity lingers without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias; perceptual signature is hushed, tactile, slightly mythic. Diction (“ink that glinted like beetle-shells”) is precise yet unobtrusive. No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates with emotional intensity. Dialogue is sparse but subtextual.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and propulsive; no loops or scaffold. Metaphors serve rather than swamp. Sentence variety supports the quiet cadence. No register drift or mixed vehicles. Final line crystallizes without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The corpse-flower-as-puzzle premise is fresh, and the inversion—failure as prelude—feels inevitable. Specific details (spectrometer, sketchbook, bottle of burning liquor) ground the communal vigil. Risk in letting business die pays off in resonant closure. No derivative echoes.</comment>
