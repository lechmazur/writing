<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lior’s interiority is concrete—his skepticism, his tactile coin-rubbing, his gait as confession—but the final choice to stay and listen feels more thematic capstone than earned pivot; no prior beat shows him weighing exit against lingering. The woman’s pressure is present yet too spectral to function as crucible. Overall, a vivid consciousness whose change is asserted rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the slit opens, map blanks, and Lior steps through with the cost of perpetual listening. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—storm, footsteps, whispers layer until the final reconfiguration. Orientation is swift; causality is loose but coherent under lyric design. Only the woman’s vanish feels slightly convenient.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Port containers, frost, aurora bleed, and the coin’s worn edges all filter through Lior’s maintenance gaze, constraining his path choices. The dented steel slit acts as micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-biased; spatial choreography clean. Weather and maze evolve with the storm’s pulse.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove quiet endurance outlasts force—tightens when the storm rewrites routes and the woman offers the blank-map gamble. One clear deepening: Lior’s silent walk past her crystallizes his stance, foreclosing the loud exit. Cost is felt in the blank map and the unending listening. Agency remains internal but legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of quiet persistence versus brute noise emerges through gait, whispers, and the final invitation to keep listening. No explicit moralizing; resonance arises from the blank map and the slit that isn’t an exit. Ambiguity lingers without confusion. Only the woman’s thesis line skirts didactic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Voice is tactile, compressed, and rhythmically controlled—boots crunch, metal groans, storm hums. POV stays locked; perceptual signature sharp (“walk was a confession”). Dialogue minimal but subtextual. No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates cleanly under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is selective and purposeful. No loops or scaffold; each sentence layers atmosphere or stakes. Occasional elevated phrasing (“conceptual repricing” risk) stays within Lior’s reflective register. Clean mechanics, strong verbs, no mixed metaphors.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of geomagnetic noir and container labyrinth; the mutable metal maps and gait-reading feel specific to this world. Trope of “key with no lock” is reimagined as temporal aperture. Risk-taking in lyric structure pays off in closure. Derivative echoes minimal.</comment>
