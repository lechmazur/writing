<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s interior contradiction—collector vs. conduit—drives every beat; the moment he lets the borrowed grief flood him (“the widow’s voice dissolve…”) is a costly, earned pivot. The flaw (emotional parasitism) is dramatized, not labeled, and the final renunciation carries visible price. Minor slip: the blacksmith and child are off-page, so status dynamics bullet is moot.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias’s identity flips from printer to page under Accumulative/Textural lens—pattern of borrowed griefs coalesces into self-authored feeling. Causality holds: each borrowed persona tightens the noose until the halo mirror rewrites the sky. Cost is legible in the line “You were never the printer.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The topaz-dust workshop, halo fragment, and vanishing-star sky constrain every choice; the fragment literally rewrites the heavens at closure. Sensory detail is selective (ink, topaz, metallic tang) and filtered through Elias’s artisan eye. Spatial choreography is tight; no orientation drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—decode emotion’s math—tightens when the press prints Elias’s own face, forcing a trade-off: keep collecting or become the page. Escalation is one deepening under Accumulative lens; cost is the dissolution of borrowed safety. No reversals needed; the single crystallizing beat suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the concrete act of borrowing vs. giving; no moralizing. The final image—stars rewritten by felt experience—offers a non-literal answer to the widow’s question. Subtext in the sigils and the crossed-out name carries conceptual cost without exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct: ink-stained, alchemical, compressed yet lyrical. Perceptual signature—“faint metallic tang of something vast and newly born”—is Elias-specific. Patterned elision (stars vanish in clusters) is taught early and paid off. No POV leakage or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence layers sensory, emotional, and conceptual work. No loops, no mixed metaphors. Rhythm modulates with pressure—short clauses during the fragment’s pulse, longer breaths at closure. Clean mechanics; no artifacts in final third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—using fallen halo as printing die to transpose empathy—is fresh, non-obvious, and fully committed. Transformation test fails if names/places swapped; specificity is integral. Risky lyric structure pays off in the sky-rewrite closure. No derivative echoes.</comment>
