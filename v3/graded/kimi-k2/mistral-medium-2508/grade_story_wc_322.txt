<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elias’ interior contradiction—his compulsion to dissolve ownership of memories versus the personal price each weave exacts—is specific and embodied in the sinew thread. One micro-choice—handing the thread into the void—is pivotal to the RR. The woman functions more as philosophical mirror than second character; her presence doesn’t meaningfully complicate Elias’ status but allows a crisp voiced echo. No deeper interior contradiction surfaces after the eruption, so the final “Again?” feels slightly foregone rather than earned under escalating conflict.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The piece teaches its Accumulative/Textural lens from the first sentence; closure is a Charged Poise as the gallery collapses into ordinary space yet retains irretrievable memory weight. Causality holds throughout—each threaded moment becomes the fuse for communal revelation. Orientation is granted in the opening 30 words; no drift. Cost is palpable: the last thread snaps and renders the void “just an empty frame,” a genuine forfeiture under the chosen lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Gallery, void frame, and thread recur as living architectures that actively constrain Elias’ tactics; the shifting walls directly prevent retreat and anchor the RR. Sensory selection is lean and urgent: “beeswax and old paper,” “hummed,” “scent of jasmine.” No spatial or sensory drift. Final image leverages the empty frame—the micro-setting itself—as carrier of conceptual repricing: absence as charged presence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is singular: to prove memory is communal property through irrevocable exhibition. Pressure tightens once when dismantling is confirmed; Elias chooses to weave anyway. Escalation is textural—each eruption layers sensory overload rather than causal reversal—but remains coherent under the Accumulative lens. Cost is visible when the void ends in quotidian emptiness, a clear tightening under the inferred mode.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—“memory as shared haunt rather than property”—arises through image rather than exposition. Thread, void, and exchanged glances accrue weight until the final hush lands as subtext. The ending resists didactic moral; ambiguity lingers. A touch of poetic echo edges too close to articulated wonder in final lines, blunting full 8+ resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Narrative persona is coherent, lyric, and architect-biased: “geometries that shouldn’t exist” is a POV-filtered perception. No head-hopping. Diction ranges from precise technical—“sinew thread,” “void framed”—to sensorily textured. No leakage of omniscient exposition. Slight repetition of “again?” registers as stylistic echo rather than slackening.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Information density is high—“a fever dream architect,” “thread spun from his own memories”—each noun and verb earns thematic rent. One light echo on “thread” in adjacent clauses is negligible. Syntax is varied; paragraph cut test passes. No figurative muddle or mixed metaphors in peak beats. A single redundant “quiet explosion” phrase nicks the otherwise taut cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The transformation of a memory-sharing installation from immersive spectacle to communal mirror is specific, fresh, and thematically incarnated. The rational-enchantment core is never gimmicky; it grows from tangible material choices (thread, void, scent). The concept risks cliché but avoids it via sensory immediacy and ethical cost.</comment>
