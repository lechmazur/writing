<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is vivid—calloused hands, salt-worn ropes, “half-remembered hymn” gait—yet the sleepwalking agency remains slightly abstract; the final smile and winged shadow crystallize a credible renunciation with felt cost, but the shift from passive trance to active choice could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the labyrinth re-weaves itself into a door, the wharf’s ruin is foreclosed, and Elias steps into dawn “not empty-handed.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each pressed plate beat layers pattern until the stone itself rewrites—cost is legible in the ache of his bones and the vanished winged ink.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Red canyon walls, brine-stink, copper air, and the Heart Chamber’s pulsing stone are selective, sensory, and purposeful; the illustration plate and red dust veins act as micro-setting that constrains the final re-patterning, charging the closing image with undeniable weight.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“to carve a path from ruin to reverence”—is signaled early; pressure tightens as each plate-press irrevocably re-stitches the labyrinth, foreclosing retreat; the cost is the unmaking of the old wharf and the ache in Elias’s bones, visible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of mending broken precedents emerges through concrete action—sewing memory into stone—without moralizing; the final image of a winged shadow stretching toward an uncharted horizon offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights all prior ruin.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded in Elias’s perceptual signature—“frayed edges,” “salt-worn ropes,” “rusted iron” scent; rhythmic control under pressure, no head-hopping; purposeful elision of waking logic is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive—“veins of red dust rose like embers”—with only minor figurative excess; no loops, no filter-verb stacks; final cadence shift from lullaby to dawn-light is earned and clear.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Familiar ruin-to-reverence arc is transformed through the loom-labyrinth metaphor and sleepwalking weaver; the synthesis feels inevitable, the risk of abstract lyricism is navigated without loss of clarity, and the winged shadow image is fresh, specific, and unforgettable.</comment>
