<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Liora’s interior contradiction—yearning to un-eclipse the covenant yet fearing her own scars—drives every beat; the final “silver leaf blooming from the oldest scar” crystallizes her earned change with visible cost. Motivation stays rooted in her visionary flaw: she listens too late. Micro-choices (pressing the clipping to her wrist, running the root-bridge) are embodied and irreversible. The only drag is a touch of diagnostic self-labeling (“root-bound visionary”) that momentarily abstracts the struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the covenant is not broken but waiting, and Liora’s stance toward it has irreversibly shifted. Causal linkage holds—scars → maze path → future-self intersection → silver leaf—without teleportation or soft resets. The 120-word orientation anchor is met by line 3. Future-Liora’s “You’re early” supplies the felt cost: the covenant’s timetable is not hers to command.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The cobalt glade’s damp earth and crushed-violet scent are filtered through Liora’s urgency; the shifting hedge literally rewrites paths, constraining her choices. The maze topiary clipping evolves from key to sprouted leaf, charging the final image. Spatial choreography stays coherent across the root-bridge sequence. One minor drift: “bruised into dusk” risks cliché, but the color motif recovers by the end.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—un-eclipse the covenant—tightens when future-Liora declares it “not ready,” foreclosing premature victory. Each scar-burn narrows the maze options, turning internal pressure into external constraint. The cost is palpable: three days rooted to soil on the first attempt, and now the timetable mismatch. No coincidence resolves the conflict; Liora’s agency alone reconfigures the covenant’s accessibility.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the tension between heed and haste: listening to dreams is necessary but not sufficient; timing and scar-tribute matter. The covenant’s “waiting” reframes prophecy as collaborative, not granted. Subtext lives in gesture—silver leaf tucked behind the ear—rather than statement. The ending avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers about what “ready” will cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded: “the glade screamed—not in pain, but in recognition” teaches the pattern early and pays it off. Sensory selectivity (“scent of damp earth and crushed violets”) is character-specific. Syntax modulates with pressure—short clauses during the bridge run, longer coils during reflection. No POV leakage or register drift; future-Liora’s diction is autumnal but still Liora’s.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; each sentence layers image, motion, and stakes. Metaphors are coherent—maze as loom, scars as maps—and never muddle causality. One paraphrase loop (“the future had arrived… the future had arrived early”) is minor. Rhythm accelerates during the bridge sprint and breathes at the willow, supporting emotional contour. No scaffolding or filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The synthesis—scars as cartography for a living maze that weaves fate—feels inevitable yet fresh. The covenant’s “eclipse” is not cosmic but relational, a twist that deepens on reflection. Risk is taken in the future-self encounter, yet it lands because the scars prefigure it. No stock phrases or genre defaults; even “cobalt glade” is recharged by the color’s recurrence.</comment>
