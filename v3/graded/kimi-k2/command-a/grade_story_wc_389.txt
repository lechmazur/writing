<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias’s loneliness and visionary drive are sketched vividly, but interior contradiction is asserted rather than dramatized; the “variant allegiance” choice is declared, not embodied in micro-choices under pressure. His final smile feels earned, yet the cost is narrated rather than felt on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the portico’s activation reconfigures the world and Elias’s role, a Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost. Causal linkage is mostly intact, though the middle relies on montage-like summary rather than beat-by-beat escalation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The stormlit observatory is evocatively anchored; the cobalt portico’s shifting surface constrains Elias’s final action and charges the dawn image. Selective sensory detail supports tone without clutter, though spatial choreography during the climax is briefly vague.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>One dominant stake—shape a new dawn—is signaled early and tightened when the voice demands the “unfold” choice. The escalation is more atmospheric than beat-driven; the cost is visible but generalized rather than granular.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of bridging past and future emerges organically from the portico’s function and Elias’s sacrifice. The final dawn image offers resonant reweighting without moralizing, though subtext could be sharper in earlier beats.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet controlled, with a perceptual signature that favors cosmic scale and glassy light. No head-hopping; compression and patterned diction are consistent and purposeful.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is fluid and image-rich; occasional elevated phrasing skirts purple but stays within the visionary register. One paraphrase loop (“visions grew more vivid, more urgent”) slightly dulls momentum mid-text.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Familiar tropes of the lonely prophet and ancient artifact are refreshed through the storm-veiled observatory and the portico’s fracturing light. The synthesis feels inevitable rather than gimmicky.</comment>
