<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s grief-driven determination is embodied in tactile rituals (tracing the spine, arranging shells) and crystallizes in her steady “I’ve come to parley.” Yet the retrocognitive entrapment is asserted more than dramatized; we never feel her mind slip or pay a visible price, so the interior contradiction remains partly abstract.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the lagoon’s acceptance reconfigures Elara’s options and the cost—an open-ended guardianship—hovers in the stilling water. Causal chain is clean (diary → messages → apparition), but the apparition’s instant assent feels slightly convenient, muting the earned price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The zeppelin’s drifting shadow and the obsidian mirror-lagoon are vivid, selective, and directly pressure the parley; the lagoon’s surface literally reconfigures to deliver the guardian. A touch more sensory narrowing under stress would push it higher.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth for the silenced—is signaled early and tightens when the guardian’s question forces Elara to pledge herself. The cost is implied rather than visceral; a concrete forfeiture (time, safety, memory) would sharpen the final beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of erased histories demanding voice emerges organically from diary, lagoon, and ritual; the ending’s charged silence offers a resonant, non-moralizing answer. One near-explicit line—“truth in tension”—leans toward statement rather than image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet disciplined, with rhythmic control (“dark whisper across the sands”) and a consistent archivist’s perceptual signature. No head-hopping; compression and elision are purposeful and paid off in the final hush.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, propulsive, and information-dense; figurative language is selective. Minor scaffold appears (“each piece a word, each arrangement a sentence”) but does not stall momentum or cloud the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Floating civil-rights archive above an obsidian lagoon is a fresh synthesis; the diary-to-parley path feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk is moderate—more conceptual than structural—so the score sits just below the highest band.</comment>
