<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is vivid—her boots sinking, the satchel’s mystery, the clock’s weight—but the “occasionally everywhere” gaze is ornamental, never complicating a choice. The final smile feels tidy; no contradictory impulse is dramatized in the archive. Still, her embodied awe and the micro-choice to clasp the charm anchor her arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the ticking clock re-ignites the archive and reweights Mara’s role from cultivator to guardian of divergence. Causal chain holds—charm descent → archive revival → new jars—though the archive’s “dying” stakes are asserted more than dramatized. One transition (dune to cavern) is clean.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The glowing dune is tactile—sand shifts, warms, guides—yet the archive interior slips toward white-room. The chess clock’s glow and the pendant’s cool metal serve as micro-settings that constrain the final gesture, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“cultivate sparks”—is signaled early and tightened when Mara realizes the archive needs the clock. Cost is conceptual: she must surrender the relic’s stasis to restart time, foreclosing her own nostalgic refuge. One clear escalation beat suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of divergence versus preservation emerges through the archive’s rearranging shelves and new jars; no moral is stated. The final image of “protect their divergence” reframes the earlier lullaby without sermonizing. Subtext is carried by objects, not exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet grounded in sensory detail; “fractured lullaby” motif modulates from whisper to archive hum. No POV drift; perceptual signature is consistent. Compression in the descent sequence is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; occasional elevated diction (“otherworldly,” “converged”) edges purple but never stalls momentum. No loops or scaffold. Final ticking line lands with cadence shift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of post-apocalyptic caretaker, quantum-charm, and living archive feels fresh; tropes are transformed through tactile specificity. The risk of lyric abstraction is balanced by grounded stakes. One clear inflection: sparks diverge rather than simply survive.</comment>
