<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—her needle hovering, heartbeat syncing with the flame—but the mentor-shaped void is asserted more than dramatized, muting the cost of her final resolve. Lira’s reappearance supplies relational pressure, yet their shared history is sketched in shorthand, blunting the crucible effect. The earned shift from skepticism to guardianship of the flame is legible, though the prior causality feels compressed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the completed chart crystallizes new purpose under the Accumulative/Textural lens, the observatory’s hum and dawn-light reweighting earlier silence. Causality holds—flame pulses chart shifts Lira arrives synchronized stitching—but the mentor’s disappearance is exposited rather than dramatized, a minor ellipsis. Orientation is swift and spatial anchors remain stable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The cobalt dome, eternal candle, and shifting tapestry function as micro-settings that constrain choice: the candle’s steady glow anchors reality, the dome’s glass reflects mutable constellations, the fabric literally re-forms under Elara’s fingers. Autumn dusk and dawn bracket the scene with sensory economy. One spatial slip—door location relative to work-cushion is vague—keeps it from 8.0+.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve the observatory’s cosmic gateway—surfaces early and tightens when Lira reveals the plot to extinguish the flame. Escalation is one deepening: from solitary listening to collaborative synchronization, with the cost of lost anonymity and assumed danger. Agency is clear; coincidence is absent. The price (perpetual vigilance) is implied more than dramatized, capping the band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of listening as resistance emerges through action—stitching, synchronizing—rather than statement. The flame’s shift from keepsake to keystone quietly reweights the premise. Subtext in Lira’s “I’ve come to synchronize” carries layered urgency. Final image of dawn-lit tapestry offers resonant non-moral answer: vigilance is the new embroidery.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with tactile diction—“threads of silver and gold,” “velvet cushion”—filtered through Elara’s artisan perception. Rhythm modulates: longer cadences for reflection, clipped beats under threat. No head-hopping; POV remains anchored. Dialogue is spare and subtextual, though Lira’s register edges toward exposition.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, vivid, and propulsive; figurative language is selective—“cobalt observatory,” “echoed silence”—and never clutters high-pressure beats. One minor loop: “the conspiracy is closer than you think” echoes prior phrasing. No mixed metaphors or register drift. Final paragraph achieves charged poise without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The fusion of embroidery, astronomy, and political conspiracy feels fresh; the eternal candle as cosmic anchor is a non-obvious pivot. Tropes of mentor disappearance and secret gate are transformed through tactile craft. Specificity of star-chart stitching grounds the speculative frame. Risk is moderate but coherent; no gimmicks.</comment>
