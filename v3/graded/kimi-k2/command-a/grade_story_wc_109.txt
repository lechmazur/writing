<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The oracle’s obsession is clear and embodied in tactile ritual, but interior contradiction remains abstract; no moment shows the cost of this obsession altering tactics. The final smile registers as performance rather than earned renunciation, softening the sting of “work far from over.”</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the map of night crystallizes in the oracle’s mind as the last star dies, reweighting the premise with undeniable conceptual cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each silence-layer tightens the pattern—yet the cost is more atmospheric than viscerally felt on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The fort’s stones, the booklet’s flaking gold, and the dimming sky are vivid and selective, but only the booklet’s faint glow actively constrains the oracle’s next choice. The storm remains backdrop rather than tactical pressure, capping the score just below the 9-band gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—completing the endless-night map—escalates as each summarized silence adds contour, tightening under the Accumulative lens. Yet the cost is diffuse; no single beat shows the oracle forfeiting a concrete alternative path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the oracle’s act: mapping darkness as an act of love and erasure. The final image of the vanished star reconfigures the premise without moralizing, though the conceptual cost could be sharper.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is lyric, controlled, and consistent; patterned elision (“summarizing silence”) is taught early and paid off at closure. Sensory filtering is character-specific, though occasional elevated diction edges toward the poetic register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with only minor scaffold (“the oracle’s voice was a mere whisper” echoes prior phrasing). Metaphors cohere, and sentence variety supports the ambered hush cadence without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The conceit of mapping night through curated silences feels fresh and inevitable; the risk of lyric abstraction is mostly rewarded. A slight over-reliance on familiar gothic atmospherics keeps it from the 9-band.</comment>
