<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is concrete—“fingers tracing the worn surface,” legs wobbling—and her contradictory impulse (clinging to broken compass vs. trusting utilitarian poles) plays out in scene. The final renunciation—tucking the compass away—occurs on-page with felt cost. Reflection exceeds the 20% cap and is somewhat expository; it tilts stance but also flattens micro-choice density. Interior voice is distinctive, yet minor therapy-speak drift (“align her heart and her actions”).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens: rising image density from compass → poles → sunrise crests reweights stakes (“mocking” dawn → “golden light” promise). Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration; Mara’s smile crystallizes new stance without resolving all regrets; cost is felt. Minor ambiguity on exact time elapsed mid-paddle. Orientation and causality are legible under the taught pattern; no breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Salt scent, seaweed, weathered kayak hull, and brass compass create an integrated coastal micro-setting. The poles explicitly constrain navigation choices; their shrinking on the water charges the final image. Sensory detail is filtered through Mara's functional priorities (spacing, horizon). No global caps triggered; meets 9+ gate (constraint shapes tactics).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</question>
<comment>Dominant stake: reclaim direction/self-trust. Tightening occurs when Mara swaps failing compass for pole-navigation—an embodied choice that costs her the certainty tool. Pressure intensifies under Accumulative lens: failed stars → stable poles → sunrise—each layer narrows options without external resolution. No cheap coincidence; escalation is earned.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</question>
<comment>Theme of adaptation vs perfection emerges from objects (compass → poles) and embodiment, never declared. Last image (“merrily melancholic smile”) reweights prior failures without lecture. Subtext is present and specific, though final sentence verges on overt thematic summation. Avoids sentimental closure nonetheless.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</question>
<comment>Cohesive close-third lyric voice: perceptual signatures of a navigator’s eye. Syntax varies with urgency; no head-hopping. Drift into slightly elevated diction only once (“melancholic echo of her own fractured heart”) but rhythm holds. Interior monologue is filtered and particular.</comment>

<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and free of loops or scaffold; sentence length modulates. One mixed metaphor “salt-thick air” barely registers. No artifacts in closure beat. Occasional adjectival stacking around regret but does not fog clarity. Reads aloud smoothly.</comment>

<grade>7.5</question>
<comment>Transforms familiar “lost sailor” trope by replacing stars with mundane utility poles as map, a fresh angle. Risk taken is mild but thematically coherent. Specificity of kayak scars and brass compass detail anchors the universal without gimmickry.</comment>
