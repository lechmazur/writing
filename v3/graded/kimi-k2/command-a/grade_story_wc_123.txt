<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias’s solitude-versus-duty conflict is sketched but never embodied in a contradictory micro-choice; the pivot from “integrity in solitude” to “integrity demands action” is asserted rather than dramatized. His interiority is generic (“his mind raced,” “his resolve hardening”) and the masked figure supplies exposition instead of applying relational pressure. The final stance crystallizes, but the cost is only gestured at, not felt on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a soft Earned Stasis—Elias leaves with “new purpose”—but the causal chain from message tube to decision is thin: he slips past guards via an off-stage “intuit,” then receives an info-dump that resolves the mystery. The rogue zone’s stakes are declared, not tested; the ending lacks a visible or conceptual price. Orientation is clear, yet the drive lens drifts between situational pressure and causal linkage without tightening either.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The courtyard’s damp-earth dusk and the industrial wasteland’s cold hum are sharply evoked, filtering through Elias’s sensorium. Details guide movement—floodlights dictate stealth, the tower’s spiral staircase narrows options—but no setting element reconfigures the final image or exacts a concrete cost. Strong atmosphere, but the environment remains backdrop rather than constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—“something’s been released”—is declared late and never materializes as an on-page threat; tension derives from sneaking, not from the storm-borne contagion. One tightening beat occurs when Elias decides to enter the zone, yet the price (solitude breached) is summarized, not dramatized. Agency is present but undercut by coincidence: guards’ patterns are intuited rather than earned.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of integrity versus isolation emerges implicitly through Elias’s reluctant response to the message, but the final paragraph moralizes (“he understood that integrity demanded action”), blunting subtext. The storm as unnatural symptom offers conceptual weight, yet its connection to Elias’s personal code is asserted rather than discovered through action. Resonance is present but not fully earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays consistently anchored to Elias’s perceptions; sensory selectivity (“scent of damp earth,” “faint hum”) reflects his observational bent. Syntax is clean, though metaphors lean familiar (“symphony he knew all too well”). Dialogue is sparse and functional; the masked figure’s speech is expository rather than textured, but voice remains coherent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is fluid and largely free of loops; occasional filler (“he knew all too well,” “he couldn’t ignore it”) is minor. Sentence rhythm modulates with tension, and spatial choreography is clear. No figurative muddle or register drift, yet no line-level brilliance either; the writing is competent but not arresting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>The fusion of storm-tracking expertise with covert bio-hazard intrigue is fresh, and the carrier-pigeon anachronism adds texture. Yet the rogue-zone reveal feels like standard dystopian scaffolding, and Elias’s pivot from recorder to reluctant hero follows a predictable arc. Specificity is solid, but the synthesis stops short of risk-taking.</comment>
