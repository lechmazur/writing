<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara projects contradictory impulses (holds unbearable truth versus absorbing all) and is shaped through micro-choices (finger smudge that redefines the illustration). Interiority is embodied and specific; the oracle’s passivity is precise—she endures rather than resolves, a credible renunciation earned by prior evidence and landing with felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout: density of the botanical motif and weather station hum tighten until the smudged flower image commands a Resonant Reconfiguration. Q2 oversees closure; Elara’s earned stance (occupying the margins forever) is on-page and conceptually priced, satisfying the closure gate.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Station’s metal frame and ozone scent anchor the mountain perch; physical micro-setting informs Elara’s peripherality. Environmental pressure is subtle (thin air, storms) yet lacks direct constraint on the final choice, trimming the upper band margin.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Swaying-certainties concept drives tone and shaken epistemology; however, it escalates internally rather than tightening external options. Growth accumulates to the botanical distortion but never changes Elara’s tactics—score stays in high mid-tiers.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The plea for “weight of a swallowed truth” weaves through every beat, culminating in the final reconfiguration where sorrow converts to resilient poise. Theme emerges organically, no tidy moral; reversal is non-literal and resonant.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lyric compression with rhythmic variation under pressure; sensory filter is POV-specific. Dialogue absent, so voice relies on interior texture and attentive misperception; misalignment of flower image fulfills distinctive perceptual signature.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong lyrical economy, but occasional abstract “auroral sorrow” labels cloud embodiment (-0.2). Rhythm propels quiet revelation without ornamental density; line-level artifacts minor and do not impact closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Calling a protagonist an “oracle” is familiar, yet placing her at a weathered station with smudged botanical drawing re-weights the trope through grounded specificity. No radical formal experiment, but synthesis converts cliché into earned image.</comment>
