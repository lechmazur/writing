<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Lira’s desire to inscribe memory on skin is vivid, but her internal contradiction (yearning vs. fear of erasure) is stated more than dramatized; the final stance crystallizes, yet the cost feels more asserted than embodied. “She knew the risk—discovery meant erasure” tells rather than shows the stakes on her body.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the sentinel’s retreat reconfigures the garden’s silence and Lira’s resolve, with the verse glowing as both shield and sword; causality holds under Accumulative/Textural lens. One transition (twilight → full night) is legible; orientation is anchored by 120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The garden’s obsidian petals and dewy gaps constrain Lira’s dance steps and supply the ink medium; the moonstone dust’s glow charges the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent—feet trace constellations, sentinel halts at edge.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserving forbidden memory—tightens when footsteps approach; Lira’s choice to stand tall narrows options and carries implicit cost (future erasure). Pressure escalates via sensory density, not causal chain, fitting Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of memory vs. sanctioned forgetting emerges through image (inked galaxies on skin) rather than statement; final whispered “fledge” reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext in sentinel’s hesitation is effective.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice maintains consistent perceptual signature—selective attention to gaps, petals, starlight—without head-hopping. Syntax modulates with emotional crest: short clauses under threat (“She knew she could not flee”).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic; occasional elevated diction (“obsidian grace,” “cosmic verse”) fits lyrical mode. No loops or scaffold; metaphors stay coherent. Minor filter verb cluster (“seemed to conspire”) does not dull momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fusion of tide-dancer exile, moonstone ink, and nostalgia-ban yields fresh mythic texture; transformation test passes—story would collapse without these specific elements. Risk in lyric stillness is rewarded by resonant closure.</comment>
