<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Zara’s trauma-borne compulsion to protect the photograph is vivid, but the internal contradiction between paralyzing fear and blossoming creativity flips too cleanly in the penultimate paragraph; a more frayed transition to her first decisive sketch would earn higher.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><closure lands cleanly: the on-page “sketchpad on the bench, the photograph safe in her pocket” crystallizes a Charged Poise; the price (renouncing refuge, embracing art) is visible.<comment>Closure lands cleanly: the on-page “sketchpad on the bench, the photograph safe in her pocket” crystallizes a Charged Poise; the price (renouncing refuge, embracing art) is visible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>“Loose stone at cliff-edge,” “relentless crash of waves” directly constrain her physical crawl and echo interior precarity; however the arboretum’s flora remain mostly atmospheric backdrop instead of active leverage in the final beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</question><comment>Stakes center on regaining meaning after violent loss; the tightening moment—the near-fall that forces stillness/reframe—is concrete, yet the cost is only implied, not visibly etched into her body or choices in the final paragraph.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</question><comment>Theme of stillness as survivor’s grace emerges through pattern: jasmine scent → freeze → cliff precarity → renewed sketch; stays anchored in particulars; avoids moralizing, yet a faint thematic echo in “she understood now…testament to endurance” trims 0.3.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</question><comment>Tight third-person lyric interiority with selective sensory diction (“wind…salt and blooming jasmine”), though occasional abstract distillate “in a world that had since shattered” edges toward exposition rather than POV-tinted detail.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</question>
<comment>Rhythmic control is strong—long lines mirror wind swell then shorten under literal cliff stress; two minor scaffold repetitions (“teetered…teetering”) slip in without dulling the penultimate surge.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</question>
<comment>The drone-strike-to-art-resilience arc is familiar; freshness arrives via somatic markers as art-impetus. Yet “crumpled photograph at cliff edge” risks iconic cliché, pulling originality back to mid-band.</comment>
