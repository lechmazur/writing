<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s “prism-minded” trait is shown through pattern-seeing rather than told, and her trembling hand at the seed shows embodied cost; yet interiority stays safe, never risking contradiction under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the seed in hand crystallizes new guardianship with felt weight; causality holds under a Situational lens—gravity’s inversion forces stance crystallization without tidy payoff.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Grotto veins and mist are filtered through Elara’s urgent focus, guiding micro-choices; the glowing seed at the end recharges the “clandestinely luminous” motif, tying setting to final cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—unlock forgotten combinations—tightens once when gravity flips, narrowing options to a single seed; agency is clear, cost visible, no reversal beyond the threshold moment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of custodianship emerges through the seed’s transfer, never sermonized; the serpent-key doodle’s shift from map to talisman reweights meaning without explicit statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays close to Elara’s selective perception; prose modulates from hushed anticipation to breathless ascent, no head-hop or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and rhythm, propelling the ascent; minor scaffold (“the luminescence intensified, casting long, dancing shadows”) but no loops or mixed metaphors in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Inversion of gravity as annual portal feels fresh; serpent-key doodle evolving into living map avoids cliché, though “seed of vigilance” edges close to trope without deeper twist.</comment>
