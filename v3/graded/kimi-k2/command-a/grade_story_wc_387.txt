<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Interiority is sensorily solid—‘smooth surface cool against her skin’ gives Elara texture—but motive to ‘uncover hidden patterns’ remains thematic assertion without visible stakes. No contradictory impulses, no on-page choice with cost; the closure is appreciative rather than renunciatory. The character read is coherent and atmosphere-anchored but not tested under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Closure is Charged Poise: final paragraph crystallizes stance rather than foreclosing a path, and ‘sense of peace’ tells rather than dramatizes felt cost. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—impression layering toward resonance—which the last paragraphs echo, though linkage across beats is looser than best-in-class. No orientation debt; spatial/ temporal anchors are clear within first 120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Parapet stones, rain-slick jasmine, and floating fireflies are vivid but remain scene backdrop rather than constraint; the lone bamboo whisk is the micro-setting that finally charges Elara’s stance. Sensory triangulation is strong, idiom consistent, weather felt in damp stone and rising wind; meets 9+ quick test via object-charged closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—‘honor the unseen labor’—is thematic, never concretized into escalating jeopardy or sacrificed option. Accumulation of images provides tonal deepening but no single beat forces Elara to relinquish or risk anything on-screen. Escalation plateau at contemplative deepening.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of ‘hidden effort as sacred unseen architecture’ emerges implicitly through nets, whisk, firefly paths; no didactic final summary. Final paragraph offers quiet conceptual re-pricing as the tapestry of effort reweights Elara’s self-concept, earning resonance without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</question>
<comment>Perceptual signature is distilled, lyrical, bias-tuned: ‘scent of damp stone and blooming jasmine’ seen only through Elara’s fisherman-eye priorities. Free-indirect style handles micro-shifts of thought without head-hop, sentence rhythm modulates between hush and hush-plus-pulse in sync with firefly pulses. No register drift, no artifact clusters under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</question>
<comment>Prose is textured and compressed; few loops beyond mild stock ‘silhouette framed’ and second-instance ‘whisper’. Vivid economy—each object does new work by end. Final sentence lands image cleanly, no figurative muddle. Slight hedge words (‘seemed to’, ‘faint glow’) keep it just under 9 band purity but never slack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</question>
<comment>Net-mender philosopher is fresh axis, and firefly moon-path conceit feels particular. Core premise remains a meditation, not a transformed trope; high familiarity risk of ‘philosopher on parapet’. Gains via specificity of nets & whisk, but stakes stay low-consequence.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.9</question><grade>Single continuous choice—to stand, think, revere—without visible forfeit keeps score modest. Philosopher status cues early, but causal pressure never rises.</grade>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</question><grade>Introduced early, physically handled (cool skin touch), returns in final image as talisman that crystallizes insight; removing it would dilute the earned crystallization beat.</grade>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</question><grade>Discussed thematically, never enacted in action tactics; patterns never constrain a visible choice or resource. Remains thematic aspiration rather than operational engine.</grade>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.5</question><grade>Trait stated as label, no on-page consequence altering moves; no cost incurred from the ‘somber’.</grade>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.2</question><grade>Whistle beats twice—once accidental, once deliberate—but never redefines a live option; could be swapped for sigh or soft hush without structural breakage. Adds atmospheric note rather than lever.</grade>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.1</question><grade>‘Moon paths’ lovely but appears late as interpretive metaphor; no tactical use earlier in choice set-up.</grade>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</question><grade>Constantly present, richly rendered; yet it provides backdrop more than resource constraint. Its micro-setting role is atmospheric reinforcement rather than tactical leverage.</grade>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</question><grade>Seasonal motif establishes mood but does not impose a ticking clock or limit action; time unfurls quietly without pressure.</grade>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.0</question><grade>Motive—‘to appreciate hidden effort’—guides contemplation but never collides with opposing desire, hence no clear cost or sacrifice enacted; remains thematic desire more than dramatized conflict.</grade>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</question><grade>Tone modulates between modest hush and intellectual boldness; final image carries the blend, giving quiet assertiveness to stillness. The modulation is coherent but not sharply tested under pressure.</grade>
