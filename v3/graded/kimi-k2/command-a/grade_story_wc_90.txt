<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s pacifism is stated but never tested; no contradictory impulse is dramatized. The “shadow work” remains abstract, so her interior arc feels asserted rather than earned. Final “ghostly resolve” lands as mood, not visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the portal opens and Elara steps back aboard, but the causal chain is thin: the tear’s insertion triggers the gate without prior constraint or price. Orientation is clear; lens is Accumulative/Textural.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>The recycled ship and golden dimension are sketched with selective, purposeful detail. Micro-setting (tool belt, tear) constrains action, but the ruins never press back on Elara’s choices. Sufficient specificity for the word count.</comment>
<question>4</question>
<grade>6.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—unlock the dimension to save humanity—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once when the tear merges with the core, but the cost is aesthetic light, not a felt forfeiture. Escalation is present yet mild.</comment>
<question>5</question>
<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Theme of compassion-as-renewal emerges through image rather than statement. Subtext is strongest in the stitching-as-prayer motif. Final light-spill avoids moralizing, offering a quiet reweighting of grief into hope.</comment>
<question>6</question>
<grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited is stable; perceptual signature is calm, slightly lyrical, matching Elara’s pacifist lens. No dialogue to test voice distinction. Rhythm breathes with scene needs; occasional elevated diction fits the mythic register.</comment>
<question>7</question>
<grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and mostly loop-free. One paraphrase loop (“light… golden light”) near the end dulls momentum slightly. Otherwise high density, no mixed metaphors.</comment>
<question>8</question>
<grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Familiar tropes—last human, mystical relic, dimension portal—are refreshed by pacifist ethos and textile magic. The synthesis feels organic but not startlingly fresh. Specificity of stitching elevates it above template.</comment>
