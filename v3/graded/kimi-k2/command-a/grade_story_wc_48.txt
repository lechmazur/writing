<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Interiority feels consistent and specific; conflicted stance plays through micro-moves—“part of her wanted to turn away…”—but interior monologue leans into therapeutic cadence (“felt an indelible mark”) just as stakes spike. Final choice—placing shell among others—lands as genuine renunciation backed by prior beats; cost reads emotionally but could be made more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure is a clear Earned Stasis: fragment laid among glowing shells refigures “collecting” into “solemnizing” stories, foreclosing Elara’s earlier escape impulse. Cause holds: fragment’s glow cues each encounter, driving deeper into nexus; final image recasts entire walk as pilgrimage, cost legible in surrender of narrative control (“her words flowing like a river”).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Mist, shore, and the fragment itself are visceral, selective—never touristy—and constrain movement: glow cuts fog, tree of shells dictates center. Micro-setting on the fragment satisfies the 9+ gate: cool curvature and growing warmth directly shape Elara’s hand, heartbeat, and final placement choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“collecting hopes without being consumed”—is signaled early and steadily escalates under Accumulative/Textural lens: each cameo raises emotional density until the tree of shells makes retreat impossible. Cost is visible when Elara relinquishes proprietary control over the stories; agency remains hers, though escalation could be sharper if an earlier exit option were shown then stripped away.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly: memory as living resistance against erasure. The return image of glowing shells reweights the fragment’s initial trinket status into communal archive. Only lapse is one near-articulate line “she knew her work was not just…” that nudges thematic summary; otherwise resonance grows through specifics rather than lecture.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet controlled: swirling syntax matches psychic state without sliding into purple. Perceptual signature—Elara’s synesthetic awareness “air alive with secrets,” “cool surface grounding her”—remains consistent. Only minor lapse with one elevated diction “indelible mark” that edges toward label territory. Line rhythm escalates and breathes at key beats.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Sentence economy is strong: dense sensory imagery (“air alive with secrets”) propels beats without redundancy. A few filter stacks (“she felt a surge…”) dull immediacy at peak moments but never loop. Imagery is purposeful: mist-into-shawl, fragment-into-key. Zero typos; paragraph cuts yield clean visual rhythm.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Familiar tropes—liminal nexus, ghostly histories—are transformed through tactile micro-setting and a novelist protagonist who must surrender authorship. Risk lies in subtle inversion of creative ownership; payoff is earned because the “collect stories” quest ends by relinquishing control to the nexus itself, a non-obvious synthesis.</comment>
