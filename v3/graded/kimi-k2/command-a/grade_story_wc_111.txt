<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is textured and embodied (gnarled hands, deliberate polishing), but the “wisely pragmatic” trait is asserted more than dramatized; the final renunciation feels earned yet the cost is more conceptual than visceral. No contradictory impulses are staged in scene, so the 9+ quick test is missed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias’s placement of the final marble crystallizes his stance with visible cost (“garden had finally acknowledged his presence”). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of marbles and garden response reweights the stake—but the causality between polishing and garden’s “whisper” is lyrical rather than strictly because/therefore.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Garden and marbles are rendered with selective sensory detail that constrains Elias’s ritual; the cracked marbles’ glow and the maze’s turns guide his daily placement. The final image of light mingling with fading day charges the closure, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—proving mutual recognition between gardener and garden—is signaled early and tightens through daily ritual; each polished marble narrows tomorrow’s options. The cost is conceptual (acceptance of cracks) rather than a tangible forfeiture, keeping it below 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of “mended deception” emerges organically from the marbles’ cracks and garden’s hidden flaws; the ending reframes imperfection as beauty without sermonizing. The final rustle-as-gratitude offers a resonant, non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays close to Elias’s perceptual filter; diction is spare, tactile, and consistent. Rhythm modulates with ritual slowness then lifts in the charged final image. No dialogue, so voice purity is maintained.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; occasional soft repeats (“garden seemed to…”) are minor. No mixed metaphors or scaffold; clarity never wavers at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Quantified luck is lightly sketched but not explored; the cracked marbles as memory-vessels feel fresh, though the “garden knows its gardener” notion flirts with pastoral cliché. Specificity of Elias’s ritual rescues it from template.</comment>
