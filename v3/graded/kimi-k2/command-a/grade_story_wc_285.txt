<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Coachman's motivation—distilling complexity into essence—is cleanly telegraphed and revisited, but the figure-mentor arrives ex nihilo: no prior pressure or relational crucible puts the coachman’s flaw into play, so the “promise” revelation feels more lecture than earned choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Lens lands as Accumulative/Textural: fog density and yarn needle come back into the final image, the ticking gutter spell runs out to trigger a cadence shift. Yet causal impetus for the mentor’s appearance is missing; nothing in prior texture seeds that beat, costing 0.4 under lens ambiguity rule.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fog, ticking gutters, and the silver needle function as micro-setting that actively obscures/illuminates choice. Visual weight is balanced; only the river’s description slips slightly into tourist-travelogue. Details filter through POV without scaffolding.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—acquire the promise—is personal and signaled early, but escalation is purely atmospheric pressure; no concrete forfeiture or resource jeopardy tightens until the figure hands over a scroll, diluting the cost legibility required to push above 7.0.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of erasure and persistence rises palimpsest-style from fog, yarn, past-inscribed scroll. Final lines keep the paradox intact instead of moralizing. Some risk of thematic echo in mentor’s speech, but subtext rescues it via imagery.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Voice lingers in a hushed, weather-soaked register whose rhythm sways like the fog. Line-level diction is consistent; one drift toward philosophical diction (“conceptual repricing”) during climax but coherent under POV strain. Compression and sensory autonomy remain tight.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Metaphorical layering is controlled; only minor redundancy when fog is twice called “both barrier and bridge.” No scaffold-sentences or filter-verb stacks. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with the ticking gutter cadence, allowing sentence length variation.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Palimpsest-as-literary-device is familiar, but its integration into the micro-stage of fog and yarn needle feels particular. The unknown mentor trope borrowed from folk-vision, though, flirts with “clever twist” rather than transformation.</comment>
