<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s homesickness and guardian identity are embodied through her sensory absorption of the garden and her refusal to abandon the library; the final renunciation carries visible cost. Interiority is specific (“dimensionally homesick,” “feral instincts”), yet a few lines drift toward label-speak (“make friends with uncertainty”). Micro-choice at climax—tightening grip, steady voice—earns the Earned Stasis. Secondary character (keeper) applies direct pressure, but voice distinction is minimal.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elara’s “I will wait” forecloses immediate return, cost framed by “the garden will fade.” Causal chain—pendant appears → keeper warns → choice made—holds under Situational lens. Orientation is clear by line 3; no teleporting props. One meaningful tightening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Frozen garden and mist are not backdrop; they seep into Elara’s pores and shape her decision to endure. Pendant’s warming glow and crystalline foliage are selective, tactile details that charge the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent; no white-room drift. Environment constrains choice, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—library’s safety versus homesickness—signaled early. Escalation tightens once: keeper’s warning raises cost of using pendant. Agency rests in Elara’s refusal; cost is legible (“the garden will fade”). No reversals beyond the single decisive tightening, adequate for 600–800 words.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of embracing uncertainty emerges through Elara’s refusal to choose exile, embodied in the charged image of sentinel stillness. Subtext in dialogue (“What belongs to you in this place?”) carries implication without sermon. Final image reweights earlier motifs without moralizing. Avoids tidy resolution; ambiguity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Voice is consistent, lyric-feral: “eyes like shards of obsidian,” “coiled like a predator.” Perceptual signature filters setting through Elara’s alien senses. Dialogue is sparse but goal-driven; keeper’s diction could be more distinct. No POV drift; psychic distance modulates with tension.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and propulsive; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is selective (“mist seeped into her pores”) and avoids purple drift. One mixed metaphor (“foggy lucidity of her thoughts”) barely grazes clarity. High information density; sentences advance stakes or atmosphere.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: feral librarian, dimensional exile, and sentient frozen garden cohere into a singular mythic shard. Pendant-as-key trope is grounded in specific cost. Risky lyric compression pays off in final sentinel image. No derivative echoes; premise feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
