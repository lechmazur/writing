<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her fingers brushing the quill holder, her pulse quickening at the key—but the “calmly inventive” trait is asserted more than dramatized; the final choice to activate the cradle feels slightly under-motivated because Thorne’s hesitation is too brief to crystallize her risk. The mentor gift anchors backstory without violating BRR, yet the cost of betrayal is named rather than felt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: blackout → investigation → key discovery → cradle ignition. Closure lands as Decisive Change with conceptual cost—the fort’s light reconfigures social reality—though the blackout’s origin remains off-stage, a mild ellipsis. Orientation is clear by line 3; no teleporting props.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The luminous fort at twilight is sketched with selective sensory strokes (dying torches, star shimmer) that guide Elara’s stealth and hide Thorne’s approach. The sundial’s half-painted angles function as micro-setting that literally constrains the code-breaking action. A sharper tactile detail on the cradle’s eruption would have pushed higher.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—awakening the populace without bloodshed—is signaled early and tightened when Thorne blocks her path. The blackout intensifies pressure, the key retrieval narrows options, and the ignition exacts the social cost of exposure. One meaningful turn suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of non-violent revolution emerges organically from Elara’s choice to make the fort “buzz with newfound energy” rather than destroy it. Subtext in Thorne’s loosened sword grip hints at internal fracture without exposition. Final “winking hush” risks a touch of meta-commentary but lands as Charged Poise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Elara’s perceptual filter; diction (“luminous,” “eerie stillness”) matches her watchman’s vigilance. Dialogue between Elara and Thorne is spare, subtextual, and differentiated. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; occasional elevated phrasing (“insidious,” “cascade of light”) flirts with overwriting but never stalls momentum. No loops or scaffold. One mixed metaphor—“veil for something far more insidious”—slips by unnoticed in flow.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Familiar rebellion tropes are refreshed by the blackout-as-catalyst and the sundial-cipher mechanism. The cradle as non-violent beacon rather than weapon offers a fresh inflection. Specificity of the bronze quill holder as key template feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
