<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s grief and resolve are embodied in her purposeful gait and the drone’s release; the moment she sees her brother’s last moments crystallizes her shift from vengeance to acceptance. Yet the interior contradiction between anger and serenity is stated more than dramatized, and the final choice feels lightly earned because the cost is implied rather than enacted.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the ink’s revelation reweights the premise from “control time” to “accept memory,” with Elara’s lighter heart as felt cost. Causal chain is intact—drone leads, ink shows, stance shifts—though the ink’s rules are revealed rather than tested earlier.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Wind-sculpted sand and silvery post-eclipse light are vivid and selective; the tent’s diagrams and vial anchor the scene. The setting never actively constrains choice, but the drone’s metallic glint against desert hues charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—uncover why time distorts in crisis—is signaled early and tightened when the ink forces confrontation with memory. Escalation is single-note: discovery, revelation, acceptance. Cost is emotional, visible in tears, but no tactical forfeiture sharpens the trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: the impossibility of erasing grief versus the necessity of bearing it. Subtext resides in the hummingbird’s mechanical persistence and the ink’s refusal to stay. Final image of wind carrying the story avoids moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays close to Elara’s selective perception; diction is controlled, with occasional lyric lift (“canvas waiting to be filled”). No head-hop; dialogue is spare and subtextual. Voice could sharpen further under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and propulsive; sensory detail is purposeful. Minor scaffold—“seemed to glow,” “seemed to pulse”—slightly dulls immediacy. No mixed metaphors or register drift; final paragraph cadence lands the tonal shift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Fusion of speculative tech (drone) with mystical ink feels fresh; the eclipse aftermath as liminal space is evocative. Premise avoids template by reframing time travel as memory work. Specificity of albino tracker in desert setting adds distinctive texture.</comment>
