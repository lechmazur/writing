<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Eli’s quiet determination is embodied in the forge scene and the descent, but interior contradiction is muted; the “awakening” trade remains abstract, so the cost feels intellectual rather than visceral. The final smile is earned, yet the missing texture of what he has actually surrendered blunts the emotional sting.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because Eli accepts the bargain, therefore he descends and weaves the silk, therefore the planet heals. Closure lands as Earned Stasis—he returns changed but cannot name the loss—yet the on-page sentence “caught between understanding and confusion” is too coy to let the cost fully register.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Floating rock arches and molten orchard air are vivid, selective, and tethered to Eli’s sensory priorities; the arches shift from menace to life, charging the final image. A touch more tactile detail inside the core chamber would have nudged this into the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—planet’s renewal vs. personal awakening—is signaled early and tightened once: the mine descent forecloses retreat. Cost is implied but not dramatized on the page; the awakening lost remains conceptual, so escalation is clear yet not fully paid.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of resilience-from-rubble emerges organically through Eli’s choices; the final image of softened arches and blossoming orchards offers a resonant, non-moralizing answer. A shade more ambiguity about what “awakening” meant would deepen the aftertaste.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays close to Eli’s perceptual filter; diction is controlled, rhythms tighten under pressure. Dialogue is sparse but natural, carrying subtext in the stranger’s “I’ve come to barter.” No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, vivid, and propulsive; no loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated phrasing (“azure defiance”) risks register drift but stays within the lyrical allowance. Final paragraph could trim one sentence to sharpen cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Orchard planet + floating rock arches + magician’s silk is a fresh synthesis; the silk-as-life-vessel twist feels inevitable in hindsight. The premise avoids template echoes, and the quiet ending resists spectacle for earned resonance.</comment>
