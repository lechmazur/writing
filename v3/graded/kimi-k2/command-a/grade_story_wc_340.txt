<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s curiosity is consistent, but her interiority is mostly declarative (“her heart quickening,” “tears welled”). The mentor’s goggles and diary serve as emotional triggers, yet the final insight arrives as an unearned epiphany rather than a choice that costs her something tangible. No contradictory impulses are dramatized; the arc is smooth affirmation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly with the diary’s decrypted line reweighting the quest, but the ascent is an and-then sequence of set pieces rather than because/therefore causality. Each floor yields a clue without raising stakes or foreclosing options. The final beat satisfies the lens (Accumulative/Textural) yet lacks a visible price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The spire’s cold, light, and verticality are vividly filtered through Elara’s goggles and diary, constraining movement and attention. “Scattered light” recurs with shifting emotional valence, charging the observatory climax. Spatial choreography is tight; no white-room drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—uncover the diary’s meaning—remains abstract; no floor presents a dilemma that narrows her path or exacts a cost. Pressure is atmospheric, not agonistic. One tightening beat (key fits lock) is too late to escalate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of “joy beneath anguish” emerges through the mentor’s final line and the aurora’s light, avoiding explicit sermon. The diary’s decryption reconfigures the quest’s meaning, but the absence of a felt cost blunts resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Third-limited prose is steady, tactile, and filtered through Elara’s sensory priorities (“goggles glinted,” “fingers tracing”). No register drift or head-hopping. Compression in the elevator transitions is purposeful and legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences are lean, rhythmic, and information-dense; no loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated diction (“otherworldly glow”) is brief and voice-consistent. Figurative language is spare and purposeful.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>The icebound-spire scavenger hunt is familiar, but the integration of diary, goggles, and scattered light feels specific to Elara’s grief. No radical risk, yet the synthesis avoids cliché through restrained lyricism.</comment>
