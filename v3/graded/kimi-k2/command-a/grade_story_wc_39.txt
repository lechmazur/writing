<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is vivid—his coat “patched with stories,” the remembered laughter in a buried jar—but the moment of “becoming a translator” is asserted more than dramatized; the final smile is earned yet the cost feels generalized rather than embodied in a specific forfeiture.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the music box’s autonomous song reweights Elias’s purpose and the loft’s atmosphere; the broken jar’s faint retained music supplies visible cost. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density and cadence shift rather than causal chain—and holds cleanly to the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The loft’s cracked beams and wind-whispered dunes anchor place early; the music box itself functions as micro-setting that constrains choice when it jams and later releases its flood of sound. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elias’s priorities.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—redeeming lost voices—signaled in paragraph two; pressure tightens when the box refuses to play, then deepens when it suddenly overflows, forcing Elias to drop the jar. Cost is visible (shattered glass, lost capture) but could be sharper.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of memory-as-redemption emerges through concrete handling of sound and silence; the final image of the shard pressed to ear reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext resides in gesture—the dropped jar, the closed eyes—not exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet controlled; perceptual signature is consistent (“lonesome splendor,” “sweeten and preserve like honey”). Patterned elision (no direct exposition of how jars work) is taught early and paid off at closure. No POV drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and musical—“shimmering like captured light”—but avoids purple overload; rhythm modulates with tension. One minor loop: “ready to listen, ready to translate, ready to sweeten” could trim, yet it occurs post-closure and does not dull the final image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Sound-capture in glass jars is fresh, and the fusion of penny-poet archetype with memory-archivist role feels specific. The music box’s shift from artifact to autonomous agent is an earned reconfiguration rather than gimmick.</comment>
