<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s insomnia and “methodically hopeful” trait are embodied in her nightly climbs and steady brushwork, but the shift from self-soothing to communal mission is asserted more than dramatized; the final calm feels slightly unearned because the cost of her new purpose is only implied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each stroke thickens pattern until the greenhouse air itself reconfigures. Closure is a Charged Poise—the canvas glowing as bridge—with the cost legible in her irrevocable insomnia now yoked to an endless task.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The rooftop greenhouse, smog, and moonlight are filtered through Elara’s sleepless perception; the shifting scent of jasmine and the brush’s warming handle constrain her choices and charge the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—rousing a lost kindness—tightens once when the daydream forces her to paint for the vanished city; the price is her surrender of solitary refuge to an open-ended guardianship, visible in the dawn smog’s return.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of buried kindness emerges through the accumulating glyphs and the moonlit city’s communal gestures; the final “saffron quiet” offers a resonant, non-moralizing answer to the question of whether strangers remember.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Voice is painterly, tactile, and insomnia-sharpened; perceptual signature shows in “smog-choked city” vs “crisp jasmine air.” No head-hopping; free-indirect texture stays consistent under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; occasional lyrical layering (“moon-tipped bristles glowing brighter”) risks overwriting but is reined in by rhythmic variation and concrete sensory anchors. No loops or scaffold in the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Familiar “magical brush” trope is refreshed by insomnia as conduit and the lost language as communal memory; synthesis feels inevitable, though the premise itself is not radically new.</comment>
