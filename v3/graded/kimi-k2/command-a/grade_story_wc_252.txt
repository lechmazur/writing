<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—calloused hands vs dancer’s grace, the guarded heart—but the “true nature” remains abstract; the detachment beat is gestured rather than dramatized with embodied cost, so the final choice feels slightly under-earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the island fades and Elara rows away changed. Causal chain (scrimshaw summons island → detachment dissolves barrier) is legible, but the whale’s mechanics are soft; cost is felt yet diffuse.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Sublittoral fringe is evoked with salt-silt boots and emerald shafts of light; the disappearing island itself constrains the climax by vanishing, charging the final image. Sensory selection is tight and POV-filtered.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—embrace true self—tightens once when Elara must let the scrimshaw go. Pressure is coherent under Accumulative/Textural lens; the whale’s call intensifies mood rather than narrows options, so escalation is more cadence than crisis.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of freedom-through-vulnerability emerges organically from the island’s dissolution and the relinquished key. Final image of “combative tenderness” offers non-literal resonance without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet grounded in dock-work diction; perceptual signature is consistent (“ocean’s breath whispered secrets”). No dialogue, so compression and rhythm carry the piece cleanly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is fluid, with rhythmic variation and high information density; occasional elevated phrasing (“ancient and unknowable”) edges toward overwriting but never stalls momentum or muddies closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>The pirate-scrimshaw-as-key and summoned disappearing island feel fresh; the whale’s song guiding to a vanishing heart-island synthesizes mythic and maritime registers in a way that resists template plotting.</comment>
