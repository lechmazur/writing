<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“quiet pride,” “spiritually curious”), but her contradictory impulses remain under-dramatized; the shift from janitor to cosmic steward is asserted rather than tested under pressure. The final renunciation is credible yet the cost feels generalized rather than specific to her lived flaws.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the lantern’s dimming transfers its “strength” to Lira, reweighting her stance toward stillness. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of stars, lantern pulses, cleaning beats—but the causal linkage between lantern and constellation could be sharper.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The station’s “skeletal frame etched against the infinite void” and the lantern’s warmth against cold vacuum create tactile specificity that constrains Lira’s choices. Micro-setting (lantern as portable sun) charges the final image, though spatial choreography on the observation deck is lightly sketched.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding meaning in maintenance—tightens when the lantern activates the trackers, forcing Lira to choose between routine and cosmic calling. The cost is conceptual (acceptance of stillness) rather than visceral, but the deepening is legible under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of “flourishing stillness” emerges organically from star-death imagery and Lira’s cleaning ritual; no moralizing statement intrudes. The final image of the dimmed lantern reweights prior motifs without abstraction, though the paradox could carry more friction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet disciplined, with rhythmic control (“hush of an overlooked era”) that modulates under pressure. Perceptual signature is consistent—cosmic scale filtered through janitorial attention to dust and stains—without register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, vivid, and propulsive; occasional elevated phrasing (“primal elegance,” “eternal canvas”) flirts with overwriting but stays within character-bound lexicon. No loops or scaffold detected; final paragraph maintains cadence without artifact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Transforms the familiar “lowly worker touched by cosmic wonder” trope through the janitor’s tactile ritual and the lantern’s quiet transfer of power. Specificity of star-tracking station and “flourishing stillness” concept lend freshness, though premise itself is recognizable.</comment>
