<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara’s “odd historian” trait is asserted rather than dramatized; interiority drifts into exposition (“she had always believed…”) instead of embodied contradiction. No micro-choice under pressure shows her oddness costing her anything; the ritual succeeds because she is sensitively perceptive, not despite a flaw. The ending smile feels unearned because prior beats lack internal conflict.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing (world dreams again), but the cost is asserted, not dramatized—no visible price is paid by Elara. Causal chain is thin: tapestry → scrolls → ritual succeeds without setback or constraint. Orientation is clear; single-scene default met. Lens holds (Causal) but escalation is gentle.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>“Reclaimed silo library” is vivid and tactile—metal walls, bronze quiet—and the altar at the center constrains the final ritual. Spatial choreography is clean; objects (tapestry, scrolls) are handled on the page. Micro-setting (altar) charges the closure image. Some atmospheric phrases (“thick with the bronze quiet”) verge on overwriting but stay legible.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—restore the world’s dreams—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once: discovery of scrolls → ritual. However, the tightening is informational, not experiential; no live option is foreclosed, no visible cost exacted. Agency is present but frictionless.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.0</question>
<comment>Theme of imagination’s fracture emerges through the tapestry and ritual rather than statement. Subtext is modest but coherent: dragons as lost guardians of dreams. Final image of golden light reweights earlier bronze quiet without moralizing. Complexity is present but not deeply probed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited voice is consistent; diction is elevated but stays within Elara’s scholarly lexicon. Sensory signature (“bronze quiet,” “weathered metal”) is distinctive. No dialogue, so no register clash. Rhythm is controlled; occasional lyrical compression is purposeful.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, with vivid nouns and verbs. A few stacked modifiers (“thick with the bronze quiet of forgotten eras”) flirt with purple but do not obscure. No loops or scaffold. Information density is high; sentences advance plot or atmosphere. Final paragraph avoids artifact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Post-apocalyptic library + tapestry-as-key is a fresh synthesis; dragons as dream-guardians offers a non-obvious angle. Specificity of reclaimed silo and half-burned diaries grounds the concept. Risk is moderate; execution competent but not bold enough for 8.5+.</comment>
