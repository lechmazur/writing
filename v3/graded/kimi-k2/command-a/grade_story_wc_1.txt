<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is specific—her glass-maker’s patience, her need “to discover purpose in the pauses”—but the apprentice’s absence is only asserted, not felt. The ledger strip is handled twice (discovery, final reveal) yet never alters her tactics in-scene; she simply follows its trail. The “steadily adaptive” trait is stated rather than embodied in a visible trade-off. Closure cost is present (apprentice captive, workshop lost) but arrives off-stage, muting the felt price.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens is causal: because she finds the strip, therefore she retraces the route, therefore she learns the truth. Orientation is clear by line 4. Closure lands with a decisive change—she now knows where the apprentice is held and commits to action—though the cost is more asserted than dramatized. One clean transition (campfire → canyon trek) fits the 600-800-word scope.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The canyon’s frost patterns literally guide her steps, turning environment into method; the bioluminescent grotto recharges the “luminous glass” motif at closure. Sensory selection is filtered through a glass-maker’s eye—light, fracture, reflection. Spatial choreography is coherent; no impossible moves. The kiln’s scorched surface becomes a charged object that constrains her next choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</question><comment>Dominant stake: rescue the apprentice and expose the guild. Pressure tightens once when the ledger reveals the captive’s location. Agency is present—she chooses to follow the frost—but the final beat summarizes rather than dramatizes the tightening. Cost is implied (ruined workshop, lost apprentice) yet not viscerally staged on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</question><comment>Theme of finding meaning in fragments emerges organically through the shattered glass and torn ledger. Subtext operates in silence: the canyon’s “drifting resonance” mirrors her unresolved grief. The final image—stars reflected in her glass—offers a quiet conceptual repricing: beauty persists even in ruin. No overt moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</question><comment>Third-person limited stays close to Elara’s perceptual signature: “her hands steady despite the chaos,” “her mind piecing together fragments.” Syntax is controlled, rhythmic, and glass-maker precise. No dialogue, so no voice slippage. Compression is purposeful; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</question><comment>Prose is clean, vivid, and propulsive. “Shadows danced and silence hummed” risks cliché but is immediately grounded by tactile detail. No loops or scaffold. Metaphors stay coherent—“frost…a natural tapestry that seemed to mirror the markings.” Occasional elevated diction (“luminous,” “bioluminescent”) fits the elevated craft context.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</question><comment>The luminous-glass premise is fresh, and using frost patterns as forensic map is inventive. The guild conspiracy is familiar but rendered through specific material culture—rare sands, exotic dyes. Risk is moderate; no structural gimmicks. The synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
