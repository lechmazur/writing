<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elena’s interiority is specific—polymer-chemist lens on river foam—but grief is rendered in generalized therapy-speak (“quiet ache,” “adrift”). The final shift from isolation to integration is credible yet compressed; we feel the cost more in concept than in embodied action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Single-scene, single-POV default met; closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost—“ready to walk” implies forfeiture of safe isolation. Causal chain is thin: river insight triggers change rather than forcing it, but lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Ravine’s braided waterways mirror Elena’s mental braiding; foam patterns physically constrain her insight moment. Sensory detail is selective, POV-filtered, and returns in the final image, charging closure without ornamental excess.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transform grief into connection—signaled early. One meaningful tightening: realization that separation can bridge, not bar. Cost is conceptual rather than tangible; pressure escalates via interior deepening rather than external stakes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of transformation via integration emerges through polymer metaphor and chrysalis reprise; no explicit moralizing. Final image reweights prior motifs (foam, chrysalis) into quiet resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays close to Elena’s perceptual filters; diction skews lyrical yet rooted in her scientific lexicon. No dialogue, so voice coherence rests on interior rhythm, which modulates with emotional rise.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is fluid, with rhythmic variation and high information density. Occasional elevated phrasing (“symphonically attuned”) edges toward register drift but remains within Elena’s frame. No loops or mixed metaphors.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Fusion of polymer science with grief recovery feels fresh; chrysalis and foam motifs avoid cliché through specificity. Premise is familiar (healing in nature) but executed with idiosyncratic lens.</comment>
