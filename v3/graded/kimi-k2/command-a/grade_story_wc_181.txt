<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“faint hum that resonated in her chest”), but her contradictory impulses remain under-dramatized; the final acceptance of heirship feels more conferred than earned, softening the cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara’s stance crystallizes with the cameo warming her palm—but the causal chain from finding the object to accepting legacy is compressed; the woman’s exposition resolves tension rather than tightening it.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The astral orchard is rendered with selective, luminous detail (“iridescent petals that shimmered like captured starlight”) and the crystalline bathroom mirrors reconfigure thought; however, the setting never physically constrains choice, capping the score just below 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake—uncovering nonlinear inheritance—is signaled early and escalates via the keeper’s appearance, yet the tightening is delivered through dialogue rather than a visible trade-off; cost is implied, not dramatized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of nonlinear inheritance emerges organically from object and orchard imagery; the final image of Elara holding the cameo reweights prior material without moralizing, though the keeper’s speech edges toward thematic echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical, consistent, and perceptually specific (“simply complicated, like the orchard itself”); minor register drift into abstract diction (“nonlinear inheritance, she murmured”) slightly dilutes immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean and rhythmic, with purposeful compression; occasional stacked modifiers (“beautiful, inexplicable, and unsettling”) and a paraphrase loop (“mysteries that others dismissed… mysteries than she could imagine”) keep it from 8.5.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The pistachio-shell cameo as data-storage relic and the orchard-asteroid premise synthesize familiar tropes into a fresh, specific vision; risk-taking is present but not radical.</comment>
