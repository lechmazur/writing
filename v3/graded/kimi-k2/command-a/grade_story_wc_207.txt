<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s curiosity and inherited quest are clear, but interiority stays at summary level (“she understood now”) rather than dramatized contradiction; the final renunciation of the compass is credible yet the psychic cost is asserted more than felt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: compass lost, mystery embraced, with visible forfeiture. Causal chain holds—compass leads, psychometry confirms, compass surrendered—though the hinge between worlds is declared rather than tested in action.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Factory grit, tunnel damp, and glowing lagoon are vividly selective; the lagoon’s light reweights the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial tracking is clean, but the leap from basement door to vast cavern could use one more sensory anchor.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“find where explanations fail”—is signaled early and tightened when Elara chooses to let the compass sink. Pressure is coherent under the Accumulative/Textural lens; cost is legible yet could be sharper on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of embracing the unknowable emerges through concrete action (abandoning the compass) rather than statement. Final image of rain recharges the petrichor motif with quiet resonance, avoiding moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice is atmospheric and consistent, with sensory diction that feels character-bound. Occasional elevated phrasing (“resonant hush,” “embrace of the unknown”) edges toward poetic abstraction but stays within tolerable lyric compression.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose is fluid and propulsive; minor scaffold (“the air smelled of rust and rain” echoed later) and one mixed metaphor (“needle spinning wildly as if caught in a magnetic storm”) slightly dull the peak beat, keeping it below 8.5.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Petrichor collector + psychometric quest + subterranean gateway feels fresh; the compass-as-key motif is familiar but transformed through inherited loss and deliberate surrender. Specificity of scent-memory links stakes to sensory world.</comment>
