<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara’s motive is declared early and her interiority stays consistent, but the text tells us she “rejected nostalgia” and “realized her work was done” rather than dramatizing those pivots with embodied contradiction or micro-choice. The bottle glows, the town revives, yet she never faces an active trade-off or visible cost; her agency is largely contemplative. Earned Stasis is asserted, not performed on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the cove lives, Elara walks away, lanterns persist—cost is conceptual (she can’t stay) and felt. Causal linkage is thin: the bottle responds to thought, but the leap from memory to material revival is ellipsis, not dramatized beat. Under Accumulative/Textural lens the pattern holds; the final image reweights the premise. Orientation is clear by word 60; no penalty applied.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered—warm bottle, crunching boots, lantern light on water—each image serves the beat. The cove’s ghostliness is evoked through empty windows and whispering sea, then transformed in mirrored sensory language. Environment does not constrain tactics, but the amber bottle functions as micro-setting that charges the final image, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—revive the town—signals early. Pressure escalates via accumulative pattern: each lantern appearance tightens the miracle. Yet Elara faces no external opposition, resource limit, or internal sacrifice; the cost is purely conceptual (she must leave). One meaningful deepening occurs, but the tightening is observational, not a forced trade-off, keeping the score sub-8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme—creation over nostalgia—emerges through image progression: sealed bottle → open sky, crumbling stone → new light. No character states the thesis outright; the final glow of lanterns acts as non-literal answer. Ambiguity is present but not complex; counter-readings are limited. Resonance is solid yet not indelible.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Third-limited stays tight to Elara; perceptual signature is consistent—alchemical vocabulary, tactile attention to temperature and texture. Rhythm modulates with scene: longer reflective sentences collapse into short declaratives as lanterns multiply. No dialogue, so voice carries all weight. A few near-clichés (“heart pounding,” “whispered secrets”) slightly blunt distinctiveness.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and propulsive; sentences carry double duty (action + atmosphere). No loops, scaffold, or register drift. Occasional soft modifiers (“almost alive,” “somehow familiar”) are minor artifacts but do not touch closure. Metaphors stay coherent; opening and closing images form a crisp bracket.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>The “memory-powered revival” premise freshens the familiar “save the ghost town” arc, but the execution leans on generic fantasy beats (glowing artifact, lanterns as life). Specificity resides in alchemical lens and sensory detail rather than conceptual twist. Risk is moderate; transformation is present but not startling. Hindsight does not reveal an inevitable yet surprising reconfiguration.</comment>
