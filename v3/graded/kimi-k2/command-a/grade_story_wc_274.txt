<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interior conflict is embodied in trembling fingers and racing heart, but the “bravely conflicted” label is repeated rather than dramatized; the final choice to copy the data is credible yet the cost feels generalized rather than specific to her flaw.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: letter → descent → breach → copy → exit. Closure lands as Earned Stasis with felt cost: “her world would never be the same.” One minor causality wobble: the “blink that follows surprise” is declared but not timed on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The echoing, snow-muffled library is vivid and selective; its cold and silence pressure every beat. The terminal and frosted archives constrain access, but the final image could have leaned on a charged object or micro-setting to reach 9-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—suppress vs expose contraband truths—tightens once when the network activation countdown begins. Cost is legible: exposure is irreversible. A sharper on-page forfeiture (e.g., deletion of her own clearance) would push higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of truth vs order emerges organically from Elara’s choice; the final image of snow continuing to fall offers quiet resonance. One line edges toward thematic echo: “the fragility of truth and the cost of bravery.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited voice is consistent, with perceptual signature in “cryogenic archives,” “frosted glass,” and “ghost in the machine.” Rhythm modulates with urgency; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, vivid, and propulsive; occasional scaffold (“the library’s silence pressed,” “the dizzying quiet”) repeats without fresh pressure. No mixed metaphors or loops in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Familiar “archivist uncovers buried truth” frame is refreshed by cryogenic library and snow-muffled atmosphere. Specificity of dormant networks and erased histories feels non-generic; risk is present but not radical.</comment>
