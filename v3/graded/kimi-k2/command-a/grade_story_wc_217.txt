<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical but generic; “searching for inspiration” and “weave words into dawns” are stock phrases. The poet’s contradictory impulses (to finish vs. accept incompleteness) surface only in dialogue, not embodied choice. The final shared release earns a modest shift, but cost is soft—no forfeiture beyond handing over the feather.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Single-scene causal arc: kite falls → repair → release. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (shared rekindled belief) with gentle felt cost—loss of talisman. Orientation is clear by line 40; no lens ambiguity. Minor causality gap: why the kite’s words glow is unexplained, but doesn’t break closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Cobalt lagoon, wet earth, salt air are vivid and selective; the drake feather and kite fabric act as micro-settings that constrain choices (repair, gift). Final image of kite ascending against lagoon recharges setting with thematic weight. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible moves.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</question>
<comment>Dominant stake—recovering the capacity to see beauty in the incomplete—is signaled early and tightened when the kite’s cut string literalizes “unfinished.” Agency is collaborative repair and release; cost is the poet’s relinquishing of her talisman, but the price feels light. One meaningful turn, no reversals.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</question>
<comment>Theme of beauty in incompleteness emerges organically through kite repair and shared release. Subtext in the wanderer’s “unfinished” line and the glowing poem avoids overt statement. Final image reweights premise without moralizing. Minor drift toward platitude in “beauty isn’t found in perfection” line.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</question>
<comment>Lyrical third-person limited stays close to poet’s sensorium; perceptual signature is consistent (“burnished hush,” “shimmered like a mirror”). No head-hopping. Dialogue is spare but natural, carrying subtext. Rhythm modulates with emotional beats; no register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</question>
<comment>Prose is fluid, with rhythmic variation and strong sensory nouns. Occasional soft phrases (“weave words into dawns,” “magic that lurked”) edge toward cliché but don’t stall momentum. No loops or scaffold. Metaphors are coherent; no mixed vehicles. Clean grammar and punctuation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</question>
<comment>Familiar trope of strangers healing each other via symbolic object is refreshed by the kite-poem device and lagoon setting. Specific details—drake feather, shifting kite script—feel particular. Risk is modest; synthesis is competent rather than revelatory. No close echoes of famous scenes.</comment>
