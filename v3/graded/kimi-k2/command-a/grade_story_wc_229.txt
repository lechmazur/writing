<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is textured—his doubts about silence versus shouts are embodied in the humming cork and the ache in his chest. The final choice to follow the woman and accept the lesson is earned by prior beats: the cork’s hum, the garden scent, the beckoning silhouette. Cost is visible in the renunciation of louder self-assertion. Secondary character pressure is minimal; the woman functions more as oracle than crucible, capping the score below 8.8.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias’s stance crystallizes when he raises his hand to the beckoning figure, accepting that quiet intent outreaches noise. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of scent, vibration, and dawn light tightens until the final image reweights the premise. Orientation is clear by line 3; no causality breaks. Cost is felt in the ache of “screaming tenderness” and the relinquishing of louder self-proof.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The cobalt lighthouse, dawn cool, and garden scent are vivid and selective, filtering through Elias’s perceptual bias. The cork and lantern room act as micro-settings that constrain his attention and final choice. Setting does not merely backdrop but guides movement—scent leads him down the stairs and along the shore. Missing a deeper occupational constraint keeps it below 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—proving quiet intent can move more than noise—is signaled early and tightened when Elias inhales the cork’s scent and chooses to follow the woman. One meaningful deepening occurs as the garden scent intensifies and the figure beckons, narrowing his options to act or retreat. Cost is legible in the chest-ache and the renunciation of louder self-assertion. Agency is present but lightly pressured; the woman’s appearance edges toward coincidence, not resolution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: the power of purified, quiet intention versus performative noise. Subtext resides in gesture—the raised hand, the vanishing woman—rather than statement. Final image reweights the premise without moralizing. One near-theme echo (“whispers travel farther than shouts”) is spoken by the woman, but it is brief and framed as instruction, not sermon, limiting deduction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays close to Elias’s sensory filter; diction is lyrical yet disciplined, matching his quiet temperament. Rhythm modulates with emotional rise—longer sentences during reflection, clipped fragments as he descends. No POV leakage or register drift. Dialogue is minimal but carries subtext when the woman murmurs the thematic line.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, vivid, and propulsive; figurative language is selective (“screaming tenderness,” “invisible thread”). No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Occasional elevated phrasing (“resonate with his heartbeat”) skirts purple but remains within POV lexicon. One minor filter-verb cluster (“he felt”) in the lantern room is negligible.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of lighthouse duty, humming cork, and garden scent at dawn feels fresh and specific. The “vibrations of intent” concept is grounded in tactile experience rather than abstraction. While the mysterious mentor trope is familiar, the quiet beckoning and scent-guided walk transform it. Risk is moderate; no structural gimmicks, but the lyric compression is purposeful.</comment>
