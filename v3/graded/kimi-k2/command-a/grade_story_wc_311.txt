<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s grief is embodied in the dulled scythe and her tracing of the atlas; the contradictory pull between duty and love is dramatized when she chooses to name the monsters instead of reaping. The interior contradiction is present, but the final renunciation—“she would carry these names”—leans summary rather than fully dramatized cost, keeping it just below the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the naming ritual crystallizes the monsters and re-weights Elara’s purpose. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each echo of sacrifice layers density until the final image reconfigures her stance. Cost is legible in the fading crystalline forms and her acceptance of perpetual heartbreak.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The observatory’s rune-lit platform and creaking dome are tactile constraints that enable the ritual; the dusk light and stone walls mirror Elara’s emotional dusk. The setting actively shapes the climax by supplying the mechanism for crystallization, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether Elara can transmute grief into meaning—tightens when the runes flare and the monsters rise. Agency is clear: her act of naming forecloses passive mourning. A visible price is implied as the monsters dissolve, but the cost could be sharper on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The theme of sacrifice as lingering light emerges organically from the named monsters and the observatory’s echoing voices. The final image of etched constellations offers a non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext in the hush of “distant intimacy” deepens the resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise—“shadows of centuries,” “shards of night”—and stays within Elara’s perceptual range. Compression and patterned elision (“once-fierce purpose had crumbled”) are taught early and paid off in the crystalline cadence of the ending. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; figurative language is selective. Minor scaffold appears in “echoes of forgotten phrases” repeated twice, but it does not obscure causality or dull the closure image. No mixed metaphors or filter-verb stacks under pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The fusion of reaper myth with cartographic sea-monster lore feels fresh; the atlas page as grief-engine is a non-obvious synthesis. Risk in the lyric, accumulative structure heightens meaning without gimmickry. Transformation test passes—this story could not swap names or settings without collapse.</comment>
