<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is stated early and consistent, yet her interiority remains largely declarative (“she knew,” “she felt”) rather than embodied contradiction. No micro-choice under pressure complicates her stance; the climax is received passively via song fragments. The vine’s transformation is external spectacle, not earned through her flawed agency.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—golden orbs crystallize the restored stories—but the cost is asserted rather than dramatized. Causal lens holds: harvest moon alignment triggers song return. However, the decisive change is narrated summary, not on-page action with felt forfeiture.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Verdant arbor is anchored early and returns in the final glow, but its spatial constraints never limit Elara’s choices. Micro-setting (vine tendril, workbench clutter) is vivid and purposeful; moonlight threads charge the closing image, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore forgotten songs to heal land—is clear, yet pressure plateaus after initial setup. No tightening beat narrows options; the songs simply arrive when moon and tendril align. Agency is observational; escalation is atmospheric, not tactical.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Theme of renewal through ancient harmony emerges organically via imagery rather than statement. Subtext is modest: vine’s glow and song threads carry the thematic weight without overt moralizing. Final image reweights prior motifs effectively, though ambiguity is gentle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays close to Elara’s sensory filter; diction is lyrical yet controlled. No head-hopping or register drift. Distinct perceptual signature—“soft glow of the harvest moon still lingering,” “dew on the grass sparkled like stars”—anchors voice without purple excess.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is fluid and rhythmic; occasional soft fillers (“seemed to,” “as if”) slightly dilute immediacy. No loops or scaffold; figurative language stays coherent. High information density in workshop description; final paragraph avoids explanatory drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Familiar eco-fantasy tropes (moon magic, singing to nature) are refreshed through tactile tinkerer details and luminous vine mechanics. Premise is recognizable but executed with specificity; no risky structural innovation, yet transformation feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
