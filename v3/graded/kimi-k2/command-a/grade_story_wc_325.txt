<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elena’s claustrophobia surfaces in visceral beats ("walls seemed to close in"); the vow to Dr. Voss keeps every move tethered. One flaw undermines full marks: her interiority drifts toward abstract paraphrase ("some things were meant to remain invisible, and that was okay") rather than embodied cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure delivers a resonant reconfiguration—the shimmering realm dissolves back into a charged poise: Elena now accepts the hidden ("that was okay") with codex in hand and mentor glimpsed, the price being the inability to reclaim Dr. Voss. Causal linkage holds from beat to beat; only a smidgen of late summary tempers perfection.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The drowned corridors ("murky darkness", "crashing hush") actively squeeze each breath and every step; the rising tide itself becomes an ally near the end. No environmental element is wasted; each constrains tactics. Near-miss at 9+ due to the single stock phrase "murky darkness".</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—retrieve the fleck to glimpse the unseen—gains relentless pressure as water cycles, walls crumble, and claustrophobia spikes. A mid-story tightening (vault door groans open) shrinks options to “face the invisible or retreat”. Felt cost arrives as she relinquishes the hope of bringing Dr. Voss back.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme—respect the invisible, relinquish control—emerges wordlessly from Elena’s encounter with the pulsing cable-luminosity. The refrain “crashing hush” reweighted at close turns from suffocating terror into oceanic acceptance. One late nudge of overt articulation ("some we’re not meant to control") tugs it back from 9+.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The POV remains pinned to Elena’s trembling sensorium: “air hung heavy…her breath ragged”. Syntax tightens under pressure, but occasional abstract filler (“things that moved unseen beneath the waves”) wavers from her actual lexicon, keeping it short of 9.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is largely taut and tactile—“metal groaned”, “fleck seemed to pulse”—yet a paraphrase-loop around “invisible things” recurs twice, dulling impact. The closing sentence reclaims vigor, so the defect slides rather than snaps.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Submerged claustrophobic quest plus living undersea cables braided as ancient veins is fresh and specific. Not a derivative frame: Elena’s debt animates every step, rendering the trope deeply hers. Minor late echo of “crashing hush” keeps it a hairline beneath 9.</comment>
