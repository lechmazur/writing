<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“her fingers tracing the ridges,” “her breath catching”), but the apology is delivered as a current rather than a concrete micro-choice, softening the cost. The perfume bottle and orchard memories press her, yet the final beat feels more received than earned. Still, her contradictory impulses—guilt, longing, professional detachment—are palpable in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the archive glows, the bottle lightens, the orchard sighs—an earned shift in emotional weight. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (scent, hum, glowing scores) deepens the pattern until the final image reweights memory. Cost is felt in the irrevocable loss of the orchard, acknowledged but not reversed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The archive’s “aged paper and forgotten melodies” and the orchard’s “silence of impending loss” are selective, atmospheric, and filtered through Elara’s grief. The perfume bottle functions as micro-setting, constraining her method and charging the final image. Spatial anchors are clear; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—deliver the overdue apology before the orchard falls—is signaled early. Pressure tightens as the bottle’s currents grow personal, forcing the energetic apology. The cost is the orchard’s inevitable destruction; her action cannot save it, only honor it. One meaningful deepening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>“Miracles aren’t perfect… cracks in the glass” emerges organically from the bottle’s flaw and the orchard’s fate. Theme refrains from moralizing; instead, the final image of roots remaining after trees fall offers quiet, non-literal resonance. Subtext lives in scent, hum, and light rather than statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet grounded, with rhythmic control (“hush before the cutting down,” “ghostly flower”). Perceptual signature is consistent—Elara notices through scent, vibration, memory. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens under pressure. Compression is purposeful and legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and musical, but occasional stacked metaphors (“ghostly flower,” “shawl of warmth”) flirt with overwriting. No loops or scaffold; momentum holds. Final paragraph’s cadence shift is earned. Minor register drift toward the poetic is voice-motivated and consistent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The “gossip-column exorcist” trope is transformed into a memory-worker who channels regret through scent and current. Synthesis of perfume-as-archive and orchard-as-time feels fresh. Risk lies in the lyric mode, but coherence never wavers. Specificity anchors universals.</comment>
