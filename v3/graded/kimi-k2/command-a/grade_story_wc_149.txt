<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is evocative (“lovingly venomous connection”) and embodied, but the ghost bride’s contradictory impulses remain abstract; no micro-choice under pressure is dramatized until the final beat, so the renunciation feels more declared than earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the bead’s glow reconfigures her stance toward collective debt with felt cost. Causal chain is thin—why the bead awakens now is unexplained—but the Accumulative/Textural lens holds via cadence shift and image echo.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The greenhouse’s “petrified blossoms” and “twisted branches” are vivid and selective; the bead-as-micro-setting constrains her final choice. Spatial anchors arrive early; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—repay lifetime debt—is clear; pressure tightens when collective spirits intrude, forcing a stance shift. Cost is implied rather than viscerally shown, keeping it from the top band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of collective versus personal debt emerges through image pattern (bead, roots, chorus) without moralizing. Final image reweights earlier sorrow into tentative hope; ambiguity is coherent.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Voice is lush yet controlled; perceptual signature filters every detail through spectral attenuation. No dialogue, so no voice leakage; lyric compression is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is musical and dense; occasional stacked metaphors (“mournful elation,” “lovingly venomous”) flirt with overwriting but stay purposeful. No loops or scaffold in final third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Ghost-bride-in-greenhouse is familiar, yet the alchemical orchard and collective-debt angle give fresh inflection. Risk lies in lyric excess, but specificity of images rescues it.</comment>
