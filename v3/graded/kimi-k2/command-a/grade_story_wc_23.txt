<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is vivid—her hands “raw from hours of labor” and her heart “swelling” anchor emotion in body—but the shift from solitary exile to communal shepherd is asserted more than dramatized; the decisive moment of letting the first traveler in is summarized, not shown, blunting the cost of her choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The causal chain (calls → build → beacon → arrivals) is legible and lands a Resonant Reconfiguration: the station becomes refuge, Mara’s isolation ends. Closure is on-page and carries felt cost—the censer foot dims, reminding her the cycle is endless—yet the first traveler’s appearance feels slightly convenient rather than earned by prior mechanics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The windswept cliff station is sketched with selective sensory strokes—“weathered walls bearing the scars of countless storms”—and the censer foot’s moonlit glow integrates setting with tool, constraining Mara’s nightly labor. Spatial choreography stays coherent; the beacon’s hum and the cliff’s exposure jointly pressure her choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—restoring connection amid reverse migration—is signaled early and tightens as the beacon’s tone synchronizes with the relic. One clear escalation: the first arrival proves the signal works, foreclosing Mara’s solitude. Cost is implied (dimming glow) but not yet viscerally felt on page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of pilgrimage-through-loss emerges organically from Mara’s scavenging labor and the censer foot’s lunar pulse; the final image of her gazing at stars while clutching the relic reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext in the cryptic “Build” calls invites reader speculation without over-explanation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays close to Mara’s sensorium; diction (“patchwork navigator,” “raw solace”) is character-specific and rhythmic. No dialogue to test, yet the narrative voice modulates from weary isolation to cautious hope, matching the tonal arc.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and propulsive; sentences vary in length to mirror urgency. Occasional elevated phrasing (“geography of loss”) skirts but avoids purple; no loops or scaffold detected. Final paragraph crystallizes momentum without clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The reverse-migration premise and moon-phased relic feel fresh, synthesizing climate-sci-fi with mythic resonance. The beacon-as-hope device could risk cliché, yet its patchwork construction from ruined station parts grounds it in tactile specificity, transforming trope into lived necessity.</comment>
