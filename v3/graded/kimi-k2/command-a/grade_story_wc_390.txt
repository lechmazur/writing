<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elara’s internal contradiction—logic versus protective instinct—drives every beat; key choice to use the key’s resonance against the intruder is earned by prior setup, and the cost (retreat of hope for global harmony) is visible in the final glow.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Single-scene escalation from vibrational threat → crypt key activation → cloaked intruder’s banishment; causality stays tight, orientation is immediate, and the closure (harmony retained, but world still wounded) lands with a felt conceptual price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Drift-ice marina’s cracking timbers bodily pressure every move; brine-frozen scent tightens urgency, while the latent sunset clock shifts the last light to signal final choice; spatial choreography always coherent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—protect the key and sonic absolution—intensifies as the intruder’s harmonic demand exposes planetary disharmony; Elara’s adaptation narrows options, forcing a costly harmonic counterstrike.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Theme of balance through vibrational reconciliation grows from concrete choices rather than preaching; final azure glow offers quiet repricing of hope versus endless guardianship without tidy moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is precise—Elara notices ocean ice, shifting light, harmonic pulse through body; interior language is bias-driven, never generic; the intruder’s voice bypasses ears to speak soul-deep, distinct from human speech.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is clipped, sensorily dense; rhythm tightens after each crack of ice; metaphors stay grounded (glow “dying embers” granting permission) and never obscure the beat, though “crypt keeper’s key” risks ornamental flourish.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Fleshy-ethereal drift-ice lighthouse milieu blends high-concept artifact with tactile, lived detail; sonic absolution and crypt key turn familiar tropes into near-myth without cliché, though the scene setup itself echoes lighthouse-tale templates.</comment>
