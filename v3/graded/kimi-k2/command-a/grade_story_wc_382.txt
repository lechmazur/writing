<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Clara’s interiority is vivid—hand tightening on the seal, shame at neighbor-avoidance—but Elias remains a cipher; his “profound sadness” is label-speak without embodied cost. The final micro-choice (knocking with sugar) is earned by prior guilt and Elias’s prompt, yet the emotional price feels light for 800 words.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Clara accepts the tutor’s charge, pouch in hand, sealing a new path with felt social risk. Causal chain holds—meteor shower → Elias appears → seal revealed → sugar task—though Elias’s vanishing leans on situational coincidence rather than earned logic.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Rooftop garden’s scents, meteor streaks, and creaking floorboards are selective and POV-filtered; the seal’s cool metal functions as micro-setting that constrains Clara’s grip and future choice. Spatial choreography is clean; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—learning the buried language—emerges mid-scene and tightens when Elias links the seal to “truths we’ve buried.” One clear escalation: Clara moves from passive listener to active borrower of sugar, foreclosing isolation. Cost is social exposure, lightly sketched.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</question><comment>Theme of silenced histories emerges organically from the seal and whispering walls; no moralizing. Final image of sugar pouch reweights the premise—everyday neighborliness as archaeological tool—without explicit statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Clara; perceptual signature is consistent—she smells herbs, feels seal weight, notices architectural hum. Elias’s diction is slightly elevated but distinct; no head-hop. Rhythm modulates with meteor shower urgency.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; occasional soft fillers (“as though it were the most obvious answer”) slightly dull propulsion. No mixed metaphors or loops; sensory detail is purposeful.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: sugar-borrowing as linguistic excavation method feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Premise of buildings speaking through neighbor-tea is specific and memorable; avoids urban-fantasy clichés.</comment>
