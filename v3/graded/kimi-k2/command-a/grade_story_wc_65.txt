<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid (“weight of possibility,” “hands trembled”), but the contradiction between fear and hope is stated rather than dramatized in scene. The final choice—rolling the scroll and walking away—earns its cost through prior causality, yet the shift from doubt to resolve feels slightly smoothed rather than struggled.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the obsidian spire’s shadow flips from barrier to gateway, and the lake’s thaw is felt in the golden light. Causal lens holds—each beat flows because/therefore—but the cost is more conceptual than visceral, slightly softening the punch.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Obsidian spire and frozen lake are sharply evoked and return in the final image to reweight meaning. Micro-setting (kingfisher feather, inkwell) constrains the act of writing itself. A few stock wintry phrases (“crisp air,” “promise of something yet unwritten”) keep it from the 9-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—seed innovation or remain frozen—is signaled early and tightened when the quill writes unbidden, foreclosing retreat. The cost is legible (the kingdom’s silence must now be answered), yet the escalation is more lyrical than visceral, limiting upper-band entry.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of renewal-through-imagination emerges organically from the act of writing rather than assertion. Final image of sunlight on thawing lake offers non-literal resonance. One near-preachy line (“spring could bloom”) slightly dilutes subtext.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Voice is textured, with rhythmic control (“cascade of possibility”) and perceptual signature filtered through a cartographer’s spatial mind. No head-hopping; diction stays within plausible lexicon. Occasional elevated phrasing (“seed innovation within constraints”) edges toward register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, vivid, and propulsive; figurative language is selective. Minor scaffold: “the quill moved faster, the words spilling…” repeats the prior beat’s energy without new pressure. No artifacts in the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Premise—“cartographer of dreams” mapping futures—feels fresh, and the kingfisher quill as stylus of destiny is specific. Transformation test passes: swap feather for generic pen and the magic collapses. Still, the arc of “writer inspires frozen people” leans on familiar mythic scaffolding.</comment>
