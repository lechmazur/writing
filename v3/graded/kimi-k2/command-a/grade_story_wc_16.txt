<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—her “carefully reckless” trait is embodied in tactile micro-choices (brushing spines, trembling hands). The three promises give her a clear hierarchy of values, and the final exchange with Kael crystallizes a credible shift. Yet the mentor remains off-stage until the last beat, so relationship-as-crucible pressure is only implicit.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the glowing parchment reweights the broken trust and visibly costs Elara her prior recklessness. Causal chain is intact—promise → inkwell → symphony → rapprochement. Orientation is swift; no disorientation exploited at closure, so no penalty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The archive’s dust, narrow beams, and labyrinthine shelves are selective and POV-filtered. The inkwell evolves from mythic prop to active constraint, glowing under her quill. It doesn’t yet constrain a final tactical choice, so capped below 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restoring trust—is signaled early and tightened by the inkwell’s demand for three promises. Each promise raises the cost of failure; the final glow forecloses retreat. Agency is hers; coincidence never rescues.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme of truth-as-harmony emerges through the symphony image rather than statement. The inkwell’s glow reframes prior silence as dissonance resolved. No moralizing; resonance lingers in Kael’s gentle “you were careful too.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise—“dust motes danced,” “cautious exuberance.” Syntax modulates with tension; no head-hopping. Distinct perceptual signature holds under pressure; dialogue is minimal but natural.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense. Occasional elevated diction (“symphonies of truth”) skirts purple but stays within POV. No loops or scaffold; final image is crisp.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Familiar mentor-student breach refreshed by extinct-language magic and the literalized “symphony of truth.” The inkwell’s mythic tech feels specific to this archive. Risk is moderate but coherent; no gimmicks.</comment>
