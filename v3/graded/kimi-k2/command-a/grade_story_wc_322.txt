<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“a tug at something deep and unspoken”), but her contradictory impulses remain abstract; the shadow-man’s warning is the only external pressure, and her final choice feels more asserted than earned. The cost—“she had changed”—is stated rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the gallery dissolves, the thread tangles, and the world outside feels “sharper,” reconfiguring perception with felt cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern density increases until reality re-weights itself—though the causality between weaving and memory fracture could be sharper.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The optical gallery is rendered with selective, sensory precision (“walls melted into rivers of color”) and functions as active constraint: its illusions both enable and threaten Elara’s weaving. The final dissolution recharges the opening image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“discover the texture of connection”—is signaled early and tightened when the shadow-man warns of unraveling. Escalation is textural: each weave thickens the hallucination until the gallery collapses, forcing a stance crystallization. Cost is legible but generalized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of connection-as-risk emerges organically from the weaving act and the mother’s whisper, culminating in the final image of the tangled thread. No moralizing; resonance lingers in the “unsettling calm.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with rhythmic control (“sinew thread shimmered with a life of its own”). Perceptual signature is consistent; no POV drift. Compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; occasional stacked metaphors (“rivers of color,” “living vines”) risk overwriting yet serve the fever logic. No loops or scaffold; momentum sustained. Final image is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Premise fuses dream-architecture with tactile craft in a fresh synthesis; the “rational enchantment” angle avoids cliché. Risk-taking (reality-weaving as memory surgery) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
