<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is textured and embodied, but the mother-mask backstory is delivered in a single block rather than threaded through micro-choices; the final “mending herself” beat is stated rather than dramatized with a visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each loosened knot increases narrative density until the hush lifts. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—the stillness after the last whisper—felt as earned cost, though the causal jump from “plea” to instant release is slightly abrupt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Prism sanctuary and starlight are vividly filtered through Elara’s ritual focus; the net itself functions as micro-setting that constrains every tug of the needle. The final prism on her exit path recharges the opening image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—grounding the spirits—tightens as knots resist; one clear escalation when the stubborn knot threatens to stall the rite. Cost is present (emotional weight, trembling hands) but less viscerally foregrounded than the atmospheric payoff.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of bearing witness to forgotten lives emerges organically from the ritual action; the closing image of Elara walking into dawn reframes the act of mending without moralizing. Subtext in the “lucid unrest” remains coherent.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</question>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet controlled, with rhythmic variation that breathes with the ritual’s pace. Perceptual signature—salt-taste of sorrow, prismatic light on skin—is consistent and character-specific. No dialogue, so no voice leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is generally lean and propulsive, but occasional soft filler (“seemed to hum,” “felt like a bridge”) and two near-paraphrase loops slightly dull the peak beats. No mixed metaphors or register drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</question>
<comment>Fisherman’s net as archive of lost voices feels fresh; the mask-restorer angle is familiar but transformed through the net ritual. The prism sanctuary’s color logic is specific rather than generic. Risk is moderate but coherent.</comment>
