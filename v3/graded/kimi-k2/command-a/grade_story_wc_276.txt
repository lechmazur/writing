<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Kael’s cool-headedness is shown rather than told, but the interiority stays general (“felt a pull in his chest”) rather than contradictory or embodied. The final renunciation—accepting the goddess’s echo remains—earns a modest cost, yet the stakes feel abstract because the echo’s absence never endangers anything concrete. Motivation is consistent but not intensified under pressure; the goddess’s question merely confirms what he already sought.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the garden is “whole again,” the constellations resume purposeful paths, and the rail spike becomes a “tether.” The lens is Accumulative/Textural—density and pattern shift reweight meaning. However, the causality between Kael’s zigzag walk and the goddess’s appearance is more lyrical than driven, so the tightening feels lightly earned rather than compelled.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The sound wave garden is vividly evoked—“silence had a voice”—and the rail spike’s final glow charges the closure image. Spatial grounding is clear early; micro-setting (the pool, the soil) constrains Kael’s seated vigil. Sensory selection favors the auditory and tactile, but the garden’s rules remain consistent without exposition.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake—restoring the goddess’s echo—is signaled early and tightened once when the constellations freeze. Agency is mostly receptive (listening, walking) until the final acceptance, so the pressure deepens more than it narrows options. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral; the reader feels the echo’s return but not what Kael forfeits.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the tension between wildness and stillness, voiced by the goddess and embodied in the “feral lullaby.” Subtext operates in the silence-as-song conceit, avoiding overt moralizing. The final image of the garden “singing” offers a resonant, non-literal answer to what it means to be “both wild and still.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The prose carries a hushed, lyrical texture—“constellations sleepwalked,” “lullaby sung by something untamed”—that matches the POV’s contemplative stance. Compression is purposeful; no filter-verb clusters or register drift. The goddess’s speech is slightly elevated but remains within the mythic frame.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Sentences vary in rhythm and length, mirroring the garden’s shifting soundscape. Figurative language is selective; no mixed metaphors or loops. Occasional softeners (“seemed,” “as though”) are minimal and voice-consistent. The final paragraph achieves a quiet cadence that recharges earlier motifs without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The fusion of celestial mechanics with auditory ecology feels fresh, and the rail spike’s transformation from mundane object to cosmic tether is an inventive turn. The “feral lullaby” phrase crystallizes the paradoxical tone. While the premise nods to mythic archetypes, the specific synthesis of sound-garden and star-path keeps it from cliché.</comment>
