<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara’s desire to “read the stories in scars” is stated but never tested in scene; her interiority is lyrical but generic, and the final healing feels gifted rather than earned through a visible micro-choice. No contradictory impulses are dramatized under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—the merged hourglasses visibly reconfigure meaning and the cost is felt in the fading scars—under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is clear by 120 words; however, the tunnel sequence relies on dream-logic coincidence rather than tightening causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The tower, tunnel, and cavern are sketched with selective, sensory detail; the hourglass itself functions as micro-setting that constrains the final choice. Spatial choreography is coherent, though the cavern’s glowing crystals flirt with generic fantasy shorthand.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>A single dominant stake—recovering the displaced miracle—drives the piece; pressure deepens through the tunnel visions, but escalation is more atmospheric than causal. The final merging is a graceful crystallization rather than a narrowing of options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of healing through confronting buried pain emerges implicitly from image and action; the hourglass reprise offers a resonant non-literal answer. A faint drift toward abstract “miracle” language keeps it from higher resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited is stable; diction is lyrical yet consistent, with a perceptual signature keyed to plant telepathy. No dialogue appears, so voice remains coherent throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is fluid, with varied rhythm and high information density; occasional soft-focus phrases (“meteor hush,” “displaced miracle”) slightly dilute specificity. No loops or scaffold artifacts mar the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>The plant-telepathy/hourglass synthesis feels fresh, and the reversed-sand image is memorable. Some tropes—hidden basement, glowing crystals—remain recognizable fantasy furniture, slightly muting originality.</comment>
