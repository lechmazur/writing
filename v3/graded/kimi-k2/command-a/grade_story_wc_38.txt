<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is lyrical but abstract; her contradictory impulses (“to encrypt vulnerability as strength”) are stated rather than dramatized in body or choice. The dance-deciphering beat shows embodied motive, yet the cost of that exposure is asserted, not felt. Still, her calm defiance remains consistent and individuated.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the laboratory awakens, passages open, and Elara’s stance crystallizes with the dice now “silent”—a visible, felt cost under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is clear by line 3; causality is lyric rather than strict because/therefore, but the pattern is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The sunken laboratory is evoked with selective sensory detail—“damp, moss-covered surfaces,” “water dripped steadily”—that constrains movement and mood. The dice and glowing journal function as micro-settings that guide the final dance. Spatial choreography is coherent; no white-room drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—liberate buried knowledge—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once: the dance must succeed or the knowledge stays entombed. The cost is the dice falling silent, a felt forfeiture. Agency is Elara’s alone; coincidence does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of transmuting fragility into power emerges through the dance-cipher and the dice’s final silence, avoiding explicit moralizing. Subtext resides in gesture and object rather than statement. The ending reweights the premise without tidy resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical, consistent, and POV-anchored; perceptual signature favors tactile and auditory detail. Compression and patterned elision (“shadows danced,” “echoes of brilliance”) are taught early and remain legible. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose is fluid and read-aloud rhythmic; figurative language is dense but patterned, not muddled. Occasional near-repetition (“once a tomb of silence, now echoed with…”) is minor. No loops or artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The fusion of dance-as-code and dice-as-keys feels fresh; the sunken-lab frame is familiar but transformed through embodied cipher. The risk of lyric abstraction is mostly controlled, yielding a memorable inflection.</comment>
