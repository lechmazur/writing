<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the amber pendant anchors her contradictory impulses. Yet her final shift from guarded to open relies more on Kai’s gentle presence than on a visible cost she herself pays. The “quietly proactive” trait is shown in micro-choices, but the decisive beat feels externally nudged rather than internally compelled.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of moss, icicles, and pendant images tighten toward the shared notebook moment. Closure lands as Charged Poise—shared language reconfigures isolation into connection—yet the cost (loss of absolute solitude) is only implied, not dramatized. Orientation is swift; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The moss garden is rendered with tactile specificity and filters every perception. It constrains movement (paths between servers) and supplies the final amber light that charges the closing image. Micro-setting (pendant, notebook) also functions as charged object-terrain.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—protected vulnerability—signaled early. Pressure deepens when Kai arrives, forcing Elara to test her sanctuary. The tightening is gentle: sharing the notebook crystallizes the stake but does not visibly foreclose any live option; cost remains atmospheric rather than concrete.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of grafting new meaning onto wounds emerges through moss over servers and shared patterns. Subtext in gesture and silence avoids moralizing. Final image of amber light reframes the “honeyed hush” as communal rather than solitary, achieving quiet resonance without didacticism.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet grounded in Elara’s perceptual bias; sensory selection mirrors her need for softness amid decay. Rhythm modulates with emotional intensity; no head-hopping. Dialogue is spare and subtext-laden, distinct from narrative texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, vivid, and propulsive; figurative language is selective and purposeful. Occasional soft-focus phrases (“honeyed hush,” “world holding its breath”) flirt with abstraction but stay within POV lexicon. No loops or scaffold; high information density.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Post-digital ruin reclaimed by moss is familiar, yet the fusion with viral-confession aftermath feels fresh. Specificity of icicle embroidery and shared notebook elevates the trope. Risk is moderate; transformation sufficient to avoid derivative label.</comment>
