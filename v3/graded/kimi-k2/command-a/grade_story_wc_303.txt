<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Elara’s interiority is specific (mulberry ache, telepathy with plants as quirk) and her ultimate choice to weigh dream vs. empire carries cost, but her motives remain more thematic than tightly embodied; the violin usage is elegant yet doesn’t fully test her flaw.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Closure lands hard: the violin’s song reconfigures space and stakes, with felt cost as Dominion scouts falter; causal link between coffee-stain augury and choice is present though lightly dramatized under lyric lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Velvet, nightshade scent, ferns, and balcony choreography all pressure tactics—vines snare scouts and alter scene; observatory functions as constraining tool, though some decor remains cosmetic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—dream vs. Dominion—tightens through two decisive beats: augury narrowing choice and violin execution foreclosing empire’s claim; visible social cost resonates strongly under situational lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Perforated destiny concept drives every key choice, culminating in the charged image of split tree roots framing the violin; the non-literal answer to mending destiny lands without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Lyrical, sensorial prose with rhythmic control; plant telepathy emerges as a distinct perceptual signature; no head-hopping, though occasional elevated diction slides into poetic abstraction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Strong sensory compression and vivid metaphors, yet a few decorative phrases and template cadences mar the violin climax; clarity remains intact and read-aloud rhythm varies.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of plant telepathy, coffee-stain augury, and ice-violin as mending force; motivated reversal during performance feels inevitable and specific without genre cliché or gimmickry.</comment>
