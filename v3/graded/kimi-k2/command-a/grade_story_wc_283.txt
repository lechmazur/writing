<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is textured—her trembling fingers, deliberate grace, and the surge when she touches the bone button—but the contradiction between “quietly inspired” and “trembling” is asserted rather than dramatized. The final choice to carry the wisdom forward is clear yet the cost feels generalized rather than embodied; we sense renunciation but not its specific weight on her body or future.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the silent jar and the pouch of bone button crystallize a new stance—guardianship of shared wisdom—without resolving the prophecy. Causality is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of buttons → echo → insight tightens once, reweighting possibility. Orientation is immediate; no lens drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The amber warehouse’s dust-filtered light and shelf-lined silence function as micro-setting, constraining movement and focus; the bone button’s tactile specificity charges the final image. Sensory selection is POV-filtered and purposeful, though the cliffs outside remain postcard backdrop rather than tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—unscramble the echo to convert prophecy into possibility—is signaled early. Escalation is a single deepening: bone button syncs with jar, voices swell, options reconfigure. Cost is conceptual (burden of guardianship) rather than visceral, but legible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: wisdom as communal, unfinished, and portable rather than fated. Subtext resides in the shift from “prophecy” to “possibility,” carried by the bone button’s reprise. No moralizing; the final wind-whisper image invites reflection without dictation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet controlled, with rhythmic variation (“deliberate grace,” “hummed faintly”). Compression is taught early (“time felt fluid”) and paid off in the final cadence. No POV leakage; perception stays anchored to Elara’s selective attention.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, vivid, and mostly loop-free; occasional soft filler (“seemed to resonate”) slightly dulls immediacy. Metaphors are coherent; no mixed vehicles. Density is high without overcrowding the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—turning prophecy into possibility via cataloged buttons—feels fresh and specific. Canyon-echo-as-wisdom reframes familiar mythic tropes through tactile, domestic objects. Risk lies in quiet lyricism rather than spectacle, and it pays off.</comment>
