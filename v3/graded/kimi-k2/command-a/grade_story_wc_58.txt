<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elderly woman's wait embodied without diagnostic clichés; traveler’s interiority vivid—her micro‐choice to hand over the notebook and accept second thread is earned. Only the “lonesome splendor” tag skirts sentimentality. Otherwise character logic holds.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: accepting new thread re-weaves tapestry motif with felt cost (old thread now doubled, absences reweighted). Causal lens holds—each beat (asking, writing, gifting) triggered by prior cue. Orientation anchored early by twilight/ship horizon.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Garden’s scent of fallen leaves and bench-stone pressure narrow choices—the bench’s fixed location governs distance and intimacy. Thread and shadows act as micro-setting that constrains positioning. Autumn dusk deepens color palette, charging final image. Vivid without ornament overload.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—writing as healing geography—is signaled early and tightened each time traveler’s pen moves. Final gifting of notebook forecloses “waiting” mode for old woman; cost is the traveler accepting reciprocal thread, binding future journeys. Escalation through obituary words crystallizing grief is palpable.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of absences made story emerges via acts rather than exposition; final image reframes hope as transformed memory. Subtext holds dual mourning—for the living who lose themselves and for the self that waits. Non-moralizing and resonant.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice stays interiorly lyrical without drifting purple: “quiet intrusion,” “a hymn in the stillness.” Distinct perceptual signature—focus on color, scent, fabric texture—locked to traveler POV; no register wobble. Dialogue fragments feel spoken yet subtext-rich.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic; no looped scaffold or filter stacks. First line anchors stakes; last line lands with cadence shift “tiny obituaries for the day.” Figurative control sustained—no strained metaphor in high-pressure beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresher twist: obituary for living self as map of healing is non-generic; garden/threads elevate familiar grief setting. Risky compression works: two souls, single scene, woven closure without gimmick. Thread exchange feels inevitable in hindsight, specific to this voice.</comment>
