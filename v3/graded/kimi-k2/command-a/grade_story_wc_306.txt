<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is vivid—his tactile handling of the shard and attunement to wind chimes reveal a precise, character-specific lens. Motivation (“welcome nuance into certainty”) is stated rather than dramatized; we infer it only through his letter-writing, so the cost feels intellectual rather than embodied. No contradictory impulses are staged in scene; the shift from doubt to acceptance is narrated rather than enacted. Still, the final act of sealing the shard in the letter earns a modest micro-choice that forecloses further intervention.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the letter-plus-shard constitutes a Resonant Reconfiguration that reframes Mara’s doubt as generative. Causal chain is light—wind-chime “code” is asserted rather than demonstrated—but the inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of chimes → reflection → letter builds density toward the final image. No orientation debt; lighthouse, dawn, and salt air are anchored early. Cost is conceptual (acceptance of uncertainty) and legible in the shard’s inclusion.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lighthouse, breeze, and salt scent are selective and filtered through Elias’s task-oriented attention. The hollow mirror shard functions as micro-setting, its emptiness literalizing Mara’s void and constraining Elias’s symbolic gesture. Spatial choreography is coherent; no impossible moves. Weather is ornamental rather than tactical, preventing a higher score.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Mara’s paralysis under the cloak of doubt—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once: Elias translates chimes into guidance, then acts. The tightening is more interpretive than causal, so escalation feels gentle. Cost is conceptual, not visceral, keeping the score just below the 7.0 gate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of embracing uncertainty emerges organically from Elias’s ritual and the shard’s journey from brokenness to gift. Subtext is carried by the shard’s silence and the chimes’ wordless “message.” Final image resists moralizing; the wax-sealed letter lets the reader reweight doubt as possibility. One minor echo—“cloak of doubt” named twice—slightly dilutes subtlety.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Voice is calm, lyrical, and consistent with Elias’s contemplative profession. Syntax modulates with the wind’s rhythm; no head-hopping. Diction stays within a philosophical but grounded register. The only dialogue is Mara’s reported speech, filtered through Elias’s skeptical ear, preserving POV modesty.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; each sentence advances image or intent. Occasional soft fillers—“seemed to come alive,” “felt the weight of its symbolism”—slightly dilute immediacy. No loops or mixed metaphors. Strong verbs (“tugging,” “whispered”) outweigh nominalizations.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>The conscience-for-hire conceit and wind-chime divination feel fresh yet understated. Premise avoids gimmickry by grounding Elias’s method in sensory attention rather than magic. Transformation test: swap lighthouse for cabin and story still works, but the shard’s maritime echo would be lost. Risk is moderate, not bold.</comment>
