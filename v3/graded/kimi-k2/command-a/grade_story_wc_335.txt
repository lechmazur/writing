<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is textured—her backwards walk, trembling fingers, and “combative tenderness” are embodied—but motivation (“mentor resilience quietly”) is asserted more than dramatized. The single POV holds, yet the absence of a second on-page character limits relational pressure. The final resolve feels earned by the annotation act, though the cost is more conceptual than visceral.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the shard-mirror shifts from prison to portal, reweighting the premise with felt conceptual cost. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of tea-leaf patterns and shadow geometry tightens once, then crystallizes. Orientation is clear by ~80 words; no causality breaks. One minor ellipsis (how the shadow actually “responds”) is tolerated under lyric mode.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The forgotten library is evoked through sensory triangulation—dust motes, cracked windows, groaning shelves—and the shard-mirror itself becomes micro-setting that constrains her posture and gaze. Weather (twilight fade) cues the final beat. Spatial choreography holds; no floating props. While the library never actively blocks her, its atmosphere charges the final image of expectant silence.</comment>

<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: free the trapped shadow to prove reversible exile is possible. Pressure escalates via pattern density—each annotated leaf narrows interpretive options until the shadow “softens.” One clear tightening beat: her last inscription converts mirror from prison to bridge. Cost is conceptual—she relinquishes certainty—but could be sharper on the page.</comment>

<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of quiet endurance emerges through concrete acts: tea-leaf divination as pedagogy, backwards walk as self-soothing ritual. No explicit moralizing; final image of “expectant silence” reweights the library’s hush from desolation to possibility. Subtext resides in the shift from annotation as deciphering to annotation as gift. Complexity acknowledged: the shadow’s mockery hints at unguaranteed redemption.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise: “steam curling like whispers,” “edges frayed like a torn letter.” Perceptual signature is consistent—Elara notices through archivist’s taxonomies of shape and scent. Syntax modulates with stress (short clauses during tremor, longer ruminative sentences at rest). No POV drift or filter-verb clutter. Dialogue absent; prose carries subtext alone.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image, character, and concept. Metaphors are controlled—no mixed vehicles. Rhythm breathes: longer descriptive lulls accelerate into clipped annotation beats. Minor scaffold: “shadow a riddle that defied logic” could trim, but does not stall momentum. No line-level artifacts in closure zone.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses archival labor with metaphysical cartography; shard-mirror as memory-prison feels fresh. Tea-leaf geometry as annotation language is specific and non-generic. Risk: lyric compression could have collapsed into vagueness, but specificity of “crescent-moon leaf” anchors it. Transformation test passes—story would collapse without Elara’s idiosyncratic method and the mirror’s rule-set.</comment>
