<comment>Maya registers as a credible marine biologist, but her crisis interiority leans generic (“dwindling sense of hope,” “fear to wonder”) and lacks embodied contradiction under suffocation pressure. The shift from survival to epistemic drive is asserted more than dramatized; it feels convenient to arc rather than wrung from conflict.</comment>

<grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>The Causal lens is followed cleanly—trap/vision/decrypt/passage—yet the decisive moment of override is delivered in summarizing cadence, blunting the Decisive Change. Orientation is stable, and closure lands, but the cost (oxygen burn, future risk) stays abstract, curtailing RR/CR intensity.</comment>

<grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Selective sensory filter—glow, stone breath, pulsing crystals—creates consistent underwater awe without catalog overload. The temple itself doesn’t physically block Maya’s moves; it supplies aesthetic armature rather than tactical constraint, limiting high-band charge to the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>The core stake (escape alive vs. grasp transcendent knowledge) is signaled early and narrows to one climactic choice; however, the trade-off is emotionally defaulted rather than viscerally priced. Escalation is present but gentle; pressure tightens more conceptually than kinesthetically.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Ephemeral preservation versus immediate survival surfaces through imagery alone, steering clear of moral slogans. The ending’s lonesome splendor offers a resonant conceptual repricing, yet the thematic growth lacks the punch that blood-oxygen math or irreparable loss might yield.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Narrative distance stays tight to Maya, diction pitched to a marine-science observer. Occasional elevated phrases (“lonesome splendor,” “ephemeral… eternal”) risk register drift, but overall voice maintains perceptual signature and rhythmic control.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Loops are minimal, sentences carry dual duty. Some soft-focus abstractions (“weight of time,” “essence of the temple’s forgotten secrets”) dilute density; a handful near the climax slightly muffles the final image’s charge.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Merging suffocation thriller with memory-touched relic tale gives moderate freshness; tropes remain recognizable and aren’t radically inverted. Particularized details (crystal perfume vial as memory key) prevent complete interchangeability but fall short of a transformative synthesis.</comment>
