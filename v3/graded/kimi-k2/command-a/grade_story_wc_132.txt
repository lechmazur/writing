<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is textured—her fear of surrender is embodied in the trembling hand and the “hollow” whisper—but the shift from observer to self-transformer is asserted more than dramatized; the leaf acts as catalyst rather than earned mirror. The final renunciation is credible yet feels slightly cushioned by lyricism rather than cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the dissolved leaf and rearranged pots crystallize a before/after stance with felt cost (loss of control). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—storm density and leaf pulse tighten until the cadence shift in the sunlight image. Orientation is swift; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The mossy trellis, rain, and greenhouse roof are vivid and selective; they shift from barrier to gateway, constraining her movement and then enabling the final stance. Micro-setting (leaf, trellis) charges the closure image effectively.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—control vs. surrender—is signaled early and tightens through storm pressure and leaf pulse. One meaningful deepening occurs when she presses the leaf to her chest, foreclosing the old stance. Cost is visible in the drenching and the dissolved leaf.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of reluctant metamorphosis emerges organically from the leaf’s agency and Mara’s embodied fear; no moralizing. Final sunlight image reweights the premise without statement. Some risk of abstraction in “sustaining transformation” phrase.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is consistent, lyrical, and plant-attuned; perceptual signature is distinct (“circuitously sincere” shows in winding syntax). No dialogue, so no voice contamination. Rhythm modulates with storm intensity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; occasional elevated diction (“reluctant metamorphosis,” “conceptual repricing”) slightly drifts from Mara’s grounded lexicon but remains coherent. No loops or scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: using a single leaf as both catalyst and vanishing mirror for internal change. Avoids plant-nursery clichés by focusing on surrender rather than cultivation. Risk is moderate but coherent.</comment>
