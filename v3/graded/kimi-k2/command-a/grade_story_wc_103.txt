<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s obsession with “texture of time” is stated more than embodied; her trembling hand and the warmth of the fragment gesture toward embodied emotion, but interiority drifts into abstraction. The final shift—“she had discovered herself”—is asserted rather than dramatized, softening the felt cost. Still, her micro-choice to place the fragment on the pedestal is legible and irreversible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the maze’s geometry stabilizes and Elara’s ancestral memories are restored, with the cost of the fragment’s loss. Causal chain is coherent under an Accumulative/Textural lens; each beat layers sensory density until the final swirl reweights the stake. One minor ellipsis: how the maze “tests her resolve” is asserted, not shown.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The living bridge garden is evoked with selective, sensory strokes—“roots intertwined like ancient whispers,” “vines curled into arches that seemed to breathe”—that filter through Elara’s designer gaze. The maze’s hyperbolic warp is more declared than tactically used, but the clearing’s pedestal and light vortex serve as micro-setting that constrains the final choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recovering lost ancestral memory—is signaled early and tightened when the fragment warms and the maze warps. The single decisive turn is placing the fragment on the pedestal; cost is the fragment’s dissolution and the maze’s spent power. Pressure escalates via sensory intensification rather than external opposition, fitting the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of memory’s fragility and reclamation emerges through concrete particulars—fading photographs, the fragment’s pulse, the restored faces—not exposition. Final image of Elara emerging with “stories now hers to carry” offers quiet resonance without moralizing. Avoids tidy binaries; ambiguity lingers in what the restored memories will demand of her.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lush yet controlled, with rhythmic cadences that mirror Elara’s reverie. Occasional elevated diction (“retrocognitive entrapment,” “hyperbolic geometry”) edges toward register drift but remains within a designer’s plausible lexicon. Perceptual signature is consistent; no POV leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is vivid and propulsive, but figurative density clusters in high-pressure beats—“shimmering with an otherworldly glow,” “cascade of images and sensations”—without pattern-teaching. No loops or scaffold; sentences advance story or atmosphere. One mixed metaphor: “tapestry” of memories inside a “vortex” slightly blurs spatial logic.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: hedge-maze-as-temporal-instrument is specific and grounded in Elara’s profession. Halo fragment as memory key avoids generic MacGuffin by tying directly to ancestral stakes. Risk-taking in hyperbolic geometry is under-explained but doesn’t derail coherence. Feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
