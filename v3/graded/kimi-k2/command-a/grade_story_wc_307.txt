<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied, but the backwards-aging trait remains abstract; no bodily contradiction or micro-choice is driven by it. The withheld-truth motive is clear, yet the climactic reveal feels pre-decided rather than wrestled with in-scene. Cost is stated (“heart heavy”) but not dramatized through action or irreversible loss.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara’s public confession reweights her prior silences. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of stone/ripple/truth culminates in a cadence shift. Cost is legible in the grotto’s hush and her unburdened heaviness, though the price could be sharper.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Obsidian platform, magnetic grotto, and starlight are sensuously evoked and filter through Elara’s scientific-mystical gaze. The grotto’s hum and reflective water constrain her method of revelation, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—truth vs. concealment—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs when she decides to speak; the withheld truth’s release narrows her future options. Cost is present but generalized; a more specific forfeiture would push higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of absence-as-presence emerges organically from withheld truth and ripple imagery. Final image of brighter starlight offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. Subtext in gesture and silence is strong; avoids thematic echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with rhythmic control that modulates under trance pressure. Perceptual signature is distinct—scientific diction braided with mystic cadence. No POV drift; purposeful compression in trance sequence is legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, vivid, and propulsive; figurative language is selective. Minor scaffold in “she saw herself at different ages” could tighten. No mixed metaphors or loops in peak beats; final paragraph earns its quiet cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Backwards-aging premise is handled with conceptual integrity rather than gimmick; ripple-as-time motif feels fresh. Specific synthesis of physics and mysticism avoids stock tropes. One fresh inflection: revelation via withholding rather than discovery.</comment>
