<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara’s stoic defeat early quickly pivots to active resistance; her emotional restraint underpins the climactic act without generic epiphanies. Internal conflict is embodied in shunning resurrection for creation, cementing earned change. Backstory stays under 20 % and directly feeds present stakes. A stoic sensitivity renders mistakes without therapeutic self-labeling. Passivity is absent; every beat stems from agency under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds cleanly: each beat is because/therefore linked—“failed vivifying,” therefore “pivot to creative destruction,” therefore “charge the soil.” Closure qualifies as Earned Stasis—Elara renounces resurrection for rebirth, carrying visible cost in ash and sapling. Orientation held past 120 words. No telegraphed exposition post-resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Ember nexus is not tourist scenery; its pulsing light and ash columns dictate the ritual space and constrain the burial of the crozier. Sensory hierarchy mirrors Elara’s narrowing focus on the earth and the glow. The frozen-bloom reprise reweights the finale. No anachronisms or spatial drift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake: break “stifling destiny of failure.” Each press of the crozier escalates scarcity of likelihood rather than speed, tightening until the sapling signals the decisive shift. One micro-turn suffices; cost is visible in relinquished resurrection. No lucky resolutions—Elara’s hands bleed, ash sticks.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: creation via creative-destruction sublimated into necromancer-Georgics without meta commentary. The ending image recharges the frozen-bloom motif without moralizing—beauty survives char. Earned wisdom comes from ash-to-sapling experience, not prompt label.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Free-indirect style restrained—poetic but consistent with Elara’s diction under despair. “Char and brittle” diction carries intellectual flair yet stays within alchemist lexicon. No head-hopping. Dialogue is sparse but subtextual: the crozier does the talking.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Scaffold is light, loop count low (minor “ash and forgotten dreams” echo). Rhythm varies—short pins during chant, longer cadences for reverie. Density high; lines perform double duty (image + concept). Occasional elevated flourish that clouds slightly, recovered by strong nouns.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Risky synthesis—necromancy lectures into entropy ecology—felt fresh by grounding spellcraft in soil ritual. Could swap “crozier” for comparable broken tool with minor loss. Specificity of ash-sapling cycle rescues some uniqueness score.</comment>
