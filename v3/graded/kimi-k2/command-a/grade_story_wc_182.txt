<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara’s “carefully resourceful” trait is repeatedly asserted but only once embodied—when she bargains with the guardian. Interiority is generic (“her mind already racing”) and Kael remains a plot device rather than pressure. The final bargain shows earned cost, lifting the score above mid-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: diary → chrono-blossom → doorway → bargain. Closure is a clear Decisive Change with conceptual cost (balance of time). However, the mountain’s “shifting walls” behave inconsistently and the diary’s riddles are solved off-stage, softening causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The mountain-bookstore is vivid (“shelves shifting imperceptibly,” “moss-covered leather”), and the chrono-blossom’s ticking petals constrain the final choice. Spatial anchors are clear early. A few stock phrases (“shadowed depths,” “whispers of forgotten tomes”) keep it from the 9-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—find the library before time collapses—is declared but never viscerally tested; the ticking clock is metaphorical rather than tactical. One meaningful tightening occurs when plucking the flower opens the doorway, yet the price is deferred to the guardian scene, blurring cost clarity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of knowledge versus balance emerges implicitly through the guardian’s bargain. Subtext is present but thin; Kael’s urgency is stated, not dramatized. Final image of “unheard symphony” offers quiet resonance yet feels slightly abstract rather than earned by specific particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is consistent, lyrical, and filtered through Elara’s arcane lens (“language of the stars”). Syntax modulates with tension. Occasional elevated diction (“temporal energy,” “conceptual repricing”) edges toward register drift but remains within tolerable bounds for the character.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense. A few loops (“whispers,” “secrets,” “symphony” repeated) and mild scaffold (“she knew her task was to…”) slightly dull momentum. No mixed metaphors or clarity breaks; closure line lands crisply.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Combines time-travel, living library, and botanical riddles into a fresh synthesis. The chrono-blossom as key feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Some tropes (shadowed labyrinth, cloaked guardian) remain recognizable; transformation is partial but sufficient for high-band originality.</comment>
