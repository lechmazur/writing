<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s curiosity-driven motivation is clear, but interiority drifts toward summary (“felt a strange clarity”) rather than embodied contradiction. Micro-choice to place the globe down carries cost yet lacks prior tension between holding and releasing. Reflection stays within BRR limits and tilts present stance, but emotional layering is thin under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of unfinished narratives tightens toward the letter’s release imperative. Closure—placing the globe and swimming away—earns Earned Stasis with felt conceptual cost (“lullaby” reweights silence). No orientation drift; causality intact under lyric pattern.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Sunken library is vividly anchored (damp plank, silt, collapsed shelves) and constrains movement; snow globe functions as micro-setting that charges final image. Sensory selection mirrors internal narrowing—cold, dim, intact glass against decay—without excess cataloging.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding letting go—escalates through map discovery and letter revelation, tightening from curiosity to practice. Single meaningful turn: decision to leave globe. Cost is conceptual (accept impermanence) rather than visceral, but legible under lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</question><comment>Theme of release emerges organically from sailor’s letter and Elara’s final gesture; no moralizing. Subtext in “let the snow fall where it may” reweights prior hoarding impulse. Sophisticated melancholy modulates from weight to lullaby without sentimentality.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</question><comment>Voice is consistent, marine-archaeologist perceptual signature evident in “waterlogged tomes,” “rust-chewed artifacts.” Compression purposeful; no POV drift. Rhythm breathes with scene—longer reflections calmer, shorter beats under pressure. No dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</question><comment>Prose is clean, vivid, and propulsive; only minor scaffold (“its pages brittle and faintly luminous” could trim). No loops or mixed metaphors. Sensory detail integrated into action. Final image crystallizes without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</question><comment>Fusion of Earhart fame with sunken-library premise feels fresh; snow globe as memento mori device avoids cliché through sailor’s sketch and letter. Specificity of decayed study and synthetic snow creates memorable texture. Risk in quiet ending pays off via reweighted silence.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.4</question><grade>“First-name basis with Death” is ornamental; Death never appears or pressures choices. No beat altered by this relationship.</question>
<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>Snow globe: early find, mid-scene sketch, final placement reweights meaning—indispensable to closure.</question>
<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</question><grade>“Last transmission” concept shapes stakes via journal and letter; drives Elara’s shift from collector to releaser.</question>
<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</question><grade>Quietly analytic trait enables map reading and thread untangling, but lacks visible trade-off under pressure.</question>
<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</question><grade>“Note” action (journal reading) triggers map discovery and letter revelation; causal but swappable with other prompts.</question>
<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</question><grade>“Untangling threads” method signaled early (ropes, journal) and used mid-scene; mechanics matter but not deeply tested.</question>
<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</question><grade>Sunken ship library constrains movement, supplies artifacts, and charges final silence—integral across beats.</question>
<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</question><grade>Post-Earhart timeframe is backstory; no live clock or tactical pressure from elapsed time.</question>
<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</question><grade>Motivation to grasp “physics of letting go” is dramatized through globe handling and final release; conflicted choice visible.</question>
<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</question><grade>Sophisticated melancholy pervades tone, modulating from oppressive silence to lullaby; charges final image effectively.</question>
