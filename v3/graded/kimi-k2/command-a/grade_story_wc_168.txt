<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s survivor-guilt and caretaker identity are embodied in the cracked box he cradles; the feather vision re-weights his stance, but the epiphany leans toward summary rather than a micro-choice with immediate cost, keeping it just shy of 8.8.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the moonlight, box, and feather layer density until the final image crystallizes “purpose heavier than guilt.” Closure lands as Charged Poise; the cost is felt in the relinquishing of the box, though the beat could be sharper.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The moonlit ridge and porcelain box serve as micro-setting that constrains Elias’s solitude and frames the final placement; sensory detail is selective but occasionally drifts into atmospheric filler (“celestial bodies slowing their dance”).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transforming guilt into connective purpose—tightens once when the feather visions force a re-evaluation; the cost is the relinquishing of the box, but the beat is more conceptual than visceral, capping it below 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of “bargained innocence” emerges through the cracked vessel metaphor and the feather’s universal sorrow; final image reweights prior guilt without moralizing, though the articulation flirts with prompt-like phrasing once.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent; perceptual signature filters every image through Elias’s scarred caretaker lens. Compression and elision are purposeful; no head-hop or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean and rhythmic, but occasional soft filler (“as if the celestial bodies themselves were slowing their dance”) and stacked similes dilute peak pressure; no loops but a touch of overwriting near the climax.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</comment>
<comment>The cracked porcelain box as vessel for communal sorrow is a fresh inflection on survivor-guilt stories; the moonlit ridge and feather vision synthesize familiar motifs into a specific emotional arc, though the premise itself is recognizable.</comment>
