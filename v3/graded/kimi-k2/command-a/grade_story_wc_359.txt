<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—synesthetic perception is embodied in color-sound—but the childhood vow is summarized rather than dramatized, muting the cost of her final choice. The sculpted hush materializes as external validation rather than a crucible that forces her to confront a flaw or pay a price. Micro-choices under pressure are present (ringing bells, stepping back) yet feel calibrated rather than genuinely risky.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the living hush redefines silence from absence to possibility, with aurora colors charging the final image. Causality is Accumulative/Textural—each bell stroke layers color until the hush coheres—yet the sculptor’s chisel remains off-stage, a coincidental trigger rather than a causal constraint. Cost is felt conceptually but not dramatized on Elara’s body or future.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The cavern’s crystalline architecture and aurora conduit are rendered with synesthetic precision, constraining Elara’s method and charging the final image. Spatial anchors are immediate; ice surfaces, stalactites, and fractured floor track cleanly. Environment actively shapes tactics—colors guide resonance—earning the 9+ gate check.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“certify wonder as essential”—is signaled early and escalates through color-dense bell strikes that tighten toward the hush’s emergence. Pressure is coherent under Accumulative lens, yet the tightening is aesthetic rather than option-narrowing; no visible price is exacted from Elara beyond effort.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: stillness as generative possibility, not emptiness. Subtext resides in color-sound synesthesia and the hush’s living form, avoiding overt statement. Final image reweights the premise without moralizing, though the conceptual cost is more luminous than painful.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is synesthetic, lyrical, and consistent; perceptual signature saturates every line (“blues of distant whispers”). Rhythm modulates with scene intensity—longer cadences in repose, clipped fragments under climax. No POV drift; diction remains within Elara’s sensorial lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is pattern-taught early and paid off in aurora-charged closure. Occasional stacked modifiers (“liquid sunlight trapped within ancient resin”) flirt with overwriting but serve synesthetic lens. No loops or scaffold; sentences advance on multiple fronts.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Fusion of synesthesia, aurora conduit, and sculpted hush feels fresh; familiar “restore wonder” arc is re-angled through sensory alchemy. Risk lies in the lyric accumulative structure, which holds. Specificity of color-sound mapping prevents generic drift.</comment>
