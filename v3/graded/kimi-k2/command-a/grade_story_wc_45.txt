<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“weight of the changeling’s baby tooth resting heavy against her hip”), but the moment of surrendering her “certainty stone” feels slightly abstract—more label than lived cost. The contradiction between skepticism and yearning is present yet not fully dramatized in a single irreversible beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the tooth becomes a star, the maze paths clear, and Elara steps through a “gateway” with earned lightness. The causal chain (tooth → fountain → transformation) holds under a Causal lens, and the cost—loss of her certainty stone—is visible on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Garden and maze are rendered with selective, sensory detail (“ivy and hawthorn twisting in ways that defied logic”). The fountain’s dark mirror constrains the final choice, but the hedge maze itself never actively thwarts or reconfigures tactics—more backdrop than pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“to turn mistakes into constellations”—is signaled early and tightened when Elara must trade certainty for healing. The single reversal (offering the stone) narrows options, though the price feels more conceptual than visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of redemption through imperfection emerges organically from the tooth-to-star transformation and Elara’s self-reckoning. Final image reweights the premise without moralizing, but the garden’s “mending truths” edges toward abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet grounded in Elara’s perceptual bias (“translucent enamel catching the light like a fragment of moon”). Syntax modulates with emotional rise; no head-hopping. Occasional elevated diction (“constellations,” “conceptual repricing”) slightly strains the intimate POV.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense. One paraphrase loop (“her heart pounding… her voice steady despite the tremor in her chest”) and a mixed metaphor (“bones being reset” alongside emotional warmth) keep it from flawless.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Fairy-tale elements (changeling tooth, secret garden) are refreshed through Elara’s skeptical lens and the final star-image. The synthesis feels inevitable yet not radically new; risk is moderate, not bold.</comment>
