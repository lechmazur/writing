<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is lyrical but abstract; her muteness is stated, not embodied in choice. The final smile is the only visible cost, leaving motivation more asserted than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the spinning sculpture crystallizes wonder while foreclosing permanence. Causality is lyric rather than linear, but the lens holds and the cost is felt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The bluff’s altitude and cloud-draped light actively constrain movement and frame the sculpture’s glow; spatial anchors are vivid and purposeful.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stakes—“preserve the color of wonder”—remain thematic; no live option is foreclosed on the page. Escalation is atmospheric, not tactical.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of impermanence and wonder emerges through image and motion, not statement. Final tableau reweights the premise without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Voice is consistent, lyrical, and perceptually specific; the prose’s cadence mirrors the kinetic sculpture’s spin. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Sentences are clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; occasional poetic loops serve the lyric mode rather than stall momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Fusion of mute bell-tuner, iceberg fragment, and kinetic sculpture feels fresh; conceptually risky yet coherent. Avoids familiar templates.</comment>
