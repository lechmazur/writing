<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is consistent and embodied (“brazen calm unbroken”), but the story leans on summary rather than scene-level contradiction; the final renunciation is earned yet stated rather than dramatized with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elias’s final diary entry crystallizes the orchard’s new purpose with felt legacy-cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of copper wire, diary pages, and stone carvings tighten toward the last image. Orientation is clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The temple orchard is vivid and selective; living stone pillars and copper-wrapped oaks constrain Elias’s remodeling choices and charge the final tableau. Micro-setting (central oak) functions as both tool and altar, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—legacy of interspecies respect—tightens through each remodeling beat; the six-month clock is named but not used to alter tactics on the page, so pressure is thematic rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of unity between nature and design emerges organically from Elias’s labor and the orchard’s architecture; final diary line risks overt statement but is saved by the resonant image of the orchard “whispering its gratitude.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is calm, precise, and horticultural; free of filter clutter. Rhythm modulates with the orchard’s transformations. No dialogue, so voice remains internally coherent and character-specific.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; occasional soft loops (“the orchard was…”) and elevated diction (“testament,” “revered”) nudge it below 8.0. No artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Fusion of living architecture and inherited diary feels fresh; copper-guided tree shaping is a specific, non-obvious method. Premise avoids eco-fable cliché through tactile detail and earned final image.</comment>
