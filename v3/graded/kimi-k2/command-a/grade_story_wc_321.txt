<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara's positive resilience is repeatedly tagged but only tested once—her decision to enter the rift—where the cost is asserted (“body weakening”) more than dramatized. Interior contradiction is sketched rather than embodied; we’re told she feels “her consciousness splintering” but no contradictory impulse fights it. Still, the drive to merge timelines stays consistent, and the final image of her on her knees, “forever changed,” earns a modest credibility from all preceding gestures.</comment>

<comment>Drive lens reads Causal: every beat connects Mara’s attempts to their consequences (“channeling energy into its empty chambers,” ferry re-emerges). Closure delivers a decisive change: timelines merged and ferry restored, final image—“hourglass now filled with glowing sand”—supplies Charged Poise, cost legible in her collapsed body and “forever changed.” One micro turn fulfills single-cycle structure; causal linkage stays intact.</comment>

<comment>Grotto, hourglass, and sideways clocks function as a single atmospheric organism. The starlit walls project shifting symbols that constrain Mara’s decoding, and the sideways clock tightens urgency when minutes “stretch or collapse.” Micro-setting (hourglass becoming filled) directly charges final image. Anchor clear early, consistency stable—no drift. Physical detail slightly generic (“spectral glow”), yet atmosphere suffuses choice.</comment>

<grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“merge timelines or stranded souls”—announced early, pressure rises by Mara’s conscious choice to enter rift. Escalation shows narrowing options: radio fails, transient forbids passage, rift threatens dissolution. Cost feels asserted rather than viscerally dramatized, still unmistakably on the page: “Mara collapsed to her knees,” ferry restored but not without lasting alteration. Coincidence used only to warn, never to solve.</question>

<comment>Gently emergent theme of endurance versus transience unfolds through the ferry’s return and Mara’s survival. Hourglass fills—“some things endure”—reweights earlier emptiness without an explicit statement. Subtext resides in gesture: handing the transient the hourglass, rescuing commuters frozen mid-motion. Avoids direct moral; slight abstraction in final lines keeps score from 9.</question>

<comment>Third-person close clings to Mara’s sensory biases, perceptually selective (“shards of color,” “cold glass”). Tone is restrained, lyrical, no head-hop. One dialogue snippet remains short and utilitarian; voice coherence high. Occasional faint template cadence (“Mara’s heart ached…”) just touches 8.</question>

<grade>8.1</question>
<comment>Line-level economy strong—most sentences multitask image, drive stakes. No paraphrase loops or scaffold. Minor clutter in early description (“spectral grotto under starlight, where the air shimmered…”) mildly redundant. Rhythm clean, propulsion intact through climax.</question>

<grade>8.0</question>
<comment>Transforms ferry-disappearance trope into metaphysic rescue mission. Unique synthesis: ferry frozen, passengers static, sideways clocks as temporal pressure cooker. Feels inevitable by closure yet fresh in its integration; stakes stay human and tactile.</question>
