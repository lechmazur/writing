<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The dweller's motivation is clear and consistent, but interiority remains generalized—no contradictory impulses surface in scene. The final smile is earned, yet the cost feels abstract rather than embodied. No micro-choice under pressure is dramatized; the turn is narrated rather than lived.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration: the tape reel's voice crystallizes the dweller's purpose, reconfiguring their stance toward visibility. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens; each fragment adds density until the final hum. Orientation is swift; no teleporting props. The only flaw is the soft cost—no tangible forfeiture on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The sapphire hush is vivid and selective, filtering through the dweller's cautious perception. The library's pipes and shadows constrain movement and hide the cache, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent; no floating rooms. The setting never evolves with events, remaining a static backdrop rather than an active force.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>One dominant stake—visibility through restored memory—is signaled early and tightens as fragments accumulate. The pressure is textural rather than causal; no single choice narrows options. The final hum reweights the stake with conceptual cost, but the lack of a visible trade-off keeps it from the 8.8 band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: preservation of voice as resistance to erasure. The tape reel's crackle recharges earlier motifs without moralizing. Subtext operates in the dweller's gentle handling of fragments, but the thematic turn leans toward affirmation rather than ambiguity. The ending offers quiet resonance rather than conceptual repricing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays close to the dweller's sensory filter; no head-hopping. Syntax is controlled, with rhythmic variation that mirrors the methodical search. The voice is consistent but not yet idiosyncratic enough for the 9+ band. No dialogue, so voice rests entirely on narrative texture, which remains steady.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, with high information density and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful—“sapphire hush,” “metallic veins”—never muddling clarity. Sentence openings vary; momentum breathes with the search. A few soft nominalizations (“flicker of sense memory”) keep it from 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>The premise—hidden librarian restoring lost voices—feels fresh yet grounded. The ferromagnetic tape reel is a specific, non-obvious object that carries emotional weight. No close echoes of famous scenes. The risk is modest; the story plays within a recognizable lyric mode without pushing formal boundaries.</comment>
