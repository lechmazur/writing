<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“her heart ached”), but the decisive choice—accepting the jar—leans on Elara’s validation rather than a fully dramatized internal contradiction; the cost is felt yet not foreclosed by prior causality alone.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Lira’s stance shifts from thief to seeker under moonlight, with visible cost in the relinquished trap and Elara’s relinquished soul-fragment. Causal chain holds; lens is Accumulative/Textural, pattern taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>“Emerald station bathed in moonlight” and the frozen clock tower anchor space and mood; the jar’s glow becomes micro-setting that charges the final image. Selective sensory detail supports tone without clutter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—claiming or releasing the jar—tightens once when the flower-code warns of danger, then again when Elara reveals the soul-cost. Agency drives the final acceptance; price is legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of “illuminated moments” emerges through concrete objects and choices; final image of mingled moonlight reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext in flower-code and silent exchange deepens resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet controlled, with rhythmic variation and consistent POV. Distinct perceptual signature in noticing “coded” flowers and “luminous disbelief.” Dialogue sparse but purposeful.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, vivid, and propulsive; occasional elevated diction (“ephemeral,” “ethereal”) fits the lyric mode. No loops or mixed metaphors; density high without clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Familiar heist/quest frame is refreshed by soul-jar and flower-code mechanics; transformation test passes—story would collapse without these specific elements. Risk in quiet lyric closure pays off.</comment>
