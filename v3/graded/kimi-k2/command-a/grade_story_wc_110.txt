<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is textured and embodied; her contradictory impulses (fear of honesty vs. need for transparency) play out in micro-choices like tracing the ticket and sketching her own doodles. The final gesture—sliding the folded paper and lens—earns the thaw of mistrust with visible relational cost. Secondary pressure from Kian is minimal until the last beat, but the single on-page relationship shift is credible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the cracked lens reframes their shared history and future stance. Causality is Accumulative/Textural—each sensory return of the crystals, ticket, and lens thickens the pattern until the final crystallized moment. Orientation is anchored early; no teleporting props. Cost is legible in Kian’s soft “It’s beautiful” and Elara’s unspoken risk.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The crystal forecourt is vivid, selective, and filtered through Elara’s registrar vigilance; petrichor and resonant hush guide mood and choice. The projector lens functions as micro-setting that constrains the final gesture. Weather and crystals evolve causally with the emotional arc. Spatial choreography is clean; no white-room drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—thaw mistrust via transparency—is signaled early and tightened once when Elara commits to the doodle-bridge. Escalation is Accumulative: each sensory echo (crystals, ticket, lens) increases the cost of withholding. The final reconfiguration forecloses guarded silence; the price is the vulnerability both now share.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme of honesty as ambiguous clarity emerges through concrete objects (cracked lens, cryptic doodles) rather than statement. Subtext operates in the silent exchange and the lens held to light. Final image reweights the premise without moralizing. Resonance lingers in the “resonant hush” that now includes them both.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet grounded in Elara’s perceptual signature—petrichor, damp ticket edges, crystal hum. Syntax modulates with emotional intensity; no head-hopping. Dialogue is sparse but subtext-rich; Kian’s two lines carry relational shift. Free indirect style is clean and consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and symbolic work without redundancy. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is purposeful. Rhythm breathes with the scene’s quiet tension. Minor elevated diction (“ambiguously clear”) is voice-motivated and patterned early.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Premise of post-rain crystal forecourt as confessional space feels fresh; tropes of broken lens and cryptic ticket are transformed through Elara’s registrar gaze. Specificity of “crystal whispering” and “projector lens” anchors universals. Risk is quiet but coherent; no gimmicks. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
