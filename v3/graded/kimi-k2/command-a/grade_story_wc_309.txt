<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Eli’s longing to find the sacred in the simple is clearly rendered, but his interior contradiction mostly skates by summary; the final belief is earned via place rather than demonstrated turns.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>The causal spine holds: Eli’s inability to conform → rejects automated spells → seeks keystone → chooses manual harness+ mist walking. Closure lands with visible felt cost (he forecloses peer approval path).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>The icebound spire and lingering luminance create tactile resistance (icy walls, glowing mist) that physically pressures Eli’s moves; only drawback is occasional generic phrasing.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—proving real magic can still work—escalates as spire walls close in; mist-walking choice carries predictable yet legible tension and cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>The theme of true magic residing in effort over automation is resonantly stated; subtext carries via action rather than sermon, though the ending reframes stakes more than complicates them.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person close focalization is steady; description tilts select and biased. A couple of echoing generic verbs (“as though the spire itself acknowledged…”) soften the voice slightly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Most sentences propel momentum; a few “glistening” and “ethereal” soft spots. No redundant loops, and the rhythm breathes well under closing pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade>
<comment>Inversion of automation vs. manual craft is clear, though the “garden folly keystone” angles toward fantasy cliché; transform by tying impossibility theme to manual effort’s cost keeps it fresh.</comment>
