<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is textured—tapping rhythms, coral grief, the atlas obsession—but the moment of “realization” is delivered as summary rather than dramatized choice, softening the felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: each beat layers pattern (tapping, atlas, data ritual) until the final image reweights the premise. Closure is a quiet CR that re-prices the coastline’s absence, though the causal chain to that image could be sharper.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Station, sea, and torn page are vivid and selective; the atlas page itself becomes a micro-setting that constrains her attention and finally charges the ending. Weather and metal hum are filtered through her professional eye without tourist excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—why paths disappear—surfaces early and tightens via the atlas mystery. One clear deepening occurs when she links the vanished coast to fossil origins, but the cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of erased futures emerges organically from coral death, lost coastlines, and the atlas fragment. Final image of “paths we stop walking” lands as earned resonance without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Voice is consistent, marine-scientist precise, with rhythmic control that mirrors her tapping habit. No dialogue, so focus stays on internal cadence; occasional elevated diction (“periodically eternal”) risks register drift but remains coherent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; only minor filter-verb clusters (“she began to assemble”) and one mixed metaphor (“puzzle she hadn’t known existed”) keep it from the top band.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Familiar eco-fiction tropes are refreshed by the atlas-page-as-warning device and the rhythmic tapping as cognitive tool. Synthesis feels specific to this voice and moment.</comment>
