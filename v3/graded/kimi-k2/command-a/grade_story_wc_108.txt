<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Internal contradiction (fear vs. drive) is voiced, not dramatized; agency flares only in the final gesture with seashell. Micro-choices remain abstract—“trembling certainty” labels the state rather than embodying it—so the final renunciation costs remain legible but thinner than required for high band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise in the mirror room: a momentary reconfiguration where “versions of herself” collapse into active choice (“You are what you choose to be”). Causal chain is thin—key discoveries (cast → key → mirrors) arrive via spatial teleportation rather than earned deduction—but the final image clearly reweights identity with an on-page, felt cost. Drive lens is broadly situational rather than strictly causal, yet holds without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Rusted beams and starlight through gaps anchor time and place early; the library later constrains movement when Elara is funneled toward the locked door. Descriptive vividness is selective—“scent of rust and old paper”—though some labels (“whispering seashell”) border on atmospheric shorthand rather than tactile constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</question><comment>Dominant stake—identity reclaimed—is signaled clearly; tightening occurs when Elara resolves to face the mirrors. Cost is visible (her fabricated persona shatters with literal mirrored glass) but escalates by situational pressure more than by choice-driven complications. Only one meaningful intensification fits the word-limited scope.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through image: identity rewritten by unseen hands, then re-authored by personal agency. Final utterance (“not what they made you… what you choose to be” from the shell) remains just on the safe side of authorial moralizing but still risks overt statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Poetic compression sustains an almost lyric interiority—“trembling certainty,” “rusted library under the stars”—with rhythmic control and no POV slippage. Diction at times leans toward elevated literary generality, muting the stunt-double’s occupational lens.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Sentences move cleanly; occasional elevated phrasing (“urgent vibration… language she couldn’t understand” ) borders on overwriting—abstracting rather than sharpening—but avoids dense clutter. No loops, typos, or causal obscurity. Minor scaffold: two adjacent “as if” clauses slightly dilute immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>6.6</grade>
<comment>Familiar tropes—“seashell reassembles to reveal truth,” “mirrors of possible selves”—are transformed only lightly. Specific occupational detail of stunt doubling is mentioned but never leveraged; freshness leans on atmospheric phrasings rather than truly unexpected synthesis. Risk feels moderate, outcome recognizably literary but not distinctively new.</comment>
