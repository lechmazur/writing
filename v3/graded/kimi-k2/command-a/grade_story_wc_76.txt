<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is vivid—his “neatly inventive mind” and tactile dismantling of the yoyo show embodied obsession—but the final beat leans on abstract awe rather than a contradictory impulse acted upon, so the cost feels observed rather than wrestled with.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: dismantle yoyo → symbols lock → lighthouse reverses. Closure lands with visible cost—the island “humming with energy” and Elias’s trembling hands—though the beat could be sharper if the yoyo’s logic were tested under duress rather than accepted.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The lighthouse’s rusted gears and salt-stink are selective and POV-filtered; the hunger stone’s glow physically constrains the final choice. Micro-detail like “broken tooth” tower and “rocky spine” mirrors Elias’s own exposed nerves, charging the ending image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—rewrite destiny—tightens when the stone awakens and the island resists. One clear escalation: the lighthouse shudders, forcing Elias to decide amid rising tide. Cost is legible but could be more viscerally paid (blood, fracture) to reach 8.8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of defying linear fate emerges through the counter-clockwise reversal rather than statement. The bleak exhilaration lands, yet the final paragraph edges toward explaining the insight rather than letting the reversed beam speak, muting resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Voice is textured and consistent—“oil-stained coat,” “neatly inventive mind”—with rhythmic control under pressure. No dialogue, so focus stays on Elias’s perceptual signature; occasional elevated phrasing (“latent radiance”) slightly drifts from his lexicon but remains legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and propulsive; sensory nouns and strong verbs carry load. One scaffold loop—“he had come here not for the solitude, but for the hunger stone”—could be tighter, and “bleak exhilaration” skirts label-speak, but no artifact obscures the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: clockmaker + yoyo as temporal map + hunger stone as time-bender. The counter-clockwise lighthouse is an earned inversion, not gimmick. Risk is moderate; a more idiosyncratic yoyo mechanism could push higher.</comment>
