<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is stated but never embodied; she “feels” and “knows” rather than acts until the final beat. The creature’s riddle is the only moment of contradictory impulse, and even that is resolved in a single declarative sentence. No interior contradiction is dramatized; the seed is lifted without visible cost to her identity or stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure is a tidy, low-stakes CR: the tree stands, memory is “safe.” The causal chain (dream → seed → plant → safety) is linear and unchallenged; no option is foreclosed, no price paid on the page. Orientation is clear, but the lens remains Accumulative without a tightening turn.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>The ridge breathes with her heartbeat—lovely, but decorative. The seed’s glow under moonlight is the only setting detail that constrains choice, and even that is brief. Micro-setting (moss bed) is present but under-used; the grove never becomes a crucible.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade>
<comment>Stakes are declared—memory loss via monsoon—but the monsoon arrives only after the seed is planted, so pressure never escalates. The creature’s riddle is a single beat of tension, not a narrowing of options. Agency is limited to answering correctly; no trade-off is dramatized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of memory as partnership between fantasy and reality is stated by Elara in dialogue rather than discovered through action. The final image of the blooming ridge gestures toward resonance but does not reweight the premise; it merely affirms the stated thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical, consistent, and filtered through Elara’s perception. No dialogue to test distinction, but internal texture is coherent. Occasional elevated diction (“empirically whimsical”) feels slightly self-conscious yet remains stable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is fluid, with rhythmic variation and few redundancies. Some stock phrasing (“shimmered with the promise of life”) and mild overwriting (“luminous doubt”) keep it from the top band. No loops or artifacts in the final third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>The reality-checker role and knowledge-fruit seed are fresh touches, but the quest structure is archetypal. The synthesis of empirical method and dream interpretation is intriguing yet under-explored; the story does not risk complicating Elara’s stance.</comment>
