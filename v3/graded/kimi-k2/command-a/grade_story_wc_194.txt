<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Eleanor’s interiority is textured—her grip on the crank handle as “promise,” her refusal to speak on the bridge—but the betrayal revelation arrives as inherited summary rather than dramatized contradiction, blunting the cost of her final stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: Eleanor’s choice to accept the role of keeper rather than restorer reweights the dynasty stake with felt resignation. The lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of sound → vision → acceptance tightens once. No orientation drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The sepia reading room’s “golden shadows” and the gramophone’s brass constrain Eleanor’s movements and echo the past; the bridge vision is spatially coherent. The crank handle itself becomes micro-setting that charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—uncovering the family’s downfall—is signaled early and deepens when the journal reveals internal betrayal. One tightening: knowledge replaces action, foreclosing revival. Cost is conceptual (legacy irredeemable) rather than visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of inheritance as burden emerges through sound-as-truth motif; the final renunciation avoids moralizing. Subtext in Eleanor’s silence after the bridge encounter carries the weight of acceptance without exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays close to Eleanor’s perceptual filter—“aged paper and forgotten dreams,” “standing waves of sound.” Rhythm modulates with scene pressure; no head-hopping. Distinct texture sustained.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and sensory, with only one soft loop (“golden shadows… sepia reading room”). Strong verbs (“tightened,” “traced,” “clutched”) keep momentum. Final paragraph avoids overwriting while crystallizing mood.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Sound-as-medium-of-truth is a fresh angle on the decaying-dynasty trope; the bridge of intuition as literal crossing is handled without cliché. Specificity of the crank handle as inherited key prevents generic feel.</comment>
