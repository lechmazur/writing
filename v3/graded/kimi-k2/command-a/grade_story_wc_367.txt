<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The Herald’s interiority is vivid—laughter as embodied barometer, micro-choice of grasping the wick—but the “accidentally prophetic” trait is asserted more than dramatized until the fog arrives, softening motivation clarity. Still, the final act of steering the beam carries visible cost and earns the shift from caretaker to gate-opener.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the green dawn reweights the entire premise, cost is felt in the Herald’s unending duty. Causal chain holds under a Hybrid lens—ritual causality plus pattern intensification—though the fog’s agency is slightly convenient.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The emerald lighthouse, glass walls, and star-canopy are rendered with selective sensory detail; the lantern room’s glass wick functions as micro-setting that constrains the final steering. Spatial choreography is clean, but the sea’s physics remain impressionistic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—ushering a new dawn—tightens when the beam veers; the Herald’s agency to steer against fog resistance supplies escalating pressure and visible cost. One clear tightening beat suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</question><comment>Theme of weaving past shadows into future light emerges organically through the Herald’s ritual and the green dawn’s conceptual repricing. No moralizing; resonance arises from the charged image rather than statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyric, consistent, and filtered through the Herald’s perceptual signature—laughter modulating from whimsy to awe. No head-hopping; diction stays within the elevated but plausible register of a mythic caretaker.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmic and image-dense; occasional stacked metaphors (“sword of light,” “shadowed elation”) flirt with overwriting but do not stall momentum. No loops or filter-verb clutter; final image lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lighthouse mythos with portal fantasy; the green dawn feels inevitable yet non-generic. Risky lyric escalation pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
