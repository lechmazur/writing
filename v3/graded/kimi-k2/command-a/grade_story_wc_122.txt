<comment>Elara’s interior contradiction and embodied choices (tracing broken needle→rigging reverse recorder) drive each step until the tear that charges the final stance. Motives intensify smoothly across beats. Cost is visible: she relinquishes numbness for raw ache—legible on the tear line. Some emotional shorthand “filament of hush” flirts with label-speak yet the embodied outcome holds it back.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the drumstick tap crystallizes new, precarious liveness. Causal beats (needle→method→tear→tap) follow a clear because/therefore without skips. Season rustle anchors early orientation; cavern torchlight remains spatially stable. Cost felt through tear and loss of protective silence. No teleporting props or retro-patches.</comment>

<comment>The drum maker’s cavern constrains resources: torch-lit stone, half-finished wood drum, and reversed vibration physics—all directly affect choices. Details filter through tactile POV bias (felt vibrations, smooth skin). No geographic drift; winter rustle outside signals temporal shift. Micro-setting (cavern walls) mirrors internal stasis and final awakening. Slight repetition in “dimly lit cavern” is minor.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—defeat emotional numbness—is signaled in para 2; pressure escalates from scepticism through painstaking reversal work to final cost trade-off. Reversal itself constitutes the meaningful tightening: no external coincidence; the backward music narrows options emotionally. Agency: Elara renounces numbness (final beat) rather than solves an external puzzle. Cost is embodied (raw tears) and irreversible. No secondary antagonist required at this length.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges non-didactically from method and outcome: silence as creative terrain, not prison. Backward songs reconfigure meaning: what was alien becomes revelatory. Final tapped drum converts meta-question into felt resonance. Avoids abstract theme statement or tidy moral—lives in the ambiguous hush space.</comment>

<comment>VOC maintains intimate third limited through tactile bias and rhythmic prose, never drifting from Elara’s sensorium. Phrase choice (“filament of hush,” “raw, aching aliveness”) is character-bound, not editorial. Compression and patterned repetition serve emotional crescendo without obscuring clarity. No POV slippage; sentence structure breathes with heartbeat pacing.</comment>

<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Sentences are propulsive, concrete, trimmed of scaffolding; rhythm accelerates as stakes sharpen. Metaphors precise—“phonograph needle like a relic”—and stay coherent. Occasional elevated phrasing “philosophies of vibration” drifts slightly above Elara plausible lexicon; deduction only −0.3. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn. Read-aloud cadence builds effectively.</comment>

<comment>Deaf musician reversing songs to hear by tactile resonance is non-obvious and organically executed. Rejection of cure narrative in favor of revalued silence avoids cliché. Fresh frame: numbness not deficit but shield reversed by the same means. Specificity (cavern acoustics, tactile reversal) grounds originality so it survives premise transplant test.</comment>
