<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation to silence “static” is vivid, but the interior contradiction—android nostalgia versus cold miniaturization—is dramatized more through labels than embodied micro-choice. The one beat where she steels herself by recalling roses works, yet deeper fragmentation lacks continuous pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>A clear Charged Poise at closure: miniaturizing fears reconfigures her identity at visible cost—“memories… felt distant.” Lens is Causal; the magnetic shift triggers the inciting beat and the causal chain leads directly to the renunciation of untainted nostalgia.</question>
<question>3</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The glass domed farm and pulsing wooden box supply tactile imagery and constrain Elara’s final protocol, passing the 9+ gate. Yet “desert rose farm” risks generic bloom-poetry when specificity of cultivar or glass tech could heighten stakes.</question>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>A single dominant stake is declared—save the farm from chaos—and pressure tightens through the miniaturization ordeal. Cost is felt in sacrificed memory, but escalation hinges on an internal static that is more told than concretely tested.</question>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</question>
<comment>Fragmented-self versus caretaker duty is thematically resonant, yet the closing sentiment that “she had found her resolution” borders on statement—the Conceptual Repricing lands better in the silence after final image than in the explicit line.</question>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Lyric compression (“fragile yet enduring nature”) risks ornamental drift, but prose rhythm modulates under crisis. POV stays locked and perceptual signature—“unnecessary breath”—keeps voice distinct without head-hopping.</question>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</question>
<comment>Minor paraphrase loops (e.g., “strange,” “strangely organic”) dull density mid-scene. Information per sentence is high and closure image is clean, so artifacts remain under the −0.3 threshold.</question>

<grade>7.7</question>
<comment>Nostalgic android caretaker at the day of magnetic reversal is fresh, miniaturizing fears a sly twist on Pandora. The synthesis feels inevitable; risk-taking serves stakes without obscuring clarity.</question>
