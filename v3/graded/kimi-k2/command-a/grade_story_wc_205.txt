<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—her contradictory impulses (redemption vs. lingering shame) are dramatized in the Hall of Reflections beat. The shard as talisman and lens is embodied, not ornamental. Yet the “burnished sorrow” label in the final paragraph edges into diagnostic shorthand, blunting the cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the holographic record reweights the premise and forces Empiricist concession. Causal chain holds—storm → shard → visions → evidence—under an Accumulative/Textural lens. One minor ellipsis: how she breaches the sealed Hall is elided, but the gap doesn’t rupture closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid is rendered in selective, POV-filtered strokes; the shard and Hall function as micro-settings that constrain choice. Light-storm as temporal medium is taught early and pays off. Final image of shard in pocket recharges setting with felt cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove temporal plasticity—tightens once when Elara risks trespass to obtain the hologram. Cost is visible: reputational ruin crystallizes into bittersweet triumph. Agency drives escalation; coincidence complicates (storm timing) but does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of reimagining emerges from concrete events (cities reshaping, histories altered) rather than assertion. Final whispered poem offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. One soft echo: “reimagine” appears twice in exposition, slightly diluting subtext.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet disciplined; perceptual signature (poet-scholar noticing light, facets, rainbows) remains consistent. No dialogue, so no voice leakage. Compression in storm sequence is taught and paid off. Occasional elevated diction (“luminescence,” “ethereal radiance”) fits Elara’s lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; figurative language is patterned and purposeful. One paraphrase loop—“visions flooded her mind… visions etched into the shard”—dulls momentum slightly. Otherwise clean, with rhythmic variation under pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Temporal plasticity as archaeological premise feels fresh; the shard-as-lens and light-storm archive avoid stock tropes. Specificity of “covering mirrors during storms” ritual is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
