<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is clear and embodied, but interiority drifts into generic “vanishing arts” rhetoric; the final choice to “sing to listen” is earned yet its cost is stated more than felt. No contradictory impulses are dramatized on the page; the rosette functions as talisman rather than crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Single-scene arc holds under Accumulative/Textural lens; the rosette’s glow and swelling choir create a resonant reconfiguration of the library’s silence. Closure lands with conceptual cost—the space is now “living cathedral”—but the causal linkage between humming and audience transformation is compressed rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Velvet library is vividly anchored early; autumn light and parchment scent filter through POV bias. The rosette as micro-setting constrains the final image, glowing under soft light to charge the choral moment. Spatial choreography remains coherent; no white-room drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reclaiming vanishing arts—tightens via subtraction of noise; pressure grows as choir dwindles then swells. One meaningful deepening occurs when humming replaces speech, narrowing options to pure sound. Cost is implied rather than viscerally paid on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</question><comment>Theme of harmony-through-subtraction emerges from choral praxis rather than statement; the rosette’s shift from loss to beacon offers resonant reweighting. Final silence after applause carries non-literal answer to “unlearning hatred.” Avoids overt moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</question><comment>Third-person limited remains stable; diction is lyrical yet controlled, matching Elara’s musical sensibility. No dialogue present; narrative voice modulates with emotional intensity. Filter verbs are minimal; perceptual signature is consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</question><comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; figurative language is selective. Occasional elevated phrasing (“traveled stillness”) risks register drift but remains within lyrical contract. No loops or scaffold detected; final image crystallizes without clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</question><comment>Familiar premise of art saving souls is refreshed by the subtraction method and the rosette’s micro-setting role. Specificity of choral technique and library acoustics lifts the trope. No close echoes; synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
