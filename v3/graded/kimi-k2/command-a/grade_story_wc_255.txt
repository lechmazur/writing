<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is vivid—his colorblindness reframed as “lens” and plant-craft as language—but the shift from limitation to acceptance is summarized rather than dramatized in a single decisive beat, softening the felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the concertina’s song reconfigures Elias’s stance toward beauty, with the glassblower’s spoken validation sealing the cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of barter → music → image—but the final beat leans on dialogue rather than embodied action.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Shards “glint like captured rainbows,” furnace hum and leaf-whisper create tactile micro-setting; the courtyard’s glass and plants actively constrain Elias’s choices (ivy bouquet for kiln stories, fern-notes for music plea), charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding beauty without color—tightens when the reed tongue awakens and Elias must decide how to wield its song; the trade-off (plant message vs. direct play) crystallizes the cost, though escalation is more lyrical than causal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of imperfection-as-beauty emerges through Elias’s plant-barter and monochrome canvas; final image of “depth without color” reweights earlier motifs without moralizing, though subtext could dig deeper into the ethics of his cunning trades.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice is painterly and plant-attuned (“symphony of grays,” “leaves rustling in a language”), consistent POV; slight drift into editorial summary (“he began to see”) tempers immediacy but cadence holds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is lush yet disciplined; metaphors serve atmosphere without clutter. One scaffold loop (“beauty in imperfection” restated) and a filter-heavy clause (“he often wondered”) keep it from the 8.5 tier.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Colorblind painter who “speaks” through plant arrangements while bartering for awakenings is a fresh synthesis; concertina reed tongue as synesthetic bridge feels inevitable yet non-derivative, though the phoenix timeframe remains ornamental.</comment>
