<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Eli’s walk-recognition gift is embodied once (recognizing Mira) and motivates the final stance, but interiority drifts into summary (“loneliness that permeated”) rather than contradictory impulse. Mira’s desperation is gestured, not dramatized; her shift from taunt to respect feels asserted. The earned cost—accepting Mira’s dare—lands, yet Eli’s flaw (isolation) is not visibly compounded before resolution.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the key-turn reweights the premise that “whispers hold power,” with the labyrinth’s groan as felt cost. Causal chain holds: coin → map → key → lock. One minor causality wobble: the map’s “shifting ink” is never exploited after introduction. Orientation is clear by 120 words; no lens ambiguity at end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The container labyrinth is tactile—salt, rust, groaning metal—and constrains every move; the storm’s magnetic pulse is woven into the walls’ tremor. Micro-setting (key warming in pocket) charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions. Environment earns its place in the 9-band gate but lacks a final, choice-altering detail to push higher.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“prove subtlety outlasts force”—is signaled early and tightened when Mira demands proof. The key-turn is the single decisive escalation; cost is the labyrinth’s possible collapse and Eli’s acceptance of Mira’s presence. Agency is clear; coincidence (finding matching lock) complicates rather than resolves. One more beat of visible forfeiture would lift it to 8.2+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of quiet persistence emerges through action and image, not statement. The final line risks thematic echo (“whispers held power”) but is saved by its placement as earned reconfiguration. Subtext in Mira’s shifting walk is effective. Avoids tidy moral yet edges close to platitude; ambiguity is present but not deeply charged.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays anchored to Eli’s perceptual bias; sensory filtering is consistent. Rhythm modulates with pressure—short clauses during storm peaks. Dialogue is sparse but carries subtext (“Prove it”). No head-hopping; register stable. Distinct texture in phrases like “calculated spontaneity,” though one or two lines flirt with writerly flourish.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, with high information density; sentences advance plot or atmosphere. Occasional filter verbs (“they felt”) and one mixed metaphor (“weight of the moment pressing”) slightly dull immediacy. No loops or scaffold in peak beats. Clean grammar; spatial tracking precise. Final image crystallizes without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Container-labyrinth as living maze is fresh; geomagnetic storm as pressure engine is non-obvious. Walk-recognition gift is specific and tied to theme. Avoids stock quest tropes by making the goal a stance rather than treasure. Risk-taking is moderate; synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight but not radically daring.</comment>
