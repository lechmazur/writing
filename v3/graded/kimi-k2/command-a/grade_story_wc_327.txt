<comment>Lira’s urgent need is vivid, copper veins visually reinforcing the toll. Interiority is concrete: trembling hands, blurring vision, every line of song draining life. Micro-choice—she keeps singing despite physical collapse—reveals language > life hierarchy. Cost is embodied: diamond explodes, she collapses, stakes exacted on the page.</comment>

<comment>The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Lira’s renunciation of safety saves the language but shatters the diamond and nearly herself, cost paid in body and artifact. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—each echo layers texture until the pattern breaks with felt consequence. One minor lag: the “tunnel of echoes” anchor could arrive ~40 wds sooner, causing a −0.3 orientation slip, balanced by strong image payoff.</comment>

<comment>Bone towers, luminescent moss, and copper-veined skin create tactile specificity that pressures her dwindling stamina. The setting itself—echoing marrow walls—supplies the sonic resource she cannibalizes, making environment instrumental to choice. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly as sound wraps the canyon, then towers tremble. Setting charges the final image: dawn softens bone edges, towers now “keepers” of saved language.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Stakes “save dying language” are clear early; tension coils around each phrase translated. The tightening beat comes when singing saps her strength—she must decide: continue until death or stop and fail. She chooses endurance; the price is collapse and diamond destruction. The arc earns its closure without outside rescue.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</question>
<comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: preservation versus self-preservation. Subtext lives in the shuddering canyon and fracturing gem rather than stated aphorisms. The final image—bird flight echoing forever—doesn’t moralize, yet reweights the cost. A faint slip: “to ensure that the stories… would never fade” veers toward echo-statement, causing –0.2 detraction within the paragraph.</comment>

<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person close stays inside Lira’s perceptions; sentence length compresses under duress, matching ragged breathing. Diction is textured but never purple—“jagged facets catching the faint glow” shows specificity without overwriting. Occasional filter phrase “she felt” appears once late, a barely audible scratch.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Prose pulses: “coalesce, forming words, phrases” mirrors sonic accumulation. Rhythm varies—“quietly articulate… hummed weaving in and out”—breathless when stakes peak. One metaphor run (“jagged teeth… bone towers”) repeats with deliberate escalation; clarity never breaks. Clean copy, no loops.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Texture-to-sound translation is fresh, executed through canyon echoes and bird flock telemetry rather than gimmick. Traditional quest bones are reshaped by the bodily cost and metallic anatomy. Risk pays off: diamond as flawed language conduit feels inevitable only after fracture. Transformation satisfies hindsight check.</comment>
