<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“eyes glowed faintly”), but her contradictory impulses remain mostly summarized; the final choice feels foreshadowed rather than earned by prior micro-choices. No visible cost is dramatized on the page at the moment of closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (fountains awaken, city reclaims memory) with conceptual cost. Causal linkage is present but lightly sketched; the breadcrumbs function more as Accumulative/Textural pattern than because/therefore chain. Orientation is clear within 120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>“City of forgotten fountains” is evoked with selective sensory detail; the dried basin and cracked clock tower constrain Elara’s path. The final fountain’s reawakening charges the closure image, satisfying the 9+ gate for environment constraining choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><grade>Dominant stake—“liberate trapped memories”—is signaled early. Escalation occurs via breadcrumb density and city reanimation, but the tightening beat (placing the final shard) is narrated rather than dramatized; cost is implied, not felt on the page.</grade>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of memory-as-catalyst emerges organically from the box and fountains; no explicit moralizing. The final image reweights the premise without stating a thesis, but the conceptual cost remains slightly abstract.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet controlled; perceptual signature is consistent (“sidereal patience,” “defiant hush”). No dialogue to evaluate; POV remains stable. Compression and patterned elision are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic; occasional ornamental phrases (“liquid starlight”) flirt with overwriting but do not stall momentum. No loops or scaffold detected. Sentence variety supports scene needs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Familiar quest structure is refreshed by the memory-fountain conceit and sidereal patience motif. The synthesis feels specific to this voice, though the breadcrumb trail and box of memories remain recognizable tropes.</comment>
