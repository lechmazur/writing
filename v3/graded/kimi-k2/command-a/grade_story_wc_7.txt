<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is specific and embodied—her fingers brushing soil, the warmth of the fruit—but the “taste memories” gift is asserted rather than dramatized; no contradictory impulse is shown in scene. The pruning micro-choice is clean and forecloses fear, yet the grandmother’s wisdom is paraphrased, not tested under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Single-scene, causal lens holds: seed planted → growth → fruit → bite. Closure lands as earned conceptual reconfiguration—world reweighted by shared memories—with visible cost (her solitude in the greenhouse). Orientation is immediate; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rusted greenhouse is tactile and constrains movement; vines block, beams creak, rain scent presses urgency. Final image of cleaned, glowing structure recharges the decay-to-renewal arc. Micro-setting (seed pot) functions as charged object.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“gentle rebellion against indifference”—is signaled early and tightened when Elara chooses to prune debris instead of flee doubt. Cost is felt: she stays alone through dawn, staking her time and safety on the fruit’s promise.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: nurturing vs. forgetting, beauty from ruin. Final bite reframes prior decay without moralizing. Subtext in pruning: shaping self and world. Resonant, non-literal payoff.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays close to Elara’s sensorium; perceptual signature is culinary and tactile. Rhythm modulates with scene tension—longer cadences for memory, clipped for sprouting. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, vivid, propulsive; only minor filter verbs (“she felt”) and one stock phrase (“glow of a thousand moons”) slightly dull peak beats. No loops or scaffolding obscure closure.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Memory-tasting chef growing wisdom fruit in a ruined greenhouse is a fresh synthesis. Transformation test passes: story would collapse without these specifics. Gentle rebellion angle avoids didacticism, though concept of “synaptic plasticity” feels grafted rather than organic.</comment>
