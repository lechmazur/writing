<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Zara’s grief and drive are embodied in tactile detail (ash-scented dress, crystal touch), but interiority drifts toward abstract “potential pools” and “unfiltered awakening” rather than contradictory impulses in scene. The final stance crystallizes with cost—she accepts being reshaped—but the turn is more declared than dramatized through micro-choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: drone-strike rupture → observatory drift → crystal epiphany → earned stasis. Closure lands as Charged Poise: “she was no longer just a survivor—she was a seeker.” Cost is felt in the tattered dress and the irrevocable loss it signifies. Orientation is clear by line 3; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The floating observatory’s electromagnetic hum and geode-lined walls are vivid, selective, and mirrored in Zara’s fractured psyche. The geode itself becomes micro-setting that constrains her final insight. Spatial choreography is coherent; no white-room syndrome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—finding usable potential after annihilation—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once: from passive observation to active “hunt” for pattern in chaos. The cost is the irrevocable loss of her former self, legible in the dress and the silence after the breakers click back on.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Theme of resilience-through-fracture emerges organically from geode metaphor and embodied grief. Final image reframes prior motifs without moralizing. Subtext is present but occasionally over-articulated (“the hunt was not just about finding answers but about embracing the process”).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet grounded in sensory specificity; POV remains tight and consistent. Syntax modulates with emotional pressure. No dialogue, so no voice leakage. Occasional elevated diction (“bleak exhilaration”) feels earned by context.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and propulsive. Minor scaffold: “a place where the sky seemed closer, where the stars whispered secrets” could trim one clause. No mixed metaphors or loops. Density is high; every sentence advances atmosphere or insight.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Familiar trauma-to-transcendence arc is refreshed by geode-as-self metaphor and floating observatory setting. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk is moderate; no gimmicks, but also no radical formal departure.</comment>
