<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“hands that were both precise and tender”), but the forgiveness arc is told rather than dramatized; the final smile feels slightly unearned because the prior regret is only summarized. Micro-choices under pressure are present (re-weaving the rope) and align with her stated motive.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the melody of forgotten names returns, re-weighting the premise with felt cost (“she found her own name among the forgotten”). Causality is Accumulative/Textural; the rope’s glow and song arrive as pattern culmination rather than linear trigger, but the lens holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The icebound sanctum, aurora, and ceremonial rope are rendered with selective sensory detail that constrains action (cold limits dexterity, rope’s mythic weight guides re-weaving). The aurora’s final flare charges the closure image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve forgotten names—is signaled early and tightened through the rope reconfiguration; the cost is the emotional exposure of hearing one’s own lost name. One meaningful deepening suffices for length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of memory as bridge rather than archive emerges organically from the melody’s return; no moralizing. The final image of Elara hearing her own name offers a non-literal answer that reweights the premise without statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet controlled; diction (“snowmelt ardor,” “cathedral of ice”) remains within Elara’s perceptual signature. No head-hopping; free-indirect style is consistent. Rhythm modulates with emotional intensity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is selective and pattern-taught early (“rope…intertwined with threads of history”). Final third is clean; no artifacts touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: lost-wax casting + street-organ punch card + mythic rope creates a non-obvious memory ritual. Aurora as living chorus is a bold risk that heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specificity anchors the fantastical.</comment>
