<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Alaric’s interiority is vivid—armor as burden, parchment as talisman—but the shift from passive observer to “storyteller” is asserted more than dramatized; the single micro-choice (unsnapping gauntlet) is elegant yet too light to bear the full weight of claimed transformation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory pulse and vine pattern thickens atmosphere until the final image reconfigures meaning. Closure is a Charged Poise—the marionette without strings—whose cost is felt in the vanished program and the knight’s new, uncertain stance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Greenhouse is rendered with selective, synesthetic density; bioluminescent vines double as instruction and mirror, constraining Alaric’s final gesture. The “endless night” outside remains abstract, but the micro-setting of vines and gravel path is tactile and choice-shaping.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“to capture the shape of possibility”—is signaled early and tightened by the accelerating vine patterns; the unsnapping beat narrows options from passive witness to active participant. Cost is conceptual (loss of old identity) but legible in the vanished program.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of agency versus determinism emerges through the marionette motif and vine choreography; final image of the stringless puppet offers resonant, non-moralizing answer. Subtext is carried in gesture and light, avoiding overt thesis statements.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet disciplined, with controlled psychic distance and rhythmic variation that matches the greenhouse’s pulse. No dialogue, but perceptual signature is consistent: Alaric’s noticing is filtered through scarred, story-starved attention.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; occasional elevated diction (“shivering bliss,” “conceptual repricing”) skirts purple but stays within POV’s wounded grandeur. One paraphrase loop (“patterns…patterns”) is minor; no artifacts touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Familiar knight-redemption arc is refreshed by alchemical greenhouse and marionette metaphysics; the synthesis feels inevitable rather than gimmicky. Specificity of bioluminescent vines as instruction manual is the fresh inflection.</comment>
