<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—her calloused fingers itch, the bowl’s warmth pulses—but her contradictory impulses (fear of the hush vs. need to fill it) are stated rather than dramatized in scene. The final choice to speak is credible yet feels lightly earned; the cost is poetic rather than embodied. No secondary character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A. Overall, a strong single-POV portrait with minor under-dramatized tension.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the hush is reconfigured from void to canvas, with the bowl left as guardian. Causality is Accumulative/Textural—each musical phrase thickens the texture until silence itself flips meaning. Orientation is clear by line 4. Cost is felt but abstract; a hairline slip from full embodiment keeps it under 8.8.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The greenhouse, shipwrecks, and bowl form a micro-setting that constrains Elara’s posture and acoustics; fractured glass catches light that later mirrors the final “dance of reflections.” Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered. The orchard’s sunken state subtly guides her decision to kneel. Meets 9+ gate but lacks a final physical constraint, capping at 8.1.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—filling the hush with meaning—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening: the bowl’s weight forces her from playing to speaking. Cost is conceptual (bearing memories) rather than visceral; still, agency drives the turn. Coincidence absent; escalation coherent under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of beauty in imperfection emerges through image (charred greenhouse, scarred violin) rather than statement. The bowl’s shift from relic to “brush” reweights the motif without moralizing. Subtext resides in the creaking shipwrecks listening. Final resonance is earned, though slightly abstract.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise—“weathered and scarred” violin, “chronic hush” as sentient. Rhythm modulates with scene pressure; no head-hopping. Compression is purposeful; no experimental drift. Distinct perceptual signature sustained.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, vivid, and propulsive; only minor loops (“as if” twice in one paragraph) and one stock phrase (“deep slumber”) mar it. No mixed metaphors or register drift. High information density maintained.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: post-fire greenhouse as echo-harbor stage, storytelling bowl as musical mute. Tropes transformed through acoustic specificity. Risk is moderate; payoff coherent. Avoids gimmickry.</comment>
