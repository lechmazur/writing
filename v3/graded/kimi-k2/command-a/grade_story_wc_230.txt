<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s interior contradiction—rational discipline vs. the eye’s forced honesty—drives every beat; the orchard’s weight and the final relinquishment carry felt cost. Motivation (psychological safety) is embodied in tactile choices, not labels. Minor slip: Mara’s brief exposition softens the crucible moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: eye found → truth compulsion → ritual return → restored safety. Closure (returning the eye at dawn with recitation) is on-page, decisive, and costs Elias his involuntary honesty. Orientation is swift; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The hanging orchard’s damp rot and storm-scarred branches constrain movement and mood; the glass eye’s shifting colors mirror Elias’s loss of control. Final image of soil and truffle re-anchors the place as refuge. Could edge higher if orchard itself altered tactics more overtly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—control over self-truth—tightens once the eye compels speech; returning it at dawn narrows options to renunciation. Cost is the relinquishment of a potent (if dangerous) tool. Pressure is coherent but single-cycle; no secondary reversal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of chosen vs. forced truth emerges organically from Elias’s ordeal; the orchard’s “fractured grace” reweights from menace to earned safety without moralizing. Final smile amid soil is understated resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice is calm, sensory, and truffle-specific; free indirect style stays consistent. Compression in ritual recitation is purposeful. Dialogue with Mara is brief but tonally distinct; no head-hop.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and rhythmic; sensory verbs (“brushing,” “cradled,” “exhale”) advance scene. No loops or mixed metaphors. Occasional elevated diction (“psychological safety”) is justified by Elias’s rational lens.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Fusion of post-empathy-virus trauma with antique relic horror feels fresh; orchard-as-hiding-place trope is grounded in truffle ecology. The eye’s curse is familiar, but its link to forced honesty gives new bite. No close echoes.</comment>
