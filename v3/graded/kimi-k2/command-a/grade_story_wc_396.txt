<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is stated early and reiterated, but interiority remains abstract; “shadow-laced” is label-only, never embodied. The decisive act of reconstitution is motivated by stated mission rather than dramatized contradiction. Micro-choices in the mirrors are observational, not pressured. Earned stasis is present but cost is generalized rather than visceral.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the restored crystal becomes beacon of unity with visible light spread. Causal chain is linear—fragment summons shards, Elara places orb—yet the “how” of shard attraction is asserted not dramatized. Orientation is clear within 120 words. Drive lens is Causal; one tightening suffices.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Lighthouse orchard and ice floes are anchored early; salt-apple scent and creaking floorboards ground place. Mirrors act as micro-setting that constrains knowledge acquisition. Final beacon light recharges the orchard image. Detail is selective; no object or terrain actively limits Elara’s physical choices, capping at 7.4.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—mending fractured souls via empathy—is declared, not tested under rising pressure. Mirrors provide deepening knowledge but no narrowing of options; no tangible cost is dramatized until the light spreads. Escalation is informational, not causal. Agency is present but consequence remains abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of empathy-as-action emerges through the crystal’s restoration rather than authorial statement. Subtext operates in mirror visions of past mediators. Final image reweights earlier orchard description without moralizing. Complexity is modest; ambiguity is present but not sharply charged.</comment>

<grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays close to Elara; perceptual signature is calm, intuitive, slightly lyrical. Syntax is controlled, with rhythmic variation. No dialogue to judge. Voice remains consistent; occasional elevated diction (“otherworldly energy,” “conceptual repricing”) slightly exceeds character lexicon but does not rupture.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, with vivid sensory anchors and no loops. Density is good; sentences advance image or motive. Figurative language is restrained; mixed metaphor “ancient eyes” is minor. No artifacts in closure beat. Occasional filler (“she knew what she had to do”) keeps score from 7.5+.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Combines lighthouse, orchard, vintage mirrors, and crystal fragments in fresh synthesis. Past-warrior anomaly is less transformed, leaning archetypal. Specificity of salt-apple scent and ice floes lifts the frame above template. Risk is moderate; execution coherent.</comment>
