<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is textured—her tactile grounding with the drawer pull and moon-phase fixation reveal a consistent, thoughtful persona—but Kael remains a cipher; the final concession feels more symbolic than earned from visible internal struggle on his part.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the passing of the drawer pull crystallizes a fragile new stance. Causality is situational—pressure builds through dialogue and weather rather than because/therefore chains—yet the final image reweights the premise with felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The parapet’s storm and mist are vivid, selective, and purposeful; the wind’s bite and shifting visibility physically constrain the negotiation, while the moon’s hidden presence charges the final promise. Spatial anchors are clear and consistent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—breaking the cycle of blame—is signaled early and tightened through the dialogue’s micro-turn: Kael’s refusal → tentative acceptance. The cost is the mutual vulnerability of the handshake over the drawer pull.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The theme of recycling mistakes into wisdom emerges organically from the drawer pull’s history and the moon’s waning symbolism, avoiding overt moralizing. The final image of shared custody of the past offers quiet resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s perceptual signature—selective attention to brass etchings, lunar rhythms, and wind-borne mist—is distinct and consistent. Dialogue is spare yet subtext-laden; Kael’s terse cadence contrasts effectively with Elara’s measured lyricism.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical yet disciplined: strong verbs (“shrouded,” “untether”), rhythmic variation, and minimal scaffold. Occasional elevated phrasing (“furrowed hush,” “conceptual repricing”) stays within Elara’s reflective register and never muddies causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The moon-phase negotiation method and the drawer pull’s recycled history offer a fresh synthesis of fantasy diplomacy and tactile symbolism. The risk of a quiet, talk-driven climax pays off by grounding grandeur in intimate gesture.</comment>
