<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Leeward’s interiority is vivid—bare feet on driftwood, mallet “warm, alive”—but his contradictory impulses (restlessness vs. harmony) are stated rather than dramatized in scene. The final renunciation of restlessness is earned by the musical sequence, yet the cost is more atmospheric than embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the final chord stills sea and orchard, reweighting the premise that chaos can be tuned. Causal chain holds—each strike alters cloud patterns—though the driftwood orchard’s physics remains lightly sketched.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The floating orchard is tactile—gnarled branches, creaking cellos—and the xylophone of driftwood/seashells constrains the only possible resolution. Micro-setting (mallet, shells) doubles as instrument and anchor, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—turn inner restlessness into harmony—is signaled early and tightened through each musical strike. One clear escalation: fractal clouds shift from threat to map, narrowing options to play or remain discordant. Cost is atmospheric rather than concrete.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of transformation-through-attention emerges organically from the musical act; no explicit moralizing. Final image of “restless euphony” reweights the opening restlessness into a charged poise without tidy resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise—“fractal, their edges sharp and intricate”—with rhythmic control that mirrors the musical beats. No head-hopping; perceptual signature stays rooted in Leeward’s synesthetic attention.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; figurative language serves the musical motif. One minor loop—“the orchard… the orchard”—but momentum never stalls. No artifacts near closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise of a floating orchard-oracle conducted by xylophone feels fresh yet inevitable; fractal clouds as score is a non-obvious synthesis. Risky lyric compression pays off in the final resonant image.</comment>
