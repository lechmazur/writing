<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her fingers “conversing with the art,” the warm pulse of the coin—but the decisive shift from certainty to curiosity is asserted more than dramatized; the garden’s final awakening feels gifted rather than earned through visible internal struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Single-scene structure holds; the mural’s harmonic activation is a clear Decisive Change with conceptual cost (loss of certainty). Causal linkage is light—why the coin awakens now is unexplained—but the closure image reconfigures stakes cleanly under an Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Sound-wave garden is tactile and selective: metallic flowers, humming frequencies, obsidian-eyed echo-woman. The setting constrains the climax—Elara must attune her voice to the garden’s pulse—charging the final image with earned resonance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (awaken garden vs. keep certainty) is signaled early and tightened once: Elara’s hum forecloses her prior methodical stance. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral, but legible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of art-as-reciprocal-awakening emerges through concrete action; the hobo nickel’s wink and the mural’s step-out dancers reweight the premise without moralizing. Final image—garden as living tapestry—offers resonant non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet controlled, with rhythmic modulation under pressure (“methodically playful” becomes fluid conducting). No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains Elara’s throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, vivid, and propulsive; only minor scaffold (“seemed to” used twice in one beat) and one mixed metaphor (“stories…thread in tapestry”) keep it from 8.5+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses sound-garden, living mural, and hobo-nickel oracle into an organic whole; the synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking (non-causal magic) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
