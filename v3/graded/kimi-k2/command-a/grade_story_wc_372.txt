<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her interiority remains abstract; the “gently meticulous” trait is stated rather than embodied in micro-choices. The slide’s transformation triggers urgency, yet her shift from archivist to conduit feels more declared than dramatized. No contradictory impulses are shown under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Single-scene structure holds; orientation is swift and the closure beat (slide re-inscribed, Elara’s purpose reconfigured) lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration. Causality is light—slide changes because she looks—but the lens (Accumulative/Textural) is taught early and honored. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>“Frozen library above the clouds” is vivid, selective, and mirrored in the biting air and crystalline shelves. The lantern slide itself becomes micro-setting that constrains choice when its frequencies spike. Final image of lantern bridging abyss charges closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“preserve vows before illusions fade”—is signaled early and tightened when the anomalous slide rewrites itself. Agency is reactive (slide acts on Elara) rather than proactive, but pressure coheres under Accumulative lens. Cost is conceptual: she must now “carry the light forward.”</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of preservation vs. transmission emerges through the slide’s changing inscription without overt statement. Subtext rests in the abyss-gazing figure and the re-weighted vow. Final image offers quiet resonance rather than moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited voice is stable, with perceptual signature in “quartz hush” and “luminous vows.” Syntax remains controlled and atmospheric; no head-hopping or register drift. Compression is purposeful and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; figurative language is selective. Occasional soft phrases (“gently meticulous care”) edge toward label-speak but do not obscure clarity. No loops or scaffold in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Premise of memory-lantern archive above the clouds is fresh; the slide that rewrites itself feels inevitable in hindsight. Familiar tropes (guardian of memory, message from past) are transformed through sensory specificity and conceptual closure. Risk is moderate but coherent.</comment>
