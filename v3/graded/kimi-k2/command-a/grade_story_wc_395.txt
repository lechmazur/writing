<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s arc from observer to seeker is cleanly dramatized through concrete micro-decisions (offline bypass, memorizing coordinates) with visible contradictions—fear vs curiosity. Motivation reframes at climax, foreclosing safety with Earned Stasis. Secondary pressure from the archive opens status dynamics in brief beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Causal lens sustained: lie → offline bypass → final coordinates. The numbers constitute a patterned signal that reweights meaning when decoded. Closure hinges on a Conceptual Repricing—void in the archive maps to void in the missing crew, felt cost legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Few paragraphs total, yet social-network archive creates tactile specificity via interface verbs (scrolled, decoded) and environmental pressure (system locks her out). Body-as-setting (headset, terminal) constrains stealth tactics. Sensory selection mirrors bias: canted metadata attention.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake is archive silence shedding light on silence of the disappeared; truth becomes a deadly commitment. Numbers escalate as coordinates delete, tightening choices. Agency forces offline bypass, real cost: data purged. Trade-off crystallizes in the final stride into unknown space.</comment>

<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the trinity: deleted data→deleted crew→deleted self if she risks disclosure. Subtext carried in absence rather than exposition. Closure image (empty coordinate) recalibrates meaning without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Distinct perceptual signature—algorithmic filtering, numeric fixation, decaying IDs. Voice remains coherent under lyric compression. Purposeful elision of security breach mechanics is taught early and lands in final transmission.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>High density without loop: micro-choices compress legal-memo syntax, leak tension. Rhythm accelerates as beats compress. Metaphor of “archive’s corners” earns its spike. Occasional technical register shifts tolerated under POV competence.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Synthesizes cold-case trope with social-media archaeology, transforming generic archive into Rosetta stone for cosmic abduction. Fresh hinge: numbers not as clues but as coordinates disclosing unknown destination. Quiet image risks push boundaries safely.</comment>
