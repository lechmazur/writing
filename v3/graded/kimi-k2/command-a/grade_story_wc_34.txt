<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is evocative—“driftingly alert,” “kinship with the ghost”—but her contradictory impulses are stated rather than dramatized in scene. The moment of choice (encoding the ghost) is rendered as intuitive choreography rather than a visible cost-bearing decision. Her flaw (feeling unheard) is asserted, not tested under pressure. Still, the embodied emotion and micro-choices around the bolt plate earn a solid mid-high band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the ghost steps into wholeness and dissolves, a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost—Elara’s solitude after the touch. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of lightning–thunder intervals, graffiti shifts, and bolt-plate hums tighten the weave. One causal link is weak: why the bolt plate is the “key” is asserted rather than earned. Orientation is swift; no drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The misty courtyard, storm light, and relic bolt plate are vivid and selective, filtering through Elara’s perceptual bias. The bolt plate becomes micro-setting that constrains her encoding action and charges the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent; weather actively paces the scene. Slight over-reliance on visual shimmer keeps it from the 9-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—freeing the ghost—is signaled early and tightened by the lightning–thunder clock. One deepening: graffiti morphs into sigils, narrowing options to the bolt-plate ritual. Cost is implied (loss of the ghost’s touch) but not dramatized as a trade-off. Agency is present but cushioned by intuition rather than hard choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme—giving voice to the voiceless—emerges organically from Elara’s act of encoding. Subtext resides in the ghost’s silence and the bolt plate’s mute relic status. Final image of stardust mist reweights prior motifs without moralizing. A touch of sentimental uplift (“true power of her gift”) slightly dilutes resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical, consistent, and POV-anchored; perceptual signature—“tinkersong wonder,” “faint glow of distant lightning”—is distinct. Syntax modulates with storm cadence. No dialogue to test. Occasional elevated diction (“transcended worlds”) nudges register drift but remains legible under lyric license.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is rhythmic and image-dense, with few redundancies. Some metaphor layering (“phantom of data,” “spectral presence”) edges toward purple but stays purposeful. No loops or scaffold. Final paragraph’s “stardust on the wind” risks cliché yet lands cleanly. High information density throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>The “ghost in code” trope is refreshed by grafting it onto a lute-toting cryptographer and relic bolt plate. Synthesis feels inevitable: data specter meets analog key. Risk is moderate—lyric fantasy within tech-mystic frame—but coherence never wavers. Could edge higher with sharper causal specificity for the bolt plate.</comment>
