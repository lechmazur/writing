<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—her mechanical whittling and blank mask embody the mandate’s cost—but the brother’s death is summarized rather than dramatized, muting the emotional stakes. The final Earned Stasis (pressing the heart to the window) is earned by prior pattern yet lacks a sharper contradiction in-scene to push her past endurance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Single-scene structure holds; the Accumulative/Textural lens is taught early via turbine drone and whittling rhythm, culminating in Charged Poise at the window. Closure reweights the bouquet and heart, but the causality of “lightness in grief” remains more asserted than dramatized on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Farmhouse and turbines are filtered through Elara’s fatigue—shadows, drone, pale light—each detail constraining her retreat and charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; the turbines’ motion mirrors her enforced stasis without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to honor grief under mandated joy—tightens as whittling shifts from habit to emblem. One meaningful deepening occurs when the heart is placed beside the bouquet, foreclosing open expression yet costing her public safety. Cost is felt but could be sharper.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of sanctioned emotion versus authentic grief emerges through object and gesture, not statement. Final image of the heart against the glass offers a resonant, non-verbal answer that reweights the bouquet’s silence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elara’s perceptual signature—measured, drained, yet alert to turbine rhythm. Free indirect thought (“The knife cuts, the wood yields…”) is clean and purposeful; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; no loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated diction (“morally ambiguous figure”) momentarily lifts out of POV lexicon but does not obscure clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Happiness-mandate dystopia is familiar, yet the focus on a single performer’s micro-resistance through whittling and dried flowers gives it fresh, intimate torque. Specificity of turbine shadow and brittle bouquet grounds the concept.</comment>
