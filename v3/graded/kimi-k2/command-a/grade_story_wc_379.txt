<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Clara’s thrift-store eye and listening impulse drive the mailbox investigation, but interiority skews thematic summary rather than knife-edge decision; final renunciation is earned yet emotionally broad.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Quiet causal spine—the locket key yields the letter which reframes stakes; mailbox setup pays off in the ending beat; orientation clean, lens (Causal) holds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Courtyard descriptions are vivid and selective; locket and mailbox function as micro-settings that alter tactics; jasmine breeze and golden light mirror search, not postcard scenery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Listening versus intrusion tightens once: Clara’s choice to open the box escalates the conflict; cost is felt but stakes plateau rather than surge.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme surfaces through quiet image—listening as healing—without pronouncement; final dawn-light silence reconfigures the courtyard’s meaning; complexity rewarded.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Village-story voice is distinct and consistent; Free-indirect snippets feel lived-in; Mrs. Ellis’s few lines carry distinct idiom standing against Clara’s reflective cadence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm propels; syntax breathes with pressure—some ornate abstraction dilutes urgency (“intrudes least” monologue) but no loops muddle final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Mailbox-mystery angle refreshes a familiar lost-letter device; locket key in design twist feels inevitable; no derivative echoes, slight risk but coherent.</comment>
