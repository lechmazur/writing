<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Eleanor’s interiority is vivid—her fingers tracing the nib, the ache of “orbits of regret”—but the final recalibration feels slightly under-motivated; we needed one more embodied beat of doubt or cost to earn the renunciation fully.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each discovery tightens the noose (misaligned scopes → notes → vanished journalist). Closure lands with the telescope re-aimed at stars—an Earned Stasis that visibly costs her safety and severs her old life.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The observatory’s brass, dust, and glass dome are selective and POV-filtered; the misaligned scopes physically constrain her choice to intervene. Final image of lens-to-stars recharges the opening “whispers of wind” with new weight.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth vs complicity—escalates cleanly: each piece of evidence raises the price. The tightening beat is her decision to recalibrate, foreclosing retreat; cost is legible in the vanishing journalist and her own exposure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of surveillance vs wonder emerges through concrete objects (scopes pointed down) rather than statement. Final re-aiming reframes the “orbits of regret” without moralizing—quiet, resonant, earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Voice is consistent, textured, and Eleanor-specific: “rosewood pen nib poised over a leather-bound journal” teaches cadence early. No head-hopping; perceptual signature sharp under pressure (“faint whispers of the wind”).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing”) momentarily drifts from POV lexicon but never muddies causality. No loops or mixed metaphors in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Familiar “abused observatory” premise is refreshed by the inversion of scopes spying earthward; the rosewood nib as both heirloom and tool gives specificity. Risk is moderate but coherent—no gimmicks, just tight reconfiguration.</comment>
