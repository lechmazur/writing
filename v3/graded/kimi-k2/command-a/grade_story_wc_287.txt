<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“her fingers brushing against the lockmaster’s tooth”), but the final beat of handing over the tooth feels slightly under-motivated—no prior contradiction or cost is dramatized. The “wistfully pragmatic” trait is shown through action, yet the lockmaster’s arrival and instant kinship compresses relational pressure into a single glance, softening the crucible effect.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the shared tooth crystallizes a new connection, reconfiguring both characters’ isolation. Causality is mostly situational—coincidence brings them together—but the moment is legible and the cost (vulnerability, foreclosed solitude) is felt. Orientation is clear within 120 words; no lens contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The luminous harbor is rendered with selective sensory detail (“lanterns strung along the docks,” “moonlight shimmered like a mirror”) that filters through Elara’s perception. The setting subtly guides her descent and frames the final tableau, though it never materially constrains choice—more atmospheric than tactical.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—alleviation of urban loneliness—surfaces early. Pressure tightens once when Elara decides to descend, but the escalation is gentle; the lockmaster’s arrival is external coincidence rather than earned complication. Cost is implied (opening to another person) yet not dramatized on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of “reflecting light into dark corners” emerges organically from gardening imagery and the lantern/tooth pairing. Subtext is carried in gesture and object rather than statement. Final image reframes the premise without moralizing, though the conceptual cost could be sharper.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet controlled, with rhythmic variation and a distinct perceptual signature (“quivering hush,” “protected vulnerability”). POV remains tightly anchored to Elara; no head-hop. Dialogue is spare and subtextual, though the lockmaster’s speech edges toward thematic exposition.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, vivid, and propulsive; figurative language is selective. Minor scaffold appears (“as if the world held its breath” twice), but it does not stall momentum or cloud closure. No mixed metaphors or register drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>The lockmaster’s bitting gauge tooth repurposed as talismanic connector is fresh, and the fire-escape garden is a specific, lived detail. Yet the encounter arc remains familiar—lonely souls finding mirror in stranger—so the synthesis feels gently novel rather than transformative.</comment>
