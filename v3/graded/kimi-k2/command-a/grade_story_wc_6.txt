<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—atonement vs. self-forgiveness—are embodied in the tactile grafting scene; the final renunciation of inherited guilt is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost in the sand-stained hands and the coin left behind.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the act of grafting reweights the premise from “scars must be erased” to “scars can sing.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds; each beat layers density until the final image crystallizes the new stance with felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Obsidian lagoon and black sand are not mere backdrop; their sterility constrains the grafting choice and the coin’s drilled hole literally channels the sand, charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective, urgent, and filtered through Elara’s fire-sharpened perception.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—proving scars can sing—tightens once when Elara risks the graft; the sterility of the sand raises the cost. One meaningful intensification suffices under Accumulative lens; no reversals required.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the grafting act and the coin’s foreign resilience; the final image of singing scars offers a resonant, non-moralizing answer. No thematic echo in final paragraph; ambiguity lingers without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded in Elara’s fire-hardened sensorium; perceptual signature is distinct (“kelp-drift peace,” “black sand clung…heavy and unforgiving”). No head-hopping; compression and patterned elision serve the Accumulative design and remain legible at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; figurative language is purposeful and never muddles causality. Minor scaffold in “her heart hardened…beneath the surface, there was a spark” is offset by immediate embodiment.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: arsonist’s daughter turned firefighter grafting life into volcanic sand with a traveler’s coin. Specificity of setting, object, and emotional calculus transforms familiar redemption arc into singular stance. Risk in lyric compression pays off at closure.</comment>
