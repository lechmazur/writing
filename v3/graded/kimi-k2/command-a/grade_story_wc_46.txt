<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lira’s vow against fire and her tactile ritual with the glass are vivid, but interiority drifts into summary (“she had sworn…”) rather than dramatized contradiction; the final choice to leave the grotto is gentle yet feels foregone, lacking a palpable new cost or internal rupture.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the glowing glass reframes her vow and the grotto’s moonlit aperture crystallizes the stake. Causality is Accumulative/Textural—each polishing stroke thickens atmosphere until the final image reweights the premise. One transition (grotto → village) is clean and earned.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The serpentine grotto’s mist, salt scent, and moss-light are selective and POV-filtered; the sea glass itself becomes micro-setting that constrains her polishing angle and later amplifies moonlight, directly shaping the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—share gentle starlight without fire—is signaled early and tightened through the polishing ritual; the mist’s thickening and moonbeam’s arrival create a single intensification that reweights options. Cost is atmospheric rather than visceral, nudging the ceiling.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of healing-through-fracture emerges organically from the glass’s journey; mother’s aphorism is the only overt statement but is anchored in tactile memory. Final image reframes “light without fire” as quiet resilience, avoiding moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays close to Lira’s sensory filter; diction is lyrical yet disciplined (“zephyr bloom of her spirit”). No dialogue, so voice coherence rests on rhythmic interiority and holds steady under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is fluid and read-aloud ready; occasional soft fillers (“seemed to hold”) and one paraphrase loop (“light that did not burn, a light that soothed”) slightly dull the edge, but no artifacts intrude on the closing cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>The star-watcher who polishes trauma into gentle luminescence feels fresh; the grotto as crucible and sea-glass as lens avoid genre clichés. Risk is modest—no structural daring—but specificity of craft and wound grounds the concept.</comment>
