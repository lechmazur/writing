<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Eli’s loneliness and “cultivated estrangement” are sketched with evocative interiority, but the pivot from emotional insulation to active bridge-builder is compressed into a single late beat; the glass disc functions more as plot key than character crucible, so the cost feels intellectual rather than visceral.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as a Resonant Reconfiguration—Eli’s phone call crystallizes his new stance—but the causal chain between hearing the melody and deciding to dial is slightly telescoped; one more on-page micro-choice would have tightened the turn.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The tunnel’s damp pulse and the fogged booth are sharply selective, and the glass disc’s shimmer under dim light becomes the micro-setting that constrains Eli’s final action; the environment is never mere backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—whether Eli will keep his emotional distance—escalates through each looping call and the rising insistence of the melody; the tightening is felt, though the price (loss of anonymity) is more implied than dramatized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>The theme of continuity versus closure emerges organically from the looping voices and the disc’s bridging power; the final line “I’m ready to begin” offers a resonant, non-moralizing reweighting of estrangement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>The prose carries a hushed, subterranean cadence that modulates with Eli’s growing unease; perceptual signature is consistent, and the lyric compression never obscures causality.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences are lean and rhythmic, with only minor filter-verb clusters (“seemed to echo”); no loops or scaffold intrude, and the final crystalline note lands with clean sonic precision.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>The premise of a forgotten tunnel operator translating ghost-loops into melody feels fresh, and the glass harmonica as time-key is a non-obvious synthesis; risk is present but not showy.</comment>
