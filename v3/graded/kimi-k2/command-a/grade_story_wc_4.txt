<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s grief-rooted mission is clear and embodied in her tactile handling of photographs; the interior contradiction between “collective healing” and private loss is present but stays summary-level, never crystallizing into a visible on-page cost or irreversible choice. The final stance—hope replacing weight—feels more declared than earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the story layers sensory detail and photograph-arrangement until the dusk image reweights the ruin as living monument. Closure is a Charged Poise (“quiet hope echoed”), but the cost is only implied, not felt on the page, keeping it just under the 9-band gate.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lavender scent, rusted iron, and creeping vines are vivid, selective, and filtered through Elara’s grief-tuned perception; the vines’ embrace of the factory in the final image constrains the reading of decay into resilience, satisfying the 9+ gate for environment charging closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transforming pain into shared memory—is signaled early; pressure deepens as photographs are laid out, but the tightening is gentle, more accumulation than irreversible trade-off. No visible price is exacted on the page, so escalation remains moderate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of collective healing emerges organically from Elara’s ritual with the photographs; the final image of vines embracing iron offers a resonant, non-moralizing answer. A slight drift toward explicit thesis in “masterpiece of collective healing” keeps it shy of 8.5.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited voice is consistent, with lyrical compression that matches Elara’s calm perceptiveness; sensory selection and metaphor (“factory ruins cradled by creeping vines”) are character-specific. No dialogue, so voice distinction bullet is N/A.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is fluid and read-aloud musical, with purposeful variation in sentence length; occasional soft filler (“seemed to whisper,” “felt like a balm”) slightly dulls density. No loops or mixed metaphors, but a few stock phrases keep it from the 9-band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>The “archivist healing ruined factory with photographs” premise is fresh, avoiding familiar post-industrial tropes by centering scent and color. Specificity of lavender against iron and the photograph arcs feels inevitable in hindsight, though the risk level is moderate.</comment>
