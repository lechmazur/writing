<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulse—wanting to be heard yet choosing silence—earns quiet charge through mid-scene choices (traces patterns, smiles at the “click”). Flaw of fading memory provides cost, but interiority occasionally slips toward therapeutic exposition, blunting friction enough to cap below 9+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: scene deepens density of gestures until pattern break—the camera “click” reverberates. Closure image (glowing lens in hand) is earned reconfiguration with felt cost: her energy gone, legacy crystallized. One soft ripple: causality of why the mute world suddenly “listens” left partly to inference, not on-page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Harbor moonlight refracts into micro-setting anchors—water stones, prisms on skin—tightening usable space around camera and body. Camera body itself constrains final gesture (“weight, history”) linking setting to closure. Sensory choices remain selective, no drift into postcard breadth.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—silence as language—introduced early and escalates via iterative mapping. One decisive tightening: impossible click creates on-page reweighting. Cost is legible (spent body), though external stakes (will anyone ever see the photograph?) remain ambient not viscerally threatened.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme that silence contains fullness emerges from gestural acts, not exposition. Final reprise of “alive silence” satisfies RR without explicit moral. Avoidance of direct thematic statement keeps score high, though final paragraph’s “I was here” edge feels slightly explanatory.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</question><comment>Elevated lyric texture—“shadow woven from starlight… refracted… prism”—reads character-specific, not overwritten. POV focalization consistent, no head-hops. Compression occasionally drifts toward lyrical boilerplate (repetitive “moonlight shimmer” stems) but never clutters closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm breathes appropriately under elegiac pressure; metaphors stay coherent. Minor synonym loop (“mapping silence” appears three times with only tonal variation) dulls edge slightly. Final line achieves echoing cadence without artifact intrusion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Non-literal invention—camera with no film capturing silence—feels fresh yet grounded in tactile object logic. Central synthesis turns abstract conceit into embodied ritual. Avoided gimmickry; premise stays integral to stakes. Small risk of echoing familiar “final click” trope dampens upper band.</comment>
