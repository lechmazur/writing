<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“fingers trembling,” “mind racing”), but her contradictory impulses remain under-dramatized; the final choice to carry the strip feels more symbolic than earned by prior micro-choices. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible not tested.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the film strip’s letters accumulate emotional density until the projector dies, reweighting the stake. Closure is a Charged Poise—Elara’s decision to take the strip crystallizes options with felt cost (“for the first time… purpose”). Orientation anchored by 120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The projection booth functions as micro-setting: dust, moonbeam, and sputtering projector constrain Elara’s sensory focus and guide her psychometry. Final image of the theater “humming with echoes” recharges earlier stillness, tying setting to closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“where unused love is stored”—is signaled early and deepens as letters merge. One tightening beat: projector halts, forcing Elara’s decision. Cost is conceptual (burden of untold stories) rather than visceral, but legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of unspoken love emerges organically from the letters’ specificity; no moralizing. Final image of the theater as “living thing” offers non-literal resonance, reweighting the premise without thesis statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Voice is consistent, lyrical, and filtered through Elara’s perceptual bias (“quiet energy,” “hushed thunder”). No dialogue; free-indirect style stays clean. Rhythm modulates with emotional intensity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is vivid and propulsive, but occasional soft fillers (“seemed to pulse,” “for the first time in a long while”) dull peak beats. No loops or mixed metaphors; minor register drift toward abstract “repository” label.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Premise of psychometric cinema archive feels fresh; goodbye letters as stored love is non-obvious synthesis. Risky lyric compression pays off in final image. No close echoes of famous scenes.</comment>
