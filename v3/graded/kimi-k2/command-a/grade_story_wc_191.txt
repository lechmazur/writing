<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lira’s “wisely adventurous” trait is dramatized through cautious mural-peeling and decisive ascent, but interiority stays surface-level; the final renunciation is earned yet cost is more asserted than embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: murals → mechanism → stairway → throne → renunciation. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing (“throne not meant for one”) with visible cost in forfeited power. Orientation is swift; no lens drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orchard, waterfall, cavern, and throne room are vividly sketched and filter through Lira’s urgency; the ruby flake’s glow and the spiral motif constrain choices. Yet no single environmental detail reconfigures the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—ascend before sunrise—tightens via mural clues and glowing flake; sunrise deadline is named but not felt as live pressure. One clear tightening beat (unlocking archway) narrows options with visible effort.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of collective wisdom over individual power emerges organically from murals and final renunciation; no explicit moralizing. Subtext in murals and ruby’s hum deepens resonance without overt statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays close to Lira’s sensory filter; diction is lush yet controlled, rhythm modulates with ascent. No dialogue, so voice coherence rests on consistent perceptual signature.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is vivid and propulsive, but occasional stacked modifiers (“colors shifted like a living mosaic”) verge on purple. No loops or scaffold; clarity intact at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Familiar quest arc is refreshed by collective-ownership twist and synesthetic orchard imagery; not radically novel, yet the synthesis feels inevitable and specific to this telling.</comment>
