<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her breath fogging the glass, her hand sketching fireflies—but the “landscape astrologer” label never constrains a choice or alters tactics; it remains ornamental. The burnt feather’s transformation from loss to acceptance is cleanly dramatized, yet the final dance feels slightly unearned because the facility’s alarms arrive as external coincidence rather than consequence of her flaw. Still, her contradictory impulses (stay/dance vs. flee) coexist in the same beat, satisfying the 9+ quick test at a lower register.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the escape-pod threshold crystallizes her new stance—belonging as rhythm carried forward—while the cracked domes and sunrise make the cost legible. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of light intensifies, cadence shifts from solitary to symphonic, and the final image reweights earlier motifs. Orientation is anchored early; no causality breaks. Minor deduction for the abrupt alarm intrusion that feels less “therefore” than “and-then.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The algae-coated viewport and bioluminescent currents are selective, sensory, and filtered through Elara’s stargazer bias; they guide her attention and later constrain the dance space. The facility’s decay subtly mirrors her internal erosion, charging the final image when sunrise pierces the cracks. Environment does not directly block escape, so it stops short of 9-band constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“rhythm of belonging”—is signaled early and tightens when the fireflies’ pulse syncs with her heartbeat, forcing the choice to dance one last time before fleeing. The cost is felt: the domes are failing, time is shrinking, and her endurance of that risk crystallizes stance. Escalation is single but sufficient under Accumulative lens; alarms complicate rather than resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: belonging as co-creation of rhythm rather than place. The burnt feather’s reweighting and the firefly tapestry offer non-literal resonance without moralizing. Final sunrise image reconfigures the premise—light reclaimed from loss—yet the insight remains slightly abstract, keeping it just below the 9-band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise—“stars trapped in a jar,” “shadowseam wonder”—with rhythmic modulation that accelerates under pressure. Perceptual signature is consistent: Elara notices light, pattern, and celestial echo. No POV leakage; experimental compression is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; sentences multitask without loops. Occasional elevated diction (“luminous respite,” “symphony”) skirts purple but stays within POV’s astrologer lexicon. One mixed metaphor—“monument to human ambition swallowed by the sea”—slightly blurs agency, preventing 9+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Forgotten underwater observatory + bioluminescent fireflies + star-mapping astrologer synthesizes into a fresh, non-obvious whole. The transformation of the burnt feather from loss to portable rhythm feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking (lyric dance in collapsing dome) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
