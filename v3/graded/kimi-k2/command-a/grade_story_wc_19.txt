<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s claustrophobia and yearning are embodied in her tight-chested climbs and doll-whispered dreams, but the interior contradiction between safety and freedom is summarized more than dramatized in scene; the final “never be the same” is asserted rather than shown through a concrete behavioral shift.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the inversion ends, the bunker’s hush is now intolerable, and the cost is the irreversible knowledge of true silence. Causal chain is tight—training → climb → taste → return—though the gravity rule is introduced late and accepted on faith.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The xenial trellis above clouds is sketched with crisp sensory economy; the vines’ fragility directly constrains Elara’s speed and the doll’s near-loss, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clean, but “xenial” remains decorative rather than experiential.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—escape the gilded hush—tightens once when the doll slips and Elara must choose retrieval over speed; the inversion clock supplies coherent pressure. Cost is felt in the final beat: the bunker can no longer hold her, though the price is more conceptual than visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of silence-as-freedom emerges organically from Elara’s embodied experience; the porcelain doll’s sprouting image reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext is present but leans on lyric assertion rather than gesture.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet anchored in Elara’s perceptual bias; selective sensory detail and rhythmic compression suit the accumulative/textural lens. Occasional elevated diction (“intangibly tangible”) edges toward register drift but remains consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; figurative language is purposeful. Minor scaffold in “silence was heavy… silence would be different” and a few stacked modifiers, but nothing that dulls the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The inversion-hour premise and silence-flavor conceit feel fresh; the porcelain doll’s sprouting is an earned, non-gimmicky reconfiguration. Risk is moderate—lyric speculative rather than radical—but specificity keeps it from cliché.</comment>
