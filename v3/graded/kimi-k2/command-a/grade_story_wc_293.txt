<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Bridge-Song’s curiosity and “sculpt possibility” motive are clear, but interiority stays abstract; the final choice to raise the fiddle feels externally prompted rather than earned through contradictory impulses. No embodied cost is shown—only a lifted instrument.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the glass flake resolves into a sanctuary map, reweighting the premise. Causality is light—discovery feels guided by landscape coincidence rather than driven choice—but the ending image reconfigures meaning with visible cost (the vanished hitchhiker).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Mountain pullout and clearing are sketched with selective sensory cues; the glass flake itself becomes micro-setting that constrains choice. Spatial choreography stays clean, though terrain is more backdrop than active obstacle.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—uncover what the hitchhiker sought—tightens once when the flake aligns with peaks. Pressure grows texturally rather than causally; agency is mostly interpretive. A felt cost is implied but not dramatized on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of liberation from fate emerges through the sanctuary reveal; subtext lives in the silent fiddle and shifting glass. The final melody offers quiet resonance without moralizing, though earlier “pixelated amnesty” leans toward label.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice is consistent, with rhythmic control and selective detail. No dialogue to test, but perceptual signature is distinct—fiddler’s synesthetic mapping of terrain as music. Compression is purposeful.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; figurative language is restrained. Minor scaffold in “soft, golden light” and “shimmering with fragmented images” but no loops or muddle in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: a wet-plate shard as living map, scaffold-wrap flutters as cipher. The sanctuary-as-amnesty concept feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risk is moderate; the piece commits fully to its lyric logic.</comment>
