<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elara embodies a quiet, focused archetype: horizon mapper fused with spiritual sculptor. Interiority stays concrete—tactile focus on frost-latticed light, pulse under cold iron—and her contradictions (urgency vs stillness) manifest only in summary rather than moment-to-moment beats under pressure, muting earned change. The renunciation on the viaduct is visible, but its emotional charge arrives in a single paragraph rather than through an escalating interior war.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Single arc traced with discipline: lake freezes → begins tracking → viaduct epiphany → spreads practice. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise: she refuses hurried motion, stakes crystallized). Transitions are legible; one soft causal leap (“whispers of her work” draws newcomers) is forgivable at this scale.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Basalt ridges, frost air that “crackled with restrained wildness,” and the magnetic viaduct’s glistening beams are vivid and specific. Setting constrains movement (cold limits pace, viaduct frames stasis) but stops short of shaping the final beat, keeping room under the 9 cap.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake is internal refinement: shift from inner rush to calm vigilance. One tightening is signaled—renouncing sprint for slow deliberate pace—but stakes are cerebral without pressing resource, personal, or external cost, so escalation feels quiet rather than narrowing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of “sculpting patience from impatience” arises through accumulated image and rhythm, not slogan. Moon-threads and iron hum teach stillness; final tableau crystallizes without preach. Minor echo of prompt language (“patient revolution”) is kept whispered, not shouted.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Third-limited lyric with consistent interior texture; perceptual focus on gleams, hums, silver paths feels character-particular. Syntax is fluid; occasional cadenced repetition (“softly purposeful steps… softly purposeful revolution”) edges deliberate choral echo rather than monotony.</comment>

<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Lines breathe in rhythmic cadence; metaphor stays internally coherent (“unyoke the chaos” kept literal under moon tracking). No loops or clutter; rare elevated diction (“unyoke,” “resonant”) feels voice-intentional rather than thesaurus drift.</comment>

<comment>Marrying geodesic skill of horizon mapping to Zen restraint feels fresh, yet the synthesis doesn’t push far beyond familiar nature-quest tropes. One inflection crystallizes: viaduct as both physical bridge and metaphorical fulcrum—a quiet, original linkage—but the surrounding strokes remain recognizable pastoral imagery.</comment>
