<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is precise—her “affectionate detachment” is embodied in the way she handles the petal and gauges Kael’s memory. The micro-choice to dissolve the petal while holding his grief shows contradictory impulses in scene. Cost is legible: she accepts the ache in her heart as the price of professional distance. One slip: “professionally thorough” is asserted more than dramatized beyond the satchel check.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the petal’s dissolution reweights the half-truth premise, leaving Elara with “quiet satisfaction” and a lingering ache. Causal chain holds—petal → memory → crafted emotion → transience acknowledged. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: density of scent, light, and static builds to the cadence shift. No orientation debt; amber grotto anchors by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The grotto’s mineral tang and molten-gold light filter every beat; the petal itself becomes micro-setting that constrains the final act. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—Elara notices static before sound. Final image of violet-orange dusk recharges the amber motif with conceptual cost. One minor drift: “metallic” scent is vivid but not tied to later choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—deliver joy without attachment—tightens when Elara realizes Kael’s half-truth fear. The decisive deepening is her choice to weave transience into the emotion, narrowing her own ethical path. Cost is felt in the “ache” and the empty pouch. Pressure is coherent under Accumulative lens; no external reversals needed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of half-truths emerges through action: the petal’s partial memory, the emotion’s partial joy, Elara’s partial empathy. Final dusk image offers non-literal answer—fleeting light as enduring imprint. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in “another story left untold.” One soft echo: “half truths were her currency” edges toward statement, but saved by placement mid-story.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is controlled, lyrical, and POV-locked; perceptual signature shows in “static electricity tingled across her skin” and the synesthetic handling of scent. Syntax modulates with pressure—long sentences for memory, clipped fragments at dissolution. No dialogue, so no voice leakage. Register stays within Elara’s plausible lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet clear; each sentence layers scent, light, or static into character motion. No loops or scaffold; “molten gold,” “bitter tang of loss” are precise. One mixed metaphor—“stones holding their breath”—but occurs pre-closure and fits lyric mode. Rhythm breathes with the beat of dissolution.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Premise of counterfeit emotions as tradable goods is fresh; the blotter petal as memory-key is specific and non-obvious. Transformation test passes—story would collapse without Elara’s exact occupation and tool. Risk is moderate; no gimmicks. Deduction for faint echo of “emotion dealer” trope from recent genre fiction, offset by sensory specificity.</comment>
