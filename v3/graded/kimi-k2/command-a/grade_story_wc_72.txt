<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Liora’s telepathy is embodied through concrete thought-threading beats; Elara’s interiority shows fragile certainty colliding with doubt. The final renunciation—testing the serum instead of rushing home—earns its cost via prior telepathic warning. Minor slip: Elara’s “frantic” label is summary, not embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: Liora’s warning → Elara’s hesitation → revised plan. Closure is Earned Stasis: Elara chooses caution, paying with time and risk. Cost is legible in “weeks later” gratitude tempered by earlier fragility. One micro-turn suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Underwater garden is sketched with selective sensory strokes—“murky depths,” “crumbling stone fountains”—that ground the scene without cataloguing. The ampoule’s glow and thin glass become micro-setting objects that constrain choice. Could use one more tactile detail of water pressure to hit 8+.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: serum’s fragility vs. village lives. Pressure tightens when Liora exposes the glass weakness, forcing Elara to trade speed for safety. Cost is visible in delayed cure and personal doubt. One clear escalation beat meets scope.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of nuanced certainty emerges through action: the ampoule’s dual nature and Elara’s recalibration. Final image—empty ampoule buried—reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext in Liora’s silence after the warning deepens resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is consistent, lyrical but controlled; “incisively kind” is shown via Liora’s gentle telepathic intrusion. No POV drift; Elara’s perceptions remain anchored. Occasional elevated diction (“otherworldly light”) slightly lifts out of Elara’s likely lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and propulsive; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful—“tapestry of whispers” fits Liora’s mode. One mixed metaphor (“certainty fracturing like ancient stones”) is minor.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Forgotten telepathic statue guiding a diver via fragile foxglove serum is a fresh synthesis. The reversal—stillness animating action—feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk is quiet but coherent; no gimmicks.</comment>
