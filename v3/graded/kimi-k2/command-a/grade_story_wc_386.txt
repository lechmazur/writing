<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—her pulse, her breath, the tremor in her chest—but her contradictory impulses remain implied rather than dramatized in scene; the final whispered naming is earned yet the cost feels gentle rather than searing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the globe clears, the names are spoken, and the past is re-weighted with felt cost under an Accumulative/Textural lens; causality holds cleanly across dream shards and shrine beats.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The shrine’s ice walls, candle flames, and the cracked snow globe itself constrain Elara’s ritual choices; the micro-setting charges the final image when the globe momentarily clears, anchoring the emotional payoff.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>One dominant stake—salvaging the family’s memory—tightens through each dream fragment; the deepening is steady but the visible price (time, cold, emotional toll) is more implied than viscerally felt on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: the ethics of remembrance and the fragility of preserved love; the melted globe’s brief clearing offers a resonant, non-moralizing answer that reweights earlier images without overt statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet disciplined, with a distinct perceptual signature—shadows, borrowed starlight, crystalline walls—held cleanly in third-person limited; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and rhythmic; occasional softeners (“seemed to hold its breath”) are rare and do not obscure clarity; no loops or scaffold in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The ghost-whisperer premise and dream-cameo method feel fresh, grounded in tactile detail; the melted snow globe as memory vessel is a non-obvious synthesis that drives the entire arc.</comment>
