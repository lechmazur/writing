<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Lira’s curiosity is stated repeatedly but never embodied in a contradictory choice; the arrow tip is handled once as talisman, never reweighted under pressure. The breakthrough moment is narrated rather than dramatized, so the final “irreverent grin” feels unearned. No visible cost or renunciation closes her arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Closure is a narrated epiphany—holographic bell rings, world listens—without on-page decision or cost. Causal chain is “and-then” exposition; the lens is Accumulative/Textural but the pattern break is asserted, not shown. Orientation is clear, but closure lacks the required felt price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Workshop and acid sea are vividly sketched and supply sensory texture, yet they never constrain Lira’s choices or charge the final image. The bell’s iridescence borrows the sea’s palette, but setting remains backdrop rather than active force.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“ring a bell no one hears”—is declared early but never tested by an opposing force or resource limit. Pressure is atmospheric, not causal; the “breakthrough” arrives via montage, not a tightening choice with visible cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Theme of unheard yearning is coherent but delivered through exposition (“Could this be the bell…?”). The bell’s resonance gestures toward conceptual repricing, yet the insight is narrated rather than earned through embodied struggle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Voice is consistent, lyrical, and slightly elevated; perceptual signature shows in phrases like “irreverently in awe.” Compression and elision are smooth, though occasional template cadence (“gears and cogs whirred above”) dulls rhythm.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, vivid, and mostly propulsive; occasional loops (“gears and cogs… whirred”) and stock phrasing (“heart raced”) slightly dilute density. No artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Acid-sea workshop and yearning algorithm combine into a fresh steampunk-philosophy hybrid. The bell as unheard desire is a non-obvious synthesis, though the execution leans on familiar visionary tropes.</comment>
