<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete (her calm exterior vs storm within), embodied action mirrors stakes (fingers tremble against journal), but the renunciation of the mentor lands with cost. Motive ("break free…") is signalled but reiterated rather than enacted; a single micro-choice pries open the compartment which changes everything, though some micro-turns feel slightly summary.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Decisive Change: emerging from the tunnel with “free.” Earned under a Situational lens (coherent pressure crystallizes stance). Causality clean until the final discovery photo, where the leap from “a photograph equals proof” is thin; cost feels more described than dramatized.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Tunnel is tactile—damp earth, rust scent tracked to action (“fissure in the wall” triggers next probe). One object, the lantern, constrains final image—its light “seems brighter,” anchoring the before/after shift. Economy noted: no generic postcard geography.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</question><comment>Dominant stake announced—unmask mentor. One deepening: journal entry (“echoes… warnings”) escalates personal implication. Coincidental photograph shortcut slightly cools the tightening, though pressure overall holds until final stance crystallizes. Cost is implied in loss of certainty, but less visceral on-page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</question><comment>Theme of autonomy vs institutional sin emerges organically from each detail—corroded tunnel → systemic decay. Subtext strongest when lantern flicker undercuts mentor’s voice. Slight final sentence moral: “she smiled, knowing…” risks spoon-feeding, kept under cap by prior particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</question><comment>Voice consistent, textured—quietly observant yet lyric (“scent of rust and damp earth”). Compression purposeful. Repetition “her lantern” / “the lantern’s light” forms pattern rather than drag on rhythm. Free-indirect slips once (“her heart quickened”) are brief.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</question><comment>Prose propels: concrete nouns, strong verbs, clear sequence. Minor loop “shadows that seemed to reverberate” and slight filter verb cluster “seemed” but not in final third. Metaphor strings kept short, no purple drift.</question>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</question><comment>Avoids noir cliché—uses investigator archetype to stage intimate revolt. Lantern and Underground Railroad lineage lend specific moral freight. Fresh inversion: mentor is antagonist via photograph rather than face-to-face confrontation. Feels inevitable by final line.</question>
