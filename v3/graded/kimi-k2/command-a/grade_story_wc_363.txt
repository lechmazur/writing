<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is lyrical but abstract; her “wistful” trait is stated rather than embodied. The bead and puzzle drive her, yet her contradictory impulses remain off-stage. The final step onto the bridge is a clear renunciation, but the cost feels generalized rather than personal.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara becomes the message, the silence rewoven. Causality is soft—Accumulative/Textural lens—but the final image reweights prior motifs. One transition (orchard → clearing) is legible; orientation holds. Cost is conceptual, not visceral.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Bamboo-filtered light, singing trees, and backward streams are vivid and selective. The orchard functions as micro-setting; the bead’s glow and the puzzle’s shifting scenes constrain choices. Spatial choreography is coherent; no white-room drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—bridging impossible distance via silence—is signaled early. Pressure tightens when each puzzle piece narrows the path, but escalation is more atmospheric than causal. The final bridge crystallizes the choice, yet the felt price is diffuse.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Theme of connection-through-sacrifice emerges from image rather than statement. The bead’s captured stillness and the rewoven silence form a quiet repricing. Subtext is present but leans on lyric assertion rather than dramatized contradiction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice is consistent, with sensory filtering that matches Elara’s craft. Diction is elevated but stable; no head-hopping. Compression (“liquid gold,” “raveling silence”) is patterned and taught early.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is fluid and rhythmic; figurative language is dense yet purposeful. Occasional soft-focus phrases (“latent sacrifice”) slightly dilute immediacy. No loops or scaffold artifacts; punctuation and tense are clean.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Silence-as-fabric and puzzle-as-map synthesize familiar motifs into a fresh configuration. The orchard-bamboo fusion feels specific. Risk is moderate—lyric abstraction could collapse into cliché, but specificity of image saves it.</comment>
