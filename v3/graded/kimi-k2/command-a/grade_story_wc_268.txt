<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s resolve is vivid, but her interior contradictions remain abstract; the pretender’s desperation is shown only in summary. The iron-gall pellet moment crystallizes her stance, yet the cost feels external rather than embodied. Motivation is coherent but not deeply mined under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The causal chain from first cryptic note to final unmasking is legible; each marked book tightens the noose. Closure lands with the pellet drop—a decisive reconfiguration that costs the pretender their mask. One minor ellipsis: how the messages physically reach the throne room.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The temple library is evoked with dust-beams and humming stones, anchoring time and mood. Micro-setting—the iron-gall pellet and carved rune—constrains tactics. Spatial choreography is clear, but the shift from secluded stacks to coronation dais is elided.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes are declared early: expose the pretender or the realm remains in shadow. Pressure escalates through each annotated book, culminating in a public unmasking. The cost is visible—the pretender’s shaking hand, the clattering pellet—but not yet felt by Elara herself.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of truth versus illusion emerges through the drift-rune’s shifting meaning, not exposition. Subtext lives in marginalia and silence; the final image reframes the rune from deception to renewal. A touch of meta-commentary (“shadow cast by a false light”) slightly over-articulates.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet controlled, with rhythmic variation that mirrors the constellations’ slow dance. Free-indirect style stays clean; no head-hopping. Distinct perceptual signature: Elara notices ink viscosity and stone hums under her fingertips. Dialogue is sparse but goal-driven.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and purposeful; metaphors are selective (“dust danced in beams of forgotten light”). One loop: “weight of centuries” appears twice without reweighting. No syntactic monotony; sentences breathe with scene tempo. Clean mechanics and vivid nouns.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The premise—miniature titan librarian waging epistolary war—feels fresh yet inevitable. Tropes (hidden heir, ancient rune) are retooled through tactile specificity. The graceful collapse of the pretender’s reign is a non-obvious payoff seeded early. No close echoes detected.</comment>
