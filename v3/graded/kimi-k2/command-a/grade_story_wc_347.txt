<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s reluctant duty and buried hope are embodied in tactile soil-work and pocketed weight; the nut’s pull converts passive caretaking into active guide, costing her inherited safety. Interiority is specific, but the traveler remains a cipher, muting relational crucible pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: nut-impression → map → rescue → bud. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—curse weakened, role redefined—paid for by the risk taken under circling birds. Orientation is swift; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Cliffside labyrinth, salt wind, and mechanical birds are vivid and functional; the orchard soil and glowing nut serve as micro-settings that constrain choice. Final tremor and green bud charge the closing image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—break the curse while saving intruders—tightens when the nut’s map forces a live rescue under bird patrol. Cost: exposure to mechanical beaks and the orchard’s first hopeful crack.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of inherited obligation versus chosen purpose emerges through soil, nut, and map without overt statement. Final image of fragile bud offers quiet, earned resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet grounded in Elara’s perceptual bias; “graceless beauty” motif threads through mechanical birds and gnarled trees. Syntax modulates with urgency; no POV drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic; occasional elevated diction (“offhandedly exact”) fits the lyric register. One paraphrase loop (“she pressed… the same result”) is minor; no artifacts near closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Familiar curse/orchard frame is refreshed by impression-leaving nut and mechanical birds; synthesis feels inevitable. Specificity of salt-stung cliff and dust-crumbled nuts grounds the concept.</comment>
