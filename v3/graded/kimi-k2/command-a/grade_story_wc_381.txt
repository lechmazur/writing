<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied, but her contradictory impulses remain muted; the “weight of responsibility” is asserted rather than dramatized through micro-choice. The final renunciation is legible yet its cost is more stated than felt on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis—she seals the prophecy and accepts vigilance—under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is coherent, but the cost is soft; the brook’s pause and wing’s dimming gesture at price without making it visceral.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The nocturnal haven is rendered with selective, sensory precision; the brook and wing function as micro-settings that constrain her ritual. Yet the environment never truly resists or limits her—its role is atmospheric rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preventing prophecy-triggered chaos—is clear and escalates through the smoothing ritual. However, the tightening is more a gradual intensification than a decisive narrowing of options, and the cost remains conceptual rather than tangible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme of silence as both shield and burden emerges organically from action and image. The final image of the dimming wing offers quiet resonance, but the piece edges toward explaining its own metaphor (“silence was both weapon and shield”).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical, consistent, and filtered through Elara’s perceptual bias; diction and rhythm modulate with ritual intensity. No POV drift or register slippage; the prose sustains a hushed, incantatory texture throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense, but occasional soft loops (“gentle gurgle,” “quiet brook,” “tranquil blaze”) dilute impact. No muddled metaphors or scaffolding in the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>The fusion of origami, cosmic silence, and summoning ritual feels fresh and specific. While the “prophecy must be silenced” arc is familiar, the execution through tactile paper magic and hush-mapping offers a memorable inflection.</comment>
