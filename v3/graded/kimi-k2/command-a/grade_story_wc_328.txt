<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lena’s grief-driven quest is clear, but her interiority drifts into abstract “cosmic joke” shorthand rather than embodied contradiction. The arrowhead’s pull offers one strong micro-choice; the cordless-phone command lands as external puppetry rather than earned pivot. Closure’s renunciation feels more stated than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Single-scene causal arc holds: search → find → metamorphose → release. Orientation is swift; the cordless call triggers the garden shift with clear before/after. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) but cost is more atmospheric than concrete.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The underground garden’s damp stone, glowing fungi, and ozone crackle are vivid and selective. The arrowhead’s gravitational tug and the pool’s cryptid reflection constrain Lena’s final stance, charging the ending image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover proof of cryptid origins—tightens when the arrowhead’s pull forces a stance shift. Pressure escalates via the garden’s metamorphosis; agency crystallizes in Lena’s laughter-renunciation. Cost is felt but lightly sketched.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of “harmony untamed” emerges through the arrowhead’s living pull and the cryptid’s whispered warning. Subtext is strongest in the mirrored pool; final laughter reframes grief without moralizing. Some cosmic-joke phrasing edges toward label-speak.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays close to Lena’s sensory filter; diction is controlled, rhythms modulate with tension. No head-hopping; cordless-phone distortion is cleanly rendered. Voice feels specific to a researcher’s observational bent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, vivid, and propulsive; occasional “frostbitten hope”-type phrases flirt with abstraction but don’t stall momentum. No loops or scaffold; sensory detail is well-timed. Final paragraph could trim one redundant clause.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Flint arrowhead as dimensional key, underground garden as living archive, and grief-to-laughter arc synthesize familiar motifs into a fresh configuration. The cordless-phone oracle and cryptid mirror feel inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric compression pays off.</comment>
