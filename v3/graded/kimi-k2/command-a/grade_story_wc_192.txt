<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority is vivid—scars as tethers, the ache of a severed link—but the “teach suffocating to breathe” motive is asserted more than dramatized in scene; the final renunciation lands with felt cost yet lacks prior contradictory impulse on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure is a clear Earned Stasis: Lira seals the threshold by burning one of her own scars, a visible sacrifice that reconfigures her future guardianship. Causal chain holds under a Causal lens; only minor ellipsis between ring-press and collapse.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The ashen sanctuary is atmospherically rich and starlight is threaded through action, but the environment never physically constrains her tactics; micro-setting (her scarred body) does more work than the landscape.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—sanctuary’s survival—tightens once when the ring demands a scar; the cost is legible and narrows Lira’s future options. Escalation is single-point but sufficient for the length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of transformation-through-sacrifice emerges organically from the scar economy; the final image of the cracked ring and hollow ache reweights the premise without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet disciplined, with a consistent perceptual signature—“tender shadow keeper,” “loaded emptiness”—and rhythmic control under pressure; no POV drift or filter-verb clutter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, vivid, and propulsive; occasional elevated diction (“suffocating to breathe”) skirts purple but stays within character lexicon. One paraphrase loop (“she had paid a price…”) is minor.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>The scar-link economy and paradoxical pedagogy of darkness feel fresh; familiar guardian tropes are re-anchored in tactile, specific mechanics. Risk is moderate but coherent.</comment>
