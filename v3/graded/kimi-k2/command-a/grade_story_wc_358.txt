<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s motive of predictive foresight is stated, but only at the end does it translate into a renunciation ("The town’s silence...failure to foresee"). Interiority is sensory-rich yet largely unconflicted; no contradictory impulse in scene undercuts her composure. The flight-engineer patch functions as a concrete cue but does not charge a self-confronting decision—she catalogs rather than grieves. Micro-choice hierarchy is implied but undramatized; the earned stasis arrives in summary retrospect.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Elected lens: Causal—because her documentation yields knowledge that forecloses the path. Closure meets criteria: her realization reweights the mission from investigation to mission-bound vigil, carrying conceptual cost. Orientation is early and spatial anchors hold; causality from storm amplification to crash landing is explicit. However, the DC is narrated (not dramatized on page), slightly muting the felt cost.</comment>

<comment>The containers’ topology is precisely mapped—funnel walls, narrow aisles, collapsed stack—forming a kinetic environment that dictates wind vectors and the fatal landing vector. The patch counts as a micro-object that charges the final awareness. Sensory selection is purposeful and consistent, while atmosphere echoes the post-storm void without purple overlay.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Single dominant stake—preventing future catastrophe—gains clarity as she documents the impossible wind canyon. The tightening occurs at the revelation of mis-stacked containers funneling gusts into a death corridor; Elara’s agency lies in the cognitive act that yields the cost: “hindsight was all she had.” Coincidence (storm plus pilot bad luck) complicates but does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Theme (the irreducible lag between hindsight and foresight) emerges from concrete particulars—patch, oil streaks, crushed wings—but is underlined in the final reflective capsule. The conceptual repricing lands without an epistemic paradox beyond the stated one; subtext is present yet lessened by overt summary in final paragraph.</comment>

<comment>Narrative voice is crisp, technical, and character-distinct—forensic perceptiveness in phrases like “her flashlight cut through the darkness revealing.” Compression and patterned syntax serve tone; register never drifts toward academic grandiosity. POV remains tight third-person limited, with perceptual signature consistent under pressure.</comment>

<comment>Line-level craft is clean and propulsive: verbs like "loomed," "echoing," "amplifying" work double duty as action and metaphor. Occasional clichés—“the gutted aircraft” and “towering labyrinth”—slightly dull the edge, but no scaffold or loops obstruct pace. Information density above average for the word count.</comment>

<grade>6.5</grade>
<comment>Frame—accident investigation inside stacked shipping mazes—is a fresh spatial inversion of noir procedural. Execution lands well, yet its novelty is modest; the central surprise is meteorological rather than conceptual. Synthesis feels competent rather than transformative; no daring structural or linguistic leap.</comment>
