<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is textured—her tactile attention to rope and glass feels specific—but her motivation remains abstract (“preserve ancient methods”) and never collides with a visible cost or contradiction; the final smile resolves tension without exposing a flaw or renunciation, so the arc feels gentle rather than crucible-tested.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the decoded knot-map reweights her mission from search to stewardship, and the fulgurite’s glow seals the shift with felt cost (she now carries the weavers’ trust). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern density increases until the final image—but causality between knots and fulgurite remains lightly sketched rather than rigorously linked.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The golden dock, snow, and fog are rendered with selective sensory detail that mirrors Elara’s hushed focus; the fulgurite and rope function as micro-settings that constrain her movements and charge the final image. Yet the environment never actively threatens or limits her—weather is backdrop, not obstacle—so the 9-band gate is missed.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</question>
<comment>Stakes are declared early—decode or lose ancestral knowledge—but pressure is largely intellectual; the single tightening beat (final knot yields meaning) lacks an external or internal price beyond “work complete.” Agency is present yet low-stakes; no option is visibly foreclosed, so escalation feels modest.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</question>
<comment>Theme of intergenerational stewardship emerges through the rope’s silent testimony and the fulgurite’s lightning memory, avoiding overt statement. The ending’s hush invites reflection, but the absence of moral friction or counter-readings keeps complexity moderate.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</question>
<comment>Third-person limited voice is consistent, with lyrical compression that suits the contemplative mood; perceptual signature is strong in phrases like “oceanic hush” and “fractal patterns mirroring the knots.” No dialogue, so voice purity remains intact.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</question>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; figurative language is purposeful and sparse. Occasional soft-focus phrasing (“world itself were holding its breath”) edges toward cliché but never stalls momentum or clouds closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</question>
<comment>The fusion of knot-code as living archive feels fresh, and the fulgurite’s branching echo is an elegant doubling device. Yet the premise still orbits familiar “lost wisdom” territory without radical inversion, keeping it short of true distinction.</comment>
