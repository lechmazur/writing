<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is vivid—regret as “second skin,” the ghost as “shadow of eroded ambitions”—and her tactile micro-choices (prying the wheel, pressing it to her ear) embody the contradiction between paralysis and hope. The final beat crystallizes her stance with felt cost: she steps forward, accepting the weight of fragments yet reopening possibility. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible not tested; single-POV depth is strong.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the lagoon’s resumed shimmer and Mara’s step reweight the premise—stillness becomes beginning. Causal linkage holds: wheel’s hum → voice message → fragment collection → re-vision of ghost. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are taught by kinetic lagoon above clouds within first 120 words. One transition (nightfall) is brief and contiguous.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The kinetic lagoon is not mere backdrop; its currents mirror Mara’s inner fracture and its final stir signals reconfiguration. Micro-setting objects—camera wheel, rusted locket—function as tactile “places” that constrain choice and charge closure. Sensory detail is selective (shimmer, mud, static crackle) and filtered through Mara’s scavenger priorities. Spatial choreography remains coherent across the single scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—negotiate with her own ghost—is signaled early and tightened once: the wheel’s voice reframes regret from enemy to guide, narrowing her options to “collect, rebuild, step.” Cost is visible in the weight she still carries and the moonlit step that forecloses surrender. Escalation is modest but sufficient for 700-word scope; no external reversals needed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of reclamation through fragmentation emerges organically from Mara’s actions; no explicit moralizing. The camera wheel’s reprise as compass and confessor reweights earlier motifs without overt statement. Final image of “fractured stillness” as beginning offers resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext in the whispered voice avoids sentimentality.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly bound to Mara’s perceptual signature—selective scavenger noticing, synesthetic “rhythms no one could hear.” Rhythm modulates with pressure: longer reflective cadences contract into the staccato of discovery. No dialogue, so voice coherence is judged on internal texture alone; it holds. No POV drift or filter-verb clutter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet textured—“regret clung to her like a second skin,” “carousel halted, its once-whirling lights now dark.” Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing” zone) but stays within lyrical allowance. No loops or scaffold; information density high. One mixed metaphor risk—“kinetic lagoon shimmered above the clouds”—but contextually legible.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Post-apocalyptic scavenger trope is refreshed by the surreal kinetic lagoon and the camera wheel as memory oracle. The ghost-as-self device avoids cliché through embodied regret and fragment collection mechanic. Specificity of “carousel halted” and “disposable camera wheel” grounds the fantastical in tactile detail. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
