<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—trembling hands, oil-and-rust air—but her “uncertainty” is asserted more than dramatized; the final declaration “We are all broken” lands as therapeutic summary rather than earned contradiction. Micro-choices (aligning charm to statue) are present yet feel guided by external enchantment rather than internal flaw. Cost is gestured at (workshop tilts, acid sea) but not made viscerally hers.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the statue’s glow quilts memories into a charged poise of hope, with the workshop’s steadiness as felt cost. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern recognition and density increase reweight meaning. Orientation is clear by line 3; no causality breaks. Minor slack: the acid-sea threat never truly narrows options, so escalation is more atmospheric than causal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The floating workshop’s groans, oil stink, and tilting floor constrain Elara’s balance and attention; the acid sea’s hiss supplies audible urgency. Selective sensory triage under pressure—pockmarks, charm, statue glow—keeps description purposeful. The setting charges the final image when the workshop steadies in response to her words, meeting the 9+ gate condition narrowly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—salvage personal meaning before oblivion—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening: the charm clicks, memories flare, workshop lurches, forcing her to speak the kintsugi credo. Cost is atmospheric (possible collapse) rather than concrete; agency is slightly diluted by the statue’s autonomous glow. Sufficient for this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Kintsugi-as-theme is woven through image (pockmarks as repaired scars) rather than imposed; the final image of glowing flaws offers non-literal resonance. However, the explicit “We are all broken” edges toward thematic echo, blunting subtext. Complexity is present but leans therapeutic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet anchored in tactile detail—“acid sea hissed,” “gears groaned.” Syntax modulates with stress: longer reflective sentences contract to urgent fragments as the floor tilts. No POV drift; perceptual signature is consistent. Occasional elevated diction (“conjure meaning from the edge of oblivion”) slightly overshoots the POV’s plausible lexicon under duress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; figurative language is selective. Minor loop: “the workshop groaned… the gears groaning” within four lines. No mixed metaphors or scaffold clutter. Final paragraph’s cadence shift is effective, though “quilts” used as verb twice feels deliberate yet noticeable.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: kintsugi alchemy enacted on a floating rust-ruin against an acid sea. The premise avoids stock templates; the statue-memory interface is non-obvious. Risk is moderate—lyric accumulation over causal plot—but coherence holds. Could push further into the alchemist’s occupational specificity.</comment>
