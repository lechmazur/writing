<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is lyrical but generic; the locust shell and heartbeat sync are shown more than felt. No contradictory impulse surfaces in-scene; her choice to merge heartbeats arrives as serene acceptance rather than struggle. The cost—loss of the shell’s pulse—lands, yet feels pre-ordained. Still, her embodied music-making keeps her above mid-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Single continuous scene, causal lens: music → statues freeze → roots rise. Closure is a clear Decisive Change with visible cost (orchard reborn, statues gone). Orientation is swift; no teleporting props. Minor slack: the heartbeat “signal” rule is asserted late, not seeded early, so causality feels slightly retrofitted.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Orchard and sky-bridge are sketched with selective, sense-driven strokes; the violin itself becomes micro-setting that constrains stance. Obsidian statues and writhing roots track spatially. One overripe phrase (“tapestry of tarnished wonder”) but overall economy supports pressure. Setting charges the final image: roots absorbing stone dust.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore beauty vs mechanical order—signaled early. Escalation is one sustained crescendo: music unsettles statues, heartbeat sync triggers revolt. Agency remains Elara’s; coincidence plays no role. Cost is legible (orchar reclaims magic, statues crumble), though the price to Elara personally is muted.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of reawakening beauty emerges through action, not sermon. The locust shell’s shift from key to spent husk offers a quiet CR that reweights the premise. Subtext in the statues’ silence and the orchard’s tremor avoids moralizing. Final image of “promise” resonates without tidy uplift.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds steady; perceptual signature is musical—metaphors of rhythm, breath, pulse. No dialogue, so no voice contamination. Occasional elevated diction (“resonantly soft melody”) fits the lyrical frame. Compression is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Strong rhythmic control; sentences lengthen and contract with musical phrasing. One paraphrase loop (“heartbeat… rhythm… pulse”) but no artifact touches closure. Figurative language is mostly disciplined; only “tarnished wonder” edges purple. High information density; no scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Familiar fable of art vs oppression is refreshed by the sky-bridge violinist and star-wood instrument. Living statues and heartbeat signaling feel specific rather than stock. The synthesis isn’t revolutionary, but the final reconfiguration of magic through roots is memorable. Avoids gimmickry.</comment>
