<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority flickers between concrete specificity (she walks “with purpose”) and generic abstractions (“something greater”). The thrush-talisman works both as externalized motive and as tool, a clever unifying object, yet the climactic “touched it once last time” registers an internal shift rather than an embodied cost. Backstory as ghostwriter is efficiently seeded; no time is burned on back-story blocks that do not tilt her present stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure meets Accumulatl/Textural lens: nest inserted → installation “Rejoin” blooms → images knit a universal web. The sequence is a cadence deepening rather than a because/therefore chain, so lens stays coherent under the lyric build-up. Orientation clear by line 5; no ambiguity debt. Penultimate line’s felt “profound sense of peace” delivers necessary cost (non-return of nest, irrevocable offering) without exposition clutter.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Marble petals, lily-pond mirror, dragonfly on leaf—details are economical and POV-filtered. Temple rises and “prismatic” light charge the closing tableau. Environmental scale subtly guides route to center. Micro–object (the spiral nest) doubles as portable space, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</question><comment>Single dominant stake signaled early: need to “find the thread.” Escalation builds accumulatively: rain-scented air preludes stillness, walk preludes installation climax, offering preludes revelation. No reversals required under lyric design. Final image narrows option: offering made, spiral left—path foreclosed with visible cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of unity in the invisible web rises from particulars rather than slogans. Spiral, reflections, temple, nest—all literal before they become symbolic. End resists moralizing: image is charged, text silent. Subtext: art’s rejoining of fragments shadows the ghostwriter’s vocation—both acts of repair—yet the thread transcends romantic craft. No echoing moral at close.</question>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Third-limited interiority is clean; perceptual signature shows in noticing “dragonfly perched on a lotus leaf” and light “humming.” Prose voice is calm, slightly lyrical; rhythm swells organically. No dialogue present—no issue under policy.</question>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences breathe; no looped scaffold. Diction precise: “rain-scented air,” “humming with quiet energy.” Tight line-level craft sustains lyric intensity without overwriting in closure block. No clarity artifacts or mixed metaphors.</question>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Combines the ghostwriter trope with lyric mystical quest; fresh synthesis grounded in tactile spiral object. No generic “search for meaning” slog; instead specificity threads through temple, rain, nest. A touch familiar, yet handled with restraint and visual freshness.</question>
