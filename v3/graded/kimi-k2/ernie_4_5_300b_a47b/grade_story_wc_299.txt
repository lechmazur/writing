<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lenny’s contradictory impulses—nostalgia vs. emotional insulation—are dramatized in the tactile handling of the cloth and the phone call; the final choice to “resurrect forgotten stories” is credibly foreshadowed and costs him his safe detachment. Interiority stays concrete, but one beat of diagnostic self-labeling (“confidently uncertain”) slips into abstraction rather than embodied tension.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: botched appraisal → exile → cloth discovery → identification → purpose shift; each beat tightens options. Closure lands as Earned Stasis—he forecloses the “toss it” path and accepts quarry-level obscurity in exchange for story-keeping—cost is legible in the final line “after the applause, there was still music.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Trailer’s mildew, desk-lamp flicker, and granite chasm ground every beat; the cloth itself serves as micro-setting that constrains the final choice. Sensory selection skews visual; one missed tactile return to rain-soaked boots after Gus exits.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“find a reason to matter after public failure”—tightens when the cloth’s uselessness threatens his last factual refuge; the phone call forces the trade-off between anonymity and story-keeping. Cost is visible: he abandons the illusion of objective value, embracing unpaid cultural salvage.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of post-failure purpose emerges through the cloth’s revaluation from “worthless” to irreplaceable archive; no explicit thesis stated. Final image reweights earlier dynamite blasts as metaphor for demolished yet echoing art—resonant without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature vivid in “smelled of mildew and regret.” One register drift: “conceptual repricing” diction exceeds Lenny’s quarry-level lexicon in interior line.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose moves with varied rhythm; high information density in “frayed edges catching the flicker.” Minor scaffold: two adjacent sentences open “He’d…” creating template cadence; no loops obscure closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Freshens familiar “failed artist rediscovers meaning” arc via quarry/antiques collision and prog-rock ephemera; cloth-as-archive angle feels specific rather than trope-checklist. Risk is moderate—could push further into quarry acoustics metaphor—but sufficient for publishability.</comment>
