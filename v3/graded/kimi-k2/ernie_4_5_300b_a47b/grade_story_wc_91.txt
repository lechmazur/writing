<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied; contradictory strains of altruism and exhaustion surface in scene. Motivation to "fix" vs "transform" is seeded early and crystallizes in the leaving of the glowing footprint—earned renunciation. Drop of 0.2 for occasional therapy-adjacent self-absorption ("I just wanted...").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands on page with DC/CR hybrid: Lira’s detour yields a literal reconfiguration marked by glowing map. Causal chain (bugs → prophecy → confusion → listening in hush) holds. -0.3 for late-letter insertion that feels shunted.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Volcanic beach, gritty charcoal, and warm sand are tactile and bias perception. Micro-setting (luminous bugs) constrains action during final spiral and charges final imprint. A few stock adjectives (“velvet sky”) flatten texture briefly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Stake—the obligation to end accidental prophecy tightening—turns when bugs become symbols she must release. Cost is felt when prior “fixes” are re-framed as complicity; volcanic quiet acts as earned stasis. Middle beats lose 0.5 for too gentle escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Transformation theme surfaces via luminous forecasts and refusal to "fix", culminating in quiet acceptance under stars. Subtext in shared silence avoids overt moral. A late thematic echo (“understanding texture”) hovers near label-speak – slight deduction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Distinct lyrical compression echoes volcanic hiss and internal trembling. Focalization is seamless; no dialogue lapses. -0.2 occasional elevated phrasing (“choreography of celestial bodies”) drifting slightly above POV register.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythms breathe with volcanic calm. High information density with few filler adjectives. One near-loop “hush” repeated too closely in ending paragraph – minor only.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Transforms familiar “accidental fulfiller of fate” trope into quiet renunciation. Fresh inflection: the bugs as currency of consequence rather than wish-fulfilment. Sentimentality in final beach-glow residue holds back 0.4.</comment>
