<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara’s patched-together identity feels tactile—cracked goggles, salt-crusted radio patches; interiority remains concrete without epiphany drift. Obstinate midnight choices (hair-wired antenna, spinning censer foot) reveal a clear value hierarchy of remembrance over safety. Passivity only appears during one brief summary; micro-shifts of attention (phone → build) show earned agency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Plot drives on because/therefore causality under a Causal lens: hydraulics fail → phone rings → build bridge → signal coherence. Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the final spin of the foot crystallizes cost—the old routes now occupy the station’s airwaves. No orientation debt; scene anchors within 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Station hull scrap metal, body-temperature censer, and moonlit salt mist pressure her tactics; micro-setting (tool, body) constrains assembly. Despite broad strokes, specifics anchor geography and sharpen choreography under pressure. No white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Reverse migration tightens each beat: first lure of memory, then foreclosed alternative paths by midnight. Stakes feel visceral but linger slightly abstract until the final chorus; traded-off time for lyrical charge. One meaningful escalation suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme is an emergent property of Mara's goal and choices: navigation through loss condensed to the ringing beacon and fading ghosts. Ends on non-literal but resonant image (bronzine memory flash) that reweights prior material without moralizing. Avoids tidy morals.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Narrative voice possesses salt-tinged rhythm, selective sensory attention (“salt air dulls bronze”), and distinct perceptual signature. Compression and patterned elision taught early and paid off—phone static filtered into engineering syntax. No head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm mirrors urgency—short bursts under pressure, elongated breath during dawn wait. Information density high; minimal scaffolds. Clean copy; no loops or synesthetic spill.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Achieves a specific synthesis: Aboriginal navigator ancestry + doomed satellite tech fused into a tactile “geography of loss.” No derivative scent—moon-tide memory mnemonic feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
