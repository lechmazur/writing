<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s curiosity and craft ethos are vivid, but the interior contradiction—his drive to innovate versus the seed’s uncanny pull—never collides in a single, embodied beat; the final laugh feels lightly earned rather than costly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the key reweights the entire mystery under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The spiral motif threads from envelope to key, but the plant’s overnight vanish leans on convenient ellipsis rather than earned causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The brook, mist, and workshop ground every move; the slime trail and iron key charge the final image. Yet the volcanic-soil detail floats untethered to any later constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—decipher the seed or lose his sanctuary’s ethos—tightens once when the plant burrows and yields the key. Cost is conceptual (his paradigm shifts) but not viscerally felt on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of surrendering control to cultivate innovation emerges through image and action; the final key crystallizes it without moralizing. The corpse-flower stench never returns to reweight the idea, leaving a faint missed echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Voice is tactile and precise—“calloused from soldering circuits”—with rhythmic control under pressure. Occasional lyric lift (“storm-born silence”) risks poetic overlay yet stays legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and sensorily rich; only minor scaffold (“the storm intensified, rattling the windows”) repeats ambient weather without fresh pressure. No artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The escape-room designer receiving a living puzzle is fresh; the seed-to-key transformation feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risk lies in the surreal botanic leap, but coherence holds.</comment>
