<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara's interior journey is clearly anchored by her longing for her father and the need to reclaim her mental wildness, embodied through the hum she internalizes. The choice to release the gear gives up her only link to dad, producing felt cost. Interiority stays sensorily grounded; no therapy-speak breaks. A tighter beat where translocation imposes immediate crisis could lift the score.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story runs on an Accumulative/Textural drive: repeated exposure to forest sounds and gear imagery tightens into the revelation that the forest = brain. Closure—planting the gear-as-seed—reconfigures meaning via CR, with cost captured in “her pocket empty but her mind full.” One identifiable, legible lens and clean turning point satisfy the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mechanical Rainforest pulses through gear-leaf hybrids, steam-veins, and tone-rich wind; every sensory choice feeds the theme. The revelatory clearing acts as micro-setting that constrains the final action: once gear is locked, rotation forces forest-brain shift; gear’s leaving charges closure. All world rules track cleanly; selectivity economy rewarded.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“rediscover the wild frontier of her mind”—is signaled early and escalates through intensifying species hums. The decisive tightening comes when she hears the three-species chord and chooses release, forfeiting the father-gear. Cost is present, though less visceral than emotional. Middle stretch lacks a mid-scene obstacle that could have sharpened pressure further.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from pattern: sound-as-thought, machinery-as-synapse, nature-as-mind. The planted gear reweights “wild frontier” from nostalgic longing to ongoing covenant—earned, not asserted. Absent overt moralizing; the forest’s whisper “Unravel” remains implication, not explanation. One minor echo risk at father’s hologram maxim; otherwise cleanly resonant.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Consistent lyric close third suffused with sensorily filtered punctuation-free breathlessness that maps her heightened cognition. Controlled cadence modulates: longer breath sentences near discovery, clipped release at end. No head-hops or register drift even under tri-tone chord peak. Distinct perceptual signature secured.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Strong density—“roots unspooling like clockwork”—advances all three tasks (image, atmosphere, causality). Metaphors stay coherent and proportional, never chaining into purple clutter during the critical rotation moment. Rhythm exploits silence-breath silences. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold sentences detected down the stretch.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Mechanical forest as living brain is both familiar trope and freshly inflected through tonal classification of tree species and synthesis of steam synapse. The seed-gear final gesture synthesizes prior motifs, making the closure feel inevitable in hindsight. No derivative echo; specificity and risk outweigh predictability by final line burn-in.</comment>
