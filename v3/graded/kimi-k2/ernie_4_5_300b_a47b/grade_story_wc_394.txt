<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lira’s obsession with the arrow-tip and the bell is vivid, her “gears with feet” jab shows voice, and the final risk taken is consistent with her irreverence. Interiority stays concrete (“breath hitched,” hands tremble) and the micro-choice to press the tip to the kaleidoscope crystallizes her agency. Flaw: no contradictory impulse is dramatized mid-air; she never doubts the leap, so the arc is single-track. Still, the earned cost—crashing the Skein to make the bell hum—lands with character coherence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: kaleidoscope image → transliteration tweak → dive → arrow as clapper → bell hums. Closure is a Decisive Change with visible cost: the glider wrecks, the sea roars, the workshop shudders. Orientation is clean by line 8; no teleporting props. One minor slack: the tower’s sudden appearance reads like coincidence rather than prior foreshadow, but it complicates rather than resolves, so lens integrity survives.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Acid mist that eats tools, gears overhead as metronome, the arrow-tip’s grooves mirroring kaleidoscope glass—each detail is filtered through Lira’s maker-eye and steers choice. The workshop’s acid sea and sulfurous wind constrain launch timing and supply the final roar that answers the bell. Micro-setting (the kaleidoscope strapped to thigh projecting onto mist) directly guides sail tweaks, charging the climax. Spatial track stays clean; no floating rooms.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“ring the bell no one hears yet”—is signaled early and tightens when the kaleidoscope shows a crash image, forcing a choice between vision and survival. Each transliteration tweak narrows aerodynamic options until the final dive forecloses retreat; the wreckage is the felt price. No off-stage rescue; the algorithm’s success is paid with the Skein’s destruction. One beat of escalation suffices for 700-word scope.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of desire-as-code emerges from the arrow’s spirals and the act of transliteration; no character sermonizes. The bell’s unheard note becomes a resonant metaphor for unverifiable creation—paid for with wreckage, not stated. Final image of the sea “roaring as if annoyed” reweights earlier acid imagery without moral. Slight abstraction in “unspool the future” is the only near-echo, but it’s buried early and not repeated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person stays locked to Lira’s perceptual gear: “gears clacked overhead, a metronome to her restlessness.” Diction is maker-specific—“braces,” “skeletal frame,” “conductor’s baton”—and rhythm accelerates with short clauses during the dive. No head-hopping; kaleidoscope projections remain legible external stimuli. One register lift: “irreverent awe blooming” is slightly writerly, but it’s brief and closure-adjacent, not disruptive.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence. Figurative language is spare and precise—“the acid sea below roared, as if annoyed” personifies without purple. High information density: one sentence often does two jobs (“She mounted the glider, arrow tip in hand, and kicked off into the sulfurous wind”). Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold. Copy-clean: pronouns track, tense stable, no homophone errors.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fusing steampunk glider sport with algorithmic desire encoded in a hunter’s arrow is fresh; the kaleidoscope as compiler is a delightful twist on “seeing is coding.” Tropes are transformed through tactile specifics—spiral grooves, transliteration tweaks, acid wind. Risky dive ending feels inevitable in hindsight because the kaleidoscope fore-images it. Minor echo of “bell no one hears” trope, but the acid-sea workshop and yearning-algorithm re-inflect it memorably.</comment>
