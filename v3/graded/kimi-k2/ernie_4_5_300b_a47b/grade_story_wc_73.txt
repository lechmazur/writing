<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael’s grim-optimist contradiction is embodied in the dice ritual and the 42.7% figure; the final renunciation—letting the dice orbit—earns its cost because earlier beats tether the chipped die to childhood guilt and the vanished lover. Interiority stays concrete, never lapsing into label-speak. The only cap is that the lover remains off-stage, so relationship-as-crucible pressure is absent.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each loop layers pattern until the rupture breaks cadence and births the perpetual orbit. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Kael’s stance shifts from possession to witness—charged by the dice’s refusal to be grasped. Orientation is taught early; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The staircase breathes and rearranges like a deck of cards, constraining every footfall; the dice become micro-setting that finally orbit in the ruptured step, charging the closure image. Sensory detail is selective—ozone, parchment shimmer—filtered through Kael’s obsession. No orientation debt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—capture the texture of loss—tightens when the rupture forces Kael to relinquish possession; the cost is the dice’s permanent escape. Escalation is one deepening under the Accumulative lens; no reversals needed. Pressure stays coherent and legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the tension between motion and stillness; the final image of the orbiting dice reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext lives in the chipped die’s flaw and the silence it stands for. No thematic drift or echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is grim, lyrical, and mathematically precise—“grim optimist,” “tarnished silver,” “42.7%”—with rhythmic control that tightens under pressure. No POV leakage; perceptual signature is consistent. Compression and elision are taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. The final paragraph’s cadence shift mirrors the staircase’s rearrangement, earning its place.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The infinite staircase as Möbius strip of grief, the dice as compass, and the rupture as wound that heals by bleeding forever synthesize into a fresh, inevitable whole. Risk-taking (mathematical proofs scrawled on stone) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
