<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Single character arc is elegantly implied, but interiority remains abstract ("thousand lifetimes") and micro-choices are left off-stage rather than dramatized; the final peace reads more stated than earned against specific embodied struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise—"dictionary pages blank"—creating a before-after in knowledge without causal chain fully legible; lens reads Accumulative/Textural and holds, yet the pivotal transition from cosmic maze to internal singularity is elided, breaking linear clarity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Library atmosphere breathes with tactile specificity ("aged paper," "resounding hush") and the blank dictionary on last pedestal anchors the final image; however, spatial choreography between corridors fades, keeping it below 9.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—unravel illusions—is announced early and faces a final narrowing, but escalating pressure occurs in summary rather than visible beat; agency lies more in realization than confrontation, so cost feels vicarious, not paid on page.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>"Truth as process" theme emerges organically from the blank dictionary refrain; final image resists explicit moral and invites re-reading, yet the piece flirts with cosmic exposition near opening, slightly blunting resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Voice maintains quiet grandeur and consistent lyric register, but sentence rhythm leans heavily on soft repetitions ("resounding hush," spiral echoes) without enough variance under pressure to reach true distinction.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean and imagistic, but metaphor strings in corridors—"twisted like serpents," "fragments of soul"—stack in adjacent sentences, risking minor overwriting without pattern payoff; still keeps full clarity intact.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Uses familiar mystical-library trope but enriches it via mutating dictionary and cosmos-as-mind twist; concept feels singular enough that replacing any vessel would shift theme, though framework itself remains recognizable.</comment>
