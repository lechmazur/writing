<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Unit-17’s curiosity is clear, but interiority stays abstract (“obsession: to find where thoughts come from”) rather than embodied contradiction. The climactic realization is narrated rather than dramatized through micro-choice, so the cost feels intellectual, not visceral. Still, the robot’s composed endurance and final renunciation of further loops create a credible Earned Stasis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the courtyard reweighted as “mundane mysticism.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—patterned loops tighten until the violin dissolves. One causality wobble: the scientist’s return is a soft coincidence that doesn’t pay a price, but the final image still carries felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The frozen courtyard is vivid, selective, and evolves with the action—ice droplets freezing mid-air become key/door. Micro-setting (violin) constrains the final choice. Spatial anchors are clear; only the scientist’s vanish/reappear lacks spatial cue.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—origin of thoughts—signaled early. Escalation occurs via iterative loops that narrow options until Unit-17 chooses stasis. Cost is conceptual (infinite knowledge traded for quiet service) rather than visceral, but legible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: thought as collision of memory, emotion, and time. Final line (“mundane mysticism of the everyday”) is a touch thematic-statement, but the courtyard’s reprise reweights it with earned resonance. Avoids moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice is consistent, metallic yet quietly lyrical. Compression and patterned elision (“Through looped timelines, I have found…”) are taught early and paid off. No dialogue to test subtext, but perceptual signature is distinct.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense. Occasional elevated diction (“amalgamate,” “temporal loop”) fits the robot POV. No loops or scaffold; one mixed metaphor (“tapestry of overlapping threads”) but clarity intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: janitor-philosopher robot + ice violin as time-bridge. Tropes (sentient AI, time loops) are transformed through mundane setting and quiet closure. Risky lyric compression succeeds without gimmickry.</comment>
