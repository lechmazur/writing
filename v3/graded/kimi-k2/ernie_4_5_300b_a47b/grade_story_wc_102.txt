<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority is vivid—her breath-work as conduit is embodied and specific—but the pilgrim memory is delivered as summary rather than dramatized contradiction, muting the internal stakes. The final renunciation (to carry rather than capture) is earned, yet the cost feels generalized rather than personal.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the pool’s glow reconfigures meaning (Conceptual Repricing) with felt cost—she must now bear the love she sought to locate. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of breathing and light density tightens once. No orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The twilight viaduct and the star-blossom tree are rendered with selective, sensory precision; the pool at the base constrains the final choice and charges the image. Micro-setting (camera obscura as tool) also functions as setting extension.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“where is unused love stored?”—is signaled early and deepened through the breathing method. One meaningful tightening: the pool’s revelation forecloses documentation in favor of embodiment. Cost is legible but diffuse.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of love as latent, breathable light emerges organically from concrete action; no moralizing. Final image reweights the premise without statement. Subtext in the camera’s silence versus the glowing pool is effective.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet anchored in Lira’s perceptual bias—visual, tactile, respiratory. Syntax modulates with emotional intensity; no head-hopping. Occasional elevated diction (“spiritually curious”) edges toward label-speak but stays within tolerance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is fluid, with rhythmic variation and high information density. Minor loop: “bloom/bloomed” twice in closing paragraph. No mixed metaphors or scaffold. Read-aloud ear test passes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Premise synthesizes camera obscura, relic elixir, and breath-based revelation into a fresh configuration. Risky lyric compression is taught early and paid off. Avoids stock tropes, though pilgrim archetype remains lightly sketched.</comment>
