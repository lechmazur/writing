<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Jorin’s quiet resolve is embodied through deliberate micro-choices (folding the silk, choosing the center tunnel, enduring the shards). The final endurance scene crystallizes his value hierarchy—resilience over safety—at visible cost (blood, silence). Interiority stays concrete; no stock epiphanies. The only gap: Old Mara’s warning is summary, not on-page pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: silk arrives → Jorin studies → enters mine → confronts Lira → absorbs orb → orchards bloom. Closure lands as Decisive Change with felt cost (blood, spectral ordeal). One clean transition from surface to mine; orientation anchored by lantern flicker and crystalline walls. No teleporting props.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Floating arches, damp mine air, and glowing crystalline walls are vivid and selective. The silk’s azure glow becomes a micro-setting that constrains choice (absorbs shards, charges orb). Spatial choreography tracks cleanly; no white-room syndrome. Only minor: orchard bloom payoff is reported, not sensed.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—planet’s vitality—signaled early. Pressure tightens once: spectral Lira forces endurance test that forecloses retreat. Cost is visceral (blood, pain). No coincidence resolves; Jorin’s agency drives orb absorption. Escalation is single but sufficient for 800-word scope.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of quiet defiance emerges through embodied ordeal; no explicit moralizing. Final image of blooming orchards and Jorin’s silence reweights the premise without statement. Subtext in Lira’s warning (“confront the rubble within”) resonates. Minor drift: “planet’s soul” edges toward abstraction but stays tied to orb.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays close to Jorin’s perceptual filter; no head-hopping. Syntax is controlled, rhythmic (“hammering out iron tools… skeletal hand”). Dialogue minimal but goal-driven (Lira’s challenge). Register consistent; no filter-verb stacks. Voice modulates under stress: shorter clauses during shard storm.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose is lean, vivid, propulsive. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful (“skeletal hand,” “planet’s pain”). Minor register lift in “conceptual repricing” phrase, but fits spectral Lira’s diction. Clean grammar, strong verbs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: meek blacksmith + magician’s silk + planetary soul repair. Tropes transformed—mines as psychic crucible, not treasure vault. Specificity anchors universals (orchard planet, floating arches). Risky spectral encounter pays off. No close echoes of famous scenes.</comment>
