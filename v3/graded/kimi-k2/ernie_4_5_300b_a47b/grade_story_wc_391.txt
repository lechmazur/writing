<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The mapper’s traits are sketched—vigilant, obsessed with precision—but interior contradiction is thin; his bodily cost and steadier hands are shown rather than felt, so endurance earns low resonance at this length. A clearer flaw or clashing value would have made the final stance feel costlier.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>An Accumulative/Textural lens holds: incremental tightening of alignments reframes patience as kinetic, culminates in the controlled hum rippling the ice—a Resonant Reconfiguration—carrying tangible perceptual cost. Early spatial cues anchor cleanly; no causal snaps but the closure lands on-page.</question>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Basalt sanctuary and iced lake filter action beautifully—breath on metal, frost under boot—yet the setting never quite constrains motion; it frames mood more than choice. A final use of cold geometry to charge choice would have nudged it higher.</question>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single dominant stake—precise alignment vs impatience—escalates as missteps chip at options; cost stays sensorial rather than existential. Stakes are legible, escalation modest for 800 words; no reversal beyond micro-tightening.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme of disciplined time sculpting emerges through texture and stance, not talk. Final image of “unyoked” humming lake reweights the cold night into earned rhythm—subtle but resonant, avoiding explicit epiphany.</question>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person close keeps tactile filter of an observer-engineer: breath-fogged goggles, iron filings vibrating against fingertips. Syntax holds steady while cold intensifies; slight repetitions in “patience” refrain are intentional cadence.</question>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences breathe in varied lengths, rhythms match frost-crackle and humming hush. Occasional minor pleonasm—softly purposeful—costs little; overall texture is controlled, sensory, propulsive.</question>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</question>
<comment>Concept of astronomical engineering via lunar-magnetics is fresh; low-key execution safe. Risk remains moderate—no startling turn—yet sensory specificity in filings and viaduct hum feels bespoke.</question>
