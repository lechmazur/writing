<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Clara’s interiority is vivid—her contradictory need to lose and find herself is embodied in the act of weaving—but the curator remains a cipher whose pressure is asserted rather than dramatized, limiting relationship crucible depth.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each weave thickens perceptual density until the final Charged Poise (“the world seemed to shift, just slightly”) reweights the premise with felt cost—her prior certainty is foreclosed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The gallery’s warped glass and liquid fractals are not mere backdrop; their mutability directly constrains Clara’s weaving choices and supplies the final image’s reconfiguration, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“to discover the texture of connection”—is signaled early and tightened once when the thread erupts, forcing Clara to renegotiate her stance; cost is visible in her unsettling calm.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of rational enchantment emerges organically from the weave of logic and magic; the final image of a thread-lit world offers a resonant, non-moral answer that reweights earlier illusions.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Voice is textured, fever-dream precise (“liquid fractals,” “sinew thread glowed faintly”), and perceptual signature remains consistent; purposeful elision in the rupture beat is taught and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is propulsive and vivid, but occasional stacked metaphors (“storm of light,” “web of glowing lines”) slightly dilute peak clarity; no loops or scaffold in final third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of optical-illusion gallery + weaving-as-thought-architecture; the transformation of mirrors into connective thread feels inevitable and specific, not gimmick.</comment>
