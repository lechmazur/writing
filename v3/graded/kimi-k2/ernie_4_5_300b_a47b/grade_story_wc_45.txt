<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara’s skepticism and curiosity are embodied in tactile choices (testing thorns, aligning teeth) and crystallize in the mirror insight; Elias’s grief and mischief feel lived-in. Their shared history surfaces through gesture and subtext rather than exposition. The final recognition of mutual avoidance carries credible emotional cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The causal chain—finding tooth → planning alignment → Elias’s arrival → dual placement → fountain re-flow—tightens options and reconfigures the garden’s meaning. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the garden’s mirror truth reframes their past and future. One micro-turn suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The hedge maze and fountain are rendered through selective sensory detail (ivy hum, moss-choked basin) and constrain movement and choice. The garden’s spatial logic remains coherent; its shift from labyrinth to mirror is earned rather than imposed. Micro-setting (the fountain basin) becomes the charged final object.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether Mara can understand the garden without losing herself—tightens when Elias demands a second tooth. Agency remains hers: placing both teeth realigns the garden and forecloses denial. Cost is felt in the mutual admission of avoidance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The theme of forgiveness as recognition rather than absolution emerges through the mirror metaphor and the joint placement of teeth. No moralizing statement intrudes; the insight is earned in action. Ambiguity lingers: the garden remains magical but no longer hostile.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Mara’s perceptual signature—shrewd yet innocent—shapes diction (“constellations waiting to be mapped”) and selective attention. Elias’s voice is rougher, older, distinct in cadence. No head-hopping; focalization stays tight to Mara until the shared final image.</comment>

<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense without purple drift. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances character, setting, or stakes. Figurative language (tapestry of memories) is controlled and purposeful.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>The changeling-tooth-as-bridge trope is refreshed by bone-setting mechanics and the mirror payoff. Specificity of village superstition and personal history grounds the fantasy. The synthesis feels inevitable rather than gimmicky.</comment>
