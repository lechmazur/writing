<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara is vivid—contradictory impulses (clipboard as weapon and shield) embodied with tactile clipboard scars. Her gentle authority feels earned, guiding delegates under sun-scorched stone. Final renunciation/reconfiguration is credible, if understated; cost is felt in the ink-stained relic she pockets.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: dawn arrival → delegate arrival → heat lull → treaty signed → stasis at dusk. Closure lands in the quiet “price of redemption” image, the clipboard scar beneath the celestial slow dance. Minor synoptic exposition at <120 words is waived—orientation is anchored by gesture and shadow.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Volcanic terrace and eroded gods provide texture that reweights the treaty stakes: stone, sun, and erosion as silent witnesses. Mid-stanza heat lull momentarily locks elapsed time. Final sun arc mirrors narrowing options—brisk but specific rather than postcard.</comment>

<grade>6.6</grade>
<comment>Pressure builds via delegate hostility, sun arc, and clipboard ritual—the “price” concept tightens stakes. No external reversals, only gradual erosion and modest cost; sufficient for sub-800-word scope.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from paradox—scars of past peace versus promise of future compromise. Final quiet reweighting of “flawed beauty” reconfigures prior material without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Operative gentleness encoded in syntax—soft questions disarm generals. Distinct perceptual signature: clipboard clicks echo delegate metaphor rhythms. No head-hopping; psychological realism under midsummer glare.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Lyrical density earns its keep: “slow dance of celestial bodies” compresses hours into a single rhythmic line. Skip one near-redundant “then” loop mid-sentence—otherwise crisp momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: clipboard-scar diplomacy as modern myth. Ritual and erosion patterns charge the closure without gimmickry. Bold quiet ending risks but delivers.</comment>
