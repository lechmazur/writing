<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lira’s tapping rhythm gives her a tactile, embodied signature, but interiority drifts into summary (“she knew better”) rather than contradictory impulse under pressure; Kael’s skepticism supplies external pressure yet their joint decision to sail lacks visible cost on the page, muting the earned change.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final image of glowing corals and reappearing paths reconfigures meaning with conceptual cost—reality itself is cyclically rewriting. Causal linkage holds (atlas → plankton coordinates → voyage), but the leap from “ghost data” to “gateways” is compressed rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Station, atoll, and bioluminescent storm are rendered in selective sensory strokes that mirror Lira’s urgency; the atlas page and tapping rhythms act as micro-settings that constrain choices. The final reef image charges the closing beat, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“why do paths disappear?”—is signaled early and tightens when plankton spell coordinates, forcing the choice to sail. Cost is implied (abandoning the station) but not viscerally felt on the page, keeping the score just below the 8.8 band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme of cyclical renewal versus irreversible loss emerges through coral imagery and flickering islands, never sermonized. The final image reframes the fossil-fuel ban as awakening rather than healing, offering resonant ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet anchored in Lira’s tactile perception; rhythm modulates with storm intensity. Occasional elevated phrasing (“periodically eternal”) momentarily lifts out of POV lexicon but remains coherent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and propulsive, with only minor scaffold (“she’d been assembling clues ever since”). Metaphors are precise; no loops or mixed imagery disrupt the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Transforms climate-fiction tropes by literalizing cyclical time through cartography and bioluminescent code. The synthesis feels inevitable yet fresh; risk-taking with reality-rewrite pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
