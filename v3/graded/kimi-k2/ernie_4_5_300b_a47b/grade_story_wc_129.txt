<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Kael’s “boldly sympathetic” trait is dramatized through his obsessive search and the embodied ache of loneliness, but the interior contradiction between yearning and fear of rejection is only sketched; the final shared ache lands as earned yet not fully costed on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the reveal that Lira is Veyra crystallizes the stake of kinship and leaves the shared ache as visible cost. Causal chain holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens; however, the orchard’s thinning visitors is asserted rather than dramatized, muting the before/after contrast.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The crystalline orchard and glass trees are vividly filtered through Kael’s artisan eye; the obsidian arbor reappears as charged mirror in the final beat. Yet the crater’s physical rules remain ornamental—no constraint on tactics—so the setting supports atmosphere more than choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—rekindling community via Veyra—escalates through each discovered tag, tightening the search. The final reveal narrows options from solitary quest to shared bond, but the cost (lost anonymity for Lira, emotional exposure for Kael) is implied more than dramatized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of kinship emerges organically from Kael’s sculptures and the glowing murals; the final image of two figures beneath the arbor offers a non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext in Lira’s hidden identity enriches the theme, though the orchard’s decline is more asserted than felt.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet anchored in Kael’s tactile craft; perceptual signature is consistent, with glass-sap stains and reed-calloused hands. Compression and patterned elision (“time pooled like liquid mercury”) are taught early and paid off in the final shimmer.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lush but disciplined; only minor loops (“luminescent ache” twice, “glass trees” echo) and one mixed metaphor (“threads had frayed” in glass orchard) slightly dull momentum. Density is high, rhythm varied, and no artifact intrudes on the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Fusion of glass-orchard cosmology with street-art mystery feels fresh; the arbor as mutual signature is an elegant, inevitable twist. Risk-taking in lyric world-building heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, though the premise edges close to familiar “seeker finds artist” arc.</comment>
