<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kael’s interiority is vivid—his belief that “truth isn’t a blade but a kaleidoscope” seeds every choice—but the elders remain off-page caricatures, so status pressure is abstract. His embodied climb and brush-stroke act show micro-choice under cost, yet the forgiveness epiphany arrives more stated than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the canyon’s refracted light reweights the elders’ lie with visible social cost (their chants falter, villagers rapt). Causal chain—ink → glow → light burst—holds under Accumulative/Textural lens; one tightening suffices.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The bone towers and mist-shrouded spire are never mere backdrop; the spire’s shimmer literally refracts the canyon’s reality, constraining Kael’s final tactic. Sensory detail is selective—damp stone, iron scent—filtered through POV urgency.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—shatter the elders’ monolithic truth—escalates through Kael’s escalating poetic defiance; the light burst forces a visible trade-off (heretic label tomorrow). One deepening beat suffices under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: forgiveness as disruptive lens rather than submission. Final image of “light painted their world anew” offers non-literal resonance without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Voice is textured—compressed lyric cadence, canyon-echo diction—stable in third-person close. No head-hopping; perceptual signature (“crooked teeth against a bruised sky”) remains consistent under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; occasional stacked metaphors (“lens,” “mirror,” “kaleidoscope”) verge on overwriting but never stall momentum. No loops or scaffold in final third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Familiar “artist vs dogma” frame is refreshed by the physics of refraction as rebellion and the canyon’s living acoustics. Risky light-burst climax feels earned, not gimmick.</comment>
