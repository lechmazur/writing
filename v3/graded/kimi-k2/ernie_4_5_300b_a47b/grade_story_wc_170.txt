<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lirael’s interiority is vivid—embodied in the slick prism, the locket’s pulse, the sweat of effort—yet her contradictory impulses (hope vs. grief) are stated more than dramatized mid-scene. The final renunciation (walking away depleted) is earned, but the cost is more asserted than felt on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the mirrors stabilize, the song ends, and the terrace “remembers” while possibilities root elsewhere. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each mirror’s glow layers density until the final cadence shift. Cost is legible in her heaving chest and the drained locket, though the conceptual price could be sharper.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The wet-stone terrace, prism parapet, and jasmine air are selective and POV-filtered; the prism’s slick surface literally guides her touch and refracts the song. Setting constrains posture and tool use, but the final image doesn’t hinge on a specific environmental constraint—still, the charged reprise of “echoing terrace” tightens the resonance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—persuade mirrors to show extra-reflective possibilities—is signaled early and escalates through each mirror’s glow. The tightening is the third mirror’s forest path, which crystallizes her choice to release the song fully. Cost is visible exhaustion, yet the trade-off (what she forfeits) remains slightly abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of art as transference—mirrors holding secrets, song birthing unseen worlds—emerges through concrete action, never sermon. The final meadow image reweights the premise: reflection is no longer passive but generative. Ambiguity lingers without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with perceptual signature in “colors bleed where her touch distorted the light.” Rhythm modulates with effort—short clauses under fatigue, longer lullaby lines during persuasion. No head-hopping; compression and elision are taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and conceptual work. No loops or scaffold, though occasional elevated diction (“bioluminescent”) momentarily lifts above POV lexicon. Metaphors cohere and serve the mirror motif.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The mirage-painter who sings mirrors into alternate futures is a fresh synthesis; the borrowed heartbeat as metronome is specific and non-obvious. Risk in lyric accumulation pays off in the final charged poise. No derivative echoes.</comment>
