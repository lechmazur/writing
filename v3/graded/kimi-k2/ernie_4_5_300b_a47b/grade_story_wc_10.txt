<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lirael’s interiority is embodied and specific (trembling hands, breath visible) and her motivation to “rectify silence” is consistently rooted in the trauma of the capsize. The relationship with Elias acts as a crucible that forces her to renegotiate her stance toward communication, culminating in the earned stasis of embracing silence as language. Micro-choices (adjusting the case, attaching electrodes) reveal hierarchy of values. Minor slip: “silently expressive” edges toward label-speak mid-scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the final image of the conservatory “alive with invisible music” crystallizes the new meaning of silence and carries felt cost—the irrevocable loss of her voice. Causal chain is clean: trauma → silence → heat-mapping experiments → shared vibration with Elias → global recognition. One transition (word spreading) is legible and brief. No orientation debt; anchors established within first 100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The winterglass conservatory is not mere backdrop; its iced panes refract light and transmit vibrations, literally enabling the climax when the plants dance to the silent melody. Micro-setting (the bench, the frost-etched case) constrains every adjustment of the forks. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered: cold air, visible breath, faint hum through glass. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly; no impossible positions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—proving silence can be expressive—is signaled early and tightened through each experiment; the moment the first audible note emerges narrows options irrevocably. Agency is continuous: Lirael chooses to map memories, to let Elias stay, to release the compositions publicly. Cost is visible: the original scream swallowed by storm is never reclaimed; instead she forfeits conventional music for an unvoiced art. No coincidence resolves; all escalation is driven by her iterative choices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: silence as presence rather than absence. The final image of the conservatory “alive with invisible music” offers a non-literal answer that reweights every prior beat without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture and silence—Elias’s sketches, Lirael’s note scraps—rather than exposition. The motif of the tuning forks recurs with shifting meaning, constraining choices and charging the closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited remains stable, with perceptual signature filtered through Lirael’s sensory priorities (thermal shifts, vibration, refracted light). Diction is precise and voice-consistent: “winterglass,” “unshaken marvels,” “captured starlight.” No dialogue is required; the few written notes carry subtext and advance plot. Rhythm modulates with pressure—short clauses during calibration, longer cadences at the breakthrough.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, vivid, and propulsive. Figurative language is selective (“glass panes thick as ice”) and never muddles causality. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances story or atmosphere. Occasional elevated diction (“rectify the silence”) is earned by the character’s composer background. No artifacts in the final third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise—music without sound transmitted via heat-mapped emotion—feels fresh yet inevitable. Tropes of trauma and recovery are transformed through the specific device of the tuning forks and the winterglass medium. The synthesis of botany, physics, and grief is non-obvious and fully committed. Risky structural choice (no spoken dialogue) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
