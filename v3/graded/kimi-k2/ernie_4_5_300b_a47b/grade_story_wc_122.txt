<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lila’s interiority is embodied (numb hands, hollow chest) and her micro-choice to fit the copper wire is character-specific. Motivation (defeat numbness) is clear and intensifies. However, the final “found her voice” is slightly abstract; the cost (tears, ache) is felt but not foreclosed with visible consequence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the reversed Coltrane reweights silence from void to container, with felt cost in Lila’s tears. Causal linkage holds—broken needle → copper wire → reversed vinyl → hush that dissolves numbness. Orientation is clear by line 3; one legible transition (days pass) fits scope.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Cavern walls, hides, frost at the entrance are selective and purposeful; the drum’s smaller body for Lila constrains her next choice. Sensory balance favors touch and vibration over visual catalog. Micro-setting (phonograph horn, copper coil) charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—defeat emotional numbness—is signaled early and tightened when the reversed music forces a trade-off: surrender to ache or remain numb. Agency is decision to play backward; cost is the sudden weight of feeling. One meaningful escalation suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: silence as generative rather than empty. Subtext lives in gesture (trace, sign, tears) and mirrored hush. Final image of “thread of quiet” reweights prior material without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays close to Lila’s perceptual bias—vibration over sound. Elias’s gravelly diction is distinct; dialogue is spare and goal-driven. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense. Occasional elevated diction (“palimpsest of emotion”) slightly drifts from Lila’s lexicon but does not obscure clarity. No loops or scaffold; final line lands with cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: deaf music teacher + reversed vinyl + filament of hush feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk of gimmick is avoided by grounding in tactile experience. Specificity (copper wire, drum hide) transforms familiar tropes.</comment>
