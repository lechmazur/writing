<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is concrete—her hands brushing dust from the bell, her resolve “gently persistent”—and her choice to expose the givers is earned by prior beats. The final renunciation of anonymity carries visible social cost: donations stop, notes replace gifts, and she accepts the widow’s squeeze as payment. Secondary characters remain off-stage, so relationship crucible is N/A; the lone POV is consistent and embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the bell’s spoon-clapper and daily ringing crystallize a new communal language, foreclosing the old secrecy. Causal linkage holds—because Mira names the givers, the pattern of anonymous drops dissolves into open exchange. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (“terra-cotta arbor perched on the ridge”) and held throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The terra-cotta tiles, wet-clay smell, and ember-red glow under moonlight are selective and filtered through Mira’s urgency. The arbor itself becomes a micro-setting that constrains choice: it is the stage where anonymity is shed and the bell re-hung. No environmental detail is wasted; each guides the communal ritual.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—survival vs. solidarity—is signaled early (“sanctions had crippled the community”). One decisive tightening occurs when Mira rings the bell and names the givers, forcing a trade-off between secrecy and mutual aid. The cost is legible: anonymous safety forfeited for open reciprocity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from action: secrecy as a fragile currency, solidarity as earned risk. Subtext lives in the shift from silent bell to spoon-clapper—ritual repurposed from summoning to celebration. The final image of “who rings” and “who listens” reframes the premise without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Voice is steady, lyrical but grounded; sensory diction (“wet clay,” “embers”) stays within Mira’s perceptual range. No dialogue appears, so dialogue bullets are N/A. Free-indirect style is clean, and the rhythm modulates with the bell’s two rings to mark beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and propulsive; no loops or scaffold detected. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful (“red tiles glowing like embers”). Sentence lengths vary, accelerating around the bell rings. One minor filter verb cluster (“she had told,” “she had noticed”) in the reflective block is acceptable under BRR.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>The premise—sanctions-era commune sustained by secret intergenerational aid—feels fresh through specificity: needlework traded for salt, cellar bread, forbidden river fish. The bell’s transformation from silent relic to celebratory spoon-clapper is an earned reconfiguration rather than gimmick.</comment>
