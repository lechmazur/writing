<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority is specific—wood grain under her palm, the logbook’s crackle—but the leap from “cartographer of necessary distances” to decisive crossing of the light-door feels slightly under-cooked; the cost (abandoning the terrace forever) is stated rather than embodied. Her contradictory impulses (longing vs. wariness) flicker but do not fully clash in-scene before the threshold moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the light-door appears because Lira rewrites the code, crystallizing the “necessary distance” motif into an irreversible step. Causal lens holds—each prism alignment, logbook entry, and grain reading tightens toward the final crossing. The drifting terrace’s rule-set stays consistent; no late cheats.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The prism terrace’s refracted hush and shifting corn compass-needles are vivid, selective, and pressure-relevant; the final disappearance of the terrace reconfigures the visual motif into loss. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from terrace to maze heart to field edge.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—why thresholds feel sacred—escalates as each decoded symbol narrows Lira’s options until only the light-door remains. The cost (permanent exile from the terrace) is legible but could be sharper on the page; it’s more conceptual than visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of sacred distance emerges through pattern: codes, grain, prisms, and final blank page—no moralizing. The ending’s reweighting (“Distance is a kind of prayer”) resonates without explicit statement, earned by tactile discovery.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet grounded in sensory precision; the “fractured hush” motif modulates with pressure. Compression and elision (six-year gap handled in two lines) are taught early and paid off. No POV leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; occasional poetic layering (“featherly determined”) risks purple but stays within character lexicon. No loops or scaffold; rhythm accelerates at threshold. One mixed metaphor—“drowning in hush”—slightly blurs physical logic.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The fusion of weather-code mysticism, carpentry divination, and drifting architecture feels fresh and inevitable. The butterfly-effect reframing of sacred space is non-obvious yet fully integrated. Risky lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
