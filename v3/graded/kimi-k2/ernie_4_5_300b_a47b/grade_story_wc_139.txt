<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and stakes-driven; the “ink clarity” moment crystallizes her agency. Father remains off-page, so relationship crucible is absent. Motivation (fair-trade math) is clear but abstract until the final beat, slightly softening cost. Still, her micro-choices under pressure read individual and earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: asylum papers + ink pot = new path, cost is the scroll’s surrender. Causal lens holds—each beat because/therefore. Orientation is swift; prep-room anchors by line 3. One minor slack: agents’ instant stand-down feels slightly convenient.</comment>

<comment>Prep room is sketched with selective sensory hits (lilies, ironed linen, mahogany) that filter through Elara’s vigilance. Spatial choreography stays clean; casket, agents, doorway track. Micro-setting (ink pot as tool) constrains final choice. Could use one tactile detail of the dummy to tighten image.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—protect father’s formula—tightens when agents threaten her. Escalation is one smooth arc: conceal → reveal → negotiate. Agency is active; the ink pot enables the reversal. Cost (loss of scroll) is visible, though emotional sting could be sharper.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of “math vs. power” emerges through action, not lecture. Final line reframes funeral home from death to “breach point,” a quiet CR. Subtext in agents’ fear is effective. One soft moral line—“make sure no one ever has to fake their death again”—leans toward statement.</comment>

<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elara; perceptual signature is cool, analytical, tinged with con-artist savvy. Dialogue is sparse but goal-driven. No head-hop. Prose rhythm tightens under pressure; “wait actively” refrain threads cleanly.</comment>

<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, propulsive; no loops or scaffold. Strong verbs (“unscrewed,” “swirled”) and sensory specificity. One mixed metaphor—“liquid…liquefying rigid thinking”—is borderline but context justifies. Minor filter verb (“she watched”) early on, quickly shed.</comment>

<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Fair-trade economics as life-or-death MacGuffin feels fresh; grafted onto con-artist mythos without cliché. Ink pot’s pseudo-science is specific, not generic magic. Final reconfiguration of funeral home as negotiation space is inventive. Risk is moderate but coherent.</comment>
