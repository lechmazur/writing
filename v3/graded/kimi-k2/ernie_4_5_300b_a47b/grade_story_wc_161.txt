<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s contradictory impulses—shame over the grandfather’s fraud vs. reverence for the relic—are embodied in trembling fingers and ledger-flipping. The final choice to hand-carry the chip is earned by the dream and the dust-map epiphany, with visible cost: abandoning the courier identity. Interiority is specific, but the “balance” refrain edges toward label-speak once too often.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elias forecloses the safety of anonymous delivery and steps into the unknown, cost legible in the fading bookshop smell. Causal chain holds—anonymous note → dust-map → dream → decision—under a Causal lens. One transition (attic → street) is clean. Orientation is anchored by skylight and pigeon within 120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>The attic’s skylight, dust motes, and pigeon cages constrain every move: Elias maps dust because the room’s geometry limits perspective. Sensory detail is selective—sunflower seed, wood polish, tape hiss—and filtered through his obsessions. The setting quietly guides the final choice: leaving the attic means leaving the only map he has.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserve or bury the echo—tightens when the dust reveals a time-map, forcing Elias to abandon the safety of courier anonymity. Escalation is causal: each decoded symbol raises the cost of silence. The price is felt when he ignores client notes and locks the shop door behind him.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme of inheritance vs. invention emerges through objects (ledger, tape, chip) rather than statement. The final image—Elias walking toward the coast with the echo “blooming and withering”—reweights the grandfather’s fraud as a living legacy. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in the untranslatable song.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is tactile and bookish: “smelled of old paper and wood polish,” “dust motes swirled like tiny galaxies.” Syntax tightens under pressure—short clauses when the dream hits. No dialogue, so internal coherence carries the load. Occasional lyrical lift skirts but avoids purple drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and information-dense; each sentence advances image or motive. Metaphors are fresh (“dust motes like tiny galaxies”) and purposeful. Minor scaffold: “balance, he reminded himself” repeats twice. No loops or register drift in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Familiar tropes—mysterious relic, vanished scholar—are re-animated through pigeon courier logistics and dust-mote cartography. The synthesis feels inevitable: of course a man who deciphers wind currents would read time in dust. One fresh inflection: the chip as lullaby rather than weapon.</comment>
