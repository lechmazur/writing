<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Kael’s quiet enthusiasm is embodied in tactile coin-handling and sensor-sync micro-choices; the interior contradiction (skepticism vs. wonder) is present but thin, and the final alignment feels slightly gift-wrapped rather than earned through visible flaw-cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Kael’s raised hands and universe-answering wavelength crystallize the new stance with undeniable cost (loss of prior doubt). Causal chain from coin-circle to signal-thread is legible under an Accumulative/Textural lens; one minor ellipsis mid-scene is tolerated.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The ambered deck, coins, and holographic static form a micro-setting that constrains Kael’s sensor-sync choices and recharges the final image; sensory specificity is selective and purposeful, though “ambered” edges toward over-use.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decode the backwards prophecy to avert existential null—is signaled early and tightened when the spiral vision forecloses skepticism; cost is felt in the shedding of doubt, though the price could be more viscerally dramatized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of alignment-as-purpose emerges organically from Kael’s embodied struggle with static; the final image reweights earlier coin-symbolism without moralizing, leaving resonant ambiguity about what “purpose” actually entails.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Distinct cosmic-lyric texture with controlled rhythm; perceptual signature filters every detail through Kael’s sensor-biased POV. No head-hopping; minor filter-verb clusters (“he felt”) are voice-motivated and do not stall momentum.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is vivid and propulsive, but occasional stacked metaphors (“sparkler of curiosity,” “supernova clarity”) flirt with overwriting; no loops or scaffold in final third, and sentence rhythm accelerates appropriately toward closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of entropy-cosmology and coin-divination; the backwards-prophecy twist feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric compression is purposeful and paid off, though the premise’s high-concept shine slightly overshadows character specificity.</comment>
