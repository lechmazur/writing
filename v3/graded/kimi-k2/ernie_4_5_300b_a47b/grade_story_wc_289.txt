<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lila’s interiority is vivid—her hollow chest, trembling hand—but the epiphany (“now, she understood”) is asserted rather than dramatized with visible cost. The micro-choice to place her secret in the orb is clear, yet the final resolve to “write a letter of her own” is off-page, softening the earned change.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the sinking orb reweights Lila’s prior ghostwriting into a stance of openness. Causal linkage is light—Elara’s guidance is more oracle than pressure—but the final image of dissolving secrets carries undeniable conceptual cost under an Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The lotus temple and pond are rendered with selective sensory detail; the glass orbs floating at dusk become the micro-setting that constrains Lila’s choice. The environment’s prismatic quiet modulates with the stakes, charging the final image as the orbs sink and the water “rippl[es] like liquid light.”</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—fear of disconnection—is signaled early and tightened when Lila writes her secret and watches it vanish. The cost is conceptual (loss of anonymity) rather than visceral, but it forecloses her prior tactic of hiding truths for others.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of connection-through-vulnerability emerges organically from the orb ritual; the spiral motif reweights from wound secrecy to shared truth. Final resonance avoids moralizing, letting the thrush’s song and rippling water imply the new equilibrium.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet grounded in Lila’s perceptual bias—“prismatic quiet,” “liquid light”—with rhythmic control that breathes with emotional intensity. Elara’s speech is slightly more archetypal, but the contrast reads intentional, not head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, vivid, and propulsive; occasional poetic layering (“petal-strewn crown”) stays within the narrator’s lexicon. No loops or scaffold; one mixed metaphor (“thread that connects all things”) is minor.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>The ghostwriter-ghosted-by-her-own-secrets angle is fresh; the orb ritual transforms a familiar “write your secret” prompt into a quiet, earned reconfiguration. Specificity of the lotus temple setting keeps it from feeling generic.</comment>
