<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is vivid and lens-gazer specific; her empathic reading cascades into mid-scene turns that narrow choice (film break, letters). Renunciation is earned as she relinquishes the safe curator role for empathy curator, with visible rumpled film as cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: film density, rain rhythm, and letter ghosting tighten toward closure without causal reversals. Closure lands as Charged Poise—Elise’s grief frame reframed by Mara’s empathy, cost legible in final lilac-scented sigh inside the booth.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Projection booth environment is texture-dense via dust motes, rotary reels, and lilac scent; it supplies the splice kit and primer room that enable the final splice act. Micro-setting pressure alters tactics as Mara’s knee knocks the splice tool to realign the cut.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Unused love stake is visible early and tightened through each beat (letter risk, spliced tear). Price paid is visible film damage and exposure of Elise’s silent grief; stakes escalate under coherent accumulative pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: unused love as crystallized memory; goodbye letters reframed from museum relic to active re-integration. Resonant ending offers non-literal answer—love stored in forgotten footage re-ignited through empathetic lens.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>PoV remains tightly focalized through tactile, biased Mara: she smells lilac, fingers frayed film, and reframes options in whispered internal monologue. No head-hopping; final italicized whisper and crystal flare serve as crystallizing cadence control.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Clean, propulsive prose: rhythmic compression (“smoky quartz sweats, sprocket holes snag”); no looped metaphors. Read-aloud cadence tightens under peak splice as film snaps and rain holds breath, accelerating to breathless closure.</comment>

<grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of holofilm brand relic + empathic curation is non-obvious; risk is low-key but thematic coherence is strong. Not transformative enough for top band—Avantaco closure could swap venue.</comment>
