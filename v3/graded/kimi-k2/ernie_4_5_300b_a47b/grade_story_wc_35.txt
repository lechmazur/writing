<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Nessar’s contradictory impulse—wanting to blunt remorse yet risking deeper entanglement—drives every beat; the moment he tastes the founder’s guilt and chooses to dilute rather than hoard it crystallizes his arc with visible cost (numb fingers, altered gait). Interiority is sensorial and specific (“taste of salt and iron”), never diagnostic. The final renunciation—cooking as humble balm—earns its quietness because the prior beat proved the burden remains. Only minor slip: the guard’s retreat feels slightly convenient, blunting status tension.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Nessar’s stance toward remorse shifts from analytical distancing to embodied carrying, the cost legible in his unsteady legs and tingling tongue. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each sensory accretion (rain, salt, coral chill) reweights the emotional load until the final simmering broth releases it. Orientation is swift; causality is clean. The only hairline slip: the “unspoken dream” frame arrives late and could confuse timeline, but the final image overrides it.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Desert fortress, coral pavilion, and brackish pool are rendered through Nessar’s biased senses—wet stone scent, arctic air on skin—so setting actively constrains choice (door yields only to palm, water numbs). The rain’s aftermath is not backdrop but resource, softening stone and mood alike. Micro-setting (pool’s shifting tidal ink) charges the final image. Spatial choreography is flawless; no white-room drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can remorse be tempered without being transferred wholesale?—is signaled early and tightened when the founder’s memory surges. Nessar’s act of subsuming narrows future options: he must now bear what he sought to erase. The price (physical numbness, shared pallor among guards) is visible, though the escalation is single-arc rather than multi-turn. Still, the deepening feels earned under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: memory as seasoning, remorse as indigestible salt. The cooking coda reframes the entire quest—alchemy not erasure, nourishment not nullification—without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture (wiping salt-stiff apron) and silence (guards’ softer nods). The ambiguity—has he truly lessened the fortress’s burden or merely redistributed it?—lingers productively.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is sensorial, slightly archaic, yet precise: “taste of wet stone after the first rain in a decade.” Syntax modulates with stress—longer clauses in calm, clipped fragments under memory assault. No head-hopping; focalization stays locked to Nessar’s tongue and eyes. Distinct perceptual signature anchors every beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</question>
<comment>Prose is lean and propulsive; every line does at least two jobs (“the air thick with the scent of wet stone” sets place and mood). Metaphors are fresh yet apt (“frozen seafoam,” “grain of sand”). No loops or scaffold; rhythm breathes with scene needs. Minor over-modification in “arctic, the walls lined…” but does not stall momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</question>
<comment>The memory-tasting chef in a regret-storage coral vault is a startling yet inevitable synthesis; the culinary metaphor for emotional alchemy feels entirely new. Risky choice to end on quiet cooking rather than dramatic confrontation pays off because the groundwork (taste, salt, dilution) is laid early. No derivative echoes; specificity anchors the fantastical.</comment>
