<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kael’s interiority is textured—glove-cold, mirror-doubt, father-oil memory—but the “rhythm of repair” motivation is stated more than embodied; the final choice to take the gears is inevitable, not crucible-tested, so the cost feels light.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the gears are found, the clock ticks, and Kael’s stance shifts from seeker to bearer-of-tools. Causal chain holds—prophecy → mirrors → alcove—though the “crescent-moon lock” is a touch too neat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Frozen library and Hall of Mirrors are vivid, selective, and constrain movement; the cracked mirror that “sings” and the frost-rimed shelves charge the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Stakes—“mend time before it splinters”—are signaled early and tightened once when the wrong-coat reflection forces a micro-choice. Cost is present (risk of wrong reflection, cold sapping stamina) but not sharply felt at closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of repair as self-restoration emerges through concrete particulars—father’s workshop scent, mismatched coat, ticking clock—without sermonizing. Final tick reweights the premise quietly, earning resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is consistent, tactile, and slightly archaic (“driftwood nostalgia,” “rime”). Free-indirect style stays clean; no head-hopping. Rhythm modulates with pressure—short clauses during mirror dissolve, longer cadences in reflection.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, vivid, and propulsive; only minor scaffold (“the cold seeping through his gloves” could trim). No loops, no mixed metaphors. Sensory detail is purposeful, not purple.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Frozen cloud-library and mirror-quest feel fresh, but the “crescent-moon lock” and “liquid light vial” flirt with stock fantasy tokens. Specificity of mismatched-coat reflection and father-memory lifts it above template.</comment>
