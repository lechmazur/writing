<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Marlowe’s grief-rooted motive is clear and embodied; his trembling grip and blistered palm show cost. Interiority stays concrete, but the “mournfully eager” label is repeated rather than dramatized in fresh ways. The final collapse and tears earn the change, yet the arc flirts with sentimental shorthand.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each blast of the blower thickens the echo density until the shimmer bursts into voices. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—laughter restored, body spent—cost visible in “tears streaming.” One minor causality wobble: the tunnel’s acoustics are asserted, not taught early.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The tunnel’s condensation, flickering bulb, and grooved laughter scars are selective and tactile. The leaf blower itself becomes micro-setting, its vibrations numbing hands and guiding stance. These details constrain tactics and charge the final image; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore laughter—is signaled early and escalates through physical exhaustion. One decisive tightening: Marlowe keeps blasting until arms are lead and voice is gone, foreclosing retreat. Cost is visceral; no external coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of tending the unspoken emerges organically from action; no explicit moralizing. The half-sung lullabies and mechanical roar fuse into a non-literal answer about grief and reclamation. Final shimmer of voices offers resonant ambiguity without tidy uplift.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Voice is consistent, lyrical yet grounded in tool-sound imagery. Syntax modulates with fatigue—short clauses under strain, longer lines during hope. No POV drift; perceptual signature is distinct. Occasional elevated diction (“macerate the stale air”) slightly jars but stays within stylized frame.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is vivid and propulsive; sensory verbs carry load. Minor loop: “echoes of laughter had once bounced like rubber balls” followed quickly by “echoes of joy that lingered just beyond reach.” No mixed metaphors in peak beats. Rhythm breathes with exertion; final image lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—leaf-blower necromancy of laughter—is fresh and fully committed. Transformation test fails: swap blower for vacuum and core still works, so not fully irreplaceable. Yet the synthesis of grief, tool, and acoustic haunting feels specific and memorable.</comment>
