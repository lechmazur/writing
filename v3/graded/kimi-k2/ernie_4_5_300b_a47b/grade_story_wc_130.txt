<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is luminescent with contradiction, the glass-eye memory tightening her resolve; the refusal to exit grief feels earned. Her single overt decision—aligning the eyes with the mosaic—creates the entire climax and cannot be removed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure is a crystallized Resonant Reconfiguration: the chips dovetail into starlight, making ambiguous loss legible. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—every drip, fissure, and pulsing fruit tightens until Elara’s stance crystallizes with visible cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Each stalactite, vein of sap, and mosaic shard is weaponized as pressure: water constrains footing, mineral channels torque sight, stone fractures become map. The orchard body is materially essential.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Ambiguous loss is the engine: each drip confronts Elara’s refusal; the stone asks for an answer; the final image charges “grief is live geometry.” Stakes compress to a single felt question without sprawl.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from cracked-glass constellations: loss as fractal bloom rather than hole. Non-literal payoff earns resonance without sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Espen’s voice shimmers in Elara’s perception—taxidermist idioms haunting the prose. No sentence leaks outside her fractured, mineral-tuned sensorium.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Rhythmic lull-and-surge mirrors bat wings; no loop artifacts. High density—one sentence often fuses drip, memory, and tactical use of sap.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Combines taxidermy and star-orchard in a synthesis few could imagine; the cracked-glass constellation twist feels inevitable yet new.</comment>
