<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lirael's duality—yearning artist vs. time-sick loner—fuels every micro-choice; but the interior contradiction never fully collides with a beat-level mistake or irreversible cost, so the arc plateaus at earned ache rather than definitive renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens controls: each drafted fortune intensifies the same stake—bending memory into present sound—until final line crystallizes a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost: she relinquishes lived exhaustion for an “unheard” symphony. Closure is unequivocally on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Gleaming lattice, lake ice, velvet cushion—each is specific, filtered through Lirael’s synesthetic memory and constrained by the glass-spire environment; only the spire itself fails to physically channel the final choice, capping at mid-8s.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserve memory-as-music—tightens via rhythmic exhaustion clock plus fortune-by-fortune density; no concrete price is extracted before closure keeps it just sub-9/0.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of memory-as-sound and time’s looping ache emerges purely through prismatic images and refrain-cookies; final “upturned hush” functions as non-literal, non-moralized answer, reweighting without slogan.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Elegantly maintained lyric-ironic voice, rhythm shaped to mounting fatigue; perceptual signature remains singular, with controlled syntactic swell in the final paragraph.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Rich cadence without purple overload; zero paraphrase loops, every line does two jobs; final image compresses time-memory sound into one breath.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fortune-writer as temporal composer feels fresh; mirrored-horizon conceit revivified through synesthesia and frozen lake optics. Slight deduction for inherited “magical object that remembers” trope.</comment>
