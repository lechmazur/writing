<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara is a persuasive, contradictory mix of scientist and mystic, her quiet rebellion against Thalos and herself embodied in trembling hands and a half-held breath. Interior shifts are earned and visible, but the final epiphany still feels narrated rather than dramatized, nudging the score downward.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: “the proof was in the silence.” The causal chain—humming breath → vial glow → distant villager tremor—holds a Situational lens cleanly and costs Elara her margin of youth and certainty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Cobalt tower staging is concrete and reactive: rain scents the air, salt streaks guide Elara’s footfalls, vial glass captures dawn. The lighthouse garden doubles as climatic bell-lute, mirroring internal vibration; removing it guts the sound palette and tension.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Stakes tighten from neighborly rumor to lived tremor; one key middle beat (humming at window) directly narrows options. Cost is felt—Elara’s isolation publicly confirmed—but the external threat never fully materializes, capping ascent.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme crystallizes as “intention travels farther than shouting” via sensory dynamics: scent, vibration, silence. Final reconfiguration re-prices grief and rage overnight, embracing a subtle moral without sermonizing—quiet complexity earned.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Voice remains lyric yet precise—dawn “bleeds gold into bruised sky,” vibrations “like the growl of a distant tide.” Compression and syntactic variation heighten tension without overwriting; minor register lapse in Thalos’s grin-line nudges score lower.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Lines advance purpose: mirrored metaphors of tide and pulse accelerate toward climax. Occasional lavender/moonflower ornaments edge decorative, but density and rhythm remain tight; no tokens drag closure.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Lighthouse + vibration premise is fresh, but supernatural mechanism (whisper-travel) risks familiar trope; specificity rescues it. Synthesis is modest rather than revelatory; still distinctive enough for mid-tier accolade.</comment>
