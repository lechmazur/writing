<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elias’s contradictory impulses—clinging to the strap yet seeking mercy—play out in embodied micro-choices (pressing forehead to tree, letting spores burn). The final “I’m bracing” crystallizes an earned stance with visible cost. Interiority is specific, but the woman’s pressure arrives late, muting relationship crucible impact.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elias releases the tree yet keeps the strap, reconfiguring survival from formula to open question. Causal chain holds—UV spores, proprioceptive flare, woman’s touch tighten options toward the final step. Cost is legible in the burning spores and the retained mask.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>UV forest is immediate, reactive, and constrains every beat—light flares at skin contact, spores burn, ground hum guides stance. Micro-setting (tree pulse, strap bite) functions as setting-as-constraint. Sensory hierarchy stays locked to Elias’s hyper-aware POV.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can mercy be measured?—tightens when the woman’s “choice not equation” forces Elias to renounce the math and endure uncertainty. Escalation is one deepening, not multiple reversals, but the cost (burning spores, retained strap) is on-page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: UV torture reframed as forest language, mask as both shackle and talisman. Final image—“mathematics of mercy take root in his bones” as a question—reweights prior motifs without moralizing. Subtext in spore halo and pewter teeth glint.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is tactile, proprioceptive, and lyrically compressed (“metronome set to chaos”). Patterned elision (no exposition dumps) taught early and paid off in the final cadence. Distinct perceptual signature under stress; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language serves pressure without clutter. Occasional elevated diction (“ultraviolet penance”) fits the altered sensorium. No loops or scaffold; rhythm modulates with scene pulse.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: interrogation tech reimagined as living forest, mercy as unsolved equation. Risky lyric mode commits fully and lands coherent closure. Specificity of pewter strap and UV spores prevents generic dystopia.</comment>
