<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority is vivid—her raw fingers, the humming, the silent pact with the sleepwalker—but the “hauntingly optimistic” trait is asserted rather than embodied in a costly choice. The final smile feels slightly unearned because the stakes of failure (what she personally forfeits) remain abstract. Still, her micro-choices (threading the robe, aligning plates) track motive cleanly to closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the merged plates and glowing threads reconfigure the labyrinth from ruin to hymn with visible cost—the plates empty, the canyon lightening. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each stitched thread increases luminous density until the final cadence shift. One minor ellipsis—how the plates’ emptiness feeds the tide pools—keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The red stone corridors, cracked pedestal, and returning tide pools are selective, tactile, and mirrored in Lira’s body (raw fingers, glowing pocket). The labyrinth’s pulse constrains her path and supplies the literal canvas for sewing. A hairline slip: “the canyon had no sky” slightly blurs temporal anchoring, but the final reflection in the tide pools recharges the setting as closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore reverence from ruin—is signaled early and tightened once: the merging of plates forecloses retreat; the cost is the plates’ emptied purpose. Pressure escalates via accumulative density of glowing threads rather than causal reversals. A crisper articulation of what Lira personally loses would push it higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of mending broken precedents emerges organically through the act of sewing; no explicit moralizing. The final image—tide pools refilling—offers a non-literal, resonant answer. Subtext in the silent sleepwalker pact deepens the meditation on collective repair. Slight thematic drift toward sentimentality in “promise of what could be remade” holds it under 9.0.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise—“thread trail[ing] behind her like a question mark,” “labyrinth shuddered… in recognition.” Perceptual signature is consistent: Lira notices through a weaver’s bias (texture, color, tension). No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates with fatigue. Compression and elision (“hours passed, or maybe minutes”) are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and musical without purple overload; each sentence layers image, motion, and emotion. No loops or scaffold; strong verbs (“unspooling,” “seeping”) replace modifiers. One mixed metaphor—“exhausted eyes” for tide pools—barely grazes clarity. Rhythm accelerates during stitching and breathes at the cavern, mirroring tension.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The fusion of textile magic, dream cartography, and canyon archaeology feels fresh and inevitable. Risky lyric structure holds; the labyrinth as nervous system and the sleepwalking-path method are non-obvious yet fully integrated. Transformation test passes: swap any element and the story collapses. A half-point shy only because the “storybook plate” device flirts with familiar portal-fantasy trope before transcending it.</comment>
