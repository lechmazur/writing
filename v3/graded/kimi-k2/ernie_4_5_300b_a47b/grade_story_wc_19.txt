<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Lila’s yearning for silence-flavors is embodied early through tactile dread of metal quiet, but the interior contradiction never sharpens into visible friction during her ascent; she floats, she clutches, she mourns, yet her micro-choice to let the doll go is under-ritualized—more floated than earned. The growth sprout substitutes for direct fallout from that choice rather than forcing a renunciation or crystallized stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration: the porcelain loss → green sprout reweights the gilded hush into living, rootward hope with visible conceptual cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: image-density increases (doll-float, vine-grasp, final sprout) reconfigure the dominant stake from collecting silence to seeding future quiet. Causality however loosens in the middle beat; the sprout’s emergence feels associative, not logically compelled by inversion physics or her agency.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The xenial trellis is vivid—flowers thriving in thin air, honey-silence taste, light-swallowing doll—yet it is rendered more postcard than constraint; it serves mood more than obstacle. The bunker floor-crack sprout functions as micro-setting-object that constrains her lingering grief and seeds her next move, satisfying the 9+ gate barely.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</degree><comment>Early stake clearly signaled: collect flavors of silences while gravity window narrows choices. Inversion hour tightens once—clock countdown, risk of exposure—yet no second trade-off or trade-off cost manifests on page besides brief sorrow over doll’s loss; price stays conceptual rather than embodied until sprout. Pressures operate accumulatively through imagery not causality, consistent with lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of listening to and germinating silences emerges non-declaratively through inversion ritual and final living sprout. Ending reconfigures without moral: silence can be planted, not only consumed. Final line’s hopeful cadence reweights earlier dread yet stays consistent with ambiguous dread-hope tone throughout.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Lyrical compression and sensory synesthesia (“silence tasted of honey”) establish youthful wonder but occasionally verge on overwriterly (“intangibly tangible” tagline); voice holds. Free indirect slips into editorial distance only once (“She’d learned…”); otherwise perceptual signature stays anchored in claustrophobic wonder and metallic dread.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Prose reads aloud, rhythmic and textured but suffers from stacked metaphors (“sprout wings of patience,” “stretching contracted fears”). One instance of near duplicate phrasing in hatch-descent. Small figurative muddle mid-inversion costs clarity a notch yet resolves into crisp final sprout image without harming closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</question>
<comment>Concept of monthly gravity-flip as escape hatch feels fresh, grounded in sensory specificity rather than trope parade. Transformation of silence from taste-object to seedable medium is non-obvious synthesis. Only slight risk overreliance on lyric compression rather than grounded stakes.</comment>
