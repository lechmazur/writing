<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lirael’s interiority is vivid—her throat tightening at the spirits’ paradoxical tenderness, her palm to the earth—but the “moment before deciding” remains abstract; no single micro-choice visibly forecloses a path. The shard’s warming and smoothing is a felt cost, yet the shift from regret to courage is more stated than dramatized. Still, embodied emotion and consistent motive keep her above mid-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the shard’s dulled edges and the spirits’ final “Go. Live. Speak.” crystallize a stance shift with felt cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of condensation letters intensifies until moonset reweights meaning. Orientation is anchored early; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mangrove roots “clawed at the sky,” peat-rich earth, moonlit water—selective sensory triangulation that constrains movement and mood. The gargoyle shard and singing spirits function as micro-setting objects that charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; no white-room drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</question><comment>Dominant stake—retrieving unsent apologies—tightens through escalating condensation messages; each dissolving line narrows Lirael’s emotional options. Cost is visible: shard warms, edges smooth, dawn ends the ritual. Agency drives the escalation; coincidence does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of unspoken love and forgiveness emerges through the shard, spirits’ songs, and vanishing letters; no explicit moralizing. Final image of smooth-edged shard and lighter steps offers non-literal resonance. Complexity lingers: wounds remain, yet beauty is possible.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise—“fierce tenderness,” “keening songs of spirits who’d long since forgotten their names.” Syntax modulates with emotional crests; no head-hopping. Distinct perceptual signature sustained under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with scene needs; no loops or scaffold. Metaphors (“roots clawed,” “letters linger like ghosts”) are fresh and coherent. High information density; every sentence advances atmosphere or interiority. Minor elevated diction fits medium tone.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</question><comment>Fusion of cathedral gargoyle shard with mangrove spirits and unsent letters feels non-obvious yet inevitable. Tropes of ghost-messages and healing nature are transformed through tactile specificity. Risk in lyric mode pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
