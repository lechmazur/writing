<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Elara is consistent but thin—glass artisan identity never presses on the stakes; her communion action feels ornamental rather than character-forcing. No interior contradiction or cost; she registers more as placid observer than active lens.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single scene holds causal tension: prism ritual → pattern reading → reflection shift. Orientation is clear; climax lands a gentle yet legible resonant reconfiguration via sunrise image and notebook note, though cost is more mood than consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Pearl Bay dawn provides vivid sensory anchor and quietly constrains the ritual space, grounding the prism play. Mist and cold water affect Elara’s body and timing, integrating setting into choice rather than backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding value in the mundane—is more thematic posture than escalating pressure. Conflict is static appreciation; no tightening or felt tradeoff until the quiet closure, which softens rather than deepens stakes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of luminous ordinariness emerges organically via glasswork and ripples without preaching, culminating in notebook insight. Final image reweights grandmother’s legacy and future practice; lacks sharper moral friction so stops shy of top band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Liquid, sensory prose mirrors glass-worker perception; controlled lyric rhythm under dawn hush. No POV drift or filter clutter; voice remains coherent and specific.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Sentence music supports reflective calm, no loops or purple drift. Selective sensory detail and rhythmic breathing sentences elevate without obscuring cause. Clean mechanics.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Blends quiet daily magic with glass and light; familiar ingredients feel fresh via intimate bay setting. Prism reframing of mundane is specific, though risk level is low—safe lyric rather than bold conceptual twist.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade>
<comment>Glazier role frames perception but doesn’t drive conflict; choices are minimal, mainly throwing a stone and writing a note.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Prism appears early in setup, returns in closing image to cast rainbows and inspire inscription, reweighting legacy; no active two-beat use.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.7</grade>
<comment>Noctilucent reckonings are poetic theme, never defined or pressured as tactic; stays decorative.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade>
<comment>"Reads between lines" voiced but never shown altering a decision; remains label without cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade>
<comment>Commune action—stone throw + ripple reading—anchors scene but doesn’t escalate or foreclose path; more mood ritual.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.6</grade>
<comment>Pond patterns ritualized; mechanics are implicit and never challenged or varied, limiting causal weight.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Bay dawn supplies sensory envelope and constrains ritual timing; not a tactical variable beyond weather.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade>
<comment>"Before everything shifts" frames emotional threshold rather than ticking clock; serves as gentle bookend.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Motivation is explicit and drives final notebook moment with felt quiet payoff; lacks stronger external tension.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Meditative lyrical tone sustains across beats, modulates subtly with sunrise brightness; complexity grows through image rather than conflict.</comment>
