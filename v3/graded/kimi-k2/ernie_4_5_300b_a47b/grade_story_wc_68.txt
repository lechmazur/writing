<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias’s contradictory urges—idolizing a brass cog versus despairing at human forgetting—show simultaneously without tidy resolution. Micromoves (hands bleed while digging, refusal to sell) reveal values hierarchy. The final stance of “understood in sewer’s abrasive calm” earns Earned Stasis with visible price.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Causal linkage: gnawing need to exhume relics triggers scavenging, oppositions with Mara that tighten, and culminates in crystallized final image where cog + needle reconfigure meaning. Closure (Charged Poise) lands with conceptual cost: he trades open future for rebellion.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Sewer’s stench anchors who/where early; sedimentary layers supply tactile constraints for digging and history. Sunken plaza and brass oil lamp function as micro-setting that guides action, though broader geography drifts.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: save ancestral navigation from digital forgetting. Escalation driven by Elias’s digging choices: each sediment layer forecloses prior tactics (Mara forces sell-or-keep cutoff). Closure crystallizes stance with felt cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through artifact digging as rebellion against progress-as-eraser. Final image (cog+needle lined with dusk glow) reweights the thesis without sermon. Complexity preserved, no tidy moral delivered.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Distinct perceptual signature: “putrid perfume,” “algae-choked water,” wound-based interiority. Rhythm varies under stress; no head hopping. Experimental lyricism (time as layered) taught early and paid off in closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud diminuendo to quiet ending works. High density, yet no loop artifacts except sporadic generic modifiers (“moldy tomes”). Metaphor “time is layered” reins in without purple infraction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Concept of salvaging navigation via drowned cog is fresh angle on steampunk ruins. Shifts navigational pedantry into charged rebellion. Non-obvious synthesis feels inevitable by end.</comment>
