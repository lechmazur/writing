<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira’s claustrophobia is embodied (shallow breaths, walls pressing) and directly conflicts with her drive to descend; the gold-fleck choice to slap it onto the terminal while water rises is a credible, costly micro-choice that crystallizes her hierarchy of values—proof over safety. The brother-motivation is cleanly threaded through present action rather than backstory dump. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible N/A.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the holographic blip reweights the premise—brother’s “presence” archived in cable field—at visible cost (facility flooding, gold dimming). Causal lens holds: each beat (descent, codex retrieval, catalyst activation) tightens options until only exit-with-proof remains. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by 80 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Facility’s rust-salt air, moss-slick walls, and rising tide are vivid, selective, and directly constrain movement and time. The spiral staircase and terminal pedestal act as micro-settings that force tactical choices. Final image of cables as “memorials” recharges the setting with conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove brother existed via illuminant gold—signaled early. Escalation is coherent: tide clock narrows time, each step deeper increases physical and psychological cost. Final hologram blip is earned by prior causal chain, not coincidence, and forecloses further search.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of invisible memory made visible emerges through concrete events (gold tracking signal, cables as archive) without moralizing. Final reconfiguration of cables into “memorials” offers resonant, non-literal answer to the thematic question of how the unremembered persist.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is consistent, claustrophobic POV with tactile diction (“moss-slicked,” “crashing hush”). Compression and sensory narrowing under stress feel intentional; no head-hop or register drift. Rhythm modulates with rising water and panic.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, vivid, propulsive; only minor filter-verb clusters (“seemed to press”) and one mixed metaphor (“star trapped in amber” vs. “fleck”). No loops or scaffold; final image is clean and charged.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fusion of spelunker claustrophobia, undersea cable archive, and phase-transition gold feels fresh and inevitable. Risky compression of speculative tech into 700 words pays off; no derivative echoes.</comment>
