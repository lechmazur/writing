<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is vivid—“breath fogged… logically emotional” embodies the contradiction driving him—and micro-choices (dial adjustments, palm on ice) tie motive to action. The ghost exchange flips intimidation into consent, a beat under pressure that pays prior causality. Cost feels visceral: sweat, blurring vision, exhaustion after “sonic absolution.” Only flaw: minor repetitions—“logically emotional,” “adapted once more” near the end read as label-restates, not new pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the ghost vanishes after Elias proves the key is a bridge, not a lock; the lighthouse beam “guiding ships—and perhaps souls—home” crystallizes that stance with felt cost (body spent). Accumulative/Textural lens held: every wave of sound thickens until pattern breaks into acceptance. Orientation clean; anchors drift-ice marina / twilight are legible within one beat. No loophole resolutions.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Icy planks crunching, light slicing tangerine, boot-prints in frost—select sensory detail grounds stakes (“ice creaked beneath him” as reminder of fragility). Key, resonator, and sunset jointly charge the final image: Elias carries both metal and dying light, physical tools tethering spirit world. Setting constrains choice—time pressure from sunset, unstable footing on ice. No white-room drift.</comment>

<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: preserve key’s balance before darkness. Tightens once: ghost’s lunge forces Elias to trade bodily stamina for harmonic answer; escalation reads as density increase under Accumulative lens. Cost is legible—“his legs burned.” Luck only externalizes stakes (sunset fade) rather than resolves. Stakes remain personal, not world-ending, scaled to length.</comment>
<question>5</question>
<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme of bridging life/death emerges from concrete objects (resonator, key) and final beam’s dual guidance—articulated nowhere, implied everywhere. No final-paragraph thesis. Subtext in ghost’s bow, Elias’s laugh “both relieved and awestruck” crystallizes the ethically nuanced acceptance of coexistence.</comment>
<question>6</question>
<grade>8.9</question>
<comment>POV remains tight third-person interior, voice salted by Elias’s bias—tools named over emotions. Syntax flexes for pressure: long sentence before ghost, clipped fragments during clash. Phrases like “logically emotional” reappear but stay character-coded, not authorial commentary. Dialogue sparse, goal-driven: ghost’s hiss is more texture than exposition.</comment>
<question>7</question>
<grade>8.7</question>
<comment>Rhythm ebbs and surges with tension; metaphors sharp—“flickered like a broken film reel”—but stay specific, not ornamental. Info-dense lines: “resonator’s purpose shifted” advances both plot & character. Rare paraphrase loops (“balance… fragile… balance” 2 lines apart) mildly dull. Otherwise muscular, readable aloud.</comment>
<question>8</question>
<grade>7.6</question>
<comment>Combines lighthouse mystique with techno-ethereal necromancy; the sonic-runic artifact feels new because it springs from Elias’s occupation, not gimmickry. Frozen marina setting offers fresh stage for spectral negotiation. Overfamiliar metaphor “bleed tangerine and lavender sunset” is lone echo of stock imagery; otherwise particulars feel bespoke.</comment>
