<comment>Lira’s interiority stays largely poetic label—“spiralingly calm”, “shadow without a voice”—and never collides with contradictory impulse; the lone micro-choice (tilting shutters) doesn’t visibly trade against her attribute, so the ending reads as tableau continuation, not earned cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Closure is lyrical tableau (Charged Poise reconfiguration: darkness seen diffracted) rather than causally compelled shift; the “cost” (Lira’s nightly return) is forecast not enacted. Under Accumulative/Textural lens the image lands satisfyingly, but a single tightening is minimally present.</comment>

<comment>The dock’s textures—cobalt boards, rain, rust—are visceral and purpose-driven, constraining footing, visibility, and light angles. Final shot of light on water reprises the dock as micro-setting, cementing score.</comment>

<grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake (“teach darkness the value of stars”) remains poetic and abstract rather than tested; pressure plateaus rather than tightens. Tension derives from description layers, but no on-page fork or felt price is enacted.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges solely through image: mirrored stars reframed inside night, a non-didactic answer to “why beauty matters.” Sentiment is conveyed via sensory choreography, achieving resonance without overt statement.</comment>

<comment>Prose is lyrical and coherent; metaphor is lush but occasionally self-conscious and cadences repeat. Distinct perceptual signature (“bruised sky like a bruise on glass”) sustains atmosphere under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Line-level craft is precise, rhythm varied, imagery vivid; near-epithet loops (“darkness”, “whispers”) and abstract filler (“some unspoken ache”) cause minor density drag but never obscure meaning at closure.</comment>

<comment>Fresh fusion of canal guardian, dental mirror as star-projector, plus silent-empathy frame—all grounded in tactile dock logistics. Risk is lyrical; originality shows in seamless integration, not gimmick.</question>
