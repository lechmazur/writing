<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—her tactile obsession with time’s texture is embodied in every gesture—but the final “quiet certainty” feels slightly abstract, not fully paid for by prior embodied cost. The retrocognitive trait is dramatized under pressure, yet her decisive shift from unraveling to remembering is more asserted than earned on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the garden re-stabilizes, photographs glow, and Elara’s stance crystallizes into designing “to remember.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern intensifies, then reweights meaning. Cost is felt in the fragment’s dulling and the vanished visions, though the beat could be sharper.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The living bridge garden is not backdrop but active loom: vines retract, paths stretch, bridge pixelates—each shift constrains Elara’s tactics and charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered; the scent of ozone and salt carries emotional residue. Micro-setting (bench, fragment) functions as extension of character mind.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—grasping time’s texture—tightens when the fragment’s activation forces a trade-off: pursue total unraveling or accept stabilized memory. Escalation is one decisive intensification under Accumulative lens; cost is the loss of retrocognitive access. Agency is clear, though external pressure remains largely metaphorical.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: memory as story vs. fabric. The final image of photographs glowing with “inner light” reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext operates in the garden’s living silence and the fragment’s dulling. Complexity is honored—no tidy resolution, only a shifted stance toward remembrance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with rhythmic control that accelerates under pressure (“the bridge collapsed into a shower of sparks”). Perceptual signature is consistent—Elara notices through a designer’s spatial logic. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens as visions surge. Occasional elevated diction (“hyperbolic geometry”) is justified by her professional lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is patterned and paid off (“veins…slow-motion symphonies”). No loops or scaffold. Sentence rhythm mirrors the garden’s pulse—long, winding clauses that snap into fragments at climax. Minor register drift in “conceptual repricing” phrase, but clarity remains intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses hedge-maze design, retrocognition, and living architecture into a fresh synthesis. The hyperbolic-garden loom feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric compression succeeds without obscuring causality. Transformation test passes—swap any element and the whole unravels.</comment>
