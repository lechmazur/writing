<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara’s rationality is shown through methodical foraging and cautious use of the eye, but interior contradiction is thin; her hope at the end feels more asserted than earned. Jorn’s paranoia supplies external pressure, yet their shared history is only sketched. The glass eye’s cost—loss of conversational control—is implied rather than dramatized in her own speech.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: storm → seek shelter → receive ledger → decide to “occlude.” Closure is a Charged Poise (“We occlude…”) that reconfigures next steps with felt social risk. One transition (orchard → hut) is clean; orientation anchors by line 5. No causality breaks, though ledger’s sudden appearance is lightly convenient.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The ravine orchard is vivid—branches “bent low under the weight of truffles,” boots sinking in damp soil—and the storm actively narrows choices, forcing the hut retreat. Micro-setting (glass eye, ledger) constrains tactics. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered; no white-room syndrome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—protecting fragile psychological safety—faces a concrete test when the ledger threatens exposure. Escalation is single but sufficient: discovery of names tightens the noose. Cost is conceptual (risk of destabilizing the peace Mara sells) and acknowledged on page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme of truth as both poison and tool emerges organically through the eye’s paradoxical honesty and the ledger’s exposure. Final line reframes “occlude” as ethical choice, not evasion. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers about whether safety bought by selective truth is sustainable.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice is controlled, lyrical yet precise—“orchard hung in the ravine like a chandelier of green.” POV stays tight to Mara; no head-hopping. Dialogue with Jorn carries subtext (“They’re coming for me”) and advances plot. Rhythm modulates with storm pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and image-rich; no loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated diction (“psychological safety was a currency”) fits the near-future register. Metaphors are coherent; no mixed vehicles. Final paragraph’s cadence slows to mirror the new calm.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Post-empathy-virus economy and truth-sickness optics feel fresh; the glass eye as honesty-inducing relic is a novel twist on the “truth serum” trope. Specificity of truffle-foraged anesthetics grounds the speculative frame. Risky concept executed without gimmickry.</comment>
