<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is vivid—her “warmly inquisitive nature prickling” is embodied, not labeled—but the final hand-to-chest beat feels slightly unearned because the widow’s grief has been kept at arm’s length; the cost is legible yet not fully dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Mara’s “I ascend” crystallizes her new stance and forecloses servant passivity. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each object (diary, goggles) layers meaning until the final image reweights the premise with felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The icebound spire is more than backdrop; its frosted glass and thinning clouds mirror Mara’s narrowing options, and the goggles reveal hidden ice-veins that directly shape her choice to keep the diary. Environment constrains and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</question>
<comment>Dominant stake—Mara’s choice between obedience and truth—tightens once when she pockets the diary; the cost (risking the widow’s wrath) is visible. Pressure escalates under Accumulative lens via object density rather than causal turns.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</question>
<comment>Theme of “joy beneath anguish” emerges through the phoenix symbol and cracked goggles, not exposition. The final exchange reweights grief as generative flame, offering resonant ambiguity without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</question>
<comment>Voice is distinct—compressed, lyrical, and filtered through Mara’s perceptual bias (“dust sparkled like starlight”). No head-hopping; diction stays within servant POV. Rhythm modulates with elevator lurches and emotional peaks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</question>
<comment>Prose is lean yet textured; no loops or scaffold. Occasional poetic compression (“grief like a second skin”) risks overwriting but is earned by pattern. Final cadence slows to crystallize the image cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</question>
<comment>Familiar gothic-ice tropes are refreshed through the servant’s upward gaze and the goggles’ map of “forgotten skies.” The synthesis feels inevitable, not gimmicky, though the encrypted diary conceit edges close to stock.</comment>
