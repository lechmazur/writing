<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority is vivid—her “cheerful gloom” is embodied in humming that fades to sighs—but the final epiphany (“paths are released”) arrives more as thematic statement than as earned emotional cost; no contradictory impulse is dramatized in the closing beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the pool’s image reweights the premise, showing paths vanish by choice not forgetting. Accumulative lens holds—each shard/seed layer deepens pattern until the final ripple reframes memory as release. Cost is felt in Lira’s softened gloom, though the beat is quiet.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The geode’s prismatic light and crater glass are tactile constraints: shards cut, seeds root, the pool dissolves them. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Lira’s tide-washed perception; the final liquid-light image recharges earlier motifs and crystallizes the theme.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—why paths disappear—tightens once when Lira presses seeds into glass and the shard clears; this single deepening reweights the mystery. Pressure is coherent under the Accumulative lens; no external reversals, but the fog-wall image narrows options with visible regret.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: memory as burden versus gift, paths released to spare pain. Subtext lives in the shard’s regret and the bird’s forgotten flight; the final image offers a resonant, non-moral answer without sermonizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct—tide-washed sand skin, “cheerful gloom,” prismatic whispers—sustained across lyric compression. Syntax modulates with emotional crests; no head-hopping or register drift. The prose teaches its pattern early and pays it off in the pool’s quiet reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid; figurative language is purposeful and patterned, not ornamental. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Minor elevated diction (“transliterates,” “conceptual repricing”) fits the recollectionist’s lexicon and does not obscure clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The sea-foam recollectionist, crater-glass memory shards, and migratory-seed cartography synthesize into a fresh, non-obvious mythos. Risky lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry; the premise would collapse if transplanted wholesale.</comment>
