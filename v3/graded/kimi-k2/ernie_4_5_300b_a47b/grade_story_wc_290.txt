<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias’s claustrophobia is embodied early and flares under pressure, but the interior contradiction between fear and resolve is asserted more than dramatized in the moment of choice; the final step through the gateway feels earned yet the cost is more atmospheric than personal.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The causal chain (compass → organ → corridor → key) is legible and lands a decisive change—Elias exits the cathedral’s grip—yet the spatial mutiny rules are taught late, softening the because/therefore clarity at the climax.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stone, starlight, and shifting corridor walls are vividly filtered through Elias’s urgency; the compass and organ act as micro-settings that constrain tactics, though the cathedral’s larger geography remains slightly abstract.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—retrieve the key or remain trapped—is signaled early and tightens once the corridor rebels; the price (claustrophobia, bodily risk) is felt, but the spatial mutiny itself resolves more by magical fiat than by Elias’s further agency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>A wistful theme of rebellion against stifling history emerges through image and action; the final gateway image reweights the cathedral from prison to portal without moralizing, though the idea is more atmospheric than deeply interrogated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays close to Elias’s perceptual signature; sensory diction is precise and rhythmic, with only minor filter-verb clusters that do not stall momentum.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; occasional stacked modifiers (“fractured blues and golds”) flirt with overwriting but never obscure causality or dull the final beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The fusion of gothic space-bending with a claustrophobic explorer feels fresh; the compass-as-threshold and living architecture avoid cliché, though the organ’s ghostly agency edges familiar tropes.</comment>
