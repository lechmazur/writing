<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lirael’s interiority is textured—her trembling hands, the moth-wing relic, the interrupted breathing—but the story stops short of letting contradictory impulses collide in-scene; the final “peace” is asserted rather than dramatized through a visible cost. No secondary character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the monarch’s ascent reconfigures Lirael’s stance, and the lattice’s inevitable dissolution is the felt cost. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of silk, wing, light, and breath accrue until the final image reweights the premise. Orientation is immediate; no causality breaks.</comment>

<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The grotto’s moss, mist, and color-shifted sky are vivid and selective, but the setting never physically constrains her choices; it’s atmospheric backdrop rather than tactical obstacle. Micro-setting (the silk lattice) does charge the final image, lifting the score.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—honoring overlooked histories—is signaled early and tightened once when the monarch lands; the cost is the lattice’s transience. Agency is present (knotting, waiting, releasing) but the escalation is gentle, more accretive than decisive.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of transient rootedness emerges organically from silk, wing, and monarch; no moralizing. The final image of the lattice left to dissolve offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of how to honor impermanence.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with controlled rhythm and sensory specificity (“mist curled like spun sugar”). No dialogue; POV remains stable. Occasional elevated diction (“esoteric realist”) is flagged early and consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; figurative language is disciplined. Minor scaffold in the repeated “she thought” constructions, but nothing that dulls the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: using spider-silk lattices as ephemeral memorials to unnoticed deaths. The monarch/moth pairing is specific and non-generic, though the “grotto above the clouds” flirts with fantasy postcard territory.</comment>
