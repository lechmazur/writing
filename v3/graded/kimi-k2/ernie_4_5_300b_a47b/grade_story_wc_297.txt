<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lirael’s interiority is vivid—“her fingers tracing the veins” and scars that “ached now, as if summoned”—but the golden-eyed double speaks in abstract thesis (“fear is a mirror”) that blurs embodied contradiction. The final choice to press the clipping to her heart is earned by prior scar-link mechanics, yet the cost (vanished scars, twin moons) feels externally bestowed rather than wrested from flaw. Still, her micro-choice hierarchy is legible and stakes scale to length.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the covenant is rewoven inside her, sky now “two moons, one silver, one gold.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each sensory layer (ozone, elderberries, scar pulse) thickens until the final image reweights the premise. One causal gap: how pressing a clipping to skin rewrites reality is asserted more than dramatized, but the cost (scars gone, world altered) is visible on the final line.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The cobalt glade’s “heather” and “condensed time” walls are selective and purposeful; the clipped topiary literally becomes part of Lirael’s body, charging the final image. Spatial anchors are clear by line 5. While evocative, the Glass Labyrinth’s reappearance is more atmospheric than constraining; it doesn’t limit tactics until the final beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—mend the covenant—signals early and tightens once when the golden-eyed self declares “accept the pain.” Agency crystallizes in the final beat: she heeds scars, world splits. Cost is felt (scars vanish, twin moons), though the price feels cosmic rather than personal. One meaningful deepening is sufficient for length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of wounds as keys emerges organically through scar-pulse and vanishing; no moralizing summary. The final image of two moons offers a resonant, non-literal answer—dream and reality now cohabit. Subtext in “purposefully curious” (once a warning, now compass) deepens without overt statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Voice is textured—“time pooled like spilled ink,” “tasted of ozone and elderberries”—and remains rooted in Lirael’s perceptual bias. Patterned elision (“Heed the scars” twice) is taught early and paid off. No POV drift; even the double’s speech is filtered through Lirael’s dawning recognition.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; sentences advance multiple jobs. Minor figurative muddle—“thorns” throne appears late without prior cue—but no loops or scaffold. Rhythm modulates with pressure: short clauses at climax (“world split open”). Clean mechanics.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: covenant as scar-tissue interface, future bleeding into present via clipped topiary. Risky lyric structure holds coherence; the maze-vanish-reappear gambit pays off. Transformation test passes—story collapses if “scars as keys” is removed. Avoids template tropes.</comment>
