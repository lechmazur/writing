<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Elara’s layered interiority is clear—“a hunger that bordered on obsession” shows embodied contradiction—and her choices pivot via the cameo and shell, culminating in Earned Stasis when she fuses the blank to the tree, foreclosing retreat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Nonlinear legacy means every step tightens from blank → shell → tree-map → legacy-fusion; gaps are intentionally elliptical (Accumulative lens), and the closure reconfigures legacies of time via choice, with felt reverence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Orchard’s blue-glow soil, liquid-light waterfall, and pistachio tree with carved names constrain tactics (map drawn on bark, pollen guides route); orchard not mere backdrop—it scales choice and anchors disquiet.</comment>
<question>4</question>
<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>The nonlinear legacy concept steadily escalates: tree names = prior legatees, shell portraits = future selves, forcing Elara to choose inclusion/exclusion of her own name—cost crystallized by the final chime.</comment>
<question>5</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Theme “inheritance by choice” threads from legacy list to intergenerational portraiture; closure image reframes time/lineage without moralizing, leaving reader in charged poise.</comment>
<question>6</question>
<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Lyrical, introspective voice suits curator’s catalogue mindset; free-indirect compression (“pollen-dust sparking across a periphery she hadn’t noticed before”) modulates under wonder and disquiet without head-hop.</comment>
<question>7</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Succinct sensory compression (“blossoms whispering in a language she almost recognized”) keeps momentum; only minor template cadence on repetition of “pistachio,” capped at –0.2.</comment>
<question>8</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Synthesis of astrophysics curatorship + astral orchard + nonlinear legacy feels fresh; not a checklist but an organic fusion, charging the final image without cliché.</comment>
