<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—locating narrative origin in absence—remains consistent and embodied through tactile jar-handling; the final micro-choice to release the returning glimmer shows credible renunciation. Interiority stays concrete (“fingers tracing,” “heart light”) and avoids label-speak. Yet the stranger’s pressure is brief, so her interior contradiction never peaks under sustained stress; the earned shift feels gentle rather than costly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the golden residue re-weights the premise, proving absence can recur and be accepted; cost is the forfeiture of her prized jar and the uncertainty now carried for the stranger’s tale. Causal chain holds—sale → warning → echoing note → crystallized stance—under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is clear by line 6; no teleporting props or amnesia.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Floating glass library, refracted light, and mist-muffled footsteps anchor an otherworldly yet coherent stage; the stall’s jars serve as micro-setting that directly constrain mercantile choice. Selective sensory detail (visual, haptic) is filtered through Elara’s merchant gaze. The environment never complicates tactics after the opening, keeping it vivid but not fully instrumental at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—safeguarding versus releasing unshaped narrative potential—is signaled early and tightens when the stranger requests “a story that hasn’t happened yet,” forcing Elara to risk unleashing uncontained absence. One meaningful deepening occurs as the note drifts back, reweighting her responsibility. Cost is conceptual (loss of control, unknown consequences) but not viscerally felt on the page, capping escalation short of 8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme—creation demands hospitable absence—emerges through jar imagery and the returning glimmer, never sermonized. Subtext resides in Elara’s silent decision to let the parole go again, implying trust in narrative self-assembly. Final image reconfigures prior material without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers credibly: can absence be owned or only borrowed?</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly aligned to Elara’s perceptual filter; diction (“glimmering parole,” “quantifying absence”) is consistent, lyrical, and purposeful. Rhythm modulates from languid description to brisk transaction, mirroring customer flow. No head-hopping or register drift; compression in the final paragraph heightens poise without obscuring sense.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; sentences carry dual duty (action + atmosphere). No paraphrase loops or scaffold. Occasional poetic stacking (“glimmering parole of unwritten narratives”) risks purple but stays within taught pattern and pays off in closure. Minor filter verbs appear early yet do not cluster under pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Concept of vending curated absences as story-starter feels fresh and is executed with sensory specificity; the returning melodic fragment reframes the transaction as cyclical rather than extractive. Risk is taken with abstract merchandise, but concrete handling and earned return image ground it. Could edge higher with sharper cost to Elara.</comment>
