<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s atonement and interior contradiction read as concrete; his embodied grief (“his fingers bled”) and micro-choice to burn the night into light show character under pressure. Motive intensifies directly into the lantern-lit ritual. Cost is palpable: bleeding fingers, emptied pockets, acceptance of never fully repairing what is “unbroken.” The Earned Stasis — choosing continued atonement via pendant — lands with sufficient emotional weight.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Selected lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure presents a Resonant Reconfiguration: the stencil’s final inscription “Light the way” reweights atonement into ongoing renewal. Cue (dawn rising with beams still visible for miles) makes the cost undeniable; no teleporting beats or causal gaps detected. One smooth shard transition (workshop → beacon) is signaled with lantern activation, remaining within scope.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Observatory’s rusted telescopes, cracked dome, and moonlit stone constrain Elias’s every step; the stencil’s alignment with constellations physically links grief to cosmos. Lantern-lenses, cracked glass beams, and stardust vials are not backdrop but instruments that guide the ritual. Final image of beacon light slicing rural night demonstrates setting actively reconfigured to serve closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>Dominant stake: the imperative to transmute his wife’s unattainable healing. Escalation tightens sharply when stencil shadows “become a hand… an eye,” forcing Elias to acknowledge outside grief multiplying. Lantern ignition is a decisive act with felt cost—sleep deprivation and bleeding skin—that narrows later options. Coincidence limited to spectral patterns that complicate, not fix.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Theme emerges organically from specific craft: the paradox of “mending what cannot be unbroken.” Neither lecture nor symbol checklist; the motif recurs through hands-on acts—folding page-fragments, catching constellation light—that reconfigure grief’s currency. Final non-literal answer: the stencil repurposed into a pendant converts memory into action without preaching “closure = cure.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Voice is textured, lyrical, but anchored to observable acts: “lamps burn for days, glow visible for miles” not purple but tactile. Elision (skipped days of folding) is purposeful and taught through “worked through the night… By dawn.” Free-indirect stays tight; no POV leakage. Prose rhythm varies by sentence, mirroring candle wick flare then steady burn.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Rhythm carries natural pauses; sentences lengthen into the beam projection, compress during knife-edge cuts. Minor repetition (“glow like a second sky…”) does not obscure or cloud causality. Information density high: each lantern ignition doubles as memory ignition. One metaphor stack (“light the way… burning brighter”) near the end skates close but lands within tolerable affective spike.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</question><comment>Ritualized origami-mail-from-grief and astronomy-as-mourning-jewelry is a fresh synthesis; templates of grief-beacon or origami-crumbs feel inevitable only after the piece teaches them. Distinct perceptual lens: cancer memory refracted through fractured star shadows. Risk succeeds because closure hinges on observatory beam not moralized lesson.</comment>
