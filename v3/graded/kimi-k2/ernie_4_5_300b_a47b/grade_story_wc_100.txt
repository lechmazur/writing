<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s stubbornness is embodied in his refusal to open the crate and his gruff exchanges with Marisol; the shift from “burying secrets” to “carrying knowledge” is earned through the dream of the goldfish and the visible cost of staying beneath the waves. Interiority is concrete (“his hands trembled,” “brine and old paper”). The final renunciation—trading shovel for quill—carries felt cost and closes the arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the lens’s restored beam re-weights Elias’s life, turning rest from an end into a beginning. Causal chain holds—crate → dream → descent → repair → stay—each step narrowing options. Cost is visible in the final tableau: “an old woman with a lantern, and a man who’d traded his shovel for a quill.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The underwater library is not postcard scenery; its silted entrance and floating books constrain movement and supply the lens shards. The dome’s apex is the only place the lens can be reinstalled, guiding the final action. Sensory detail is selective—brine, bioluminescent ink—filtered through Elias’s embalmer’s eye for texture.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</question><comment>Dominant stake: can Elias give rest a permanent address without freezing life? Pressure tightens when the city’s heart stops and only the lens restart can revive it. One decisive turn—slotting the lens—forecloses return to land. Cost is the permanent exile implied by “Where would I go?”</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</question><comment>Theme emerges from action: permanence versus renewal. The lens, once a tool of rescue, becomes a metaphor for redirecting grief into stewardship. No moralizing; the final image of two cataloguers in a living library reweights the premise without statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</question><comment>Voice is tactile and occupational—“calloused and stained with embalming fluid,” “welded glass with molten resin.” Rhythm modulates: terse refusals early, softer cadence after the goldfish dream. No head-hopping; focalization stays locked to Elias.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</question>
<comment>Prose is lean and image-driven. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances. Occasional lyric lift (“light erupted—a beam slicing through the water”) is earned by prior compression. Metaphors stay coherent—lens scars turned to gold leaf.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</question>
<comment>Familiar tropes (underwater city, keeper ghost) are refreshed through the undertaker’s lens: death-work repurposed for cultural resurrection. The goldfish memory is a fresh, specific trigger. Risky choice—staying underwater forever—lands with coherent cost.</comment>
