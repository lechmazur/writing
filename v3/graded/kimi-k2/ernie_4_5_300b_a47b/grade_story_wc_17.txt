<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lira’s contradictory impulses—curiosity vs. stewardship—surface in the micro-choice to burn the negative; embodied tremor and soot-stained reflection keep interiority concrete. The final stance crystallizes with visible cost: she forfeits the relic to become the map. Minor slip: “legacy’s burden” is named rather than dramatized until the locket beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (ivy, ash, whisper) thickens until the corridor’s groan reweights the premise. Closure lands as Charged Poise—Lira accepts the burden, cost legible in the warm locket and whispered “You are the map.” Orientation anchored by word 80; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The ivy-veiled passage is not backdrop but active throat that tightens around Lira; the fireplace’s ash and copper locket constrain her final choice. Sensory triangulation (wet earth, iron, salt) is selective and POV-filtered. Micro-setting (locket-map) charges the ending image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—carry the walls’ memory—tightens when the groan forces a choice: keep or surrender the negative. One clear escalation beat; cost is the forfeited heirloom. No reversals, but the deepening reconfigures her mission from discovery to embodiment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of intergenerational stewardship emerges through the diaries, negative, and locket without moralizing. Final whisper reweights the premise: the map is not parchment but person. Subtext in ivy’s “food” line and soot-glass reflection avoids abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct lyric texture—curved like a question mark, corridor echo cartographer—sustained without purple drift. POV modesty maintained; no head-hop. Rhythm modulates with pressure: long sentences for wonder, fragments at the groan. Compression taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High density: “ivy spoke. It said the passage is a throat” fuses image, stakes, and theme. No loops or scaffold; metaphors coherent. One mixed register moment—“conceptual repricing” risk—but occurs outside peak beat. Final line lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: climate-haunted architecture as living archive. Cartographer who maps time, not land, feels inevitable. Risk in lyric mode heightens resonance without gimmickry. No derivative echoes; specificity anchors universals.</comment>
