<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is textured—his tactile curiosity about sorrow, the cut that knits under moonlight—but the final “smile” feels unearned; no contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene to justify the shift from wary isolation to quiet acceptance. The trees’ memories touch him, yet the moment is narrated rather than embodied, blurring cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the shimmering wall becomes permeable, reweighting the labyrinth’s layers and Elias’s role. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each disassembled cog thickens pattern until moonlit map opens—but the cost (what Elias forfeits by crossing) is only implied, not felt on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stormlit tower, damp stone, fractured moonlight, and the sextant’s brass shards are vivid and selective; the tree-root corridor glows and constrains the final step. Micro-setting (the healing wall) actively enables closure, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transform sorrow into usable knowledge—tightens when the sextant’s map reveals dream-geometries, forcing Elias to choose passage through the root-lined wall. Pressure escalates via pattern density rather than external threat; the cost is conceptual (loss of prior certainty) but only lightly legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of transmuting grief into light emerges through concrete acts—dismantling, mapping, stepping through—without moralizing. Final image of “mundane miracle” reweights earlier decay into quiet radiance, though the conceptual cost could be sharper.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Voice is restrained, tactile, and consistent; perceptual signature favors chill stone, brass grit, moon-silver. No dialogue, yet free-indirect texture sustains interiority. Rhythm modulates with storm pulses and calm mapping beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and sensorily precise; occasional elevated phrasing (“celestial heartbeat”) risks register drift but stays within POV’s wonder. No loops or scaffold; sentences advance image or action. Final paragraph’s cadence shift earns closure poise.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fusion of astrolabe cartography, grief quantification, and sentient architecture feels fresh and inevitable. The mundane-miracle tone reframes maintenance labor as quiet cosmology, avoiding genre clichés. Risk in lyric accumulation pays off in the root-memory corridor.</comment>
