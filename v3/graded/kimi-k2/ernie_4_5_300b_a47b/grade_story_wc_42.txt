<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is vivid—hands “steady as star charts,” the leaf-fall memory—but the leap at the end feels slightly unearned; we needed one more beat of visible cost or doubt to crystallize the renunciation of earthbound time.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the clock’s silence and the portal’s gold edge reweight the premise with undeniable cost. Causal chain holds (hand→signal→circuit→portal→leap) under a Causal lens; only a micro-gap in how the portal’s rules are learned keeps it from 9+.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The observatory’s silver shell, brass relics, and ozone wind are selective and POV-filtered; the telescope lens and ear trumpet constrain tactics. Yet the lunar locale never affects gravity or air choices, so the setting stops just short of indispensable.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—mastery over ephemeral time—tightens once when Elias realizes the hand measures escape, not duration. The cost (abandoning earthbound life) is legible but stated more than felt; still, agency drives every beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of transience versus control emerges through brass gears and falling leaves; the final leap offers a non-literal answer without moralizing. One near-label—“time could not be tamed”—is brief enough to forgive.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is tactile, rhythmic, and camera-repairer precise; “luminous ache” modulates under pressure. Compression and patterned elision are taught early and paid off in the harmonic singing beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; only a few stacked modifiers (“shimmering portal, its edges flickering like a candle flame”) flirt with overwriting. No loops or scaffold; final image lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: Victorian instruments + cosmic portal + sonic harmonics feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky leap ending is earned; no derivative echoes.</comment>
