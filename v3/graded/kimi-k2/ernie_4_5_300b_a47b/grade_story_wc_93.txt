<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira’s contradictory impulses—obey the promise vs. fear the storm—are dramatized in each rock placement; her final renunciation to “listen” rather than control is earned by the prior failed sequences and the star-dust flare that blinds her. Interiority is embodied (trembling hands, tears mingling with salt) and stays character-specific. The only cap is that the mother remains off-stage, so status/relationship crucible is absent.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the obsidian rock centers a living sigil, reweighting the premise from mastery to witness. Causal chain—Fibonacci → Pascal → Möbius—narrows options until the final stilling of the storm. Cost is visible in the star-dust’s scream and Lira’s tears. Lens is Causal; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The tidal bluff, aurora, and frictionless water constrain every choice: eels hang motionless, rocks must be placed on glass-still tide. Micro-setting (boots sinking, damp sand) grounds the body. Final image of the living sigil etched by eels recharges the aurora’s colors. One slip: “borrowed dawn” is never spatially anchored.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore sacred order—tightens through each failed sequence until the Möbius strip forecloses control and forces acceptance. Escalation is causal: each pattern attempted raises the star-dust’s threat until the final stilling. Cost is felt in the blinding flare and the tear-salt sting. No coincidence resolves the storm.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: the sacred is not decoded but witnessed. The final image of the living sigil reweights every prior pattern attempt without moralizing. Subtext lives in the eels’ suspended bodies and the star-dust’s scream—divine language spoken in silence. No thematic drift or echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise: “liquid green and violet,” “bruise-purple,” “living sigil.” Syntax mirrors Lira’s precognitive fragmentation—visions fracture, sentences tighten under pressure. No POV leakage; knowledge stays character-bound. Dialogue is absent, so no register clash.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and symbolic work. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Rhythm accelerates with the star-dust scream and slows into the final stilling. One near-slip: “second skin” cliché is minor.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: eel herder + star dust + mathematical ritual + frictionless tide feels inevitable in hindsight. The Möbius-strip closure is unforeseeable yet seeded by the promise “patterns hold the key.” Risky lyric compression pays off without obscuring causality.</comment>
