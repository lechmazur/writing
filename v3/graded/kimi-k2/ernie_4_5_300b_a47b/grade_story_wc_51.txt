<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael’s interiority is vivid—his trembling hands, sweat, and memory of his mother’s voice all embody the stakes. The refusal to melt his mother’s locket crystallizes a credible, costly stance. Yet the mother remains off-page, so relationship-as-crucible pressure is absent; the score caps just below 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Kael leaves the locket untouched, a visible cost under the Accumulative/Textural lens. The grotto’s lighter hush and the clinking satchel reweight the premise. Orientation is swift; no causality breaks. One hairline slip: the “whalebone reverie” line feels slightly ornamental rather than causal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The bronze grotto’s damp metal taste, moss-crusted pool, and star-fissure angle all constrain Kael’s lamp orientation. The burner’s patina and the obsidian’s condensation are tactile, choice-shaping details. Environment and tool jointly charge the final image of the untouched locket. No orientation debt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—collect burdens without being consumed—tightens when the obsidian resists and Kael’s hands tremble. The final refusal to melt the locket forecloses a path with felt cost. One meaningful deepening suffices; no reversals required. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through action: the ethics of carrying versus burying pain. The untouched locket offers a resonant, non-moralizing answer. Subtext in the “shingled hush” and fractal patterns invites reflection without abstraction. No late thematic exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is textured, lyrical yet precise—“wet metal and old prayers,” “scale-covered hide.” Syntax modulates with pressure; short clauses during the obsidian crack mirror tension. No POV drift or filter-verb clutter. Distinct perceptual signature sustained.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and mythic registers. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Occasional elevated diction (“boundary-lessly trapped”) is earned by context. Rhythm breathes with scene needs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The fractal-weaver who melts calcified burdens into carry-able patterns is a fresh synthesis of mythic and emotional labor. Specificity—the green-patinaed burner, the obsidian child-face—grounds the concept. Risky lyric compression pays off in the final image. No derivative echoes.</comment>
