<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s rogue-scholar charm is vivid in ink-stained fingers and poetic quotes, but interior contradiction is thin; his “spark of defiance” is declared rather than embodied under pressure. Lillian’s status as gatekeeper is clear, yet their relationship never becomes a crucible—she admits him with minimal cost. The final grin is earned, but the emotional price feels light.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: key phrase → proof test → seed → glowing garden. Closure is a decisive change—public bioluminescent protest now exists—with conceptual cost (surveillance risk). One transition (greenhouse → garden) is clean. Orientation is anchored by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Greenhouse humidity, moth-hum, and carnivorous plants are selective and tactile; the seed’s fractal shadows charge the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent; no white-room drift. Environment supplies tools (pheromones, fungi) that alter tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—access to covert communication—signaled early. One meaningful tightening: the pheromone test narrows options; failure would eject Elias. Cost is conceptual (future surveillance) rather than visceral, but legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of covert language emerges through plant patterns and insect code, not exposition. Final image of glowing “RESIST” reweights earlier Fibonacci games into political signal. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers about state response.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Voice is lush yet controlled—“snap-jaws glinting,” “candidly cryptic”—with consistent perceptual signature. Dialogue carries subtext (“You realize the club’s members are… selective?”). No head-hopping; POV stays anchored to Elias.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose is propulsive, with rhythmic variation and high information density. Occasional ornamental flourish (“chaos converged into a symphony”) flirts with excess but does not stall momentum. No loops or scaffold in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: lepidopterist spy club + bioluminescent protest garden. Familiar tropes (secret society, rebel artist) are retooled through entomological detail and plant-code specificity. Risky concept committed to fully.</comment>
