<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lirael’s interiority is vivid and embodied, but her contradictory impulses remain abstract; the “tremor of certainty” is felt more as atmosphere than as a specific internal conflict that forces a costly choice. The final step onto liquid glass is a clear renunciation of prior limits, yet the cost is more conceptual than viscerally dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Lirael’s stance crystallizes when she steps onto the water, reweighting the premise that boundaries are immutable. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density and cadence shift rather than causal reversals—but the felt cost is slightly diffuse, keeping it just under 8.8.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The cobalt atrium and colonnade are rendered with selective, sensory precision; the quartz’s humming and the lake’s cracking directly constrain Lirael’s choices and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent, and the environment evolves causally with her paraphrasing.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—dissolving boundaries—escalates through intensifying sensory pressure and the lake’s slow parting. One meaningful tightening occurs when the ice yields under her step, foreclosing retreat. Cost is legible but generalized; a sharper forfeiture would push higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically from the interplay of language, stone, and ice; the final image of liquid glass offers a non-literal answer to the question of sacred limits. No overt moralizing, though the conceptual cost could be more viscerally anchored.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrically compressed yet legible; perceptual signature is consistent, with syntax and diction reflecting Lirael’s poet-mind. Patterned elision (“lantern-moth hush”) is taught early and paid off in the charged silence of the ending. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information density and minimal scaffolding. Occasional stacked metaphors (“ice crystals…like suspended breath”) flirt with overwriting but serve the accumulative design. No loops or artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The fusion of poet, quartz colonnade, and boundary dissolution feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; the premise is transformed through specific, grounded choices rather than ornament.</comment>
