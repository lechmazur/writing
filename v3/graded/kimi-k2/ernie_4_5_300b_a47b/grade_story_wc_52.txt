<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Clara’s grief is embodied through tactile carving, but interiority drifts toward therapeutic summary (“Loss wasn’t an ending, but a transformation”). Micro-choices (first shallow cut, final placement on sill) are present yet lack contradictory impulse under pressure; the arc is gentle acceptance rather than struggle. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible not tested. Earned stasis feels credible but cost is more asserted than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each shaving and steam curl layers density until the lion’s quiet completion reweights the void. Closure is a Charged Poise—the lion on the sill reframes absence into vessel—cost is the irreversible absence itself, visible in the cold kettle and burned-down candle. No orientation drift; skylight and loft anchored early. One smooth shard with no teleporting props.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rain-beaded skylight and rust-hued loft filter every beat; the ash blank and candle act as micro-settings that constrain posture and attention. Sensory hierarchy (damp wool, honey steam, sawdust scent) is selective and POV-bound. Final image—lion lit by fractured rainlight—charges the closure by literalizing “containment.” No static cataloguing; each detail earns its keep.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: transform grief into tangible form. Pressure tightens once—wood yields, candle shortens, kettle cools—marking elapsed crystallized time. Agency is steady endurance; no external antagonist, yet the blank’s resistance and memory’s weight create sufficient friction. Cost is the irreversible cold kettle and spent flame, felt on page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of “here and gone” emerges through craft: absence carved into presence. Subtext lives in tool, wood, and silence rather than statement. Final image avoids moralizing; the lion’s closed eyes quietly reprice the premise. No redundant thematic echo; resonance is oblique yet legible.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays close to Clara’s sensory filter; diction (“rain-beaded,” “ash wood,” “chipped enamel”) is precise and character-bound. Rhythm modulates with task—long sentences during reflection, clipped fragments during carving. No dialogue, so voice coherence judged on narrative texture alone; no POV leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; figurative language is sparse and purposeful (“steam curl toward the ceiling”). One minor loop: “raw material of memory” / “raw emotion” within three lines. No mixed metaphors or register drift. Final paragraph avoids sentimentality through concrete image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Widow-carves-lion could be stock, but specificity of circus death and tactile woodworking transform it. Risk is quiet—no twist, no spectacle—yet the restraint feels deliberate. Fresh inflection: carving as method of “crystallized time” rather than therapy cliché. Premise is familiar but execution is individualized.</comment>
