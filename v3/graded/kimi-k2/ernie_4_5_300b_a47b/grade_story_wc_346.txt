<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is embodied and specific—calloused hands, salt-and-decay air, the tremor in her voice—yet the final renunciation (accepting her flaws while singing) is earned and costly. The grandfather’s memory is woven through micro-choices rather than exposition, and the broken puppet head functions as both heirloom and map. A hairline slip: “doubt that gnawed at her” edges toward label-speak, keeping it just below 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the lullaby reweights the premise from cataclysm to gentle sigh, with the pane’s shattering and puppet’s dissolution as visible cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern density increases until the fractal pane unravels. Orientation is anchored early; no causality breaks. The final image crystallizes options without tidy resolution.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The lighthouse, cliff, fog, and pane are not backdrop but instruments: the rusted railing bruises Mara’s palms, the pane’s hush swallows sound and later cracks under pressure. Sensory selection narrows to salt, decay, and golden light leaking from cracks—details that constrain tactics and charge the final image. Micro-setting (the pane) directly shapes the climax.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“ensure the world’s end would be gentle”—is signaled early and tightened through Mara’s escalating choice to sing despite personal doubt. The pane’s fractal collapse and puppet’s shattering are visible prices that foreclose retreat. Agency is renunciation/acceptance rather than combat, fitting the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: beauty in fracture, the necessity of imperfection. The cracked puppet and fractal pane embody this without sermonizing. The ending’s lullaby reweights prior images (cracks letting light in) into a resonant, non-moral answer. No thematic drift or final-paragraph thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is textured, tactile, and consistent—salt-and-decay, “spectral glow,” “thousand clocks ticking in reverse.” Compression and lyric elision are taught early and paid off at closure. No POV leakage; perceptual signature remains Mara’s throughout. Dialogue is absent, so no voice convergence issues.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and conceptual work. Metaphors are precise—“fractal of fractals,” “porcelain pieces raining like snow”—and never muddle causality. No loops, scaffold, or register drift. Minor intensifier clusters (“strange peace”) keep it just shy of 9.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of doomsday clock adjuster, fractal pane, and broken puppet feels inevitable yet fresh. The premise reframes apocalypse as lullaby, transforming familiar tropes through specific lived detail. Risk-taking (lyric accumulation, conceptual closure) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
