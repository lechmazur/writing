<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Kael’s interiority is vivid—trembling fingers, throat tightening, hands shaking—yet the “harvest insights from failure” motive is stated more than dramatized until the final driftwood rune. The mentor’s spectral return supplies relational pressure, but the mentor’s cryptic riddle edges toward label-speak. The earned renunciation (broken flute, new rune) carries visible cost and forecloses the old quest, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Kael’s surrender rune crystallizes a new stance with felt cost (broken flute, irrevocable lesson). Causal chain holds—uncasing flute → fissure → chamber → unmaking attempt → silence → surrender—without teleporting props. Orientation is anchored by driftwood markers and canyon geography within the first 120 words. Lens is Causal; no ambiguity at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Thunder-Echo Range is rendered through selective sensory detail—petrified pine, ozone, obsidian staircase—filtered by Kael’s relic-keeper priorities. The canyon’s acoustics and geography constrain tactics: the echo guides placement of markers, the fissure’s staircase forces descent. Final twilight recharges the opening bruised sky, reweighting the setting as witness to surrender.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—master the flute’s purpose or remain trapped by failure—is signaled early and tightened when the mentor demands “unmake.” The discordant playing that snaps the reeds is a decisive, costly turn that narrows options and forces surrender. Pressure escalates under causal agency; coincidence never rescues.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of surrender-as-insight emerges organically from Kael’s failed attempt to force mastery; the broken flute and new rune reweight “harvesting failure” without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture—trembling hands, snapped reeds—rather than exposition. Final image of the quiet hum in his chest offers non-literal resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is textured and character-bound: “avalanchingly quiet,” “bruised sky,” “time pooled like liquid.” Syntax modulates with stress—short fragments under pressure, longer cadences in reflection. No head-hopping; POV stays locked to Kael. Dialogue is sparse but carries spectral subtext.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative language is selective—no mixed metaphors in peak beats. Minor scaffold: “the canyon held its breath” borders cliché but is earned by prior acoustic setup. No loops or filter-verb stacks; rhythm breathes with scene needs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The relic-flute-as-door, failure-as-unmaking synthesis feels fresh and inevitable. Transformation test passes: the story’s emotional arc would collapse if the flute were merely a generic artifact. Risk-taking in the silence-over-sound resolution heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
