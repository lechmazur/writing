<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lirael’s cautious-nose trait and inherited grief are embodied in micro-choices (hovering over the vial, steady fingers after). The shift from fear to embrace of grief is credible, though the interiority drifts toward gentle abstraction rather than raw contradiction under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the final inhalation reweights prior scent-aversion into acceptance with felt cost (“grateful for the chance to grieve”). Causal chain—vial → UV reveal → memory flood → stance shift—holds under Accumulative/Textural lens; no breaks, one seamless scene.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Greenhouse glass, prismatic light, and extinct flora create an immersive micro-setting that constrains choice (only here can UV activation occur). The lantern glow and crystal shadows charge the final image, though a touch more tactile interaction with the space would tighten constraint to 9-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understand scent-triggered sorrow—tightens once via UV reveal; the memory flood raises emotional cost and forecloses avoidance. Escalation is single but sufficient; price is visible in tears and later unflinching inhalation. No slack reversals.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of grief-as-love emerges organically from scent-memory fusion; final image of breathing city air without flinching offers non-literal answer. Subtle, avoids moralizing, though a faint whiff of sentimentality in “grateful for the chance to grieve” keeps it from 9.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet anchored in sensory specificity; perceptual signature distinct (“aromatically cautious,” “rain-soaked earth, old parchment”). Rhythm modulates with emotional swell. No POV drift or register clash; minor filter-verb clusters (“she understood now”) slightly dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is fluid, vivid, mostly loop-free; occasional soft fillers (“almost sacred energy,” “something sweet, almost floral”) and stacked modifiers slightly dilute density. No mixed metaphors or artifacts in closure beat; read-aloud rhythm holds.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Fusion of scent-memory extraction via UV botany feels fresh; grief-as-inheritance angle avoids cliché. Specificity of extinct-plant greenhouse and lantern trade grounds the concept. A shade more risk in structure or moral shading could push 8.5+.</comment>
