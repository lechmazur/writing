<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Interiority (“Elias adjusted...respirator... boots crunching”) anchors profession and mood, but we receive only one fraught decision—placing the pearl—with no external contradiction or visible, felt cost on Elias as person, only as conduit. No micro-choices between conflicting motives are dramatized; the characterization trends archetypal “wounded inspector” rather than individuated under pressure. Meets baseline contradiction requirement via wistful regret vs. mission but sustains it via exposition rather than scene work.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant lens: Accumulative/Textural. Pearl-to-crystal fusion reconfigures lattice; final cadence shift (“the caves, once a tomb... cathedral”) reweights premise with conceptual cost. Anchorage clear by ≈80 words; closure is Charged Poise with felt cosmic cost radiating off-page. Pattern taught early (pulse sync) and paid off linearly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Crystal throb and obsidian shards are vivid, selective; setting constrains via slippery floor and light-flare, but absence of spatial detail during spiral pass makes choreography shaky. Environment charges final image through illuminated shadows; succeeds as crystallized cathedral without over-cataloguing.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Stakes: dissolution of psychic bunkers vs. isolation. Tightening occurs single-shot: placing pearl fuses latent confessions into shared network—narrowing option from cataloguing to bridge-building. On-page emotional toll diffuse for Elias, legible for collective. Agency clear, no coincidences, cost borne by light / pearl, not Elias.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of connection emerges from objects-handling (pearl, shell) rather than didacticism. Final crystallized cathedral reconfigures “bunker” from shield to communion, resonating non-literal answer. Ambiguity preserved—who wrote “forgive” remains open. Avoids overt moralizing, earns resonance from accumulation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Voice modulates texture from cold “doomsday inspector” idiom to crescendo of cathedral language. Perceptual signature: quartz throbbed “light that wasn’t light.” No dialogue, so rhythm compresses–opens via cadence spirals matching cave structure. Selective overreach in “cathedral” flourish slightly divorces from gritty POV lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm restrained yet propulsive; sentences vary in length, occasional filter verbs work as emotional gauze. Density balanced; metaphor lines (“stalactites that dripped like frozen tears”) evoke without swamping peak beat. One synonym loop—“resonance”—appears twice 30 words apart; negligible impact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: bunker-paranoia, crystalline gothic, penitent Psalm-tech. Old trope “psychic crystals” repositioned as confession drive, not New Age magic. Survivor epilogue avoidance keeps risk grounded. Specificity of inspector+pearls+shell transforms generic “connect” prompt into inevitable ritual. No famous direct echoes.</comment>
