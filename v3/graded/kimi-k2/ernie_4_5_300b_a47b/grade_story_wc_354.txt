<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Alaric’s exile and chess-as-cosmic-balance obsession are vivid, embodied, and drive every micro-choice; the final planting of the star-seed crystallizes his arc with visible cost. Interiority is specific, but the late appearance of Lira’s key feels slightly convenient rather than earned by prior causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the covenant is re-embodied in the sapling, cost paid in exile and solitude. Causal chain holds—stone dent → eclipse map → key → seed—under an Accumulative/Textural lens. No orientation drift; anchors clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The magnetic nexus, twilight bleed, and basalt monolith are rendered with tactile economy; the worry stone itself becomes micro-setting that constrains the final key-turn. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered, charging the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore the forgotten covenant—tightens once when the stone’s dent translates into star-map chessboard, forcing the key choice. Cost is felt in exile and the irreversible planting. Agency is Alaric’s throughout; coincidence complicates but does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of “beauty in constraint” emerges organically from chess metaphor, covenant riddle, and final sapling of fractured mirrors. No moralizing; resonance arises from particulars. Final image reweights premise without statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with rhythmic control under pressure (“nexus roared, a sound like wind through canyons”). Perceptual signature is consistent; no head-hopping. Compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is patterned and purposeful. No loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated diction (“celestial alignment”) is justified by star-mage register. Final image crystallizes without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chess, star-mage covenant, and magnetic nexus feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. No derivative echoes; transformation test passed.</comment>
