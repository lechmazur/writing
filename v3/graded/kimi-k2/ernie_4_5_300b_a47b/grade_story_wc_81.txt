<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority is vivid—her tactile cataloguing of books, the embodied chill of stone, the owl stamp as talisman—but the final “purpose” feels slightly abstract, not fully paid for by prior micro-choices. The shift from cataloguer to truth-bearer is credible yet compressed; more friction between her need for order and the cost of revelation would push this higher.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the vault opens, the journal rewrites the city’s myth, and Lira swims away with both artifact and burden—an Earned Stasis that forecloses denial. Causal chain holds (blackout → spiral map → stamp alignment → revelation), though the blackout’s engineered nature is asserted more than dramatized.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The sunken library is rendered through precise sensory triangulation—cold stone, bloated spines, bioluminescent algae—each detail filtering Lira’s priorities. The bronze door’s spiral grooves and the owl stamp’s final alignment charge the closure image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“trace honest origins”—is signaled early and tightened when the journal exposes collective denial. The spiral-door beat narrows options from cataloguing to bearing witness; cost is felt in the “raw, unvarnished” weight of truth, though the price could be more viscerally staged.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of truth versus myth emerges organically from Elara’s journal and Lira’s choice to surface it. The final image—moonlight on water, stamp as vigilance—offers a resonant, non-moralizing reweighting. No late thematic exposition intrudes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Voice is controlled, tactile, and slightly archaic without slipping into pastiche; perceptual signature is consistent (“tranquilly perceptive gaze,” “dappled resolve”). Compression and patterned elision are purposeful and legible at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet textured; no loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated diction (“reclaimed stillness,” “conceptual repricing”) stays within Lira’s scholarly register. One mixed metaphor—“blackout crept like a thief… swallowing flicker”—is minor.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Flooded city as archive of self-inflicted amnesia is a fresh angle; the owl stamp’s evolution from bureaucratic relic to emblem of vigilance is specific and earned. Risk-taking is moderate—quiet revelation over spectacle—but coherence remains intact.</comment>
