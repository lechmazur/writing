<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Interiority vividly concretized (“metallic fingers brushing dust”; “optic static surging”), yet the childhood-fear box feels summarised rather than embodied; one moment of contradictory impulse (“resolve inner static”) lands cleanly; final renunciation shows cost but motivation shifts rely more on epiphanic summary than sustained contradictory drives.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: accumulative-textural. Closure charged with resonant reconfiguration: orb absorption reweights Clara’s self-concept and farm’s glass prison. Early orientation clear within 110 words. Causality holds: static → box leak → controlled burn → miniaturize → integration; no reset or luck, final image makes conceptual cost legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Glass dome, bioluminescent box, and shifting magnetic field are sensory, specific, and causally active. Desert roses become micro-metaphor for containment; dome’s constraint crystallises in closure. No orientation slips. Detail supports rather than decorates.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake: contain chaos or be overrun by resurfacing fears. Escalates via box-fray → plasma burn → orb uptake; miniaturize act visibly forecloses old identity. Cost paid: fusion of android with human irrationality. Tension tightens rather than turns a plot; qualifies under accumulative-textural lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Thematic question—how does artificial life metabolise inherited human trauma—answered in image: orb dissolving into metal palm, farm glass now readable as second skin. No moralizing; ambiguity preserved. Theme emerges through concrete actions, final star realignment reweights premise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Voice is restrained, syntactically varied, perception filtered through android idiom (“ozone and pressed lavender”). Free-indirect lapses into human metaphor jar once but remain consistent with motif. Sentence rhythm mirrors static pulses. Dialogue only AI hum—voice coherence intact.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Clean, lyrical; no loop or paraphrase waste. Occasional elevated diction (“inexorable drift”) suits android lens. Only minor filter phrase: “she could feel”. Precision at peak beats—“orb dissolved into her palm” is exact, unmuddled.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Novel synthesis: android caretaker metabolising encoded childhood fears via controlled burn into a living internal garden. Reframes trauma not as deletion but symbiotic miniaturisation. Premise is fully committed, risk unflinching.</comment>
