<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Hush’s shift from tracker to translator is embodied in her nose-work and tail-thump, but the interior contradiction (nostalgia vs. present duty) is stated more than dramatized; Jeb remains functional backdrop. The final bark earns communal change yet the cost to Hush herself is only implied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the autumn leaf’s re-display crystallizes communal memory with felt social cost—distance is now bridged. Accumulative/Textural lens holds; each cylinder adds density until the final riddle reweights the stake. Orientation is clear by line 5.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Scrapyard textures (rusted harvester, piano-table, kerosene flicker) are filtered through Hush’s scent-bias and constrain choices—she must read wax because metal is dead. The leaf-as-micro-setting finally glows, charging the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“translate distance into closeness”—tightens as each solved riddle forecloses isolation; communal cheers mark visible price paid. One clear deepening beat: Hush’s bark after the final riddle crystallizes the trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of memory-as-binding emerges organically from riddles and leaf; no moralizing. Final image of glowing veins offers non-literal answer to “what grows when shared,” reweighting prior material with quiet conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays inside Hush’s perceptual signature—scent maps, ear-flicks, tail-thumps—without head-hop. Rhythm modulates from languid under-car observation to urgent nose-work; no register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, vivid, propulsive; only minor loop (“the wind carried…”) and one mixed metaphor (“tapestry of shared history”) keep it from 8.5. Sensory specificity is high, scaffolding minimal.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Post-apocalyptic riddle-solving bloodhound feels fresh; transformation of phonograph grooves into communal scripture is non-obvious yet inevitable. Risky canine POV is sustained without gimmickry.</comment>
