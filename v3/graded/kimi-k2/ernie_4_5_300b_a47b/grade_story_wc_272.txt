<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is textured—his hatred of tarot, the grandmother’s loom memory—but the portrait client’s vanishing is asserted, not dramatized, so the inciting wound feels off-page. The final smile is earned by the thread-work, yet the cost (abandoning prior art) is implied rather than embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each new thread and card fragment layers density until the final image reweights the premise. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—portrait breathes, lighthouse sighs—felt cost is the surrender of old artistic identity. Orientation is swift; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The library-lighthouse is evoked with salt-rot, warped spines, and stolen lens; these details constrain Elias’s movement and supply the thread material. Micro-setting (thread in box crack, candle at stair summit) directly shapes the final composition. One minor drift: “gap where the sea should be” is atmospheric but not spatially anchored.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will Elias reassemble meaning or be crushed by fragmentary despair—tightens as walls press and threads accumulate. The redesign act is the decisive turn that forecloses pure painterly realism; cost is the shredded Hanged Man and the irreversible ink. Pressure escalates under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of fragmentation vs reweaving emerges organically from tarot shreds and loom memories; no explicit moralizing. Final image answers the central question non-literally: “we’re all just waiting to be rewoven.” Subtext in the glowing ink and twitching threads carries the weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is painterly, tactile, slightly myopic—smudged glasses, salt-rot, moth-like questions. Syntax modulates with stress: short bursts as walls close, longer lyrical coils during thread collection. No POV drift; rhetorical questions feel character-specific rather than authorial intrusion.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; metaphors (ink glowing like “charged by forgotten energy”) are vivid without crowding. Occasional minor loop—“the walls felt too close, the air thick”—but momentum recovers quickly. Final paragraph achieves crystalline clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: tarot as literal pigment, lighthouse library as loom-space, portrait artist as unweaver-weaver. Risky compression of genres (gothic, magical realism, meta-art) lands coherently. Transformation test passes—story would collapse if any element swapped.</comment>
