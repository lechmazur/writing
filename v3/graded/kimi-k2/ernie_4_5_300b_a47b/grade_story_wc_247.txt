<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Kael’s interiority is embodied (camera against chest, hands conducting silence) and his motivation—translate silence into music—drives every micro-choice. The contradiction between his desire to disrupt forgetfulness and his fear that “the joy…would fade” surfaces late but is felt. Lira’s presence supplies relational pressure that forces Kael to externalize his gift, altering both their states. Cost is visible: Kael’s smile is “rare,” and dawn leaves him “alone again,” the silence re-ascendant.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the harbor’s silence has been reweighted from prison to canvas, with the cost that Kael must release the music to the town and remain its unheard translator. Causality is accumulative-textural: each signed phrase layers density until the final dawn image crystallizes the new equilibrium. Orientation is swift; moonlight and dock ropes anchor us by line 3. One transition (crowd disperses) is seamless.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The luminous harbor is more than backdrop; its shifting waves physically quicken in response to Kael’s signing, constraining tempo choices for Lira. Camera, dock creaks, and owl hoots are filtered through Kael’s selective attention, creating a micro-setting that charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean: silhouettes, distances, moonlit faces track without drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—break the town’s amnesiac silence—is signaled in paragraph one and tightened when the fisherman pleads, “Play that again,” foreclosing Kael’s anonymity. Escalation is accumulative: each signed phrase thickens the texture until the collective silence becomes an instrument. Cost is the dawn solitude that follows the gift.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: silence as generative emptiness rather than absence. Subtext lives in gesture—Kael’s signs say “Listening” while his body says “I am unheard.” The final image of the camera “cold against his chest” reweights the premise without moralizing, leaving a bittersweet resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</question>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise; moonlight “shimmered like liquid silver” is the single indulgence, balanced by tactile immediacy (“worn smooth by years of use”). POV remains tight third-person limited; no head-hopping. Dialogue is spare and subtextual, delivered in sign or single spoken pleas that advance the beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</question>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; each sentence advances image or stakes. No loops or scaffold detected. Metaphors are spare and purposeful. Minor elevation (“liquid silver”) is earned by context and not repeated.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</question>
<comment>The premise—translating silence into music via empty camera and sign language—feels fresh yet inevitable. Transformation test: swap camera for smartphone and the magic collapses. The joyful-sorrow cadence is specific to this harbor night, not a generic mood.</comment>
