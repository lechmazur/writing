<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Zara’s interiority is vivid—her trembling fingers, the “twinkle” when she smiles—but her final choice (to reveal the chart’s mutable truth) is more gesture than decision; the cost is implied rather than embodied. Jaxon’s pressure is present yet generic, so the relationship crucible is under-used. Still, the contradiction between outward “decoration” and covert rebellion is dramatized in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the spiral galaxy unravels into a straight line under the candle, reweighting the premise that “truth is never a straight line.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern density increases until the final shimmer reconfigures meaning. Cost is felt in the risk of exposure, though not yet paid. Orientation is clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The cobalt observatory, eternal candle, and frosted windows are selective, sensory, and purposeful; the candle’s brass warmth and shifting shadows constrain Zara’s final act of revelation. Micro-setting (embroidery hoop, telescope lens) functions as setting-objects that alter tactics. No spatial drift; weather and chill remain consistent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve hidden star-truths before the coup—is signaled early and tightens when the council moves the telescopes. One meaningful deepening: the flame’s synchronizing power is revealed, narrowing options to covert embroidery. Cost is conceptual (risk of discovery) rather than visceral, but legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of truth hidden in seams emerges organically from embroidery and star-maps; no explicit moralizing. The final image of the unraveling spiral offers a resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext in Jaxon’s hesitation and Zara’s “wind-chime” laugh deepens stakes without exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet controlled, with distinct perceptual signature—“needles darted like comets,” “wind-chime” laugh. POV stays tight to Zara; no head-hopping. Compression and patterned elision (“the truth is never a straight line”) are taught early and paid off at closure. Dialogue is sparse but natural.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information-to-sentence ratio. Occasional figurative layering (“constellations of dust”) risks overwriting but is balanced by concrete action. No loops, scaffold, or register drift. Final shimmer sentence is clean and propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Premise—celestial embroidery as covert cartography—is fresh and specific; transformation test fails if swapped. Candle-as-synchronizer and mutable star-chart are non-obvious syntheses. Risky lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry. No close echoes of famous scenes.</comment>
