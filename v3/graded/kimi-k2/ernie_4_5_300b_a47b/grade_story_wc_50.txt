<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s peripheral focus is dramatized through concrete micro-choices—angling the mirror, mapping light shifts—rather than labels. Interiority stays embodied (“his reflection warping in the mirror”) and contradictory (wonder vs. grave). The final act of reassembly is earned by prior study and carries visible cost: the cavern’s hum reclaims its voice while Elias quietly forfeits center-stage ownership. Only the keeper’s single line of dialogue feels slightly expository, trimming the top band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the timer’s restoration crystallizes a charged poise—wonder bottled yet alive—while Elias’s descent signals relinquishment. Causal chain holds: reverse-engineering → gear insertion → harmonic surge → storage. Orientation is anchored early (“marble cavern hummed…”) and sustained. One minor ellipsis—how the intact gear survived—is forgiven because the final image reweights the premise without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The cavern’s quartz veins and shifting light actively constrain Elias’s method; the mirror’s angle depends on them. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (“air tasted of damp stone and forgotten things”). The setting evolves with the timer’s repair, glowing in sync with the harvest. Only the spiral staircase at the end feels like a generic exit rather than a charged space.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore the harvest to store wonder—tightens once when Elias realizes the micro-etchings demand alignment with natural rhythms. Agency is clear: each visit maps a new constraint, culminating in the decisive gear insertion. Cost is felt in Elias’s quiet renunciation as he leaves the keepers to label vials. Pressure could have sharpened further had the wounded season shown visible decay rather than abstract “faint vibrations.”</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: preservation versus living wonder. The cellar of reason is both archive and crypt, a tension never moralized. Final image of labeled vials reweights earlier “bottled wonder” without sermon. Subtext in Elias’s mirrored reflection suggests he recognizes the paradox yet accepts it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with rhythmic control (“low thrum of trapped time… frozen starlight”). Perceptual signature is consistent: Elias notices edges, angles, peripheries. No POV leakage; sensory hierarchy reflects his locksmith’s gaze. Compression is purposeful; occasional elevated diction (“latent energy”) fits the cavern’s mythic register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; each sentence layers image, motion, or stakes. No loops or scaffold. Metaphors are coherent (“gears scattered like dead leaves”). One mixed moment—“store wonder in the cellar of reason”—is borderline but contextually earned. Final paragraph cadence slows appropriately to release tension.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The “harvest of echoes” premise is fresh yet grounded in tactile mechanics. Transformation test passes: swap cavern for any generic ruin and the story collapses. Peripheral focus as method feels non-obvious and integral. Risk-taking in quiet, accumulative design heightens resonance without gimmickry.</comment>
