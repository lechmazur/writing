<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Leeward’s interiority is embodied and specific—her trembling hands, salt-taste of victory—but the contradiction between her need for harmony and the physical toll never quite collides in a single moment; the final smile feels slightly unearned because the cost (raw fingers, aching arms) is summarized rather than dramatized as a fresh wound.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the driftwood circle’s shift from chaos to mosaic is legible and charged. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each dubbed layer thickens the pattern until the final silence reweights the whole. One causal gap: the seabird’s cry is absorbed too smoothly, a micro-convenience.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The floating orchard is never mere backdrop; the salt-slick planks, kelp ropes, and lightning-scarred trunk physically constrain Leeward’s footwork and mallet angles. The driftwood circle’s groan under strain is the final image that crystallizes cost, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—turning chaos into harmony—tightens through each percussive beat; the orchard’s structural groan supplies audible pressure. One clear escalation: the shift from flat plank to lightning-tree gong narrows options and raises stakes. Cost is visible in sweat and splintered wood.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: creation wrested from entropy. The final mosaic of plank, kelp, and fruit offers a non-literal answer without sermon. A hairline slip—“obstacles are just instruments waiting to be tuned” flirts with aphorism but is offset by embodied labor.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is oceanic and percussive—syntax rolls and breaks like surf. Compression is purposeful: “salt and victory on her lips” distills triumph and exhaustion. No POV drift; perceptual signature remains taut even under peak strain.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers sound, texture, or motion. Occasional figurative excess—“clouds dissolved into stars” is stock—but never muddies causality. No loops or scaffold; rhythm modulates with scene tempo.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The floating orchard-as-studio, the fractal dub technique, and the mallet’s sketched resonance synthesize into a fresh, non-obvious whole. Risky lyric accumulation pays off when the final silence reconfigures the entire soundscape. No derivative echoes.</comment>
