<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is vivid—ink-stained fingers, retrocognitive loops—but her final choice to “buy time” feels under-motivated; the diary’s blank pages hint at cost yet lack embodied consequence. Elara’s ghost supplies pressure, but Mara’s contradictory impulses (fear vs duty) are told more than dramatized in the collapse beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Mara survives but forfeits the codex, diary erased—cost is legible. Causal chain holds (diary → lagoon → tunnels → trapdoor), though the Society man’s sudden appearance edges coincidence. Orientation is clear by 120 words; lens is Causal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The obsidian lagoon and zeppelin library are sharply evoked and constrain action—lagoon literally parts to admit Mara. Sensory detail is selective (salt, decay, bioluminescent fungi) and filtered through Mara’s urgency. Final image of blank diary pages reweights the setting’s promise of revelation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“uncover truth before erasure”—is signaled early and tightened when Mara sees her own death in the tunnels. One decisive turn: triggering the trapdoor, trading codex for life. Cost is visible (blank diary, lost codex) and narrows future options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of memory vs erasure emerges through the diary’s encryption and blank ending; no overt moralizing. Subtext in Elara’s “They’ll erase us all” resonates without explanation. Final image of blank pages offers conceptual repricing: truth survives only as potential.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is textured, slightly archaic, consistent with Mara’s archival precision. Compression in tunnel descent is purposeful. Dialogue between Mara and Elara carries subtext; Joran’s lines feel functional but distinct. No head-hopping; POV stays locked to Mara.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and propulsive; occasional elevated diction (“bioluminescent fungi”) fits the scholarly POV. No loops or scaffold. One mixed metaphor—“tunnels twisted like intestines”—but clarity intact. Final paragraph cadence crystallizes loss.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: retrocognitive archivist on a floating library negotiating with a ghost via sand symbols. Tropes (resistance diary, hidden tunnels) are reweighted by the lagoon’s memory threshold. Risky collapse ending feels earned, not gimmick.</comment>
