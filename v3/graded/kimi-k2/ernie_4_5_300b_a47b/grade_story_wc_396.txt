<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“skin held the faint silver sheen”), but her contradictory impulses remain muted; the final choice to “give the storm a heart” is resonant yet feels slightly pre-ordained rather than wrestled with under pressure. Micro-choices (lighting lantern, walking the mirrors) are present but lack visible cost until the final beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the fragment’s glow spreads, aurora brightens, ice stills—cost is felt in the long shadow across snow. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of mirrored glimpses tightens stakes without causal reversals. Orientation is clear by line 3; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Setting is selective and purposeful: frost-heavy apple boughs, groaning ice, lantern-lit mirrors—each constrains movement and charges the final image. The lighthouse orchard functions as micro-setting that alters tactics (mirrors in attic, fragment on snow). Sensory hierarchy reflects Elara’s aurora-tuned perception.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—quieting the fear-storm—is signaled early and deepened through each mirror glimpse. One meaningful tightening: the weighted breath before reply forces the empathic synthesis. Cost is conceptual (shared grief absorbed) and visible in the flare that stills the floes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of empathy as active courage emerges through concrete particulars (sailor’s terror → resilience, mother’s clutch → love’s strength) without moralizing. Final image reweights prior fragments into a living heart for the storm, achieving resonance without statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet disciplined, with aurora-tinted perceptual signature (“midnight ice” eyes, “shadow-laced”). Syntax modulates with emotional rise; no head-hopping. Free indirect style stays clean; diction remains within Elara’s plausible lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; each sentence advances image or stakes. Minor loop risk in “frost…frozen…floe” cluster but offset by rhythmic variation. No mixed metaphors or register drift. Final paragraph crystallizes without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lighthouse orchard, aurora-touched keeper, and empathy-mirrors feels inevitable in hindsight. Tropes (storm-as-fear, crystal mending) are transformed through specific emotional calculus. Risk in lyric accumulation pays off in closure image.</comment>
