<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Clara’s grief-driven coaching and empathic gift are credibly embodied; her micro-choice to reveal Lila’s father history tilts the girl’s stance. Lila’s shift from isolation to “I’m learning” is legible, though her interiority is mostly reported. Cost is present but diffuse—no single forfeiture crystallizes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Single-scene arc holds under Accumulative/Textural lens: seven games layer density until Lila’s stance crystallizes. Closure is a Charged Poise—“let’s keep planting”—with felt social cost. Orientation is swift; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Cobalt library, mist, and magnetic grotto are vividly filtered through Clara’s bias; the grotto’s hum and filings constrain the pawn’s tremble and the zipper’s tug, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clean.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Lila’s need to connect with her absent father—tightens through each game; the seventh loss crystallizes her shift. Cost is emotional, visible in her softened unspoken words. No external reversals, but internal deepening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of “planting forests of second thoughts” emerges organically from chess moves and window displays; final line reframes rebellion as collaborative growth. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Clara’s lyrical, precise interiority—“the hush where past meets prophecy”—remains consistent; dialogue with Lila carries distinct subtext. No POV drift; rhythm modulates with emotional beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lush yet purposeful; occasional stacked metaphors (“cobalt library’s mist-swirled aisles… breath held too long”) flirt with overwriting but never stall momentum. Clean mechanics.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Magnetic grotto as amplifier of silence, chess displays as urban semaphore—fresh synthesis of grief, mentorship, and quiet resistance. Risky lyricism pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
