<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara’s frugality and grief are embodied in tactile choices (bartering wages, gripping the tile), but the mentor’s death is summarized rather than dramatized, muting the interior contradiction. The final covenant with herself lands cleanly, yet the cost feels more conceptual than visceral.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the tile becomes a mirror, reframing her quest as self-covenant. Causal chain holds—tile as key → chamber → mirror—though the disembodied voice edges on convenient oracle. Cost is legible in her lighter steps and the word “Asharu.”</comment>

<comment>The reimagined palace is evoked through sandstone arches, bioluminescent chamber, and star-chart reliefs; these details constrain movement and discovery. The tile itself serves as micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory economy is strong, though “dusky harmony” risks abstraction.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—seal a covenant with the unknown—is signaled early and tightened when the wall slides open. Agency drives each beat: placing tiles, answering the voice. Cost is visible (tile edges bite palm), but escalation plateaus once the chamber opens.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through the ironic fusion of frugality and cosmic scale; no explicit moralizing. The tile’s shift from cipher to mirror reweights the premise without statement. Final resonance lingers in “Asharu,” binding curiosity to self-oath.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is precise, textured, and consistent—Elara’s skepticism colors every perception. Compression (“Encrypted devotion”) is taught early and paid off. No head-hopping; the disembodied voice remains external oracle, cleanly handled.</comment>

<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense. Occasional elevated diction (“relic that transcended language”) momentarily drifts from POV lexicon but recovers. No loops or scaffold; sentence variety supports momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The fusion of Babylonian mathematics, frugal astronomy, and ironic self-covenant feels fresh. Tropes (magic artifact, disembodied voice) are grounded in character stakes. Specificity of “star-chart eyes” and “Asharu” anchors originality.</comment>
