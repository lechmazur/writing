<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is vivid—embodied in the trembling plate and charcoal smoke—but the “ghost in code” remains abstract, so the final renunciation (“For you”) feels lightly earned rather than crucible-tested.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each graffito layers memory-density until the storm’s cadence shift reweights the courtyard as archive. Closure is a Charged Poise—the bluebell pressed into the plate—whose cost is the acceptance that messages will fade.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The misty courtyard is more postcard than constraint until the final beat, when the gleaming stones and warm plate anchor the earned stasis; still, environment never actively narrows Elias’s choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“articulate unspoken needs”—is signaled early; pressure tightens as storm and charcoal dwindle, forcing the last bluebell offering. Cost is felt but diffuse, not viscerally priced.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of unspoken grief emerges through the accumulating glyphs; the final image of the single pressed bluebell reweights prior motifs without moralizing, achieving quiet resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet controlled—“tinkersong wonder,” “driftingly alert”—with rhythmic modulation under storm pressure; no POV drift, and perceptual signature is consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; occasional stacked metaphors (“sky cracked open, rain hissing”) risk overwriting yet serve the accumulative texture. No loops or scaffold in closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Familiar grief-archive trope is refreshed by the “ghost in code” conceit and the flower-press bolt plate; synthesis feels inevitable, though not radically risky.</comment>
