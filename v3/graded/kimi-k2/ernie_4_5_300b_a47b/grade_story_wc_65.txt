<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lira’s interior contradiction—fear of the blank page vs. compulsion to map ignorance—is embodied in trembling hands and ink-scent; her predictive obsession is shown through nightly climbs and data cross-checks. The final renunciation (burning journals) carries visible cost and is earned by prior causality. Secondary characters remain off-page, so relationship crucible is N/A.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each observation (lake temperature, star positions) tightens the forecast until the equinox crack rewrites the village’s future. Closure is a Decisive Change—the thaw arrives on schedule, reconfiguring the villagers’ stance. Cost is felt in Lira’s splintered quill and burnt past. Orientation is anchored early; no teleporting props.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The obsidian spire and frozen lake constrain every choice: the spire’s stairs dictate nightly data collection, the lake’s ice sets the stake. Micro-setting of the weathered oak desk and iron-scented ink ground the POV. Sensory selection is urgent and character-biased. Final image of hearth flames recharges the spire’s earlier cold, crystallizing the cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will predictive modeling defeat perpetual winter—is signaled in paragraph two. Escalation tightens through nightly data and derision from Elders; the equinox crack is the earned reversal that narrows options (winter is no longer inevitable). Cost: burnt journals, dulled quill, social scorn endured.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: knowledge tempered by imagination can reshape fate. Subtext lives in the kingfisher’s courage transferred to quill, in the silent awe of villagers. Final image of burning journals reframes earlier obsession without moralizing. No thematic echo in final paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with tactile diction (“iron-rich ink,” “jagged edges clawed”). POV remains tight; no head-hopping. Syntax modulates with pressure—longer sentences for reflection, clipped fragments during the thaw. Dialogue is minimal and natural when present.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers data, sensation, and stakes. Occasional elevated phrasing (“celestial ledger”) fits Lira’s scholar mind. No loops or mixed metaphors. Minor scaffold in “data without imagination is a corpse” line, but it lands within character voice.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: cartography of ignorance, predictive alchemy, kingfisher courage as tool. Tropes (chosen one vs. tradition) are grounded in meteorological minutiae. Risky structural compression pays off in final hearth image. Premise is not derivative; transformation test fails—story is inseparable from setting and method.</comment>
