<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Kael’s interiority is vivid—his mantra “Discard assumptions” is embodied in the dismantling of the console—but the shift from observer to transformer feels slightly under-motivated; the cost (burned palm) is present yet not deeply tied to an internal contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the tower’s rebirth reweights the premise. Causal chain holds—each dismantling beat tightens access to the hush—though the leap from fragment to city-wide resurrection could be sharper.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Radio-tower-gorge is tactile and atmospheric; the Hollywood fragment and rusted console function as micro-settings that constrain Kael’s choices. Final image of glowing veins charging the gorge crystallizes the transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“find the beginning in every ending”—is signaled early and tightened by each stripped wire. One clear escalation: the hush shifts from absence to potential, forcing Kael to risk the burn. Cost is visible but not yet viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of rebirth-through-silence emerges organically from the city’s circuitry and Kael’s dismantling. Final image of the river of light offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. Subtext in the fragment’s shift from fame-mirror to spent key is effective.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is textured, lyrical yet precise—“serenely electric static,” “spectral fingers”—and stays within Kael’s perceptual range. Compression and patterned elision are taught early and paid off in the luminous thread vision.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic; occasional stacked metaphors (“skeletal hand…spectral fingers”) risk overwriting but never stall momentum. No loops or scaffold; final paragraph achieves crystalline clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-apocalyptic tech-fantasy and metaphysical signal theory. The hush-as-language concept and the gorge’s liquid-light rebirth feel inevitable yet non-derivative. Risky lyric escalation heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
