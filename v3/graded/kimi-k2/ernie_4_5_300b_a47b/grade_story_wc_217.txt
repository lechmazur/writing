<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority is lyrical and embodied (bare feet skimming water, tracing feather barbs), but her contradictory impulses remain muted; no moment of genuine struggle complicates her tending. The final renunciation of permanence is credible yet cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure is a gentle Resonant Reconfiguration: the tapestry will dissolve, yet the act of creation is affirmed. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—storm debris is gathered, woven, and released—though the kite-string snap functions more as echo than causal pivot.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Cobalt lagoon, warm gold afternoon, kelp lattice—details are selective and filtered through Lira’s perceptual bias. The drake’s feather anchors both design and final image, constraining her choice to release rather than preserve.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stakes are quietly stated: harmonize discord through transient art. Pressure tightens once when the kite falls, but the escalation is more tonal than consequential; no visible price is paid beyond the inevitable unraveling.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme—beauty in impermanence—emerges through Lira’s tending and release, not pronouncement. The final image of the feather against fading light reweights earlier motifs without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays close to Lira’s senses; diction is controlled, lyrical, consistent. Purposeful compression (“burnished hush”) teaches the reader the cadence early and sustains it to the end.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is fluid and image-dense yet avoids purple overload; rhythm modulates with scene temperature. One paraphrase loop (“quiet rhythms—the lap of waves…”) is minor and does not dull closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>The drake-feather-as-lyric-bridge trope is familiar, but its integration into storm debris weaving and final dissolution feels specific to this voice. Risk is modest; transformation is subtle but present.</comment>
