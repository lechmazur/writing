<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lirael’s interiority is vivid—her deliberate pause to withhold the council, her embodied grip on the stone—but the “softly deliberate” trait is asserted more than dramatized; the final choice to speak “Bloom” feels inevitable yet the cost is only lightly sketched.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the spiral shadow resolves into luminous motes that reconfigure the library’s shelves—an earned Resonant Reconfiguration. Causal chain (footage → word → stone → shadow) holds under a Causal lens; only a faint ellipsis in how the future stone arrives keeps it from 9.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The blooming library above clouds is rendered with selective, sensory precision; the petrified-petal shelves and glass dome constrain visibility and mood, while the river stone’s shifting veins act as micro-setting that charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“preserve the shape of hope”—is signaled early and tightened when Lirael must choose the word; the cost is conceptual (hope’s fragility) rather than visceral, but agency is clear and escalation coherent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of hope’s necessary metamorphosis emerges through concrete objects and choices; the spiral’s transformation from threat to gift offers a resonant, non-moralizing answer. Subtext in Thalos’s “luminous regret” deepens without overt statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with a perceptual signature attuned to dusk light and petal-shelf glow. Compression and patterned elision (“shadow unbound,” “luminous regret”) are taught early and paid off; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; occasional elevated diction (“luminous with regret”) fits the fabular register. One paraphrase loop (“the shadow… the shadow unbound”) is minor; no figurative muddle at climax.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The dream-sharing network as time-sharing device is a fresh synthesis; the river stone’s dual-timeline resonance feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric compression succeeds without obscuring causality, though the premise’s full implications are lightly sketched.</comment>
