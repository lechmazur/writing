<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elias’s contradictory impulses—fixing clocks vs. embracing uncertainty—are dramatized in the greenhouse collapse and compass discovery; the final renunciation of perfection is earned and carries felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the spinning compass reweights the premise, the cost is the abandonment of certainty, and the causal lens holds from map to garden.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The subterranean waterfall and moss-slick cave constrain Elias’s movements and supply the compass; the greenhouse shaft collapse is spatially coherent and charged.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>One dominant stake—truth vs. certainty—tightens when the compass refuses north; the plunge and recovery raise cost, though coincidence (storm-upturned hatch) slightly dilutes agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: the futility of imposed order is shown through Elias’s tools and the spinning needle; final garden image offers non-literal resonance without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct—tinkerer’s perceptual signature in gear metaphors and sensory selectivity; no head-hopping; rhythm modulates with pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and propulsive; occasional figurative layering (“leaves sharp as knives”) stays purposeful; no loops or register drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of clockwork, subterranean myth, and epistemic uncertainty; risk-taking in letting the compass fail as tool yet succeed as mirror feels earned.</comment>
