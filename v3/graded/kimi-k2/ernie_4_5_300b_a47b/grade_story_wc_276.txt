<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Kael’s cool-headed detachment and competence feel consistent; his final kneel-and-smile suggests Earned Stasis after a credible on-page trade (goddess lost → sky stilled). Yet interiority after the spectral touch leans toward lyrical summary rather than embodied emotion, blunting the fuller 9.0+ claim.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure unit is Resonant Reconfiguration—garden regains harmony at cost of goddess, crystallized in the final clear note. Accum/Textural lens holds: zigzag patterns intensify, break, and coalesce without causal reversals; the spike reprise charges the final image. Orientation solid by 100 words; causal hiccup limited to 0.1.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The sound wave garden remains tactile and specific; emitter, spikes, and crystal trees constrain every tactic. Sensory economy is vivid (warm-hued ripples underfoot) and consistently filtered through Kael’s fisher-mechanic eye. The garden itself co-defines the final image, just shy of 8.8 only because first spatial anchor is slightly slow.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—stabilize the garden by catching the goddess’s echo—is signaled early and tightened when Kael’s silence must voice a trade-off. Escalation is one decisive density spike rather than multi-turn causality, but cost is palpable: she dissolves, sky orbits freeze. One 0.2 cap for mild abstraction in “patterns can’t hold you.”</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through pattern-break / pattern-restore cycles; the cost is a latent grief for the replaced divinity. Close avoids moralizing and echoes earlier motifs in the single lingering note. A slight drift toward abstract “spectral sorrow” edges it down from 8.5.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Kael’s physical lens; voice owns ceremonial, feral lullaby without slipping into exposé. No dialogue, yet diction and imagistic cadence modulate with each strike. One micro drift—“grief so profound it threatened to unravel his composure”—reads like narrative commentary rather than sensed thought, 0.1 off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops, clean sentence rhythm, and high density where each image advances or reflects tension. Figurative language is sculpted: “zigzag of crimson light” mirrors both visual and emotional rupture. Final line lands by image without over-song. Fully integrated under pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses fisher, sound garden, lite-physics, and mythic resonance into an organic whole; goddess-as-fractured-frequency feels fresh yet inevitable. No genre clichés telegraph the arc. Spike, constellations, and silence form an inventive triad that reweights the last pause.</comment>
