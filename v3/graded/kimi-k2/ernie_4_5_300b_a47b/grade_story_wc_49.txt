<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Lira’s motives are legible—restore fading magic and anchor the community—and her embodied urgency shows in aching hands and damp cheeks. Choice-agency, however, is concentrated in the final invitation (“Will you help me remember?”) rather than dramatized in a wrenching decision; the cost (vine to dust) is borne by the prop, not her character flaw. Interior contradiction is present but muted: her need to “keep stories spinning” is underplayed. Earned stasis works, yet feels more extension than closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Lira’s open offer ushers in shared guardianship with a felt cost—the spent tendril. Drive is Accumulative/Textural; each golden thread deepens the stakes until the forest “pulses” back to life, tightening the same tapestry. Orientation and causality are clean; only a single heartbeat of ambiguity—will the alliance endure?—tilts the lens slightly toward situational poise rather than decisive pivot.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Setting is lavish yet purposeful: cogs, glowing pollen, wind-up birds, silvered oaks all return in charged beats. Spatial tracking across branch, dew-mapped floor, and communal circle is flawless. Environment literally animates—earth coos, vines spin—with direct narrative payoff that constrains Lira’s exhaustion and the creatures’ choreography. Over-rich description occasionally outweighs utilitarian detail, keeping it under 8.5.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“the arbor’s fading magic”—is signaled early and visibly reversed through progressive restoration. One meaningful tightening: the vine collapses, demanding communal stewardship. Yet escalation is external (forest wakes, stream sings) more than psychological; the protagonist’s internal tension never sharpens to a pivot with unmistakable cost. Lemons-to-lemonade outcome feels slightly inevitability-tinged.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Theme coheres around collective memory as living labor: magic requires continuous tendering. Subtext flares in the fox’s yawn—“Again tomorrow?”—offering wry acceptance rather than parable. No sermonizing; final promise blooms silently. Some abstraction in “golden stories” remains, preventing tense thematic bite.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person close stays snug to Lira’s hushed wonder, tactile metaphors steady. Prose modulates tempo—short staccato plucks during climax, longer exhalations at doom. Minor “liquid gold” overwrite drifts toward cliché but never ruptures voice. Earned lyric confidence under pressure; dialogue minimal, well-aimed.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Rich vocal texture balanced by rhythmic variety; surplus metaphors (“moon smiled back”) momentarily clot the final cadence without damaging clarity. No loops, no register drift; sentence engineering precise. High info density maintained—single phrases often craft mood and plot alike.</comment>

<grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Viola-magic renovates familiar eco-bio-lumina trope through specificity: spider-silk lyre, wind-up birds in forgotten tongues. Mid-scene pivot to communal memory steward flips chosen-one arc without cheating. Risk is moderate; payoff “seed planted under renewed moon” subverts heroic resolution while reinforcing premise. Not revolutionary, yet fresh enough.</comment>
