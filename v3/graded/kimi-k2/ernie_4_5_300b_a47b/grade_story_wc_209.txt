<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mara’s quiet obsession is credibly embodied—brush trembling, palm on glass—but her interiority drifts into summary (“she’d finally understood”) rather than contradiction in scene. The final smile feels unearned; no micro-choice dramatizes the cost of her new knowledge. Secondary characters (Sister Agatha) apply only off-hand pressure, so relationship crucible is minimal. Overall, a solid portrait with minor epiphany drift.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the pavilion murals invert time/space, reweighting the premise with visible conceptual cost. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern intensification across seasons and glass layers. Orientation is clear within 120 words; no lens ambiguity. One transition (winter→summer) is handled cleanly. Minor causality gap: how the etchings “rewrite photosynthesis” remains asserted, not dramatized.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Amber pavilion, jasmine scent, and cathedral scaffolding are vivid and selective; the glass itself becomes a micro-setting that constrains touch and perception. Light shifts (morning root-systems, twilight heartbeats) are filtered through Mara’s painterly gaze. Spatial choreography holds—no impossible moves on scaffolding. Final image of murals breathing in reverse crystallizes setting as active constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decode grandmother’s secret—is signaled early and tightens through each glass layer deciphered. Escalation is textural: each new etching reweights the mystery rather than narrows options causally. Cost is conceptual (fear of being seen, Elias’s confession) rather than visceral. One deepening beat: violet glow reveals inscription that reframes the quest. Agency remains intellectual; no tangible forfeiture.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of communion with darkness emerges organically from glass etchings and nocturnal blooms; no explicit moralizing. Subtext in “map to the hush” and “dark nourishes what light scorches” resonates without decoding. Final murals whisper rather than preach. Ambiguity lingers—window’s last layer unbroken—yet feels purposeful. Avoids sentimentality through concrete particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Voice is painterly, tactile, and consistent: “bioluminescent hues,” “tendrils of light curling toward the dark.” Syntax modulates with emotional intensity; short clauses under flashlight tension, longer cadences in reflection. No POV drift or filter-verb clutter. Dialogue (Sister Agatha) is spare and subtextual. Distinct perceptual signature sustained to final line.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and idea. Metaphors are controlled—no mixed vehicles. Rhythm accelerates during scaffold climbs, breathes during dusk observation. Occasional elevated diction (“umbral tenderness”) fits artist POV. No loops or scaffold artifacts. Clean mechanics throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Fresh synthesis: botanist grandmother + cathedral window as living cipher + reverse-blooming murals. Tropes (mystical inheritance, secret code) are transformed through painter’s sensory lens. Risky lyric accumulation pays off in final image. Specificity of glass etchings and jasmine shadows anchors universals. No derivative echoes.</comment>
