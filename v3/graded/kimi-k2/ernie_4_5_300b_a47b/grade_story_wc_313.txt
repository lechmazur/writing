<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara’s vigilance and inherited guilt are embodied in tactile beats (label, photos); her shift from hoarding to sharing memory is earned, though the daughter’s entrance feels slightly expository rather than crucible-level pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Mara’s placement of her own photo beside the ghosts crystallizes her new custodial stance. Causal chain (label → photos → daughter → shared guardianship) holds under Accumulative/Textural lens; cost is the surrender of solitary control.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Midnight ridgeway, receding waterline, and the half-buried label create a tactile, haunted micro-setting that constrains movement and frames the final image; selective sensory detail mirrors Mara’s narrowed vigilance without tourist excess.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—town’s memory versus dam’s failure—tightens once when Mara chooses shared guardianship over solitary expunging. Pressure is coherent but the external dam threat remains more atmospheric than tested on-page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of memory as communal responsibility emerges through objects and choices, not statement; final image of new photo beside old ones offers non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext in the daughter’s “I’ve been waiting” carries generational cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is restrained, weathered, and specific to Mara’s levee-warden perception; diction stays within her lexicon. Compression and patterned elision are purposeful and paid off in the final cadence shift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful; “broken teeth” and “mirrored hush” serve tone without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Flooded town resurfacing as literal and mnemonic event feels fresh; transformation of souvenir photos into living map avoids trope trap. Risk lies in quiet lyric closure rather than spectacle, executed coherently.</comment>
