<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elio’s interiority is vivid—his tactile search for the halo fragment and wordless song embody his “quietly persistent” trait. Yet the shift from artifact-hunt to mystical renewal feels slightly under-motivated; the cost of singing (loss of the fragment’s power?) is implied rather than dramatized. Still, his embodied contradictions (silence vs. song, loss vs. possibility) register on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the courtyard’s transformed circle and Elio’s final smile crystallize a new stance toward silence. Causality is Accumulative/Textural—patterned imagery (mist, bells, fragment) tightens until the song reweights the whole. One minor drift: the “wrong turn” mechanic appears late and functions more as reveal than causal pivot.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The abandoned train and hidden courtyard are rendered with selective sensory detail—rust flakes, ivy curtain, fountain’s glass-clear water—each filtered through Elio’s carpenter gaze. The setting constrains choice: the collapsed canopy hides the fragment, the ivy door reveals the oasis. Spatial choreography is clean; no white-room syndrome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“interpret silence as possibility”—is signaled early and tested when Elio chooses song over secrecy. Escalation is one deepening: the courtyard’s response reconfigures the value of silence itself. Cost is conceptual (the fragment’s glow fades), but the price could be sharper on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of renewal-through-quiet emerges organically from Elio’s actions; no moralizing. The final image of arranged wildflowers and patterned ripples offers a non-literal answer to the central question. Subtext in the wind bells’ hush and the fragment’s bite carries weight without exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elio’s carpenter perception; diction is tactile and rhythmic (“splintered wood,” “misting hush”). No dialogue, so voice coherence rests on internal texture, which holds. Occasional lyric compression (“whispering gleam”) is taught early and paid off in the final song.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and propulsive; figurative language is selective and purposeful. One minor loop: “misting hush” is repeated with near-identical phrasing twice. Otherwise, sentences advance story or atmosphere without scaffold. No mixed metaphors or register drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The abandoned-circus frame is familiar, but the fusion of carousel carpentry with mystical acoustics feels fresh. The halo fragment and wind-bell map are specific inventions that charge the closure. Risk is moderate—lyric mode rather than plot twist—but coherence holds.</comment>
