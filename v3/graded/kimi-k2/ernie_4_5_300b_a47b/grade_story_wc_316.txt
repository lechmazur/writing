<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Kael’s contradictory impulses—yearning for feeling yet fearing it—are dramatized in the duel; the final merge costs him the clone-self and reawakens pain, earning the change. Interiority is specific (“raw but real”), though a few phrases edge toward label-speak (“emotional numbness”). Micro-choices (slamming palm, cradling the jar) reveal value hierarchy under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each energy exchange narrows options until the merge becomes inevitable. Closure is a decisive change—clone erased, emotions restored—paid for by the loss of a potential future self. Anchors are clear within 120 words; no orientation debt. One causal tightening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Floating rock dojo and sky-vortex are vivid, but only the dojo’s cracking surface actively constrains tactics. Brain-in-jar serves as micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective; spatial choreography is coherent. Lacks one more environmental pressure to breach 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—custody of singular existence—signaled early. Escalation is causal: each opposed surge tightens the field until only merger or annihilation remains. Cost is visible in the clone’s scream and Kael’s raw heart. One meaningful turn satisfies scope.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of authentic selfhood emerges through the duel’s energy dialectic; no explicit moralizing. Final image of the brain as “a choice” reweights the premise with conceptual cost. Subtext in clone’s sneer and Kael’s grin carries the conflict. Slight abstraction in “history rewrites itself” keeps it from 8.8.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is textured, rhythmic, and POV-locked; sensory bias (“wind howling through cracks in worn boots”) is character-specific. Compression and inversion (“not falling but descending”) feel intentional. No head-hopping; dialogue minimal but subtext-laden. Distinct perceptual signature under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, propulsive, and image-dense; no loops or scaffold. Metaphors (“liquid clouds,” “sugar in tea”) are apt and brief. Sentence rhythm modulates with tension. One mixed metaphor (“dormant volcano” after “wildfire”) is minor.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of clone-duel and ego-death recovery; tropes are inverted (clone wants autonomy, original wants feeling). Specificity of complementary-opposite energy work grounds the fantastical frame. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Minor risk in sky-rewrite device, but it pays off.</comment>
