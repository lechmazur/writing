<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority is textured and embodied; the coral fragment and cast function as extensions of her contradictory impulses. The final act—placing the coral on the table—earns its cost through prior emotional investment. Minor slip: “lotus-hearted ache” edges toward label-speak, though it is dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the coral becomes a talisman that reweights the peace talks. Causal chain holds—each reflection on the cast’s codes tightens Lira’s resolve until she risks the gesture. Cost is legible in the delegates’ silence and her own softened ache.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mist, coral, and bench form a micro-setting that constrains movement and mood; the coral’s ridges physically bite into Lira’s palm, guiding her final choice. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered. One minor drift: “aquarium” origin feels briefly dislocated before re-anchoring.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—grafting meaning onto ruin—tightens when Lira translates the child’s fear into usable hope. The single escalation beat (placing coral between factions) narrows options and carries visible social risk. Pressure remains coherent under Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from coral/cast mirroring; no moralizing. Final image of the cast “hung in the atrium’s rafters” reweights prior loss into fragile hope without explicit statement. Subtext in the general’s touch on coral is sharp and unspoken.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded; perceptual signature filters every detail through Lira’s translator mind. Rhythm modulates with pressure—short clauses under stress, longer reflections in lulls. No head-hopping; free indirect style is clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is selective and patterned. One paraphrase loop (“broken things could hold the blueprint for something whole”) slightly dulls the final cadence. Otherwise, zero scaffold, strong verbs, and vivid nouns.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise—translator decrypting a child’s cast to restart peace talks—is fresh and specific. Coral fragment as negotiating talisman transforms familiar “object of hope” trope. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight; risk-taking (lyric compression) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
