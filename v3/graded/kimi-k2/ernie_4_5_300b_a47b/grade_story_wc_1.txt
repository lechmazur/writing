<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lirael’s interior contradiction—“survival left her hollow” vs “need to discover purpose”—drives the crawl through the crevice. Embodied emotion in the shard warming her thigh crystallizes the cost. Final stance (to etch panels, teach frost-mapping) is earned, but “pauses” idea edges close to theme-articulation rather than lived flaw.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: frost-patterns, shard hologram, and glass reprise deepen stakes rather than causal chain. Closure is the Charged Poise crystallizing purpose in the final stride; “drifting resonance” image reweights prior material with visible cost (“hollow”). Orientation anchored within 120 w.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Indigo canyon walls, frost prisms, and smoke-stained chamber are vivid, selective, and—via frost route and shard projection—actively constrain choices and charge closure. Micro-setting (glass shard body-warm) doubles as setting and prop. No environmental waste.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—re-purpose life after survival—tightens via frost-lead map, shard revelation, and final renunciation of studio vases. Escalation is steady pressure of “hollow” vs “pause-truth,” culminating in a cost visible on page: she forsakes old art for teaching, accepting uncertain drift.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from accumulative imagery—glass, frost, scorched ledger—rather than overt statement. “In the pauses, the truth breathes” lands as holographic inscription, not preachy. Weight lingers but mild epiphanic tilt keeps it shy of higher band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Lyrical, sustained third-person limited with perceptual signature tuned to glassworker sight: “molten pools into mirrors that reflected not faces but emotions.” Rhythm modulates with canyon breath. No POV drift. Distinct voice under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud ear is clean—sentence variety, image-driven diction, and no loops. Single strained metaphor: “ribs to swallow the moon’s light” edges purple but recovered quickly. Information density high without prose artifacts; closure image crisp.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Unique synthesis—smuggler’s frost-map + glass-worker perception—feels inevitable. Canyon chamber hologram and “etch existence into pauses” invert standard survivor arc. Fresh inflection outweighs familiar “hollow-after-trauma” scaffold.</comment>
