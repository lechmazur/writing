<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Lira’s obsession with the lost expedition and her mother’s fate is vivid and embodied; the reed whistle, journal, and pattern language all press her toward the crack. Internal contradiction surfaces when awe collides with terror at the watchers. The final stance—standing her ground while the city wakes—earns its cost through prior causal chain. Minor slip: “quietly driven” is asserted more than dramatized until the final beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each beat (whistle sequence, crack widening, journal revelation) tightens options until the gate’s purpose flips. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—gate was a cage, not a shield—felt through Lira’s immobility amid collapsing shells. One transition (surface → tunnel) is clean and legible. No causality breaks; cost is unmistakable in the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The turtle-shell city is never mere backdrop: its grooves guide Lira’s map, its fracture becomes the tunnel, its waking reconfigures stakes. Brine, iron, and salt anchor every shift in pressure. Spatial choreography from attic to tunnel to shaking plaza tracks cleanly. Final image of shifting shells charges the closing beat directly.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—uncover why watchers move—escalates when the journal reframes them as screaming keepers and the shells as hungry. Each tightening (crack, hum, collapse) narrows Lira’s choices until endurance is the only agency left. Cost is visible: city shakes, people flee, shells devour. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from pattern-as-countdown and gate-as-cage; no moralizing. Subtext of inherited obsession and complicity resonates through the mother’s journal and Lira’s mirrored fate. Final reweighting—“the watchers had been screaming all along”—lands without exposition. Ambiguity lingers: is Lira savior or final witness?</comment>

<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays close to Lira’s sensory filter; perceptual signature is tactile and cartographic. Rhythm modulates with pressure: longer sentences for wonder, staccato for collapse. No head-hopping. Occasional elevated diction (“calcified bone,” “conceptual repricing”) fits the mythic register without drifting from POV lexicon.</comment>

<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet textured; each sentence advances image or stakes. No loops, no scaffold. Metaphors (turtle heartbeat in shell) are precise and earned. Minor filter verbs (“she felt”) appear but do not stall momentum. Final paragraph achieves Charged Poise with zero slack.</comment>

<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Turtle-shell necropolis as living prison feels fresh; trope of lost expedition is inverted into countdown mechanism. Pattern language as warning rather than communication is non-obvious. Specificity of reed whistle’s single haunting note and salt-iron taste anchors the concept. Risky reversal—gate meant to keep us in—earned by prior detail.</comment>
