<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Thaddeus’s interiority is atmospheric but diffuse; the yarn needle and “distill complexity” remain abstract labels rather than embodied stakes. No contradictory impulse is dramatized mid-scene, so the final silence feels like continuation, not earned renunciation. The ferryman is present but exerts no pressure that forces a choice, keeping relationship status static.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure is a quiet Charged Poise—the silent exchange reconfigures the palimpsest promise—but the cost is only gestured at (“carry his own layer forward”). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, yet the tightening is more cadence than consequence. Orientation is clear by ~100 words, no debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fog, ticking gutters, and the creaking hull are vivid and selective, filtering through Thaddeus’s professional attention. The yarn needle functions as micro-setting, but it never constrains a choice; it merely accompanies reflection. Environment guides mood, not tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—“palimpsest promise” distilled into essence—stays conceptual; pressure rises atmospherically but never narrows options or exacts a visible price. The ferry’s arrival is situational, not a turn driven by Thaddeus’s agency. Escalation is tonal, not tactical.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme of layered memory and distilled truth emerges through image and ritual silence, avoiding overt statement. The final image reweights the yarn needle as a tool of continuity, but the conceptual cost remains gentle. Subtext is present yet modest.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Voice is consistent, textured, and perceptually specific—“spindrift serenity,” “wet coal” eyes. Compression and patterned elision are taught early and paid off in the hushed closure. No POV drift; silence carries subtext effectively.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lyrical yet lean, with rhythmic variation and no loops. Occasional elevated diction (“palimpsest,” “distill complexity”) slightly exceeds the coachman’s likely lexicon but remains coherent. No artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>The ferry-as-palimpsest conceit is fresh, and the silent ritual feels specific to this world. Yet the yarn needle’s mythic resonance edges toward familiar trope without full transformation. Risk is moderate; specificity keeps it above template.</comment>
