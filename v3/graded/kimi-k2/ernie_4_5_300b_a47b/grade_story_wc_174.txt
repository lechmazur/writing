<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s interior contradiction—elegant liar seeking redemption—drives every beat; the moment he flips the projection to “make the shadows dance” crystallizes his stance with visible cost. Yet the serenity trait is asserted more than embodied under pressure, and Mara’s presence is too slight to function as crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the reversed projection reconfigures meaning and forecloses the old “smooth lies” path. Causal chain holds—argument hush → raw audience → flipped show—but the lens tilts Accumulative/Textural rather than pure Causal, and the cost is more conceptual than visceral.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dome’s rusted ribs fracture light and echo laughter, literally shaping the projection surface; the story stick’s glow becomes micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered, though “meteor hush” edges toward atmospheric cliché.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can Elias test an ethical story mode under live scrutiny—tightens when the drifter scoffs and Mara reframes the campfire metaphor. The reversal of roles forces a public stance with reputational cost, satisfying the single meaningful turn required at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of complicity and half-truth emerges through the puppet swap and Mara’s mirror line, not authorial commentary. Final image of flickering campfire shadows offers resonant, non-moralizing answer. One near-theme-statement (“half-truths are the only kind worth telling”) is thin but not sermonizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Voice is urbane, ink-stained, and rhythmically controlled; perceptual signature favors fractured light and hush. Compression and elision are purposeful, taught early by the “ink-stained fingers” detail. Dialogue is sparse but carries subtext; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is vivid and propulsive, with strong verbs (“loomed,” “piercing,” “scrubbed”) and minimal scaffold. One mixed metaphor (“rust-crowned ribs piercing dusk”) and a near-paraphrase loop (“stories are thieves… reverse the heist”) slightly dull the peak beat, keeping it below 8.5.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: calligrapher turned shadow-puppet ethicist in a decommissioned radar dome. The trope of role-reversal is grounded in Elias’s specific guilt and the dome’s optic architecture. Risky setting choice heightens stakes without gimmickry; slight echo of “campfire story” idiom tempers full originality.</comment>
