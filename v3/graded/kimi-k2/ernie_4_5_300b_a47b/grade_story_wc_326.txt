<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Interiority is textured—heartbeat-counting as embodied rebellion against a database glitch—but contradictions (alive vs officially dead) are asserted more than dramatized in scene. Micro-choices lean toward passive witnessing (watching ink, listening to AI) rather than active gambits that cost him anything until the final shrug toward living. The final stance feels consistent with his compulsive ritual, yet the woman remains a cipher and the promised “wisdom extracted from failure” is more abstract than applied. Good spine, but interior tension doesn’t tighten the noose in proportion with external pressure.</comment>

<comment>Closure is an Earned-Stasis variant: Elias lets the paradox stand, tracing the teacup spiral into dried permanence, a Cost framed as acceptance rather than erasure. Structure is Accumulative/Textural—ink patterns, shard, static beats layer and reweight meaning. Orientation, causality, and lens hold without contradiction; the AI exchange and heartbeat counting provide persistent constraint. Cost is legible—but the “wisdom fetched” feels more elegiac than enacted, so ceiling remains just under elite.</comment>

<comment>Frosted windows, grinding gears, ink in ridges—environment is selective and tactile; observatory dome and porcelain shard function as micro-settings that physically guide Elias’s gestures (shard pressed to skin, ink grooves under finger). Weather creates quiet containment but never threatens capacity; final line uses setting only as backdrop rather than tool, missing the 9+ gate that would require choice-constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: reconcile a living body with official death—pressure tightens via AI’s ultimatum and pulse-counting proof. One meaningful deepening—the ink-trace defragmentation—reconfigures Elias’s relationship to the error. Cost is soft: acceptance replaces removal; emotional bruise rather than material sacrifice felt. Agency remains internal; no tangible resource foreclosed.</comment>

<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without sermon: living with irreconcilable data, accepting haunting as compass rather than curse. Recurrence of “not ready” shifts from lament to promise by closure. Wisdom extracted is interior and oblique, never labeled a moral. Slight risk of vagueness is offset by embodied imagery (shard, ink spiral).</comment>

<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Focalization is tight, sensuous, specific—“frost-laced windows hummed with the ghost of starlight,” “ink pooled in the grooves... forming constellations.” Rhythm surges under pressure; purposeful sentence fragments in peak beats. AI’s speech crackles with mechanical idiom distinct from Elias’s lyrical sensorium. One small drift: “the digital ghost lingered in hospital databases” edges toward narrator omniscience rather than Elias’s knowledge.</comment>

<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High density—sentences frequently doing two jobs (image + causality). Near-loop “ink pooled... the ink was from...” earns lenience because pattern is functional. No mixed metaphors; “shard clinking like a metronome” is precise. Filter-verb counts remain low; rhythm modulates with pulse. Occasional elevated abstraction “conceptual ghost” slightly thins immediacy.</comment>

<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh angle: bureaucratic immortality transformed into existential haunting. Porcelain-as-portal; AI whose original star-mapping purpose refract into personal surveillance. Risk of concept-over-character skirted because Elias’s compulsive heartbeat ritual personalizes the premise. Still a known territory (digital ghosts, glitched identity) pushed a notch further by ink-portrait self-portraiture.</comment>
