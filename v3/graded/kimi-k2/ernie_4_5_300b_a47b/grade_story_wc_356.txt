<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority is vivid—her olfactory gift and patient ambition are embodied in soil-tuning and scent-tracking—but the elders’ opposition is off-stage, so status pressure is muted. The final renunciation of haste is earned, yet the cost (lost weeks, social skepticism) is more asserted than felt on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each journal entry and doodle thickens pattern until the hush itself reweights the stake. Closure is a Charged Poise—the blooming flower reconfigures village energy with visible communal awe—though the causal “because” between doodle-hush and bloom could be sharper.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The treetop village is tactile—creaking walkways, lantern-lit mist—and the corpse-flower scent becomes a micro-setting that constrains Lira’s watering choices. Final image of glowing maroon petals against twilight charges the closing beat, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—harmonize restless energy via bloom—is signaled early and tightens through scent-shifts and elder skepticism. One clear deepening: Lira’s pivot from forcing growth to embracing stillness narrows tactics and carries the felt cost of public doubt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of wisdom-through-patience emerges organically from Lira’s failed urgency and the seed’s eventual crack; no moralizing summary intrudes. Final image of “chaos and serenity as kin” lands as resonant reconfiguration rather than stated thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise; olfactory descriptors (“metallic tang,” “sweet note”) create a distinct perceptual signature. Compression and patterned elision (journal fragments, doodle margins) are taught early and paid off in the closing bloom tableau.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is fluid and image-dense, but occasional stacked modifiers (“pungent, sweet musk,” “deep maroon and veined with gold”) flirt with overwriting. No loops or scaffold; rhythm breathes with scene needs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Familiar herbalist-and-mystical-seed frame is refreshed by olfactory POV and doodle-as-prayer device. The synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight, though the corpse-flower trope itself remains recognizable.</comment>
