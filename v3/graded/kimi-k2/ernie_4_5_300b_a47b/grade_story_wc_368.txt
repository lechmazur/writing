<comment>Lin’s interiority is freshly precise—her synesthesia of heartbeats with dye pulses crystallizes one key beat; the donor-heart as narrative vessel elevates a single beat to closure, not ornamental.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Closure hinges on the wing-triggered sun flare charging the final image (Resonant Reconfiguration under an Accumulative/Textural lens); no causality breaks.</comment>

<comment>The obsidian terrace mirroring valley mist as shifting indigo texture constrains choice; environment/glow interface directly energizes the final tableau.</comment>

<comment>Single, coherently escalating stake magnetizing stories narrows around Lin’s irrevocable stance crystallization; blue glow tightens options at cost.</comment>
