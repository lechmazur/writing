<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The ghost bride’s layered motive—vengeance, mercy, and self-release—drives every beat, but her interiority is delivered in summary rather than embodied micro-choice; the final renunciation is earned yet stated rather than dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the bead’s dissolution reweights the premise and frees both spirits. Causal chain holds (fruit → bead → vortex → dawn), but the pivotal moment is narrated rather than enacted, muting cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The greenhouse’s frost, glass, and humming fruit constrain every move; the meteorite bead and crystalline pomegranate function as micro-settings that charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean, sensory selection purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—settling the centuries-old debt—is signaled early and tightens when Elara activates the bead. One clear escalation: the fruit splits into a vortex that forecloses the ghost’s lingering. Cost is legible but abstract.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of love-venom entwined with debt emerges from image and action; the final dawn reconfigures meaning without moralizing. Subtext in the pomegranate gift and veil-lift is strong, though the last whisper edges toward summary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is lush, consistent, and sensorily precise; free-indirect drift into Elara’s perception is controlled. Occasional elevated diction (“mournful elation”) risks register drift yet remains coherent under lyric pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is musical and dense; occasional stacked metaphors (“threads of a thousand funerals,” “ink-shadows”) flirt with overwriting but never stall momentum. No loops or scaffold; rhythm accelerates at climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Familiar gothic tropes are reforged through meteorite bead and alchemical orchard; the debt-forgiveness twist feels inevitable yet fresh. Specificity of humming crystal fruit and smoke-gray veil lifts it above template.</comment>
