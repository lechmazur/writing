<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lira’s curiosity and competence are clear, but her “perpetually surprised” trait never complicates a choice; the pilgrim remains cipher-like, so relationship pressure is absent. Interiority is vivid yet never contradictory; the final “listen” beat is a soft landing rather than an earned renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the chip unites, but the true key is star-alignment—cost is the open unknown now humming in Lira’s bones. Causal chain holds: track → observe → lever → decode. Orientation is swift; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Observatory stones, drone feed, and prism light are tactile and constraining; the dome’s rotation is a physical pivot that enables the climax. Dusk’s “crown of shadows” and Cassiopeia’s keyhole charge the final image without overwriting.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decode belonging—is signaled early and tightened when the lever choice irreversibly aligns the dome. Cost is conceptual: the answer dissolves into resonance rather than place. Agency is clear; coincidence only guides, never rescues.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of belonging-as-resonance emerges through starlight and chip, never sermonized. The prism’s fractal shadows and the waveform heartbeat reweight the premise without moralizing. Final silence invites reflection rather than declaring it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</question>
<comment>Voice is sharp, tactile, slightly tech-tinged (“augmented reality overlays,” “frequency spectrum”) yet lyrical. POV stays tight; no head-hop. Compression is purposeful; drone buzz and stone hum teach the pattern early.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</question>
<comment>Prose is lean and sensorily precise; occasional elevated phrases (“celestial keyhole,” “brilliant dimness”) flirt with overwriting but remain anchored in POV. No loops or scaffold; rhythm accelerates with lever pull.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</question>
<comment>Fusion of ancient observatory and linguistic-sci-fi tech feels fresh; star-alignment as decryption key is non-obvious yet inevitable. Risk is moderate—lyric closure over spectacle—but stakes stay personal and earned.</comment>
