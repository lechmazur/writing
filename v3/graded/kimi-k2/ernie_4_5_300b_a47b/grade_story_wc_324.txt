<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lila’s curiosity is embodied in her tactile handling of the photograph and hearing aid, but her interiority drifts toward generic “midwife to grief” labels; the final smile is earned yet feels slightly under-costed because no prior flaw or contradiction is dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration: the synchronized pulses crystallize the before/after of love acknowledged. Causal chain is tight—photo → pulse → twin hearing aid → whisper—yet the cost is more conceptual than visceral, nudging it shy of 8.8.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium is vivid and purposeful, guiding Lila’s movement and filtering twilight into bruised violet; the fountain and west-wing labyrinth constrain her path, but the final image could have leaned harder on the setting to charge the goodbye.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“assure the vulnerable voice”—is signaled early and tightened when the pulse synchronizes; pressure escalates through Lila’s agency, yet the felt cost remains gentle, keeping it just below the 8.2 gate for high-band escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of love too big for words emerges through the photograph’s silent gesture and the final whisper; the ending reframes the frozen smiles without moralizing, though the conceptual repricing could bite deeper.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Lila’s perceptual signature is consistent—spectral mist, algae-softened edges, faint heartbeat in amber—but occasional elevated diction (“spectral cats,” “reeling hush”) edges toward poetic overlay rather than lived idiom.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lyrical yet disciplined; no loops or scaffold, and sensory detail is selective. One mixed metaphor—“heartbeat trapped in amber”—momentarily blurs the physical logic, but momentum holds.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The “contact tracer for hearts” premise feels fresh, and the hearing-aid-as-medium twist is specific; risk is moderate, but the synthesis of detective and spiritual midwife is memorable and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
