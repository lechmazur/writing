<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“her heart a steady drum”), but the moment of fear-admission feels slightly therapeutic rather than contradictory. The final choice—offering the tooth—earns its cost through prior symbolic logic, yet the keeper’s vanishing leaves the relationship pressure under-developed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the laughter becomes feeling, reweighting the gorge from dread to hope. Causal chain holds—dream → gorge → keeper → translation → reconfiguration—with no unmotivated leaps. Cost is legible in the “luminous ache” that replaces the earlier chill.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Echo Gorge’s stone ribs and humming pebbles constrain movement and mood; the crocodile’s tooth as micro-setting object charges the final image. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered (“air tasted of old dust”). Spatial choreography is clean; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—capture laughter for healing—is signaled early and tightened when the keeper declares laughter “a language of the living.” One meaningful turn: Lira’s admission of fear narrows options and enables the translation beat. Cost is felt in the keeper’s disappearance and the ache she carries out.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of laughter-as-healing emerges organically from the gorge’s grief-laden music and Lira’s embodied struggle. Final image reweights the premise without moralizing: “luminous ache of hope” is non-literal, resonant, and charged with cost. No thematic drift or sermonizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet controlled; perceptual signature is consistent (“sky bled gold,” “pebbles hummed”). Syntax modulates with pressure—longer cadence in reflection, clipped fragments at the encounter. No POV leakage or register drift; compression is purposeful and closure-legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; figurative language is selective and pattern-taught early (“sky bled gold” primes later “luminous ache”). No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Minor filter-verb cluster (“she realized,” “she understood”) in the keeper beat keeps it from 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Familiar “soul collector” trope is transformed through the specific task of harvesting laughter and the crocodile-tooth veil-piercer. Gorge-as-ribcage and harp of unspoken truths feel fresh and inevitable. Risk in lyric mode pays off; no derivative echoes.</comment>
