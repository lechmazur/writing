<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lila’s interior conflict—hope colliding with the knowledge that these entities are older than time—is concrete ("her chest tight with relief") and recurs under rising pressure. Her micro-choice to dam the river ("Then I’ll dam it") crystallizes an end-of-round stance with visible endurance cost. Her cautious hope never flips into naïveté; flaws persist under the final taunt. Dialogue with Hale could be sharper, but it is secondary pressure, not relationship crucible; still, it pushes Lila to declare her plan.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: every beat either tightens strategy ("synced her laptop… uploading code") or constricts outcomes when campus divides escalate funding crisis. Closure lands on a Charged Poise: the receiver now awaits future command with a felt loss—the tricksters are not done; the cost is the end of Lila’s innocence. A one-way transition (lab to quad) is handled cleanly and feeds straight into the closure image. No orientation drift or unexplained jump.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The sub-basement maze of cables and green-wave screens is tightly filtered through Lila’s need to “sync her laptop to the transmitter”; the gear physically constrains body movement and tactic (kneeling beside oscilloscopes). Outside quad and “hum of the transmitter” anchor time and place early. Only minor redundancy: “relics from when radio was the only link” restates transmitter vibe without fresh gain—nips 0.2 from top band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—save funding/world from cosmic manipulation—is clear; the community schism is the visible lever that tightens stakes. The middle pressure beat forces her precision tactic under on-page time crunch (“board wants to pull funding”). The final truce/surrender does close an option—“game isn’t over” crystallizes persistent cost, not a reset. Escalation under causal lens satisfies.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</question><comment>The thematic line—“power is a river; it changes course”—is subtexted through the final cosmic taunt rather than articulated. Lila’s renunciation to “dam it” reconfigures her relationship to control and stakes; ambiguity lingers without sermonizing. No moral spoon-feed, but the cosmos-as-chessboard metaphor edges too neat and could be more unsettling.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Interior voice is crisp: “hands trembled as she keyed the final sequence” vs. the earlier measured tone. POV never drifts; even Hale’s one line lands outside her earphones, maintaining psychic distance. Rhythmic control under pressure: sentence length contracts in burst to match tension. Only a mild line-level loop—“the station’s transmitter hummed… the station’s transmitter hummed” echo repeats at open/close, forgiven as sonic refrain pattern.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</question><comment>Propulsive rhythm, varied sentence texture, high information density. Couple of filter stacking: “the hum of the university radio station’s transmitter buzzing beneath her fingertips”—two audible verbs in one phrase nips 0.3. No scaffold clutter; nouns and verbs do heavy lifting. Closure beat “crystallized… silent war” lands clean. Minor polish on stray modifier pile-ups would push to 8+ band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The cosmic-trickster radio war is not novel genre-wide, yet its fusion with sub-sonic astrophysics and campus bureaucracy feels freshly particular. Risky choice—no literal on-page antagonist—but payoff lands. The only derivative tinge is the “chessboard” cliché at the finale; specific texture slightly outweighs it, keeping score north of mid-7.</comment>
