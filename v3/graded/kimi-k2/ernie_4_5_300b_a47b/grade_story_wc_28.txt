<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias’s interior contradiction—steel arms cradling mercy—drives every micro-choice; the tessera placement is a credible renunciation that costs him the comfort of pure grief. Retrocognition is embodied, not labeled, and the artisan’s memory tilts his present stance. Flaw: the “gentle radical” tag is asserted rather than dramatized, slightly blunting specificity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory shard layers density until the final tessera reconfigures the plaza’s meaning. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise—where the mosaic’s ripple makes the cost of hope legible. Orientation is anchored early; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The plaza, minaret shadow, and tessera texture constrain Elias’s movement and charge the final image; the stepping stone literally guides his act of renaming. Selective sensory detail (ash, ozone, chipped glaze) filters through his retrocognitive bias. No spatial drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—whether to transform ruin into mercy—tightens once when Elias presses the tessera into the gap, foreclosing nostalgic paralysis. Pressure is coherent under the Accumulative lens; the cost is the acceptance that scars remain visible. No escalation beyond this single turn, but it suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of aberrant mercy emerges through the tessera’s journey from intact art to broken relic to re-placed promise, never sermonized. The final image reframes destruction as transformation without moralizing. Subtext in the chipped waves carries the weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded; retrocognitive slips are signaled by rhythmic shifts (“He saw… Now…”). Syntax mirrors Elias’s flickering perception without losing clarity. No POV leakage; diction stays within his plausible lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; figurative language is patterned early and paid off (“shattered sky… fractured glass”). No loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated diction (“retrocognitively trapped”) is voice-motivated and consistent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Familiar post-apocalyptic plaza is refreshed by retrocognitive mosaic work and the paradox of “aberrant mercy.” The tessera’s reuse as a renaming tool feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risk in lyric compression heightens resonance without gimmickry.</comment>
