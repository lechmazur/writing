<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Althea’s studious compulsion and tactile reverence for her notepad are vivid, but the interior contradiction—between disciplined restraint and ecstatic surrender to the lamp’s hum—never sharpens into a visible cost or irreversible choice; the final smile feels unearned because no path is foreclosed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each dawn session layers texture until the lamp’s pulse reweights the stake. Closure is a Charged Poise—Althea clutches the thickened notepad—but the cost (what she forfeits by continuing) remains conceptual rather than felt on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The bonsai labyrinth is rendered with luminous specificity; the fluorescent lamp’s hum and the violet-pine paste notepad anchor micro-setting. Yet the environment never actively constrains her choices—she could leave at any moment—so the final image is enriched but not charged by place.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—collecting “textures of different times”—is signaled early and deepens when the lamp synchronizes with her breath, tightening the pattern. However, the escalation is observational rather than adversarial; no tangible price is extracted, so pressure plateaus.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of invention as memory-keeping emerges organically from Althea’s ritual; the final image of the ever-thickening notepad quietly reframes prior entries as living bridges. Subtext avoids moralizing, but the lack of a concrete sacrifice keeps resonance just shy of exceptional.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet disciplined, mirroring Althea’s restraint; sensory detail is filtered through her paper-centric worldview. No dialogue, yet the prose rhythm modulates with the lamp’s hum, sustaining a coherent perceptual signature throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is lush but selective; metaphors (gilded-leaf, moss-cushioned stone) serve atmosphere without clutter. Occasional soft-focus phrasing—“dizzying dance,” “torrent of invented histories”—dilutes immediacy, yet no loops or register drift mar the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>The fusion of bonsai gardener, stationer, and temporal archivist feels fresh; the lamp-as-oracle device avoids cliché. Risk is moderate—quiet lyric rather than structural daring—but the synthesis is specific enough to resist easy substitution.</comment>
