<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority is textured and embodied; the coachman's layered motives (soldier-gardener, grief-hope) surface through micro-choices like crushing bone-ash fertilizer. The final whispered phrase earns a credible renunciation of violence. Yet the single POV never faces a live opposing will, so status dynamics and relational crucible remain untested.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the garden’s tiny flames against the storm reconfigure meaning with felt cost (time, risk, memory). Causal chain is slim—scattering seeds because birds ask—but the Accumulative/Textural lens holds via cadence shift and deepening color. Orientation is swift; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Jetty, twilight, salt-rot, and glowing petals are filtered through the coachman’s soldier-gardener gaze; the half-buried seed pods become micro-setting that constrains the final image. Sensory selection is urgent and purposeful; no white-room drift. Environment actively guides how deep to dig and how sparingly to water.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—redeeming a dead reef through a salt-strangled garden—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening: storm clouds swallow the last light, forcing the coachman to leave the nascent plot to fate. Cost is visible (time, exposure, memory ash) but not yet paid, so pressure is legible but not acute.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of submerged concord emerges from concrete acts—ash of the reef feeding violet petals—never stated as thesis. Final whisper “The earth remembers” offers resonant, non-moralizing answer. Complexity is honored; no tidy redemption, only fragile possibility.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</question>
<comment>Voice is distinct, lyrical, and soldier-weary; perceptual signature notices bird dialects and soil tension. Syntax modulates with emotional pressure—short clauses under storm threat, longer cadences in reflection. No head-hopping or register drift; diction stays within the coachman’s plausible lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</question>
<comment>Prose is lean yet textured; every sentence advances image or stakes. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Rhythm breathes with scene needs—sparse during planting, taut as storm gathers. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful; no purple drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</question>
<comment>Premise of battlefield-to-garden is familiar, but execution is specific: bone-ash fertilizer, bird-call lexicon, extinct word “Khalis.” The synthesis feels inevitable rather than gimmicky. Risk is moderate; no structural gimmicks, but specificity and emotional truth elevate beyond trope.</comment>
