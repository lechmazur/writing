<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Eleanor’s decision to stop intervening with the hellebore is embodied and motivated by clear contradiction: her lifetime habit of control versus the plant’s necessity to shapeshift. The moment of physical restraint (Mara seizing her wrist) externalizes her internal struggle and sets up the final cost—she now has to relinquish the identity of controller. The emotional arc tracks. Some interior summaries (“she realized that transformation wasn’t to resist”) flirt with diagnostic speak but remain within tolerance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The piece closes on a clear Resonant Reconfiguration: Eleanor’s choice “to help them by releasing control” crystallizes both stance and method with felt professional/story cost (her nursery will henceforth look nothing like her original plan). Causality remains consistent under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each beat builds the pattern of letting-go until the ending reweights everything. One minor ellipsis: how the nursery will financially survive total relinquishment goes undramatized, but the closure retains its charge.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The mossy trellis is not merely picturesque; its soaked lattice functions as a sensor—storm-damped wood, climbing volunteer vines, and Eleanor’s palm all constrain later tactics by literally hosting the metamorphic vines that finalize her stance. The environmental pressure of storm season is kept ambient rather than acute, so 7.0 is the ceiling, but the setting never acts as wallpaper.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>The single dominant stake—Eleanor’s need to dominate versus the plants’ imperative to transform—escalates credibly under pressure. The hellebore’s retraction offers one visible, on-page test that forecloses the “control” option. No coincidence resolves the issue; the shift is driven by observing plant behavior and a conscious renunciation. Cost appears at the end: permanent alteration of her work identity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Transformation-as-sustenance emerges cleanly from image, action, and environment; no late-breaking moralizing intrudes. The line “They’re reconstructing, by releasing control” spoken together at the end offers a resonant reweighting that reframes the entire nursery. Subtext about the cost of obsessive control is threaded via micro-gestures rather than lecture.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Eleanor’s sensory perceptions (“humid air still electric,” “damp fibers clinging like second skin”) are selective and plant-science-biased, anchoring the POV. Compression is purposeful: storm description is lyric without purple overlay. One mild filter-verb cluster (“she thought of…”) appears near the end and prevents a 9+, but the voice remains stable throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Line-level craft is smooth with only small loops: a near-repetition of “linden leaf tracing… circuitously sincere” once, and a slightly elevated phrase “energy funneled into” mid-climax. No mixed metaphors mar the hellebore’s visual clarity. Overall, clean enough to serve the climactic image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</question><comment>While “plants teaching humans” is a familiar vein, the reframing through “circuitously sincere” (an idiolectal plant-science observation) and the hellebore’s visible metamorphosis infuse fresh specificity. Volunteer vines arriving overnight felt slightly convenient, curbing originality. Nevertheless, the synthesis of horticultural detail and interior arc feels lived-in rather than derivative.</comment>
