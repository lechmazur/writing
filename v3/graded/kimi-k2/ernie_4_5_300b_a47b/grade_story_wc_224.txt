<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lirael’s contradictory impulses—yearning for home yet fearing the stone’s memories—are embodied in her nightly substitution of reality and the trembling feather. The final choice to accept obsidian shards into her skin crystallizes her arc with visible cost. Minor: Orin’s pressure is off-stage, so relationship crucible is muted.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the stone’s shattering embeds memory-work into Lirael’s body, reweighting “home” from place to act. Causal chain—feather → stone → cavern → bookstore—holds under Accumulative/Textural lens. One micro-turn suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The mountain-bookstore’s spiral shelves and bioluminescent cavern constrain movement and mirror Lirael’s descent/ascent. Lantern shadows “sharp as knives” and crystalline walls charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“shape of home”—tightens when the stone’s mirror demands Lirael seed her own truth. Escalation is one deepening beat: feather contact → cavern → skin-embedded shards. Cost is the obsidian shards themselves, altering her forever.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: memory as home, not geography. Subtext in the feather’s dissolution and the stone’s mirror avoids moralizing. Final image of silver-lit peak reweights prior motifs without explicit statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Distinct lyric texture—“mercury-glass,” “hidden thunder”—remains consistent under pressure. POV stays tight to Lirael; no head-hop. Compression and patterned elision (“seed it…via the texture of a feather”) are taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is selective, not stacked. No loops or scaffold. Rhythm modulates with tension—short clauses during stone-flare, longer breaths in attic dust. Clean mechanics.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fantasy premise is familiar, but the synthesis—memory-weaving mercury skin, mountain-bookstore, feather-as-key—feels specific and inevitable. Risk in lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
