<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Lira’s curiosity about petrichor and her psychometry gift are concrete, and her final renunciation—choosing mystery over explanation—carries felt cost in the lingering hum. Interiority is vivid (“tasted the edge of the unknowable”) but occasionally drifts toward lyrical summary. Sensibly eccentric tag neither constrains nor complicates a key action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Lira leaves the threshold unmapped, the compass now still; the lagoon hum becomes her new ambition. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—each beat layers mystery and reweights stakes until the final charged image. Pattern holds cleanly and reconfigures her stance at cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (sharper petrichor, “resonant hush”), anchoring us immediately. The lagoon’s physicality constrains her actions (wading into silt, scooping water) and charges the final silence. Micro-setting of compass/stone initials likewise tightens the moment. Remains vivid without overcrowding.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake is early—seize untainted memory/parfait. One deepening beat: compass vibration forces retreat, foreclosing exploration and raising ontological cost. The loss is felt (hum in the quiet) but escalation stays quiet rather than sharply tightening under a causal arc.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme (epistemic humility vs. colonial explanation) is conveyed through the lagoon’s refusal; no single moral stated. Final image—the hanging hum—reweights earlier quest without sermons. Strikes resonance yet leans on lyrical assertion in final line.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Distinct third-person limited voice shaded by scientific curiosity yet lyric ear. Rhythm modulates with pressure—short declaratives in cavern, longer rumination aboveground. No head-hop; psychometry sensory bridges change smoothly. One minor register drift (“earth’s memory lingered”).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is trim, imagery precise, propulsive. Few minor loops (“thicker with petrichor…petrichor here was different”) and near-metaphor stack lower third. Overall high information density without purple or scaffolding glitches.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of scent-as-memory, geology-as-threshold. Compass/experience reprise at closure feels inevitable, not gimmick. Loses top increment because underlying genre note (secret cavern) remains familiar; grounded by sensorial specificity.</comment>
