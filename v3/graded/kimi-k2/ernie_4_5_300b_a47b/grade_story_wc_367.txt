<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The Herald’s role is vivid, her laughter visceral, interiority rich, and the final choice to guide the “new dawn” is embodied in her stance against the wind; however, the cost is implicit—“alone on the cliff”—and lacks a tangible wound or irrevocable forfeiture under 800 words, capping character depth just below the 8.8 gate. Her contradictory impulses (exultation in the storm vs fear of oily shadow) play through the scene, though secondary figures are absent, limiting relationship pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The causal arc lands cleanly: lantern adjustment → shadow prophecy → decision to steer dawn, culminating in a Charged Poise at balcony’s edge. Orientation is quick; the lighthouse and keeper anchor by line two, sustaining coherence. The final image of raised light and “a choice” reconfigures premise, but the internal cost—though felt—is not dramatized beyond breath and laughter, so closure stays legible yet stops short of higher band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Salt-wind, emerald glass, star-thick sky are rendered in purposeful sensory selection; the lighthouse constrains placement and tool access. The setting subtly shapes tactics—height limits retreat, wind demands grip on lantern—charging final image. Despite atmosphere’s sharpness, the environment never exacts a concrete external price (injury, broken tool), keeping it below high-band stricture.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—“shape the new dawn with ancient shadows”—is clear; pressure tightens as the Herald twists the wick and shadows thicken to reveal unavoidable darkness. One meaningful deepening occurs when oily silhouette complicates prophetic gold. Agency is active through lantern manipulation and final stance; a visible price is abstract (fear, implication), satisfying at length but missing visceral loss for higher band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Light vs dark, legacy vs algorithmic forgetting, and caretaker duty crystallize without overt statement. The dawn reconfigured as “a choice” at the end reweights the concept of prophecy and stewardship, earning resonance. Subtext avoids moralizing; theme is emergent from specific glass, flame, and wind.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice is atmospheric but anchored: cackling mid-tempest wind chimes, flame like “captured comet,” rhythmic control matches gale’s rise and hush. Perceptual signature is strong; POV never drifts. Syntax avoids monotony, diction stays within locus-specific lexicon. One head-hop risk avoided as only character present.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, information-dense; only minor loop (“shadows shifted again... shadows shifted”) and one mixed metaphor—“liquid night” poured from flame—blunt edge slightly. Rhythm breathes with pacing beats. Clean grammar; line-ends reconfigure earlier motifs effectively, sustaining momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>The post-print lighthouse-keeper wielding archaic shadow-projection is fresh. Premise does not linger on nostalgic clichés; ritual precision of wick-twist as prophetic engine feels specific. Derivative echoes minimal. Final crystallization “the dawn is a choice” provides earned non-literal turn on familiar horizon, though the inversion isn’t epochal.</comment>
