<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Cedric’s silence and trauma are embodied in every micro-choice; the trembling fingers, the throat tightening, the paradoxical shivering bliss all feel lived. Motivation pivots from survival to capture to surrender, each shift rooted in the prior beat. The final renunciation—walking away unarmored, leaving no prints—carries visible cost and is earned by the spiral descent. Interior contradiction is present but compressed; a hair more on-page tension between “capture” and “feel” would push 8+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the greenhouse dissolves, Cedric re-embodies in violet light, and the program’s blank page reweights the premise. Causality is Accumulative/Textural—pattern density and cadence shift rather than strict because/therefore—but the lens is taught early and held. Orientation is secure by 120 words. One minor ellipsis: the “patterns” rule is asserted more than dramatized before the staircase opens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The greenhouse is a micro-setting that constrains every move: glass corridors funnel Cedric, vines flare violet when touched, condensation slicks the marionette. Sensory hierarchy is POV-bound—cold, scent, light—never tourist catalog. The orb chamber reprises the greenhouse’s “captive stars” motif, charging the final image. Could edge 8.5+ if the orchard’s alchemy had one tactile rule earlier.</comment>

<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“capture the shape of possibility”—is signaled on page one and tightens when the line changes to “descend.” Escalation is Accumulative: each pattern break (program, vines, orb) intensifies the cost of knowing. The final choice to walk away forecloses the capture path with felt weight. One beat shy of 8.8: the price of orb-shattering could be sharper on the page.</comment>

<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the tension between control and surrender; no character states it outright. The marionette’s snapped strings and blank program reconfigure the premise without sermon. Final inscription—“The strings were never meant to hold you”—is earned, not asserted. A hair more ambiguity in Cedric’s laughter would deepen resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is knightly-lyric, precise yet haunted: “shivering bliss,” “rusty from disuse.” Perceptual signature is consistent—Cedric notices cold, glow, condensation, never exposition. Rhythm modulates with pressure: short clauses at the snap, longer breaths in the orb chamber. No head-hop or register drift.</comment>

<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence layers image, stakes, or atmosphere. Figurative language is selective—no purple stacks. One scaffold loop: “reality shifted” appears twice in adjacent beats; minor. Otherwise zero loops, clean mechanics, and strong cadence control.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Familiar gothic-fantasy tropes—silent knight, alchemical greenhouse, marionette metaphor—are transformed through Cedric’s embodied trauma and the Accumulative closure. The “orchard that eats people” angle is fresh, and the final inversion of capture into dance feels inevitable. Risky lyric compression pays off without clarity loss.</comment>
