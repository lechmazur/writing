<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—her polymer-chemist lens feels lived-in—but the shift from grief paralysis to “on my way” arrives via text message rather than an on-page micro-choice, blunting the cost of reconnection. The sister relationship is sketched more than crucible-tested; their final duet reads as gentle détente rather than a choice that forecloses retreat. Still, the embodied grief and scientific metaphor cohere.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly with the chrysalis release and hand-squeeze—an Earned Stasis that forecloses continued estrangement. Causal chain is thin: the foam insight is stated, not dramatized as a decision trigger, and the pivotal text message sits off-stage. Mosaic structure (ravine → studio → ravine) is legible, but the transitions feel like fade-outs rather than pressure-bearing hinges.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The braided ravine is tactile—froth, mossy crevice, eddies—and its geometry literally shapes Elara’s insight about convergence. Micro-setting (chrysalis in palm) charges the final release. Weather and spatial choreography remain stable; only the studio interior is lightly sketched, but the river’s fractal foam recurs to anchor scale and theme.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—repairing the ruptured sister bond—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once: the text invitation forces a yes/no that Elara pays with emotional exposure. The foam insight re-weights the stake conceptually but does not escalate external risk; the cost is relational, not situational, keeping tension modest but coherent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of divergence-as-connection emerges organically from river morphology and chrysalis husk; no moralizing summary intrudes. Subtext lives in gesture—Mara’s raw breath, the hand-squeeze—rather than dialogue. The final release of the chrysalis reconfigures the meaning of “unfinished transformation” without overt statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is precise, scientific yet lyrical: “surfactants—natural and synthetic—swirled into temporary unity.” POV remains tightly anchored to Elara; no head-hopping. Dialogue is sparse but natural; Mara’s “Come hear?” carries subtext. Occasional elevated diction (“symphonically minded”) feels authorial but stays within Elara’s lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; no loops or scaffold. Metaphors are controlled (“rivers twisting like strands of rope”). Minor register drift—“loosened grief let her type back”—is forgivable in context. Final paragraph avoids sentimentality through concrete image: “watching it spin in the eddies before vanishing.”</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>The polymer-chemist POV reframing grief through surfactant behavior is fresh; the braided-river / chrysalis synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight. No stock tropes; the “unfinished metamorphosis” motif is particular to this family’s silence. Risk is moderate—quiet epiphany rather than structural daring—but the insight lands.</comment>
