<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Clara’s contradictory impulses—idealism vs. fear—surface in the tremor of her hands and the pocketed nail, but the interiority occasionally drifts into summary (“she knew this: some truths were worth the risk”). The ancestor’s motivation is vivid, yet Clara’s final leap feels slightly under-cooked; the cost is declared more than embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the warming nail and green sky crystallize stakes without resolving them, reweighting exile from shame to potential return. Causal chain holds—nail → stanza → dig → journal → roof—though the “door will open” beat is more incantation than mechanism. Cost is legible in the flickering lights and churning sea.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The brass dials, frosted glass, and salt-ozone air are filtered through Clara’s map-librarian gaze, constraining her path (only the eastern tower soil is soft enough to dig). The spongey gray sky and sickly green climax charge the final image, but the station’s interior layout remains slightly abstract.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reversing ancestral exile—tightens when the jet stream accelerates evacuation pressure. One clear escalation: discovery of the codex forces Clara to choose roof ritual over safety. Cost is implied (evacuation risk) but not yet viscerally paid.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</question><comment>Theme of inherited shame vs. reclaimed agency emerges through objects (nail, journal) rather than exposition. Final rooftop stance reframes exile without moralizing; ambiguity lingers in the storm’s unanswered “question.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Voice is precise, tactile, and slightly archaic (“spongey gray,” “weather instruments hummed like anxious sentinels”) consistent with a librarian who reads margins. Compression and elision are purposeful; no POV drift. Dialogue is minimal but natural when it appears.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; figurative language is selective. Occasional soft filters (“she wondered”) are brief and voice-motivated. No loops or mixed metaphors in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Familiar tropes—ancestor’s hidden journal, magical weather—are refreshed by the map-librarian’s marginalia obsession and the copper nail’s coffin provenance. The reversible exile concept feels specific to this lineage and station.</comment>
