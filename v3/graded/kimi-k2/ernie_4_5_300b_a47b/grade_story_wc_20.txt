<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kael’s interiority is textured and embodied; the ache in his bones, the coin’s heat, the throat-tightening all ground motive. The final renunciation—accepting cracks without Lira—earns its cost through prior causality. Minor slip: “balanced alchemist” is label-speak before it is dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Single-scene causal arc: coin-drop → vortex → apparition → renunciation. Closure lands as Earned Stasis with felt cost (empty hand, extinguished glow). Orientation is clear by line 3; no lens drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Foundry’s rain, molten pit, and coin-as-key constrain every beat; the metallic air and corrugated roof pressure Kael’s stance. Final image of extinguished glow recharges the setting’s cathedral shift. Spatial choreography is clean; no white-room lapse.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—redeem self by bridging seen/unseen—tightens when coin fuses and Lira offers irreversible renunciation. One meaningful deepening suffices; cost is visible in the fused coin and vanished sister.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of kintsugi-as-acceptance emerges through fused coin and Lira’s translucent form; no moralizing. Final image of empty hand reweights “names have weight” without stating it. Subtext in Lira’s “you kept searching” carries regret and release.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Kael’s perceptual bias; sensory filtering (“smelled of iron and wet earth”) is character-specific. Rhythm modulates with pressure—short clauses at vortex, longer reflection after. No head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, vivid, propulsive; no loops or scaffold. “Molten gold that mirrored the zodiac coin” does double duty. One mixed metaphor—“molten metal began to swirl, forming a vortex that pulled at his clothes”—slightly muddies physics but does not obscure closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Familiar grief-quest refreshed by alchemical kintsugi fusion and astral apparition. Coin-as-key and molten portal feel inevitable in hindsight. Risk is moderate but coherent; no gimmickry.</comment>
