<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lila's numb-grief detachment shows in micro-choices—clutching the parasol tip, welcoming toe-numbing pain—and culminates in an Earned Stasis that still feels slightly generalized; the shift from intending suicide to feeling “a flicker of peace” is legible but short of a fully embodied contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Lila’s redefinition of the “fold in patience” lands with felt cost as she renounces the clinic and folds her vigil by the ice; causal string is intact, one transition (ice-rescue) is clean, and timeline tracks consistently.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Frozen marina, frost-blur edges, and the parasol tip all physically steer her actions; final image links parasol to “flicker of peace,” constraining choice without lapsing into postcard set dressing.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</question><comment>Dominant stake—will Lila end herself—presses from rumor-of-clinic through parasol-hook rescue; the tightening comes via the realization that action, not waiting, forecloses the suicide path. Cost is visible in relinquished future-tense escape, though the external rescue remains lightly coincidental.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</question><comment>Theme of re-learning life’s necessity through listening (ice-call, rescue) emerges via scene rather than statement; quiet ending crystallizes ambiguous renewal, avoiding moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Constrained, frost-bitten diction suits the POV; repetitive stems (“fold in patience,” “fold”) are sparse and intentional. Few spoken lines are naturalistic yet spare.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, evocative, propulsive; occasional soft modifiers (“faintly blue”) do not clutter. No sustained loops or register drift.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Suicide-tourist trope is refreshed via ice-rescue pivot and parasol-tip harpoon; transformation sufficient to escape template territory, though still recognizable.</comment>
