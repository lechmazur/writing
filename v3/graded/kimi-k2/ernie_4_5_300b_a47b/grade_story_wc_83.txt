<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s grief-driven compulsion is visceral and embodied; the geode’s bite and her “shattered-glass laugh” ground her interiority. The final crystallization of identity from survivor to seer is earned by the escalating cost of each choice. Minor slip: “what’s left to lose?” edges toward diagnostic shorthand but is immediately re-embodied in the crater descent.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the new crystal pulses, the observatory is gone, and Elara steps into an irreversible role. Causal chain—geode → node → shatter → rebirth—holds without gaps. One micro-turn at the node entry tightens stakes under a Causal lens. Cost is legible in the vanished observatory and the “wild thing” heart.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Crater of ash, glass corridors, and the pulsing node are sketched with sensory economy; each detail either constrains movement or charges the final image. The geode doubles as micro-setting and tool, its heat and edges guiding every beat. Spatial choreography stays coherent across descent and vortex entry.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—access unused potential to re-see reality—tightens when circuit-breaker countdown and node instability foreclose retreat. Escalation is causal: each override raises physical and existential cost. Final price is the obliteration of the observatory and the irreversible shift in Elara’s ontology.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of awakening through trauma emerges from the fractal imagery and the transformation of grief into disruptive agency. No explicit moralizing; the ending image of endless nodes reframes prior loss as ongoing hunt. Subtext resides in the geode’s shift from wound to compass.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Voice is sharp, compressed, and character-specific: “bleak exhilaration” modulates from bitter laugh to wild grin. Syntax mirrors stress—short bursts under alarms, longer coils inside the node. No POV drift; Orion’s disembodied lines remain external. Occasional lyrical lift (“grief made solid”) is earned by context.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose is lean and propulsive; each sentence advances image or stakes. Minor loop—“the hunt wasn’t over. It had just begun”—is acceptable as cadence echo. No mixed metaphors or register drift. Density high without clutter; “ozone and ash” does double sensory duty.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of quantum grief-tech and personal apocalypse; the “intangibly tangible” paradox is transformed from AI jargon into lived sensation. Risky collapse of observatory and reality rules is foreshadowed early, paying off in the final crystal. Avoids stock post-apocalypse tropes through specificity of Elara’s stance.</comment>
