<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority is vivid—spectacles, frost-kissed grass, breath hitching—yet her contradictory impulses (fear vs duty) are stated more than dramatized in scene. The final refusal to sit crystallizes her arc with visible cost (stairway collapses), but the moment is compressed to a single sentence, muting the felt weight.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the throne as mirror reconfigures the quest from external to internal, with the collapsing stairway as on-page cost. Causal chain holds—flake → murals → hollow tree → ascent → revelation—though the guardian’s trial is resolved by a single question rather than a tested choice, slightly thinning causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The orchard’s bioluminescent pears and ozone scent are selective and POV-filtered; the hollow tree and glowing steps constrain movement and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is tight—waterfall veil, pavilion wall, summit chamber—though the “constellation” tree pattern remains evocative rather than tactically used.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“find stairway before sunrise”—is signaled early and tightened by flickering light and collapsing steps. Sunrise clock visibly alters tactics, yet the spectral guardian’s demand feels more conceptual test than escalating pressure, keeping the peak beat slightly abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of legacy-as-self emerges organically from murals and final image; no moralizing. The ruby-flake-as-pendant reprises the throne’s mirror, reweighting prior material with quiet resonance. Ambiguity lingers—future as story to write—without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet disciplined, with rhythmic control under pressure (“voice echoing with the weight of eons”). Perceptual signature is consistent—Lira’s lore-keeper diction colors every observation. Compression and elision are taught early (peeling paint as revelation) and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; no loops or scaffold. Metaphors (“cathedral of shadows”) are purposeful and coherent. Minor register drift—“conceptual repricing” risk in “the throne was never unclaimed”—but clarity remains intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Familiar quest arc is transformed through bioluminescent orchard, paint-peel cartography, and throne-as-mirror twist. Specificity of ruby flake murals and spectral guardian feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking (metaphorical stairway) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
