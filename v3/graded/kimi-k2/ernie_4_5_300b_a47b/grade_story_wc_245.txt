<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Elias’s loss-anchored drive is clear (“late at night Elias vowed to reach the end”), but some interior turns lapse into label-speak rather than embodied contradiction. His late-arriving mother as a “memory made flesh” feels emotionally potent yet slightly under-earned—more vision than choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The causal path—mother’s melody → ring‐translation → dop-song → map → stillpoint—locks cleanly into an Accumulative/Textural lens: density tightens, cost is felt when Elias “wades” to dig, and the final reconfiguration charges closure. Orientation, stakes, rhythm all cohere.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Vivid ultrasonic textures (humming canopy, roots drinking light) permeate physical choice; the compass ring and riverbed function as micro-setting that constrains tactics. Spatial choreography stays coherent, though late stillpoint image is faint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Pressure ratchets from curiosity to tangible risk—river’s current warning, silt under fingernails, stillpoint burial—without bloated reversals. One meaningful deepening: river commands “Dig,” foreclosing a speculative path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>The stillpoint reframes grief as map territory, charging every sensory layer with emotional stakes; no tidy moralizing, final gesture a quiet blaze of trig vibrations rather than proclamation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Ultrasonic whispers-through-ring give Elias a distinct perceptual voice; rhythm thickens under stress. Forest’s chorus modulates naturally, no head-hopping, prose tight.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Moments of ornamental description (“time pooled like mercury”) border on overwriting; paraphrase loops (“every ridge, every river”) dilute pace. Information density high otherwise.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Fresh angle: sightless cartography guided by sonic melody; non-obvious synthesis compressed lyrical → map → memory. Minor generic components (haunted object, forest quest) get specific technological and emotional spin.</comment>
