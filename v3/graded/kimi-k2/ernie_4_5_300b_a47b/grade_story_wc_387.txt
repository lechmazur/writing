<comment>Kael’s interior is layered and particular yet his actions are mostly receptive observation rather than pressing choice; the only concrete choice—the mirror-whistling reply—does little to foreclose options or reveal fresh contradiction, so the “earned cost” criterion is only weakly met via contemplative stance rather than material consequence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds cleanly: pattern density, subtle tempo shifts, and the firefly code tighten perception to earned stasis. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration—Kael’s new attuned silence—whose cost is legible as lifelong vigilance rather than discrete event; orientation beats land well before 120 words.</comment>

<comment>The parapet’s moon-washed stone, damp wind, and phosphorescent tide are vivid, selected, and knit through every bodily motion; the bamboo whisk serves as micro-setting that constrains the final gesture, charging the image when lifted to moonlight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</question>
<comment>The dominant stake—learning to read the hidden labour of the world—intensifies via the deepening pattern of firefly light, but the rising pressure remains observational rather than decisional, so the lack of an irrevocable tactical fork caps pressure just below excellence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</question>
<comment>The theme of unseen effort emerges organically from every image and motion; the final hush reframes prior particulars without explicit statement, achieving subdued emotional afterglow rather than neat moral delivery.</comment>

<comment>Voice is richly textured, salt-stung and moonlit, with a restrained lyrical pulse that never overwhelms causality; POV stays rigorous and perceptually signature throughout.</comment>

<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is sinewy, largely free of scaffold or loops with supple sentence modulation; a few mild stacked modifiers near the climax briefly cloud density without obscuring closure clarity, holding at strong tier.</comment>

<comment>The philosophical net-mender decoding aquatic moon-flicker codes feels fresh, yet the coastal lyrical frame edges close to familiar salt-air elegy; the synthesis is specific enough to avoid cliché but not startlingly singular.</comment>
