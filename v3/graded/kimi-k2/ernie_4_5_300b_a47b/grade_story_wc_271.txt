<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lila’s contradictory impulses—grief’s paralysis vs. the deliberate “freeze” of peace—are embodied in trembling hands and the stone bench; the final micro-choice to tuck the photo back without flinching earns the closure with visible cost. Mrs. Voss functions as pressure, not ornament, forcing Lila to articulate the stake aloud. Interiority avoids therapy-speak; the body remembers through salt, lavender, cold rock. Motivation scales cleanly from seeking stillness to anchoring hope in realism.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: density of sensory markers (stone, salt, lavender) tightens toward the Charged Poise of the final tuck. Orientation anchored by line 3; no drift. Closure lands on-page—“her heart steady”—with felt cost: Elias’s absence is no longer a void to flee but a shape she can hold. One seamless scene, 740 words, single POV, one micro-turn (flinch-to-anchor).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Arboretum, cliff, salt wind, and lavender sprig are not backdrop; the stone bench literally steadies Lila’s hand and the salt scent cues the somatic anchor. Micro-setting (bench, pocket, coat) constrains the final choice. Sensory hierarchy is POV-biased: painter’s eye for texture, PTSD-narrowed hearing. Weather (gust that rattles gates) triggers flashback, then is re-inscribed as neutral stimulus. Spatial choreography clean; no impossible positions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: can Lila freeze a moment of peace without erasing Elias? Escalation is accretive: each sensory marker layers pressure until the gust forces a test; she either dissociates or anchors. The tightening beat is the conscious re-inscription of the gust as “just wind,” costing her the last illusion that grief can be outrun. Agency is renunciation: she forecloses the path of perpetual flight.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the tension between memory as wound vs. memory as architecture. Subtext in the photograph’s creases and the lavender’s softness carries the argument without statement. Final image—pearl of stillness “cradled in her chest like a promise”—reweights the premise: realism includes the beloved dead. No moralizing; ambiguity remains (will the pearl hold tomorrow?).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is painterly, salt-stung, PTSD-tuned: “wind-twisted pines,” “salt-bleached roses.” Syntax modulates with stress—long lyrical lines collapse into the staccato “She flinched.” Free indirect style stays clean; no head-hop. Dialogue sparse, subtextual (“Hope feels… fragile”). Diction never exceeds Lila’s lexicon; lavender, stone, gulls recur with shifting valence. Rhythm breathes with her breathing exercises.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative language is sparse, precise: “pearl of stillness” appears once and earns its keep. No mixed metaphors. Strong verbs—“cracking,” “cradled,” “shatter.” Paragraph cuts are purposeful; the single-line “She breathed in, slow and deep” acts as white space. No typos, tense shifts, or pronoun drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Familiar PTSD-recovery arc is refreshed by the lighthouse-keeper absence and the somatic-marker method, both grounded in botanist Mrs. Voss’s lived practice. The “pearl of stillness” is not a slogan but a replicable bodily protocol. Specificity of salt-stung arboretum and drone-strike wedding survivor roots the universal in the irreplaceable. No close echoes; transformation test passed.</comment>
