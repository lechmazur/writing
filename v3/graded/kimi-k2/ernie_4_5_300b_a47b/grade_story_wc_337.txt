<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is embodied and specific—“salt and memory,” “frayed edges”—but her contradictory impulses (fear vs. compulsion to listen) are stated more than dramatized. The final shift to lucid wakefulness is credible yet feels slightly under-costed; we see the weight lift but not what she forfeits. Elias functions as oracle more than crucible, so status pressure is muted.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the net’s dissolution into key is a Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights silence from prison to open conversation. Causality is Accumulative/Textural—each loosened knot thickens the hush until pattern-break releases it. Orientation is swift; no lens ambiguity. Cost is conceptual (loss of protective silence) rather than visceral, but still legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary refracts starlight into “a thousand shifting colors,” a micro-setting that mirrors Mara’s fractured perception and later clarifies when the light bursts free. Salt-crusted net and dulled needle are tactile anchors that constrain her method. Spatial choreography is tight; no white-room drift. Environment evolves causally with the unraveling.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—free the restless spirits—signaled early. Escalation is Accumulative: each knot loosened intensifies the hush until the final burst. Agency is present but soft; Mara’s fear is voiced yet never truly tests her resolve on the page. Cost is conceptual rather than a forfeited live option, keeping it from the 8-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of silence as both refuge and prison emerges organically through the net’s accumulated voices. Subtext in Elias’s riddles and the “key to a door that was never locked” reframes secrecy without moralizing. Final image of “a faint, persistent hum” offers non-literal resonance. Avoids tidy epiphany; ambiguity lingers productively.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet grounded in sensory specificity—“interlaced hush,” “barnacles of memory.” Syntax modulates with tension, tightening during unraveling. POV remains stable; no head-hop. Dialogue between Mara and Elias carries subtext, though Elias edges toward archetype. Distinct perceptual signature sustained.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; figurative language is selective. Occasional soft phrases—“she felt a weight lift”—slip toward summary rather than embodiment, but never stall momentum. No loops or mixed metaphors. Final paragraph’s cadence earns its breathing space.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Premise of mending haunted nets inside a prismatic sanctuary feels fresh, synthesizing ghost-story and craft motifs. The “interlaced hush” concept reweights silence as tangible material—an inventive turn. Risk is moderate; execution coherent. Avoids gimmickry, though Elias’s riddles flirt with trope.</comment>
