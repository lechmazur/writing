<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Lirael’s interiority—especially the “furiously tranquil” paradox—shapes micro-choices under pressure, but the trait is labeled more than dramatized in body language, and her moment of sacrifice is felt more as triumphant release than visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story establishes Accumulative/Textural drive—spirals, seeds, entropy—and fulfills it with Renegotiated Stasis: root-to-sapling reconfigures entropy-debt into renewal. Spatial/temporal anchors land cleanly before demand sharpens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Icebound atrium crystallizes pressure: melting shards after seeding exert causal leverage on closure; starlight shading violet/silver syncs with Lirael’s biopsycho state. Environment precisely constrains seed placement, not mere backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Central stake—restore life-path or drown in chaotic time—tightens through each seed-splinter beat. The oak sprout acts as decisive reversal/charged poise, but cost is abstract (conceptual, not visceral) at closure’s edge.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of cyclical entropy/rebirth emerges organically from seed decay → tree’s green flame, avoiding didacticism. The final image quietly reweights ancestral guarding as renewable burden, but remains slightly ethereal.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Consistently lyrical, sensory-dense POV matches Lirael’s shifted perception without drifting into purple. Controlled compression in vortex passage keeps mind coherent under disorientation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sentences compress multivalent sense without loops; early “flush of light like shattered glass” is reactivated as ice bloom later. A single phrase drag—“decay fueling the vortex’s hunger”—comes near register clash but traces cause.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Inverts archetypal seed-keeper myth by redefining “sacrifice” as controlled disorder. Risky entropy-to-flora inversion is grounded in specific heirloom beans, not generic magic seeds, though some cosmic diction feels familiar.</comment>
