<comment>Lira's interiority is consistent and specific—“Through forgotten songs, we remember how to live” distills her value hierarchy. The micro-choice to lay her palm on the mica and draw the melody is embodied, costly (hoarse, exhausted), and irreversible. The memory fragments generate a believable struggle without explanatory filler. Only minor excess reflection late prevents a 9-band.</comment>

<comment>Closure arrives via Earned Stasis: Lira keeps humming even as the night retreats, accepting perpetual guardianship. The chosen Accumulative/Textural lens tightens by density—note by added note—until the final “bound release” reimages the orchard as a living dawn-song. On-page cost is felt (voice raw, “hoarse”) not summarized.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Greenhouse walls etched in silver runes, glowing gold-plums, and mica windows function as micro-setting tools that constrain choices: only the windows let past songs return; the fruit responds to each note. Spatial choreography is airtight; “leaned against a tree, exhausted but peaceful” anchors posture under luminous canopy.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Pressure is single-thread yet acute: the dying realm’s need versus Lira’s finite voice. Escalation accrues through growing light and spreading melody until “the realm learned to swaddle itself” marks intensification, not resolution. One price (hoarseness, exhaustion) is visible; a sharper trade-off would punch 8.5.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The theme of communal memory reborn through individual sacrifice emerges from Lira’s sustained, gritty singing, not from a statement. The final image—tiny sun-bright windows as woven dawns—earns thematic cohesion without abstract preach. No final-paragraph lecture occurs.</comment>

<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person close filters everything through Lira’s idiosyncratic noticing (humming orchard glass, soil-streaked light “like captured stars”). Rhythm modulates with tension: longer lines during harvest stasis tighten to clipped phrases when the songs ignite. No dialogue exists, therefore no dialogue faults.</comment>

<comment>Prose is dense and musical—“sound wove through the orchard, igniting the fruit, which burst into soft, radiant blooms” does triple job (action, metaphor, stakes). Minor overwriting on “mercury-pooled” and “endless night” (loose metaphor cluster) keeps the score a hair below 9-band.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Mythic orchard inside a mirror world where time is liquid and windows inhale dreams feels specific and non-shoppable. The core concept—a lonely singer reviving collective memory note by note—feels inevitable here yet genuinely fresh; no near-echo detected. Minor deductions only for familiar lyrical motifs.</comment>
