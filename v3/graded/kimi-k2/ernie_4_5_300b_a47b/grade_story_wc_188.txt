<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority is vivid—embodied in the warm knot, the chant, the raw laugh—yet the mentor’s absence is only asserted, not dramatized, so the final renunciation feels slightly pre-loaded rather than fully earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the blooming lilies reweight “shadows” into latent potential, and the cost—accepting the children’s scars as permanent context—is legible in the final image of upward fire.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>The fortress’s liquid-light fountains and dormant fire-lilies are not mere backdrop; their staged dormancy and explosive blooming physically constrain Lira’s path and charge the final reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—outrunning past failure—tightens when the note forces a choice: ignite the lilies and risk repeating harm, or retreat; the single escalation is sufficient and the price (memory of scars) is felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through the inversion of “shadows” from darkness to unlit potential; no moral is stated, yet the final image of reflected light on a starless sky reweights the premise with quiet conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is textured, rhythmic, and POV-locked; the chant’s cadence modulates with pressure, and the perceptual signature—“filter the world through its flame”—is consistent and paid off in the final bloom.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; only minor scaffold (“the air grew thicker, the ambient sounds muting”) slightly dulls momentum, but no artifact touches the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of fireworks craft, living architecture, and mentor-echoed riddle feels fresh; the risk of lyric escalation pays off without gimmickry, though the mentor’s vanishing trope is familiar.</comment>
