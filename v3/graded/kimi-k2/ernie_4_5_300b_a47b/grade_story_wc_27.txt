<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira’s barefoot stargazer identity is vivid—calloused feet, opera glasses, grandmother’s charts—yet her “awkward confidence” is asserted more than embodied; the final stance crystallizes but the cost is collective rather than personal, softening the arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the stones’ hum peaks, the rebellion’s voice roars, and the lull is reweighted into gathering storm. Causal chain (alignment → hum → signal → reignition) holds under Accumulative/Textural lens; only minor ellipsis between “Now!” and the roar.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Spaceport bay is tactile—rusted cranes, half-buried drones, cool floor under bare feet—and the stone circle’s hum constrains the final choice. Sensory hierarchy narrows to vibration and wind, charging the ending image with ozone and iron.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“the rebellion is dead / not dead”—tightens once when the hum peaks and voices rise. Agency is collective ignition rather than individual sacrifice; cost is implied in the thunderous roar but not individually felt, keeping it just below the 8.8 gate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of “chaos has a rhythm” emerges through stones, hum, and collective voice; no explicit moralizing. Final image reweights prior despair into charged poise, though the conceptual cost is more communal than personal.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet grounded in Lira’s barefoot, sky-watching perspective; perceptual signature sharp (“liquid gold,” “thread of sound”). Dialogue with Jax carries subtext, though their voices verge on convergence under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is vivid and propulsive, but occasional stacked metaphors (“liquid gold,” “dead engine’s wake,” “thunderous serenity”) risk overwriting in peak beats. No loops or scaffold; rhythm modulates with scene pulse.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Familiar rebellion-lull trope is refreshed by stone-circle resonance and opera-glass interface; synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk lies in communal rather than personal ignition, slightly blunting individual ingenuity.</comment>
