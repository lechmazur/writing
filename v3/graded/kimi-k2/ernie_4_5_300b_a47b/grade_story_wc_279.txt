<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara feels individual and arc-worthy—her shift from observer to active translator is subtle yet earned through embodied micro-choices (tracing, pressing, white-chalking the wall). Interiority is mood-rich though it flirts with “mantra” self-awareness as shorthand for struggle. The reconfiguration at the end crystallizes motive with visible forfeiture of detachment and rings cost inside the sculpted silence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the mandala-tile synergy remaps the emergent hush from silence to collective language, forcing Mara to risk disruption by drawing on the wall. The Accumulative/Textural lens is taught and maintained—the repeating pattern→density shift reweights stakes without causal whiplash. A knock emerges in late-transition opacity (“bell tolled”) absent spatial cue, but it does not derail consequence. Cost is palpable—her older stance as detached recorder is foreclosed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The grotto’s tactility—damp moss, hovering flake, breathing silence—constrains every move; fog complicates depth perception and the acoustic chamber governs choice of silence vs. speech. Palette evokes mood while the tile’s lilac light explicitly charges the final projection. Occasional mist-as-skin cliché is offset by integrated sensory hierarchy.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decipher or preserve fragile hush) is announced early; pressure tightens via the tile’s urging (“Interject”) and her chalked patterns that unlock a system-wide change. Escalation rises through legitimate agency—drawing in sand, aligning tiles—not luck. The price is loss of passive sanctuary; option tally is rewired by the wall inscription’s irrevocable permanence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of collaborative truth vs. solitary observation emerges organically from Marr’s process; silence morphs from absence to communal message without expository nudging. Final image reweights prior chalk galaxies and “unlearning” mantra into participatory design. Minor diffuse mantra phrase risks echo effect but is salvaged by embodied cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited voice is coated in Mara’s chalk-laden perceptual signature: “galaxies of sand,” “lilac-hued glow felt in the ribs.” Rhythm modulates—long, lyrical twines in quiet discovery swapped for clipped diction during tile-fitting beats. No head-hop; minor uptick in abstract nouns near climax but stays within look-feel.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sentences are dense yet agile, layering purpose: “shard...pulsed with a faint, lilac-hued glow, as if it had absorbed the grotto’s secrets” folds atmosphere, agency cue, sensory shimmer. Few filter verbs; props tracked cleanly. One density spike (“collective silence born from countless voices...”) risks infodraft but is anchored via focalizer awe.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Takes the overused “magical artifact in cave” scaffold and reframes it via street-chalk cosmology and acoustic linguistics. Fresh synthesis feels inevitable because the mandala, tile, and hush co-evolve from sidewalk art and grotto echo into shared lexicon. No close echoes of extant genre scenes.</comment>
