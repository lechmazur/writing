<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s survivor-guilt and need for absolution are embodied in the hourglass moment; the scarred face and helmet bite are vivid. Interior contradiction—fear of the box vs need to open it—drives the single decisive choice. Yet the “bargained innocence” concept is asserted more than dramatized in present action, muting the cost scale.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the final whispered “I hear you” crystallizes a new stance toward pain and forest. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each sensory layer (moonlight, frost, sand) intensifies until the cadence shift at dawn. Cost is felt in the relinquishing of self-punishment, though the causal chain is more atmospheric than because/therefore.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Ridge, moonlight, and frost are filtered through Elias’s firefighter gaze; the porcelain box functions as micro-setting that constrains the final gesture. Sensory hierarchy narrows to the hourglass’s silver sand under moonlight, charging the closing image. Spatial choreography is clean; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—translate pain into universal language—tightens once when the hourglass’s flow reframes memory. Escalation is accretive: each remembered scream layers until the stance crystallizes. Agency is present in opening the box and tipping the glass; cost is the emotional exposure, though external stakes remain internal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of fire-as-transformation emerges through specific images (ash nourishing life) rather than statement. The hourglass reweights the premise from frozen guilt to flowing acceptance. Subtext in the mother’s note avoids moralizing; resonance lingers in the forest’s sigh.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet grounded in firefighter diction (“reading the land’s breath”). Rhythm modulates with pressure—long sentences for ascent, clipped fragments at the tipping of the glass. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, with selective figurative language (“silver light pooling like spilled milk”) that never overwhelms. One paraphrase loop (“he’d come here to… instead he’d found”) is minor. High information density; no line-level artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Transforms familiar survivor-guilt arc through the hourglass image and firefighter’s ecological lens. Specificity of porcelain cracks and frozen sand feels inevitable in hindsight. No close echoes; risk is modest but coherent.</comment>
