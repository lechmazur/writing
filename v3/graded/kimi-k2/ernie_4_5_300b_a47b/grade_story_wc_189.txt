<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is textured and embodied; her contradictory impulses (record vs. bridge) act simultaneously in the grotto beats. The final micro-choice—leaving the cicada—earns the soft rapprochement with Kael and carries relational cost. Minor slip: “warmly observant” is asserted more than dramatized in body language.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of tide, cicada, starlight patterns reweights the relational stalemate. Closure is a Charged Poise—the altered cicada placement crystallizes options and felt cost without resolving the argument outright. Orientation is swift; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Grotto is vivid, selective, and filters through Elara’s chronicler eye; tide’s micro-shifts constrain her pacing and final gesture. The jade cicada functions as micro-setting that charges the last image. One stray “ancient grotto beneath the stars” leans toward postcard, but overall integration is strong.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can Elara translate her tidal foresight into human connection—tightens once when she risks the cicada nudge. Cost is relational vulnerability; Kael’s softening shows the pressure landed. No reversals, but one meaningful deepening under Accumulative lens suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of transition-as-fermentation emerges through tide, cicada, and pause without moralizing. Final image of cicada left for the tide offers non-literal resonance that reweights prior material. Subtext in Kael’s silence and Elara’s gesture is effective; avoids tidy moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: chronicler’s synesthetic noticing (“tide’s breath painted the walls in silver”) remains consistent. Rhythm modulates with emotional pressure; no head-hopping. Dialogue is spare but carries subtext; voice coherence under stress is exemplary.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid; figurative language is purposeful and pattern-taught. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Sentence variety supports tidal cadence. One minor filter-verb cluster (“she imagined it carrying memories”) but does not dull closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: tidal chronicler using liminal ritual to mend a relationship feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Cicada as metamorphic semaphore is specific and transformative. Risk is quiet, but coherence and specificity elevate it above familiar “pause before talk” stories.</comment>
