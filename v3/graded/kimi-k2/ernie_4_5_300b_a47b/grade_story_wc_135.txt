<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lirael’s reporter-diligent drive pulses through every return to the damaged sites, but her interiority hovers—scars are named more than embodied—and the climactic choice (restoring the trumpet) feels granted rather than wrenched from her fatigue.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Staggered-interval revisits create a cumulative accretive frame; causality is loose (Memories surface because Lirael “waits”), yet the rhythm tightens options toward the final reunion of valve and trumpet with discernible closure resonance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Ivory-harbor rain-slick cobbles constrain movement and echo emotional fractures; lighthouse cottage floorboard journal and plaza’s echoing seagull cries serve as tactile constraints that alter next moves, with the trumpet’s gleam charging the final museum tableau.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Single dominant stake—harbor history reclaimed—is clear; pressure tightens through journal revelation and fisherman testimony, but escalation flattens when social restoration turns into ceremonial blowing without showing the real reintegration cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>“History as mosaic” emerges from relics and voices rather than statement; the final trumpet note subtly reprices silence and revises the exile’s legacy without slipping into platitude.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Elegant restrained lyricism mirrors Lirael’s archivist lens; sensory cadence accelerates with tide pools and salt-air absence, then softens for archival echoes without overwriting.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Almost no loops or filler; high information density—“brass component from pre-exile”—advances both world and character; figurative language is selective and purposeful, giving prose a distinct crystalline texture.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Blue-collar oral history grafted onto fantasy exile feels fresh; mosaic structure of voices repurposes familiar post-exile tropes into a brass valve that reframes silence as both lament and promise.</comment>
