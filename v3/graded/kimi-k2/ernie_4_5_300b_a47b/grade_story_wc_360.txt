<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elias’s contradictory impulses—detachment vs. the need to feel—are dramatized through the press experiment; the embodied cost (tears, stumbling) earns the final renunciation. The borrowed-personality trait pressures one decisive beat (confusing the fragment) and then collapses, a credible arc. Veyra’s loneliness refracts through Elias’s sudden empathy, altering their relationship state. The flaw of treating emotion as formula drives the mistake and its visible price.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: Elias’s deliberate ambiguity → fragment confusion → transposed empathy → tear-stained realization. Closure is a Decisive Change: he abandons the analytical stance, foreclosing further experimentation. Orientation is anchored within 120 words; no teleporting props. The cost (loss of detachment) is legible in the fogged goggles and fragment settling “cool and obedient.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The halo fragment constrains every choice—its pulsing light guides Elias’s tactics and finally charges the ending image. Micro-setting (burnt-sapphire air, brass goggles) is filtered through Elias’s priorities and evolves with the experiment. Spatial choreography is clean: fragment, press, ink jars track across beats. Sensory detail narrows under crisis to the heartbeat-like pulse.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can emotion be quantified?—tightens when the fragment turns the experiment back on Elias. One meaningful escalation: the empathy merge forces a stance crystallization. Agency drives the turn; coincidence does not resolve. The price—loss of analytical armor—is felt on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from action: the impossibility of reducing emotion to math is proven by Elias’s own breakdown. Subtext lives in the fragment’s refusal to be solved and Veyra’s scowl softening. The ending image (tears, obedient shard) offers a resonant, non-moral answer. No thematic echo in final paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct—precise, analytical diction that frays under pressure (“lucid turbulence”). Perceptual signature is Elias’s: equations, brass goggles, synesthetic scent. No head-hopping; interiority stays character-bound. Rhythm accelerates with the runaway press, then slows to the final crystallized moment.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high information density. Figurative language is selective and purposeful (“sine waves of joy”). No mixed metaphors in peak beats. Sentence rhythm mirrors emotional intensity—clacking press, then hushed final line. Clean grammar and pronoun reference.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Premise—empathy transposition via celestial shard—is fresh yet grounded in character need. Tropes (mad scientist, mystical artifact) are transformed through Elias’s specific flaw and the workshop’s tactile detail. Risky lyric compression pays off in the final image. The synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
