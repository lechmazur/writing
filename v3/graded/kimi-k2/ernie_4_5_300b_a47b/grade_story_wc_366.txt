<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s reticence and embodied watchfulness are vivid; the shift from dismissive skepticism to anticipatory caretaking of the stone-stack ritual is credible and felt. Interior contradiction—gruff silence vs. covert hope—plays in real time. The final smile is earned because the ritual has visibly replaced the lamp as his source of duty. Cost is present: he accepts permanent vigilance without mechanical light.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the lighthouse beam is gone, yet Elias’s nightly stacking now carries the beacon’s moral weight. Causal chain—glass → note → stack → reply—tightens options until endurance becomes the only viable stance. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern density and cadence shift reweight the stake. Cost is legible in the final image of Elias pocketing the singing glass, now a portable vigil.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The lantern room’s salt-streaked walls and rattling windows act as micro-setting that constrains movement and mood; the eastern window sill becomes a charged altar. Sensory selection (iron, brine, wind moan) is filtered through Elias’s professional eye. Final image of stacked stones catching lantern light anchors the new “beacon.” Environment materially shapes the ritual that replaces the lamp.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to keep the feeling of safety alive once the lamp dies—is signaled early and escalates through each nightly exchange. Agency is expressed in Elias’s decision to keep stacking even after the lamp is declared irreparable; this renunciation of mechanical rescue carries visible cost. One meaningful tightening: the stones must be restacked every dusk, a recursive duty that forecloses rest. Pressure remains coherent under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: safety is not technology but shared, iterated attention. Subtext resides in the silence between notes and the hush after the final stone is placed. The ending reframes the lighthouse from instrument to vessel of human continuity without moralizing. Resonance lingers in the “quiet hymn to the night,” a non-literal answer to the fear of darkness.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Voice is weathered, taciturn, salted with maritime diction—“oilskin coat,” “ghostly moan”—and rhythmic restraint mirrors Elias’s reticence. Perceptual signature is selective: he notices rust patterns and slant light, not tourist vistas. No dialogue, yet interior monologue stays character-bound and avoids explanatory spillage. Final cadence slows to match the hush of earned stasis.</comment>

<comment>Prose is lean, tactile, and propulsive; each sentence advances mood or action. Figurative language is spare and precise—“darkness felt heavier, a physical thing pressing against his chest.” No loops or scaffold; information density is high. Rhythm modulates with ascent and descent of stairs, mirroring emotional rise and settling.</comment>

<comment>Familiar lighthouse tale is refreshed by replacing mechanical beacon with iterative human ritual; the stone-stack cipher feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Specificity of sea glass’s “hum” and the whispered chime lifts the premise above trope. Risk lies in quiet lyricism rather than spectacle, and coherence is maintained. Fresh inflection: the lamp’s failure births a quieter, communal light.</comment>
