<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s synesthetic gift and “gentle rebellion” motive are vivid, but interiority drifts into therapeutic summary (“she’d often whisper”) rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The final pruning choice carries felt cost and aligns with her established traits, yet earlier memories arrive as neat thematic packets rather than clashing impulses in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the plant’s reconfiguration from trauma to future-garden vision is a Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost (her trembling, exhaustion). Causal chain is tight—each prune triggers memory and growth—though the celestial alignment functions more as atmospheric cue than causal driver.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rusted greenhouse is tactile and atmospheric, its cracked glass and moss grounding the scene. The violet light of the alignment constrains timing and charges the final golden afterglow, but spatial choreography inside the greenhouse could be sharper—tools and plant positions blur momentarily.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—redeeming the seed’s traumatic memories into communal hope—escalates through each pruning cut that narrows the plant’s path. The cost is visceral (her gasping, trembling) and the final bud’s future-vision crystallizes the trade-off; coincidence (alignment) complicates rather than rescues.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme of healing-through-selective-memory emerges organically from pruning action and synesthetic flashes. Subtext avoids sermonizing until the final notebook reveal, which edges toward thematic echo but is saved by the earned image of gardens in ruins. Complexity lingers: beauty bought by excising pain.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet grounded in Elara’s sensory bias; diction (“synaptic plasticity”) stays within her salvaged-text lexicon. Rhythm modulates with stress—short clauses during pruning, longer breaths in reflection. No dialogue, so voice coherence rests on internal texture, which holds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is vivid and mostly lean, but occasional purple patches (“sculpture of light and life”) and stacked metaphors slightly dilute peak beats. No loops or scaffold, yet a few filter verbs (“she could feel”) dull immediacy. Final image lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The synesthetic botanist-healer in a post-collapse greenhouse feels fresh; the pruning-as-rewiring conceit transforms familiar eco-hope tropes. Specificity of salvaged tools and moss-streaked glass anchors the world, though the celestial alignment is a stock device. Overall synthesis is memorable.</comment>
