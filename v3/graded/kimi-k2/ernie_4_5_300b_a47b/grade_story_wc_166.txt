<comment>Lirael’s interior contradiction—yearning cosmically yet anchored to the present moment—is embodied in every move she makes, but the line “her heart full of obsidian grace” veers toward label-speak without specific embodiment. The micro-choice to etch the verse onto herself is earned and carries visible pain, meeting Earned Stasis. However, the final beat slips into abstraction, dulling the felt cost.</comment>

<comment>The closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the verse appears on her skin, and she chooses voluntary exile, “a tide dancer in a garden of stars.” Causality is Accumulative/Textural: the dance, dust, and writing escalate into a single irrevocable image. The drive lens holds through, yet a faint hint of cost is delivered more by image than by tangible burden on the final page; this keeps the score just under 8.</comment>

<comment>The moss heartbeat and luminescent mist anchor the body-as-setting early, and the garden’s spatial rules constrain her leaps—“hung suspended... the garden’s stars swirling”—charging the ending. Economy falters slightly during exposition on the nostalgia ban. Overall, environment, body, and moonstone tool shape choice and closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>A single, dominant stake—renew the constellations or remain hollow—tightens through escalating pressure of the ban and the burning stylus. Only one decisive escalation occurs; the cost is visible but brief. Agency remains clear: she writes, she burns, she accepts exile.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Thematic question of how to live between memory and now emerges organically through the dance and flesh etching. The final image reframes rather than moralizes. Echoes of loss linger despite the cosmic frame, achieving measured resonance without tidy lesson-giving.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The lyric, sensory diction is sustained and character-specific (“obsidian grace,” “celestial cloak”). Repetition of soft clauses (e.g., “and... and...”) flirts with cadence drag but aligns with ritual. Absence of dialogue removes Q6’s dialogue bullets.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is vivid yet trim, weaving metaphor into motion without purple overload. Occasional abstractions (“the universe burned”) are countered by tactile detail (moss pulse, moonstone in pores). Zero hard copy slips or loops; rhythm aligns with breaths and leaps.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>The melding of ban-against-memory with cosmic verse on skin is a non-clichéd synthesis. Some celestial-ballet imagery edges familiar archetype, but specific anchoring in tide dancer physiology and stone-to-skin transmutation keeps it fresh.</comment>
