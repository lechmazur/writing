<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—her palm on the frost, the hum only she hears—but her contradictory impulses (anchor vs. rupture) are asserted rather than dramatized in scene; the final smile feels slightly unearned because the cost to her is off-stage.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the library’s cage becomes a maelstrom, cost visible in the shuddering shelves and dispersing whisper. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern density (frost, press rhythm, spiral) tightens until the rupture reweights meaning.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Glass orchard, prismatic volumes, swirling clouds—details are selective and mirrored in the frost lattices that literally map vulnerabilities; the setting constrains Elara’s timing and method, charging the final image of the etched-air spiral.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—rupture vs. preservation of order—signaled early; pressure escalates via the frost anomaly and frantic press rhythm, narrowing to the decisive print run. Cost is legible in the shattering whisper and patrons’ terror, though Elara’s personal price is less visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Theme of awakening through rupture emerges organically from Elara’s tools and choices; the final dispersal of the whisper reweights earlier order as cage without moralizing. Subtext in the frost’s silent map and the press’s heartbeat deepens resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Voice is lush yet disciplined, with rhythmic control that accelerates during the rupture; perceptual signature (ink-ozone air, fractal frost) stays tightly bound to Elara’s sensorium. No head-hopping; compression and elision are taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; figurative language serves pattern rather than ornament. Minor loop risk in “glass orchard library” repetition, but momentum never stalls. Final image—“etched into the air itself”—lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</question><comment>Fresh synthesis of letterpress mysticism and fractal architecture; the bottled whisper as destabilizing eternity-compressor feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risky rupture-as-liberation stance is fully committed to, not hedged.</comment>
