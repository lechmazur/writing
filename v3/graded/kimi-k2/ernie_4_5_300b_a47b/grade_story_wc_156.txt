<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marisol’s curiosity and methodical playfulness are embodied in tactile choices (kneeling, adjusting the dish, whispering). The hobo nickel’s emotional weight is credible, yet her interiority flirts with label-speak (“inherited his restlessness”) and the final beat is more observation than choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the mural reseals, the coin is pocketed, and the garden’s hum becomes a felt rhythm. Causal chain (coin → reflected sound → awakened memory) holds; the cost is the irreversible shift from certainty to curiosity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The sound-wave garden is rendered through selective sensory detail—E-flat drone, fractal chimes, concave dish—each constraining Marisol’s experiment. Spatial choreography is clean; the garden’s hum evolves into a lullaby that charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—uncovering the mural’s hidden memory—tightens when the nickel’s harmonics force a trade-off: knowledge gained, innocence lost. One clear escalation beat; cost is legible in the final “rhythm” she now carries.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of nested awakenings emerges through concrete action rather than statement. The final image reweights prior material: the garden is not a place but a state of mind. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays close to Marisol’s perceptions; diction is vivid and consistent. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful; Dr. Lysander’s lines carry subtext. No head-hopping; voice modulates with emotional intensity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense. Occasional soft phrases (“pulse quickened,” “throat tightened”) are minor. No loops or scaffold; metaphors stay coherent. Final cadence is earned.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses acoustic science with memory magic in a fresh, non-obvious way. The hobo nickel’s dual role as heirloom and acoustic prism feels inevitable in hindsight. Specificity anchors the fantastical; no stock tropes.</comment>
