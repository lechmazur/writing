<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara’s skeptical, pattern-seeking mind is credibly embodied in tactile beats (kneeling in loam, reassembling shreds). Her final choice to sacrifice the flawed diamond is foreshadowed by earlier micro-choices and carries visible cost (loss of the orchard’s miracle). Interiority stays concrete, though a touch more contradiction at the climax would push higher.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each beat (find journal → reassemble letters → test diamond → seal stillpoint) tightens options under rising stakes. Closure lands as Decisive Change with felt cost—the orchard’s fertility traded for world safety. One minor ellipsis (how Mara intuits the second diamond’s purpose) keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The rust-colored dust, radioactive grit, and impossible orchard create a tactile crucible that constrains every move. The diamond’s symbols and the soil markings integrate setting into the final ritual. A hairline slip: the “crumbling cottage” interior could be more specific to POV priorities.</comment>

<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—prevent stillpoint collapse—is signaled early and escalates through each beat. The flawed diamond’s sacrifice narrows options and exacts a visible price. One tightening suffices, but the pressure could feel more viscerally urgent in the final chamber.</comment>

<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of truth’s cost emerges organically from Mara’s choices; the orchard’s survival becomes a moral trade-off rather than a sermon. Final image of cleaner air and unfurling branches reweights earlier motifs without moralizing. A shade more ambiguity in the “hope” note would deepen resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Voice is sharp, skeptical, and sensorily precise—“truth excavator,” “radioactive grit,” “branches arching like fingers.” Syntax modulates with tension; no head-hopping. Occasional elevated diction (“stasis seeping”) slightly lifts out of POV lexicon under peak stress.</comment>

<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and propulsive; every sentence advances plot or atmosphere. Metaphors are vivid yet controlled (“apples glowed like miniature suns”). One paraphrase loop (“the diamond… the gem… the stone”) in mid-story and a filter-verb cluster (“she felt”) near the climax keep it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Post-apocalyptic orchard keyed by a flawed diamond to a time-stasis breach feels fresh and inevitable. The stillpoint concept is grounded in tactile stakes rather than abstract gimmick. Risk-taking (renouncing miracle for survival) pays off without obscuring clarity.</comment>
