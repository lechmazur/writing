<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Anya’s contradictory impulses—methodical documentation vs. visceral dread—are embodied in micro-choices (adjusting sensors, pocketing the patch). The final renunciation of the port’s “machine” is earned, but the engineer’s flatness and the patch’s late agency dilute relational pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each gust tightens options until the climactic discovery. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—port as hungry machine—with felt cost in Anya’s redesign mandate. Minor drift: patch’s sudden resonance feels like a late rule tweak.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Container labyrinth constrains every move; wind vectors and rusted ridges are filtered through Anya’s investigator gaze. Sodium light, salt-stained gravel, and the vibrating patch charge the final image. Spatial choreography is exact; environment actively shapes tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—survive the port’s emergent wind-machine—escalates via sensor data and bodily threat. One decisive tightening: 45 mph gust forces climb. Cost is visible (redesign mandate) but less visceral than atmospheric dread.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges: human systems become autonomous, hungry architectures. Subtext in the patch’s buzz and engineer’s glazed eyes avoids moralizing. Final image—port “never truly sleep[s]”—reweights premise without statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Anya’s perceptual signature; diction is precise, rhythmic. No head-hopping. Engineer’s dialogue is serviceable but generic; voice convergence under stress is minor.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, propulsive; sentences advance plot or atmosphere. Occasional figurative excess (“machine was hungry”) is earned by context. No loops or scaffold. Clean mechanics.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: cargo-container microclimate as antagonist. Premise is specific, grounded in port logistics. Risk is moderate; transformation is solid but not radical.</comment>
