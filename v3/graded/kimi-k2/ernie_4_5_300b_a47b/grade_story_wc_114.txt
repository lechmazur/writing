<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lirael’s interiority is touchable (spectacles, graphite smudges, palm on cold glass) and her contradictory impulses (oracle vs. mess-bearing conscience) act simultaneously in-scene. Fault-tolerance is driven by visible flaw (guilt over hidden seismic data) that escalates choices and spawns a credible renunciation at closure. Micro-choice hierarchy (truth vs. safety) is pinned with cost as she abandons the station.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal arc from fever dream-borne doubt → discovery of falsified data → definitive renunciation is clear. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration: “occupying margins” final image reconfigures her stance with undeniable cost (“anchor her… until it breaks her open”). Situational lens holds—geological instability pressure coherently narrows options to flee or perpetuate a lie.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Mountain’s twist of pine scent & “steel barnacle” station anchors body-memory. The bearberry watercolor body-tool constrains a choice (plant’s roots throttled into the illustration paper → roots of the cover-up she must root out). Spatial choreography of aurora-fractured shadow across valley creates coherent pressure for flight.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—station’s impending collapse vs. public cover-up—escalates via cause-of-action: Lirael chooses stolen illustration to confront her own complicity. Staticed readings & muffled evac whispers raise immediate pressure. Closure choice (abandon post) forecloses her career path with wrought cost—“weighted heavier each day” is visible in textual weight.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme—truth-telling vs. calculated containment—emerges through specific embodiment (soil-thin roots, swallowed metallic tang). Auroral shroud final image non-literally answers the central question by reframing silence as complicity. Subtext indicts institutional denial without moralizing; ambiguity lingers in Lirael’s choice to “bleed” instead of quantify.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person immediate POV is stable; free-indirect texture fuses oracle prAndlength with visceral perception (“metallic tang of a swallowed truth”). Dialogue is minimal yet goal-driven (frost-moustached director: “Oracles don’t feel the weather”). Closing line makes her voice crystallize under pressure without head-hop.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Rhythm swings from rattle-rattling wind to auroral ripple without cliché; density is high—every charcoal smudge, forehead-to-glass beat advances story or atmosphere. No filter-verb addiction; passive “had faded” deliberate for after-fe tone. Line-level loop/artifact screen finds zero paraphrase churn; cut “a lie about the station’s stability” sets up closure cost.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: “fault-tolerant oracle” who becomes the fatal flaw she detects—plant-drawn roots literalizing data lies. Risk transforms trope by turning seismic cover-up into personal illness. Final stakes image—aurora dimming over fleeing silhouette—feels inevitable and non-obvious, visualizing her newly anchored instability without exposition.</comment>
