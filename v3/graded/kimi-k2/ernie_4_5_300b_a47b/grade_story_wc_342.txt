<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lira’s face-blindness is evoked through texture and hue, but never tested under pressure; her final act feels inevitable yet the interior contradiction (artist who cannot see faces must paint memory) remains ornamental. The safe’s weight and the coin’s indentations give her two tactile choices, but the emotional cost is stated rather than embodied. Earned stasis is present—she walks away carrying the legacy—but the flaw of “limits overcome” is asserted more than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the portrait becomes the new “sky inside walls,” reweighting the guild’s premise. Causal linkage holds—coin → panel → safe → journal → paint—yet the demolition clock is more scenic than causal driver. One transition (inside tree → outside chaos) is clean; orientation is anchored by damp bark and wrecking-ball shadows within 120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The oak’s grain, wet soil, and parchment scent are filtered through Lira’s synesthetic perception; the empty shelf and hidden panel constrain her next move. The tree’s hollow functions as micro-setting that literally houses the stakes; its fall is the felt cost. Sensory hierarchy tightens under threat—dust, rumble, stinging eyes—mirroring internal urgency.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“final portrait of knowledge” before dawn—tightens when discovery of the journal reframes the task from recording decay to preserving legacy. The wrecking ball supplies coherent external pressure; Lira’s agency is the choice to paint the sky-pattern instead of decay. Cost is visible: the tree will fall, the portrait may burn, yet escalation stays singular and sufficient.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of preservation vs. impermanence emerges through the oak’s grain and star-blue pigment; no explicit moralizing. The journal’s line “When the tree falls, let the stars remain” reweights the premise without preaching. Subtext lives in tactile detail—indentations, safe’s weight, coin’s warmth—rather than exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is painterly, synesthetic, and consistent: “fractally precise spirals,” “ultramarine and gold to mimic the night sky.” Perceptual signature remains stable under stress; no head-hopping. Compression is purposeful—e.g., “the heightened stillness of the tree’s final moments lingered, a silent hymn”—and cadence modulates with scene pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers texture or advances action. No loops or scaffold; metaphors stay coherent (“spirals that mirrored the constellations she’d never seen”). Occasional elevated diction fits Lira’s artistic lens. Rhythm breathes with urgency—short clauses before the wrecking-ball blow, longer painterly strokes during creation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fusion of face-blind portraitist, living calendar carved in oak, and star-mapped journal feels fresh and inevitable. Tropes of “last library” and “hidden knowledge” are transformed through tactile synesthesia and the fractal sky-painting. Risk lies in the quiet lyric ending; it pays off by reconfiguring meaning rather than spectacle.</comment>
