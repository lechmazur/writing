<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lila’s curiosity and inherited skepticism are embodied in micro-choices—dropping the pencil, twisting the pendant—yet her interiority occasionally drifts into inherited proverb rather than fresh contradiction. The final endurance (sketching the giant as guardian) carries cost, but the shift from skeptic to believer feels compressed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Lila re-enters normal time clutching new knowledge and a charged sketch, the cost being the irreversible glimpse of borrowed moments. Causal chain holds—pendant twist → tunnel → re-entry—though the “uncage” instruction resolves more by oracle fiat than earned logic.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The rooftop canal, moss-crusted stones, and suspended raindrops are filtered through Lila’s illustrator gaze, constraining her movements and later charging the final sketch. Spatial anchors are clear; the giant remains off-stage, slightly thinning environmental pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—capture the breathing canals’ secret—tightens when the fissure opens and time thickens. The cost (irreversible knowledge, possible imbalance) is implied rather than dramatized on exit, keeping escalation vivid but not viscerally paid.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of time as woven, borrowed, and sketched emerges through action and image rather than statement; the final sketch reframes the giant from threat to weary guardian, reweighting the premise without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Voice is precise, tactile, and illustrator-specific—“moss-crusted stones,” “silver serpent”—with rhythmic control under pressure. Compression during the tunnel sequence is taught early and paid off cleanly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is vivid and propulsive, but occasional stacked metaphors (“tunnel was not a passage but a moment”) flirt with overwriting. No loops or scaffold; clarity remains intact at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The giant-as-metaphor-for-borrowed-time feels fresh, synthesized through Lila’s vocation and the canal’s pulse. Risky temporal compression is executed cleanly, yielding inevitability in hindsight.</comment>
