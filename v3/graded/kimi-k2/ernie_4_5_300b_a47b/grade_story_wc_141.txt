<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lira’s interior contradiction—logic vs wonder—drives every micro-choice; her embodied grief and curiosity feel lived-in. The final renunciation (she stops debunking and hums instead) is earned by the shell-cello experiment and carries a visible emotional cost. Yet the astronomer and wife remain off-page voices, so relationship-as-crucible is absent and the score caps below 8.8.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the glowing staff in dust reweights the premise from “decode” to “feel.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of hum, shell, and memory tightens until the final image. One causal wobble: the dials jump from 11:59 to 12:00 without on-page trigger, a minor ellipsis that doesn’t break the lens but keeps the score under 9.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The observatory’s decay—cracked dome, rusted scopes, dust motes—constrains Lira’s every move and charges the final open-sky image. Micro-setting (the half-finished cello as tool-as-setting) is tactile and specific. A single spatial slip: the control panel’s “faint buzz” after years of abandonment strains plausibility, a hairline nick.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“prove the riddle isn’t madness”—tightens when the shell-cello fusion forces a choice between explanation and empathy. The pressure deepens with each resonant beat until the final reconfiguration. Cost is felt (she gives up debunking) but less visceral than the thematic payoff, capping the score below 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: harmony bridges life and death, logic and wonder. The final melody in dust offers a non-literal answer that reweights all prior material. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers. One near-miss: “gloomy cheerfulness” is named, not dramatized, a minor label intrusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is textured, lyrical, and consistent—Lira’s perceptual signature filters every detail through myth-buster skepticism and latent longing. Syntax modulates with emotional crescendo. No POV leakage; dialogue is minimal and subtextual. A single cadence echo (“hum” thrice in four lines) is intentional pattern, not monotony.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; every line advances image or stakes. Figurative language is selective and purposeful (“fossilized question”). One mixed metaphor—“the walls themselves were listening”—is brief and doesn’t cloud causality. No loops or scaffold; high information density throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of seashell map, half-finished cello, and cosmic riddle feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Tropes (haunted observatory, ghost-riddle) are transformed through Lira’s empirical lens and musical resolution. Fresh inflection: the shell points where stars *were*, not *are*. Risk-taking (lyric accumulative structure) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
