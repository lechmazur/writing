<comment>Cael’s desire to merge with the canyon is vivid, but his interiority is filtered through lyrical summary rather than contradictory physical choices: there is no moment where “to stay” fights “to leave” in live beats. Once the fusion begins, he is almost a conduit rather than a protagonist wrestling a choice—no residual fear, regret, or second thought is dramatized to make the renunciation painful on the page. The arrowhead’s merging feels like ordained destiny; its cost is asserted, not embodied in sweat or blood.</comment>

<comment>This is an Accumulative/Textural design whose charge builds through dense iterations of echo, bone, wind, spiral, pulse; closure arrives as “Earned Stasis” when Cael stops and the canyon sings back, a Charged Poise that redraws the map. The drive lens is stable, cost is rendered through the image of arrowhead fusing to sternum—felt anatomically, not merely stated. Orientation is established swiftly; no lens contradiction harms closure. A half-step cap prevents 8.5 solely because the renunciation is so seamless it flirts with inevitability rather than taut choice.</comment>

<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The bone canyon is rendered through gust-chiseled dust, wind-patterns and fossil song; every sensuous cue presses toward physical immobility as the final gateway. It functions as micro-setting within Cael’s own body and arrowhead, constraining movement until “to travel by staying” becomes the only viable tactic. The final image is inseparable from the towers’ resonance charging the closure.</comment>

<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The governing stake is simple: will Cael accept the call to anchor himself irrevocably? Tension ratchets through accumulative layers of sound and vibration until the canyon answers in kind, narrowing options to one—become echo or remain exile. Cost is legible in the arrowhead’s physical absorption. A slight deduction because external opposition is absent; pressure is purely atmospheric rather than contentious.</comment>

<grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>The piece argues that heritage is not a place but a resonance one chooses to inhabit. There is a final paragraph of gentle reflection—borderline thematic statement—preventing the top band, yet the image of spiral–bird-murmuration charging “home” survives on its own power.</comment>

<comment>The cadence is incantatory, with wind-blown syntax mimicking heartbeat and canyon rumble. No single word feels removable without weakening the sonic lattice. Filter-free interiority and textured body attention keep POV unbroken even under lyric stretch.</comment>

<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Sustained figurative layering could overdose, but every repetition—“layered dust,” “bone towers,” “pulse”—does cumulative work under ear and eye. Small risk of monotony is offset by metrical swells that mimic gust-driven breathing. Minor redundancy such as “stone arrowhead” / “stone in his chest” in same half-page nibbles at perfection.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The concept of “navigate without moving” feels inevitable once encountered, yet no precursor short story in recent memory combined flint arrowheads, harmonic skimming, and fossil towers into a single atmospheric spell. Risk lies in how archetypal “ancestor calls” motifs are. The specificity of grandmother-echo encoded in sternum bone rescues it from stock territory.</comment>
