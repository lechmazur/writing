<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s interior contradiction—yearning to recover scent yet choosing to “midwife” others’ stories—remains embodied in every tactile choice; the screw becomes the hinge where her loss turns outward. The final pocketing of the screw is a credible renunciation that costs her the fantasy of literal recovery and forecloses that path. One beat of diagnostic label-speak (“her own hollow nose might refill with meaning”) slightly over-articulates what the body has already shown, keeping the score just below the 9-band gate.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the rotated screw and the newborn-gasp drop re-weight time itself, making the cost of her renunciation audible. Causal chain holds—because she decodes the screw’s origin she therefore redefines her vocation—under an Accumulative/Textural lens taught by the spiraling scratches and water-drip cadence. No orientation debt; fog, shop, and body anchor by line 5. The lens stays coherent to the final breath-sound, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The midwife’s screw functions as micro-setting: its warmth, threads, and quarter-turn rotation physically constrain the final choice and charge the closing image. Fog and water-clock gurgles are filtered through Mira’s haptic bias, never tourist-catalog. Spatial choreography is immaculate—loupe, screw, float, pocket—every object tracked without drift. Environment, body, and tool converge to crystallize the stakes, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can she transmute loss into meaning—tightens when tactile discovery of the screw forces a choice: keep fantasizing scent or midwife stories. The quarter-turn rotation is the single visible trade-off that forecloses the first option. Pressure grows via pattern intensification (spiral scratches → birth panic → breath-like drip) under Accumulative lens; cost is the audible relinquishment of self-healing. Sufficient for high band, though only one tightening beat keeps it shy of 9.0.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: meaning is midwifed, not inhaled. The screw’s journey from birthing tool to pocketed talisman reconfigures the value of absence itself, a Conceptual Repricing paid for with the forever-lost jasmine. No final-paragraph thesis—just the wet-gasp drop—lets resonance linger. Complexity is honored; no moral is preached.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person POV stays latched to Mira’s haptic perceptual signature—“trembling calm,” fingertip coastlines, heat of first breath—without ever slipping into omniscient commentary. Rhythm compresses under pressure (“tears blurred the loupe”) then elongates with the final drip, mirroring her emotional cadence. No head-hop; Horace’s thoughts remain opaque, seen only through Mira tactile lens. Distinctive syntax and selective sensory hierarchy satisfy the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: “spiraling outward like the panic in a delivery room” fuses metaphor and stakes in one stroke. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn; each sentence advances image or choice. One clause of slightly elevated diction (“commemorate safe arrival”) is earned by context. Closure image remains crystal—no figurative muddle touches the final drip.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: aromatherapist-turned-tactile-story-midwife meets water-clock horology, birthing clamp screw as time’s heartbeat. The inversion of “reading between lines” from scent to steel feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric compression taught early and paid off at closure without gimmickry. Not quite a 9 only because the midwife-insert premise, while transformed, is not wholly unprecedented.</comment>
