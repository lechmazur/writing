<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Porous, tidal chronicler’s choices (offering cicada, shifting lantern) directly shape the turning point; interiority skews lyrical but always grounds in embodied sensation—salt on lips, pulse of stone.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural closure: patterned moonlight→fracture→texture reweights reconciliation stakes with earned silt-layer cost; no causality misstep.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Grotto’s limestone ribs act as micro-setting; tide and phosphorescence constrain footing and time, recharging the final panoramic moment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Pause-as-creature metaphor tightens emotional bandwidth one meaningful turn: argument→quiet co-observation→re-tidal shift with tangible cost of eighteen-year cicada patience.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Transition-period rhetoric unifies theme via silt-layer metaphor; closure image rerenders time as tactile pay-all, not abstract thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Vintage marine diction and rhythmic tide-cadence hold under daughter’s entry; no lexical slippage at climax.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Salt-line propulsion; zero loops; compact metaphors (jade heart, lunar fracture) enrich without muddle.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Silt-time recalibration feels fresh; sideways truth-telling rescues familiar estrangement trope through tidal specificity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Observer-turned-initiator at pool and cliff rim; her every lantern tilt and cicada offering directly tighten reconciliation stakes.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Jade cicada handled four times—pocket pulse, ledge promise, apology-shaped exchange, shared heartbeat—evolves from memory token to covenant tool.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<comment>Every beat measured in patience (cicada 17-year metaphor), redefining urgency from calendar to sediment; fundamental to tactic shift.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Warm observation enables noticing brittle-star diagram, constraining how they witness pain together; deduction for fewer trade-off moments.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Foreseeing expressed via sideways watching directly triggers offer of cicada, crystallizing future breakfast/joke micro-moments; unswappable pivot.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<comment>“Listen sideways” reframes question pool-side rather than daughter-in-law; shapes how chronicler initiates contact and reopens conversation late in scene.</question>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Grotto’s tide rise constrains standing spots and clock; ritual cradle of starlight turns to erasing footprints, affecting departure path.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Pause across conversation is dramatized as living creature; timeline remains clear but less enforced by external countdown, small cap.</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Tone modulates from brittle-star resilience to shared dawn luminosity, coherent but subtle; mid-chart since not foregrounded.
