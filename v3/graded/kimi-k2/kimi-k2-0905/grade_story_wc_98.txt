<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Calyx’s interiority is vivid—her hesitation over the seed is embodied in the copper taste and the hush before rain—but the loss of her teacher’s name is told more than dramatized, softening the cost at the pivotal beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The dream-entry, seed-planting, and communal braid form a clean causal chain; the final image of children weaving doubt into the fissure delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration with visible price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Orchid fibers, vanilla lattice, and basalt underfoot are selective, sensuous anchors; the ridge itself becomes a living constraint that must be mended, charging the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The single dominant stake—ridge survival versus memory loss—tightens with each beat; the monochrome canyon forces a trade-off that forecloses any easy victory.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the dragon-back flower and the silver leaf’s injunction: memory survives only if guarded with acknowledged doubt, a resonance that lands wordlessly in the final braid.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lush yet disciplined, modulating from pre-monsoon hush to dream-orchid synesthesia; compression like “luminous doubt” and “coppery ink” stays within Calyx’s perceptual lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; occasional stacked metaphors (“dragon’s back… overlapping generations”) risk overwriting yet serve the dream logic and never stall momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The fusion of cartography, dream botany, and collective memory feels inevitable; the conceit that doubt can stitch land is fresh, risky, and fully committed to its implications.</comment>
