<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The poet’s interior contradiction—yearning to finish the chord yet choosing to let it hover—peaks when he presses the torn feather into sand and speaks the first line aloud; the embodied cost is the poem he now must carry unfinished. His “warmly attentive” tending is shown through concrete micro-choices (tuning the zither string, gifting the feather) that foreclose the option of solitary completion. The chipped-tooth smile and lunar absence crystallize his acceptance of fracture as beauty’s doorway. All beats grow from his stance; no stock labels or epiphanies intrude.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the spiral dissolves yet the chord remains humming—an undeniable conceptual cost that reweights the premise “incomplete is the only doorway.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each fragment (feather, shell, soldier) layers density until the final braid of kite-tail sunrise crystallizes the reconfiguration. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“ankle-deep in the cobalt lagoon”); no teleporting props or amnesia. The only minor drag is the kite’s late re-entry, a coincidence that complicates rather than resolves, so the cost still reads.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The cobalt lagoon, torn feather, and cracked zither function as micro-setting that directly constrain choices: the wet sand receives the spiral, the feather’s barbs catch light only at fractures, the broken third string buzzes until sleeve-fiber retunes it. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—poet notices dawn-violet in barbs, not tourist vistas. Weather (post-storm) deepens the “wounded horizon” and justifies the fragment-strewn tideline. Spatial choreography is flawless: footsteps approach, they sit opposite, spiral is walked outward, tide erases.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“discover beauty in the incomplete”—is signaled in paragraph 6 and tightens when the poet renounces finishing the chord, instead weaving discord into a loom of almost. The kite’s snapped string and the zither’s buzz are external pressures that force the joint improvisation; each note plucked narrows the poet’s solitary option. Cost is visible: the poem stays unfinished, the feather relinquished, the spiral dissolved. One meaningful deepening suffices; no reversal is required under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the accretion of broken fragments rather than any statement; the final sand-erased sentence reweights prior images without moralizing. The torn feather, chipped tooth, and frayed kite-tail braid into a non-literal answer: incompleteness is not deficit but aperture. Subtext resides in gesture—gifting the feather equals accepting lunar fracture in himself and the world. No thematic echo or platitude intrudes; resonance is built from concrete particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyric compression is taught early (“burnished hush”) and sustained without head-hopping; perceptual signature is poet-specific—reflections erased by ripples, syllables as tiny mirrors. Syntax mirrors emotional cadence: long breath-like sentences build the spiral, then shorten at the woman’s laugh. Diction stays within plausible lexicon yet achieves freshness (“seam pulled loose by the storm”). No filter-verb stacks or register drift; the final sand-erasure line is rhythmic, propulsive, inevitable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative language is selective and paid off—“torn net that still holds fish” refracts back to the feather’s fractured barbs. No mixed metaphors; physical logic holds (wet sand receives spiral, tide erases). Information density is high: one sentence often does three jobs (sets body, object, metaphor). Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; paragraph cuts are purposeful.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of drake feather + cracked zither + snapped kite string creates a fresh acoustic-spatial metaphor for artistic collaboration. Risk is taken by eschewing plot for accumulative texture, yet the closure remains legible. Specificity anchors universals: the chipped tooth, the three-colored braid, the sewing-pin tin. While “artist at shoreline” is familiar, the treatment transforms it through tactile fractals and joint music-making.</comment>
