<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Motive crystallizes late (“inheritance… dark archive”) as Mira moves from passive recording to submission; the final becoming-corridor beat shows change but feels abstract—cost is poetic rather than embodied. Interiority stays vivid, yet decisive choices are swallowed by the setting’s dream logic.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise—Mira’s absorption into the architecture reconfigures the world as a living camera. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern taught by ivy and negatives pays off in the last frame with felt conceptual cost (“empty room that somehow breathed”).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>ivy-veiled passage negatives constrain movement and meaning: walls narrow, strips touch her face, shutter mechanism revealed; micro-setting as living camera charges final image perfectly. Sensory economy favors moss, dripping, staining glass.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</question><comment>Dominant stake—“mapping legacy’s burden”—escalates from mere curiosity to existential incorporation. Tightening occurs when strips reveal herself as child; this deepens cost but agency remains metaphoric rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</question><comment>Novel image of building-as-camera organically expresses theme of inheritance and guilt; refrain of negatives and dreams reweights “legacy’s burden” without sermon. Final heartbeat-echo achieves resonant ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Distinct lyric texture: “blackened edges fluttered like moth wings”, “stone inhaling” gives perceptual signature. Compression and elision taught early by ellipsis and reversal; voice modulates cleanly across shards.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Rich yet controlled: no redundant loops, metaphors serve camera/negative motif. Highest-pressure beats retain clarity—“fresh film negative strip dangling” final image lands clean. Only fractional slip is lyrical density near climax, but momentum preserved.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</question>
<comment>Architecture-as-camera concept felt inevitable after early ivy and shutter hints; negatives-as-time-strip fresh and particular. Slight derivative echo of “haunted university” frame keeps from perfect 9.</comment>
