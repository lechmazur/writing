<comment>Lira’s interiority is consistent and the sacrifice is legible; a bit more bodily specificity at the swallowing moment would deepen embodied cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Closure is a crystallized RR—the chrysalis beat reweights purpose while keeping cost unmistakable; the contraction motif links causally from coin spiral to waveform fate.</comment>

<comment>Observatory as micro-setting constrains the final action; amber panes and brass rail are tactile and return to charge the chrysalis image.</comment>

<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Pressure tightens once when the coins demand personal sacrifice, raising the cost of transcendence; stellar doubt versus purpose remains the one coherent stake.</comment>

<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from collapse-as-creation; “antenna the cosmos needed” reweights prior material without moralizing, keeping ambiguity honest.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Distinct lyric rhythm is sustained; “ambered observatory,” “hiss arrange itself,” and coin-cold throat are texture-driven; no leakage or drift.</comment>

<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet readable; occasional abstract stacks (“wavelength align with purpose if she could distill”) skim the edge but never cloud climax clarity.</comment>

<comment>Fresh post-heat-death lighthouse premise, backward prophecy mechanic, and coin-sacrifice closure crystallize a singular vision with high risk well-integrated.</comment>
