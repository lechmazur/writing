<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is active from the first beat, weaving six-month deadline, trunk-split green pulse, and treaty desire into each micro-choice; copper-wire implants track cost on every page, culminating in a renunciation that loses self-interest but secures the orchard’s voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The inferred Causal lens holds through because/therefore linkages: diagnose-deadline → remodel → treaty broadcast; closure is a Decisive Change—Mara signs over pulse and name, rendering death sentence into permission that the orchard now inherits.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The oaks, copper filigree, and pulsing stone pillars detail every beat; wire-wrapped boughs act as micro-setting that constrains installation and hammers the final image’s frequency. Specificity anchors the echo.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The six-month clock fumes across every later afternoon; each wired graft ratchets stakes while bat claws closing the circuit prove the treaty’s test. Causal tightening intact under Causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The orchard temple becomes a gently systematic plea for co-evolution, enacted through tethering species in shared heartbeat. The final hum reframes humans from owners to freelancers—no sermon, only resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited locked tight; voice treads between scientific lyric and brazen calm. Rhythm varies with bat-wing hush and stone-bell vibration; syntax mirrors wire-copper pulse without head-hop.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Imagery (“granite breathe like a slow lung”) carries specific embodied weight; no loops, variation natural, propulsion high despite lyric texture. Precision costs minor denseness only in one ornate tree line.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Fuses eco-installation, interspecies diplomacy, and dying-caretaker frame into a fresh 600-word arc. Risky synthesis feels inevitable once the wire sinks, charging the closure beat.</comment>
<question>9 A</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Every choice—ladder climb, wire threading, diary signing—alters tactics and closes one path; removal breaks the ending pulse that gifts her pulse to the orchard.</comment>
<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Diary waits open then torn page becomes final conductor; handled twice with reweighted meaning, though could have constrained an early beat tighter.</comment>
<question>9 C</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Copper-branch lattice shapes every graft decision; temple angle dictates tension. Not mere theme but active circuitry that redraws prayer protocol.</comment>
<question>9 D</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>“Gently systematic” governs labeling index cards an hour before tremor: it costs precision when her hands fail to steady, visible trade-off mid-arc.</comment>
<question>9 E</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Remodeling seven branches remakes the wounded tree and finalizes the broadcast network; swap becomes impossible without breaking stakes and treaty charge.</comment>
<question>9 F</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Copper’s micro-current equal to heartbeat is signaled, engineered, narrated again when bat sparks appear; its mechanics matter to frequency test.</comment>
<question>9 G</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Temple orchard’s living stone pillars create both audience and megaphone; each pillar’s resonance hammers constraints, altering choice list from soil depth to pulse sharing.</comment>
<question>9 H</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Six-month clock colors every pruning decision; twilight/guest arrival rhythms tighten, though timeline could mark a more granular beat—enough to tweak tactics.</comment>
<question>9 I</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Interspecies treaty desire drives the remodelling, tested when tourist children taste citrus-mint leaves; conflicted want vs anatomical sacrifice is dramatized, not labeled.</comment>
<question>9 J</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Brazen calm surges under lyre-like copper hum; it wavers once as tremor, then resolidifies in signature final walk, charging the orchard’s first autonomous beat.
