<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lina’s interiority is vivid—her held breath crystallizing into needles, the taste of iron, the memory of her brother’s fall—yet the relationship with Master Jomei remains largely off-stage, so status dynamics and secondary pressure are muted. The earned shift from terror to release is credible and embodied, but the mentor’s function is more symbolic than crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The causal spine is clean: each stroke of the rune tightens the breath-clock, the kettle’s plume triggers the inversion risk, and the final click releases both breath and grief. Closure is a decisive reconfiguration—scars become airborne stories—paid for by the snapped quill and the platform’s relieved rise.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The floating rock, tatami circle, and storm-stacked sky are rendered with tactile specificity; the kettle’s mirrored surface and bouncing raindrops constrain posture and timing. The environment is not mere backdrop—it actively shapes the breath-hold ritual and final exhalation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—transforming scars into stories under mortal pressure—escalates with each crystallized breath; the kettle’s plume is a live fuse that narrows options to succeed or repeat her brother’s fall. The cost is visceral: lungs pierced by internal needles, quill snapped, platform rising as if relieved of a corpse-weight.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through image rather than assertion: crystallized grief becomes luminous sentences that orbit then dissolve into story. The final spiral-rune offers a resonant, non-literal answer—stories, unlike bodies, learn to fly—without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with rhythmic control under pressure (“storm clouds stacked above like bruised shelves”). Perceptual signature is consistent—Lina’s synesthetic noticing of taste, sound, and texture—without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers sensory detail and stakes (“rain striking the platform so hard that individual drops bounced knee-high”). No loops, no mixed metaphors, no filter-verb clutter—only purposeful compression that accelerates toward the click of closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The fusion of calligraphy, breath-magic, and grief ritual feels fresh; the floating rock tea-ceremony is a specific cultural invention rather than generic fantasy. The inversion of the childhood superstition into deliberate revision is a non-obvious synthesis that lands with earned inevitability.</comment>
