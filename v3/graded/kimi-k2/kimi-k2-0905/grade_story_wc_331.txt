<comment>Ms. Penumbra’s inner contradiction—sane order vs eccentric quest—drives every micro-choice; her silence when the poet’s hand passes through her space is an embodied cost that earns the final reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Hyperbolic shelves bend story-space causally; each 179° step tightens options toward the final fold where narrative gravity crystallizes meaning. Closure lands as Charged Poise with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The scarf’s silk threads glow with alien-sun weight; its archival warmth constrains every tactical move between curved shelves, charging the final Möbius-strip image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Quest to reach pre-word stories escalates through dimensional pressure; each hyperbolic turn raises the conceptual cost of linear time, culminating in story-gravity that forecloses escape.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the tension between order and chaos folds; the ending’s reconfiguration—“stories live everywhere and nowhere”—offers no tidy moral, only charged silence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Sanely eccentric interiority reads as lived spare-particularity; diction tilts with hyperbolic curvature, rhythmic control never breaking even under alien-sun pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet transparent; no loops, every sentence multi-tasks—equation, metaphor, action—without figurative muddle in the final fold.</comment>

<comment>Fresh synthesis of librarian-as-cosmic-cartographer feels inevitable; the dimensional scarf and hyperbolic geometry are irreplaceable tools that charge the closure image.</comment>
