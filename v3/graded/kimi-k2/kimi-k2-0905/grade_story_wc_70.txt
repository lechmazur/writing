<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her compulsion to “preserve wonder in routine” drives every micro-choice. The involuntary-truth curse forces a visible cost when she must lie to rekindle the hive. One POV, one on-page character—no relationship crucible required. The earned renunciation (leaving the gate open) crystallizes her arc with felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the lie “There is no wonder left” triggers the lightning strike that revives the hive and re-weights the tower’s purpose. Causal lens holds: each beat (riddle → lie → bolt → open gate) follows because/therefore logic. Orientation is immediate; no disorientation debt. The final image of the unlatched gate and free matchbox carries undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The tower’s copper cones, cooling ozone, and melted wax wings are rendered in selective, sensory detail that constrains Mara’s choices. The “nectar dusk” hue reappears in the wax puddles and final sky, charging the closure. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions. Environment actively shapes tactics—climbing the dark stairs, pressing palms to live copper.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve wonder—tightens when the hive’s death threatens to make her post ordinary. The riddle escalates pressure by demanding a lie from a truth-cursed keeper. The lightning strike reanimates the hive but at the price of breaking her lifelong honesty. Cost is visible: coins orbit her, keys levitate, and she leaves the toll unpaid forever.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: wonder survives only through deliberate, sacrificial artifice. The lie that “there is no wonder left” paradoxically rekindles it, re-pricing honesty itself. No moralizing; the final image of the open gate and free matchbox invites readers to perpetuate the cycle. Subtext hums in every charged object—matchbox, coins, wax.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lush yet precise, with a rhythmic pulse that mirrors the tower’s hum. Sensory diction (“ozone,” “lacquer,” “proboscis”) stays within Mara’s perceptual range. No head-hopping; single POV is rock-solid. Compression and elision (“the boy vanished into the gloom”) are purposeful and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is propulsive, each sentence advancing image or stakes. Figurative language is selective and coherent—“copper cones bristled like petrified sunflowers” charges the final lightning harvest. No loops or scaffold; no mixed metaphors. Rhythm modulates with tension, accelerating up the stairs, then crystallizing in the final hush.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The fusion of beekeeping, lightning harvesting, and truth-curse feels inevitable yet wholly fresh. Tropes (post-apocalyptic blackout, magical riddle) are transformed through tactile specificity and emotional cost. The matchbox-as-queen’s-legacy reprises with reweighted meaning, not gimmickry. Risk-taking (lying to save wonder) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
