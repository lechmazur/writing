<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—refusal to believe yet desperate need for new calculus—is embodied in the tooth and her visceral taste of chalk/thunder. Micro-choice of kneeling to swallow the constellation map shows her re-weighting; no diagnostic speak. The only cap is a hairline lack of visible physical cost at closure—garden re-weaves, villagers chat, but we feel her future work without seeing it bruise her.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a crystalline RR: the constellation map replaced by her own fractured stars, tooth set into jaw-symbol of necessary crookedness. Cost arrives in the garden’s spine-bone sundial frozen at her wrong-hour verdict—she can’t unsay death. Lens is accumulative lyric deepening that tightens stakes across every beat to final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Secret garden not décor: briar gates open from bone pavers she herself aligned, vertebra sundial time-freezing her verdict—live constraint. Micro-objects (hedge, marrow bench, dew-drinking cloak) push her to the tooth-map acceptance. Environment shapes final stance, qualifies for high band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake is Elara’s need to forgive her lethal mis-ID and still protect village love—stakes tighten because the baby she declared dead has returned loved through the changeling. Each beat raises cost: recognition (I named the corpse), horror (the fraud fed town all winter), choice (insert tooth, accept fracture). Escalation under accumulative lens lands.</question>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Mistake-honoring theme emerges via specific reconfiguration: carved yew log nourishes pear trees, grief becomes kindness, tooth becomes jewel. Final line (“a lantern in the ribs of the world”) resonates non-literally; no tidy moral overrides earned cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person close stays tethered to Elara’s sensorium—mint bruised, hem sodden—avoiding head-hop. Distinct perceptual signature: “nose full of iron” and “chalk and thunder” taste. Patterned lyric elision taught early via hedge “humming nostalgic innovation”, paid off in dawn gossip.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>High-density poetry never dulls propulsion—“tooth against her lips, tasting chalk and thunder” does three jobs in thirteen syllables. Occasional elevated turns (“nurtured the village through a hungry winter”) risk purple but serve incantatory closure tone; no causal breaks.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis lifts changeling folklore into adult ethical crucible: substitution as caregiving lie, bone-setting as metaphor for healing narrative fractures. Inevitable end: every specific wrong she named blooms brighter because irretrievable—new myth, not trope rehash.</comment>
