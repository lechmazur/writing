<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority is embodied and particular; Mira’s bruised knees and salt tears feel lived. Contradictory impulses—flight vs. the temple’s call—surface in micro-moments. Renunciation of the vial lands with felt, physical cost. Minor slip: one near-therapy-speak phrase (“overrode her own instinct”) flirts with abstraction but is outweighed by dense embodied choices under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because she feeds the organ her last tangible memory, therefore the temple stops sabotaging her radio. Final moment—offering the empty vial—is a Resonant Reconfiguration that visibly forecloses her childhood tether. One transition exists (search in the murals) but is legible. Closure carries unmistakable conceptual cost: she surrenders the very object that anchored her humanity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Flooded nave and coral organ are rendered through urgent sensory selectivity; pressure forces Mira to notice only what matters for survival. The temple’s architecture actively constrains her—tendrils grasping, pipes coughing silt—making environment a secondary antagonist rather than backdrop. Details remain precise without drift across the 800-word scope.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“send a signal before air is gone”—is legible early and escalates through tangible narrowing: air pocket shrinking, radio cords trapped, vial forfeited. One decisive tightening occurs when Mira uncorks the lilac; cost is both immediate (loss of last Earth-scent) and persistent (organ now broadcasts her memories in her absence). Agency drives all turns; no coincidences resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>Theme—“solitude can be rewired into communal signal”—emerges from specific choice to trade private memory for collective listening. Final underwater aria reprints the hush as shared memory without didacticism. Subtle resonance lingers: sailors dreaming of lilacs they have never smelled. Complexity accepted; no easy moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><question>9.2</question><grade>Distinct third-person lyric voice tightens with pressure, diction rising into liturgical elevation at climax (“cathedral-wide resonance”) then exhaling in soft bubbles. Control of compression is exemplary: no drift in psychic distance. Each sensory note is filtered through Mira’s cartographer’s eye. No head-hopping; voice sustains across the mosaic shimmer of the ending.</comment>

<question>7</question><question>8.9</question><grade>Prose is muscular yet musical, avoiding loops or filler. Each sentence either advances plot or deepens atmosphere; no scaffold sentences. Metaphor vehicles (“stone tendrils,” “coral pipes coughing plankton”) remain internally consistent. Tiny redundancy—“gathered hush” appears thrice—but rhythm under pressure justifies repetition as motif rather than loop.</comment>

<question>8</question><question>9.3</question><grade>Underwater temple as distressed sentient organ is fresh; coupling signal transmission with scent-memory is original synthesis rather than quirky gimmick. Lilac scent repurposed from keepsake to carrier wave transforms mundane perfume into narrative engine. Feels inevitable in hindsight: the temple’s lonely architecture yearning for remembered fragrance. No derivative echo of existing stories.</comment>
