<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The odd historian is fully realized via embodied micro-choices (pressing ear to concrete, spreading fragment) and the final renunciation of solitude carries a visible closure cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure satisfies the Decisive Change with felt cost: the blank tapestry is a Conceptual Repricing that reweights meaning; infer Situational lens under earned endurance. No orientation loss.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Silos, tapestry, and “bronze quiet” anchor space and mood; the concrete wall defines the final axis turn. Some ornamental texture, but tight enough for 8+ without muddle.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Tracks the historian’s growing cost: probing diaries tightens stakes; the axis tilt realigns silos continent-wide. Escalation is coherent and narrows final options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Central question—what walls remember—emerges from concrete to closure. No thematic preaching; final emptiness reframes imagination itself as a felt cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><grade>Distinct sensory attention/filter (“soot-flecked” ink, future tilt) aligns with historic POV; compressed lyric rhythm under pressure; no head-hop.</grade>

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero drift or loops; image density sustains momentum (“dragons lifting the cylinder of night”). Final blank tapestry lines read clean without scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Risky fusion of post-apocalyptic archive + medieval tapestry reshapes the silo into world-pivot axis. Transformation inevitable, choice-driven, charged quiet.</comment>
