<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The cartomancer’s interior contradiction—needing to understand collapse while renouncing profit—remains abstract; her only embodied choice is walking the grid barefoot, a gesture that never costs her anything. The “inherited mystery” is declared, not dramatized, so the final sealing of the tin feels predetermined rather than paid for. Still, her perceptual signature (ink-stained fingers, rain as coin-wallets) keeps her from stock type.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the fractal loft-map reveals infinite regress of exits, reweighting the premise that measurement can arrest forgetting. Causality holds under Accumulative/Textural lens—each added card-layer tightens density until the sigil repeats. The grid-footprints are visible cost, but the story withholds any concrete consequence she suffers for seeing the pattern; the price is conceptual, not felt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The rain-beaded skylight loft functions as micro-setting: its camera-obscura projection literally overlays the card grid with inverted streetlights, charging the final image. Weather (rain → mist → dawn) tracks scene clock and mirrors softening pressure. Spatial choreography is clean—tape, cards, footprints remain accounted for. The reclaimed-oak floorboards and tin coffee can ground the space in tactile post-crash salvage.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—map cultural collapse before witnesses vanish—signals early and tightens through pattern repetition: the leveraged-debt sigil recurs in every quadrant, foreclosing the hope of escape. Escalation is textural: density of cards and footprints increases until meaning regresses infinitely. No external antagonist is needed; the fractal itself becomes the irreversible constraint. Cost is conceptual (infinite exits = none), but lacks visceral bite.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly: quantification (crypto ledgers, Cartesian grid) cannot salvage meaning once collective memory is leveraged to death. The repeating sigil of debt reframes tarot from destiny to financial derivative, a fresh angle. No moralizing—final image of sealed tin + footprints leaves resonance without thesis. The grandmother wartime echo is under-used, keeping thematic weight on finance rather than intergenerational transmission.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tightly filtered through the cartomancer’s perceptual bias: raindrops as coins, cards as circuit traces. Syntax lengthens under mystic cadence then snaps with tape-retract “vault” echo, mirroring closure. No dialogue, so voice carries all texture; diction (“ghost protocol,” “cultural barometrics”) remains within her self-taught lexicon. Occasional elevated phrases (“secular relic promising dimension”) flirt with register drift but stay purposeful.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; sentences layer image and concept without paraphrase loops. Mixed metaphors are rare—“circuit diagram drawn by mystics” is precise. Filter verbs appear but serve lyric compression. Final third keeps clarity: “infinite regression of exits” crystallizes stakes without figurative muddle. One scaffold spot—“she had once read futures… vanished like smoke”—restates prior info, but minor.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fusion of tarot, crypto-collapse, and Cartesian mapping feels inevitable and fresh; no template plot matches this synthesis. The fractal loft as camera obscura is a risk that heightens thematic coherence. Transformation test fails—story is inseparable from its specifics. Risk distinction warranted: +0.3 for formal gamble that pays off in closure image.</comment>
