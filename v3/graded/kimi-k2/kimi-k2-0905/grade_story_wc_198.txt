<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The saxophonist’s interiority is vivid and embodied—“his cracked shoes,” “throat raw”—and his motivation to keep death unnamed powers every breath he plays. Micro-choice after micro-choice—altered fingering, the copper-tasting chord, erasing his own final note—charts a clear hierarchy of values. The only thing missing is interior contradiction inside a single beat; every impulse aligns toward the same goal, so complexity peaks at 8.5 instead of 9+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands via Earned Stasis: he refuses the prophecy’s last consonant, paying with “a final necklace of dewdrops” each holding distorted selves. The Accumulative lens holds—each musical layering reweights the dominant stake until silence itself swells to cost. Every loop forecloses an option; no causal thread breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fog, glass, dew, and limestone are never catalogued; they constrain movement—light fragments across shoes, reeds flutter against moss—charging the earned silence of the final image. The greenhouse shards “vibrate in sympathetic tuning,” making the built environment an instrumental extension; without this constraint the climax would unravel.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The single dominant stake—“to hush a prophecy spoken in code”—pushes through one continuous crescendo: each note narrows fate’s window until the diminished chord forces retreat. The cost is visceral (raw throat, dew-cooled brass), but because the danger is metaphysical rather than tangible, the price feels slightly abstract compared to, say, a broken limb—hence 8.7.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prophecy, silence, and memory refract without once stating a moral; the theme emerges from brass, breath, and fractured light. The final image—distorted reflections “none exactly the man he is”—reconfigures the reader’s understanding of identity itself. A resonant, non-literal answer scored cleanly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The voice is lush yet taut: “dewdrops form” repeated like heartbeat, syntax lengthening then snapping into single-word releases. POV distance never slips; every perception is filtered through lungs and fingertips. Compression and lyrical pattern are taught in the first paragraph and pay off at the final breath.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sensory density is high, yet information stays clear—no mixed metaphors muddle causality. Minor loop of “dewdrops form” appears three times, always reweighted by next clause, so penalty is minimal. Closure remains crystalline despite the ornament.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</question>
<comment>The conceit of a musician literally playing death into silence is fresh, yet relies on mythic archetype; the risk lies in lyric over-compression, which heightens rather than obscures stakes. Specific detail—1943 red ball, telegram—personalizes the trope, scoring high differentiation.</comment>
