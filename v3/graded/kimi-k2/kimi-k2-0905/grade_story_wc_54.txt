<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Alya’s interior contradiction—stoic engineer vs. longing idealist—peaks in the final quiet smile tasting brass; micro-choice after micro-choice arcs from skeptic re-routing glycol arcs to a visible cost pocketing the “proof” sextant shard. Character shift is earned but kept muted—stoicism flattens emotion to a single key, limiting felt contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: terminal’s heartbeat is restored, departing crowd gone, cost etched into the single coin that “spins longer than physics politely allows.” Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, the escalating density of rust becoming vermillion and glycol becoming pulse reweights the “unsolvable equations” toward reclaimed wonder. Persistent price is the quiet absence of any human audience—hope lives, but loneliness remains.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The terminal’s rust cathedral and brass birds function as extensions of Alya’s body, constraining every weld and route decision. Dust-coated tiles under the sextant’s shadow reconfigure into navigational grid—setting micro-embodied, culminating in the kinetic sculpture stirring into “a heartbeat.” Concrete, sensuous world-building never resorts to postcard list.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>A single dominant, escalating stake: redeem a bankrupt future through hydraulics. Glycol flow rising from 0 psi to functional pressure is tracked beat-by-beat; final tightening occurs when the coin refuses to fall—an elegant micro turn. Cost is palpable in the vacuumed terminal, yet the “unsolvable” city remains outside scope, muting ultimate stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Theme emerges as the reclamation of failure into usable wonder, never moralized. Spiral pictograph ➔ sextant shard ➔ spinning coin trace a subtle motif of recursion: exits become entrances. Final image of walking inward, sextant warm, reframes the maze as promise not obstacle—earned resonance without tidy moral.</question>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Third-person lens holds throughout with consistent stoic, tactile register. Sentence rhythm mirrors hydraulic pulse: short clauses during torch sparks elongate to soaring metaphors when brass wings beat. Voice loses distinctiveness only in occasional elevated coinages—“carnivalescent,” “orbiting grief”—that brush against Alya’s grounded persona.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High information density lines carry scent, color, torque—“rust had landscaped every surface into Martian vermillion.” One mild loop: “pressure equals possibility” echoes its earlier equation without new inflection. Otherwise zero scaffold or synonym churn; final image crystallizes as water arcs, coin balances, terminal breathes.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Synthesis of steampunk salvage and spaceport elegy feels fresh, not aesthetic pastiche. The reclamation equation “Hope = (Flow × Heat)/Time³” is an original, character-authored formula rather than a borrowed slogan. Every trope reclaimed—abandoned carnival, kinetic birds—grows organically from Alya’s engineered worldview; ending reprise of same material with new weight seals inevitability.</comment>
