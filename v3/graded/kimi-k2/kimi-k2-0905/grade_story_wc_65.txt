<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The cartographer’s motive—trading memory to become the constraint itself—lands with visceral cost; memory-for-memory trade off the body (toe whitening) reads as concrete risk. Internal contradiction is shown when surrendering to blankness collides with need to ‘prevail’. Renunciation final choice earns its loss via prior beats (forgetting north foreshadows final loss of name).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure satisfies Resonant Reconfiguration: body folds into page, visible absence (blank ice) now legible as the future itself. Drive lens holds as Accumulative/Textural—patterned descent toward zero self. Loss trade-offs tighten across beats; final door sketched mid-air crystallizes the earned stasis.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Obsidian spire & frozen lake provide micro-setting that shapes tactics (spiral absorbs reflection) and charges the ending image (lake surface remains ‘perfect’ future). Each prop—feather thirsting warmth, stone drinking reflection—is tactile constraint re-used at peak. Spatial mapping of ascent/descent remains coherent across beats.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake (only one future, dawn ticking) escalates through deliberate surrender of warmth → identity → memory. Each divestment narrows options and accumulates cost visible on skin. Constraint itself becomes agency; no external coincidence intrudes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme grows from ‘ignorance as deliberate clearing’ to ‘blank page becomes future’ without moralizing. Ending image (door drawn mid-air, lake reflecting unnamed stars) reweights prior motifs and refuses tidy closure. Resonance sourced from embodied sacrifice rather than abstract statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Voice modulates from precise exterior observation to lyric density at summit, never drifting into exposition. Rhythm matches ascent urgency (short, breath-close clauses), then elongates at surrender. Compression devices—“folding, not falling”—taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Few minor overlaps (“obsidian”, “kingfisher”) but each serves atmospheric refrain not paraphrase loops. Density high; no figurative contradiction at crisis beats. Syntax varied; paragraphs scale to heartbeat intensity. No scaffolding sentences or synonyms clutter final third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Transformation trope is reimagined into constraint as creative substrate—unfamiliar synthesis. Specific choices (trading north for feather, memory for modeling) personalize generic motif. Fresh integration of science-tinged language with lyric frost metaphor feels genre-elevating yet grounded.</comment>
