<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira’s curiosity is concrete—she polishes the goggles, traces the cipher, hums the staff—each micro-choice grows from the trait and alters her path. The final renunciation of servitude is earned by these visible acts, and the goggles-as-promise supplies felt cost. Interiority stays specific; no label-speak. Just under the 9 gate because the duke’s son and stoker appear only as cameos, so status crucible is thin.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: Lira stays below, root and branch expanded, servitude foreclosed. The map, diary, seed, and goggles chain causally; every stair descent is motivated by the prior decipher. Cost is legible in the final image—“watering the future with melted ice.” Lens is Causal throughout; no ambiguity at exit.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Ice-spire, brass elevator, hothouse apricot—each setting piece constrains action: cold drives her downward, heat lets the seed live. The goggles act as micro-setting, refracting light to teach the cipher. Spatial track is immaculate; we never lose her body in the shaft or greenhouse. Environment directly charges the final image of roots in volcanic ash.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“know why he smiled”/carry joy outward—tightens when the diary map replaces mere curiosity with actionable descent. The seed-planting is the decisive trade-off: she forfeits upward mobility for subterranean nurture. Pressure escalates floor by floor; each encounter costs time and objects (thimble, ash). Price is visible and persistent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of smuggled joy emerges from apricot-in-winter, encrypted music, and the captain’s wager; no character sermonizes. The final laugh in scattered light reweights grief into germination without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: will the tree survive? Complexity is embraced—sorrow and delight coexist in the same stained mouth-spiral. Resonance is earned, not asserted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays latched to Lira’s sensory filter; perceptual signature is consistent—bergamot, brass chill, apricot glow. Syntax flexes with pressure: longer lyrical coils in elevator, clipped fragments during lock-pick. No head-hop; duke’s son and stoker remain externally seen. Voice-driven elision (“ghost of the airship captain”) is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with ascent/descent; no template cadence or synonym loops. Metaphors stay coherent—”molten sigh,” “soft apology”—and never stall causality. Information density is high: one sentence often does description, emotion, and world-rule. A single hairline slip—“optimistic punctuation mark”—leans toward writerly intrusion, keeping it under 9.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Frozen-spire + apricot hothouse + musical cipher is a fresh synthesis; none are generic tropes. The goggles-as-lens mechanic is replicable but here feels inevitable. Risk—lyric escalator mosaic—heightens meaning without obscuring clarity. Transformation test fails if you swap any core image; the piece would collapse.</comment>
