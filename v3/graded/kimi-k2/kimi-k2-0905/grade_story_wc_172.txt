<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses—guilt and compulsion to witness—drive every beat; the final swallow of the echo is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the echo nests inside him, foreclosing any return to prior amorality; the causal chain from dam to drought to egg to swallow is airtight.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Salt flat, egg, and storm form a micro-setting that constrains every choice; the crystalline map projected by lightning charges the final image with irreversible loss.</comment>

<comment>The conceit of birthing an extinct echo from engineered drought feels inevitable in hindsight; risk-taking with mythic compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
