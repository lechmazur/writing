<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Boy-self and adult-self are distinct but causally linked by the lens; interiority is resonant yet at times drifts into lyric summary without embodied contradiction. The “translator” identity is declared rather than dramatized in decisional beats, reducing pressure. The final transfer reads as earned ritual more than costly choice because earlier self is unaware, muting felt risk.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—images accrue and reweight meaning through recursion, culminating in an Earned Stasis of renunciation with visible absence (“absence weighs more”). Orientation is legible; time-bridge transition is taught early and closure pays off. Minor causality gap: painter’s heartbeat date is asserted retroactively without prior cue.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade>comment>Atmosphere is tactile—the swaying rope bridges, copper-salt air, “pigment-warm dusk”—all filtered through POV priorities. Lighthouse lens and canvas shards act as micro-settings constraining action. Spatial logic remains coherent despite metaphysical tilt. Market lanterns into spiral satisfy 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</comment>Central stake is “keep ghosts from drifting” vs. “return what we owe”; escalation occurs through denser recursion of shared past rather than narrowing options. Moment of transfer crystallizes cost—adult loses literal anchor object. However, stakes are emotional/spiritual only; tangible consequence on present world is opaque.</comment>

<question>5</question><strong>7.2</strong><comment>Emergent theme of stewardship through relinquishment is coherent and non-didactic. Subtext operates (“light remembers everyone” vs. “light by letting it go”) without summarizing. Final sentence “We keep the light by letting it go” flirts with thematic echo penalty but remains resonant image, not asserted axiom.</comment>

<question>6</question><strong>8.6</strong><comment>Lush second-person-inflected interiority feels singular, compressed yet legible. Syntax varies naturally; diction tilts toward lyric precision. Few overt filter verbs; sensory anchoring is vivid. No head-hopping; timeline holds despite time-slip.</comment>

<question>7</question><strong>8.7</strong><comment>Line-level craft is dense and propulsive; mixed metaphors (“lantern in the wind” vs. “hum with memory”) are minor. Rhythm accelerates during passage through canvas; no discernible loops or scaffold. One typo: “unfasten time” is accepted usage. Clarity under pressure remains high.</comment>

<question>8</question><strong>7.8</strong><comment>Premise of roof-top memory-market fused with ghost-ferrying translator is fresh synthesis. Lighthouse shard as joint bone across time reclaims familiar object. Avoids gimmickry; risk heightens stakes without losing coherence. Strong compression and lyric recursion distinguish it from “time travel” clichés.</comment>
