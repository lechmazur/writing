<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The pianist's interior contradictions are dramatized in embodied choices—she clutches the clock even though windings no longer move, then trades its frozen chime knowing it is her last talisman; the progression from mechanical clinging to conscious renunciation carries cost. Late arrival of on-page cost in the final exit prevents higher.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The final action—deliberately finishing the unresolved chord, stepping through film fog, and emerging with a ticking clock—delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration: before/after is legible and the cost (perpetual loop vs. mortal uncertainty) is clearly felt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Cloud-bonsai greenhouse, cracked clock face mirroring ceiling bars, reel-sprocket moonlight—these micro-settings are tactile and actuate story choices. Only slight drift in the final tiles keeps it from top band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The primary stake—will she remain in safe loops or re-enter real time?—receives one decisive tightening at the film platform scene, narrowing options. Cost is felt but the doubling of “on the platform” diffuses urgency.</question>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of time-as-composition emerges through objects and gestures, not statement; final “unplanned encore” crystallizes the idea that choice can still be music. One line of overt thematic naming (“she realized then that the film was not escape but rehearsal”) knocks it off a perfect 8.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Lyrical, tactile diction (“reluctant pigeons,” “silk scarf,” “cloud-roots”) is consistently character-filtered; non-standard punctuation (em-dashes for beats) serves rhythmic intent. No head-hopping, cadence teaches its own rules.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</question>
<comment>Every sentence does work: vivid specificity, layered metaphor, no scaffold; a few mixed vehicle risks (“blade of rose”) are absorbed by surrounding clarity. Final emergence reads cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</question>
<comment>Clock-as-talisman, film-can gateway, cloud-greenhouse are fresh juxtapositions rather than gimmicks; inversion of “unfinished movie scene” as literal portal feels inevitable once seeded. Derivative echoes of Borges/Calvino kept from top by sheer visibility.</comment>
