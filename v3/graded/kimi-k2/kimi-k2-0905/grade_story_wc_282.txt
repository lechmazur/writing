<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aera’s interiority is sharp and sensorily grounded; her decision to “become the voice” is anchored in concrete action. Her micro-choice to press the fossil to her sternum, collapse, and integrate the memory-node into her staff is earned by prior causality and carries visible body-cost. Inner contradiction (the fear of drowning in prior sorrow) is embodied in the final flotation image. Meets 9+ quick test on conflicting impulses in-scene and the climactic renunciation with cost.</question>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands on the page: fossil becomes “beating node,” Aera’s renunciation of prior weight, and the new auditory coastline—an Earned Stasis that forecloses the path of silence. Causal chain from leaf contact → cave-blinded → voice released → staff floats is legible. Orientation anchors at “turquoise hush… three winters ago” by word 12. No contradiction under Accumulative/Textural lens. Cost exact: she “collapses… lighter by the mass of one fear.”</question>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The staff floating “a finger’s breadth above ground” is environment-as-micro-setting constraining later navigation. Coastal cave details (salt-curtains, mineral floor “warm as mammal skin”) are selective and POV-filtered, constraining both footing and mood. Elm image at closure charges final meaning. No generic tourism; every detail is tactile and stakes-sensitive. Meets 9+ quick test.</question>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</question>
<comment>Dominant stake—transmit memory before ocean erasure—intensifies via the fossil’s inversion of the cave’s “emotion-heat” narrowing Aera’s options to speech or loss. One decisive tightening: she must surrender her body as vessel and pay collapse cost. Pressures stay coherent under Accumulative lens; no coincidences relieve tension. Closure crystallizes “rebirth” with felt acoustic pressure.</question>

<question>5</question><answer>9.5</answer>
<comment>Theme emerges from particulars: elm memories shade council fires and city-making, yet the story refuses to name the future. Subtext carries in gesture—the floating leaf as lighthouse “without fire.” Final image reweights silence vs witness as cost and consequence without moral statement. Achieves resonant ambiguity that invites rereading.</question>

<question>6</question>
<answer>9.4</answer>
<comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: “salt-curtains,” “ochre and violet” thermal glyphs, “lowing glaciers” in the throat. Syntax tilts, compresses, breathes under pressure; no cliché cadences or head-hopping. Elliptical lyric diction is internally consistent and teaches its pattern by word 25. Voice remains singular under peak stress.</question>

<question>7</question>
<answer>9.0</answer>
<comment>Sentences vary in rhythm and length, each carrying sensory + causal payload. Almost no scaffold; one minor softener (“colors draining into the leaf”) is offset by propulsion. Figurative language coheres—no contradictory vehicles. Final line earns its elevated diction by charged payoff. Meets 9+ quick test.</question>

<question>8</question>
<answer>9.3</answer>
<comment>Trope of dying Earth and last archivist is re-forged through emotional spelunking and auditory cartography “heat-mapping emotions.” Risky fusion of hard-science framing with mystical execution lands credibly. Closure—sound released as weather—offers a fresh reweighting of transmission-as-organism. Specific elm memory, not generic tree, anchors invention.</question>
