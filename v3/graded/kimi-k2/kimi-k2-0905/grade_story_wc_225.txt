<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Marek’s guilt-driven exile and chess-tutor identity are embodied in every beat—his trembling palms, the phantom king, the righting of the fallen piece. The internal contradiction between pride and remorse is dramatized through micro-choices (decoding stitches, walking the maze) that culminate in a credible renunciation of self-punishment. No stock phrasing; the voice is specific, predatory in its clarity. The cost—acceptance of unquantifiable loss—lands on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Marek’s righting of the king re-animates the village and re-weights his stance from exile to return. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—each image (tapestry, labyrinth, storm) layers density until the final gesture crystallizes meaning. Orientation is immediate; causality is held in the frozen-time conceit that pays off when his exhale disturbs the spell. Cost is legible in the single line: “the board is wider than the mistake.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The time-frozen village is not backdrop but pressure system: suspended loaves, mid-tag children, stormlight on platinum corridors. The fountain-maze and tapestry function as micro-settings that constrain choice—he must walk the mirrored corridors and decode the stitches to move forward. Sensory hierarchy is filtered through Marek’s chess-tutor eye: corridors glint like endgame diagonals, threads spell algebraic notation. Weather is held in perpetual lull until his acceptance births the thunder.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—self-forgiveness—tightens when the suicidal king sequence forces Marek to confront the cost of every sacrificed piece. One meaningful deepening: the realization that the labyrinth is mirror, not lock, collapses his puzzle-solving stance into witness. Agency is exercised in the deliberate footstep-by-footstep walk that separates grain from husk. The thunder’s arrival is earned, not coincidental.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: a suicidal king embroidered with care becomes the image of necessary vulnerability. Subtext operates in silence—the village’s frozen breath, the king lying on its side—rather than exposition. The final murmured lesson is earned through embodied struggle, not moralizing. Complexity is preserved: forgiveness is learning, not absolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited adheres to Marek’s perceptual signature: corridors “glint with stormlight,” threads “spell fragmentary notation.” No head-hopping; the weaver’s cottage is seen only as chess notation. Syntax mirrors chess cadence—clipped, predatory. Compression is purposeful: “fierce repose” condenses tournament calm into two words.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and stakes. No loops or scaffold. Metaphors are precise: “woven hush lay over every cobblestone like thick felt.” Rhythm modulates with pressure—short clauses under stress, longer sinuous lines during reflection. Final line anchors motif and stakes without redundancy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fusing chess notation, medieval tapestry, and time-fantasy into a single emotional crucible feels inevitable yet fresh. The suicidal king gambit as embroidered penance is a non-obvious synthesis. Risk—frozen-time conceit—heightens stakes without gimmickry. Transformation test: the story would collapse if the king were any other piece.</comment>
