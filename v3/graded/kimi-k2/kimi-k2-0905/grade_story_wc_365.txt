<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The sensory mapmaker’s collision of guilt with self-discovery unfolds in embodied, contradiction-riddled interiority; her copper-wire body and glass shard become tactile markers of complicity. Decisions—pressing the shard to the deck, swallowing the cube—forge causal beats that redirect every parallel path. Passivity briefly surfaces, but each beat builds to an earned renunciation that closes the path of denial with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Loom imagery taught early as environmental geometry reconfigures into causal mechanism at climax. Each shard flare tightens options (doorway, data cube) under a clear accumulative lens. Final thread collapse into single moral choice lands as earned Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise, stakes crystallized.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Cracked deck and broken skylight operate as micro-setting that channels vibrations, constrains balance, and guides the unseen doorway. Selective, urgent sensory detail (temperature, pulse) correlates with internal collapse. Specificity anchors the multiverse braid without world-dump.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—awareness versus complicity—escalates cyclically; each shard flare deepens cost, narrowing escape routes. The experimental drive reveal reweights prior commissions into weaponized guilt, forcing a renunciation that forecloses covert patronage.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Truth’s weight emerges from choices, never proclamations. Parallel bays refract complicity into physical pressure that crystallizes the theme in final cicada-glass silence. The note becomes resonant conceptual repricing—conceptual cost legible in copper wire’s tremor.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Vivid, compressed sensory bursts (“rusted dust tasting of fuel”) carry character-filtered perception without register drift. Rhythm accelerates under pressure and decelerates during loom pauses; no head-hopping or filter-verb mural. Control persists through lyric lattice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>High-density lines compress action and atmosphere—no scaffold loops; glass shard’s cicada pulse motif repeats purposefully. Dominant metaphor sustained without figurative muddle in peak beats. Read-aloud rhythm mirrors heartbeat escalation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fusing multiverse loom with sensory-memoir guilt offers a fresh angle on grief-as-navigation; cyclical shard pulse evolves from tool to judge without contrivance. Closure hinges on patented truth-weight conceit that becomes inevitable in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Early calibration of sensors becomes the ethical linchpin; every parallel encounter reprises her buried guilt with mounting pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>First humming signal, then blood-draw cut, then dark silent judge—three beats driving stakes and closure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Weaving literalizes as loom that redirects each imprisonment, tying stakes to every variant’s environment.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Cyclical shard flashes trigger spontaneous plan pivots, altering balance and tactical choices across beats.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Redirecting starlight into revelation is dramatized: reconfiguration of all future map commissions.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Parallel-bay mechanics taught early and repeatedly shape the only possible path to evidence.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Broken gantry, zero-g locker, and roofless vacuum platform each pressurize different choices and tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.3</grade>
<comment>Dawn’s arrival and moonlight pulses serve as lived clock, tightening urgency and altering lighting for the final shard flare.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Withheld-truth hunger propels every navigation and reveals itself as complicity with clear cost.</question>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Bruised-gold dawn and emerald flares modulate mood from abandoned loss to grave resolve.
