<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior depth is immersive with brass, dust, and ‘a cloud cry.’  Contradictory wants—release vs preservation—peaks during the filament-threading moment.  Choice to speak final truths and step into the kites is credibly costly.  Grandmother and mother add legacy but are felt rather than crowded on stage; no status drift.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the act of release reframes Earth’s memory and the sky’s witness. Lens: Accumulative/Textural; escalating density and final cadence tighten pressure. String snaps are causal countdowns; no off-stage leaps. Orientation held; ‘03:17’ and altitudes anchor early.</comment>

<comment>Sky gondola functions as both crucible and cradle, constraining motion; telescope and basket floor operate as micro-setting tools that charge the final gift. Senses narrow to weightless dust and cable pops under crisis; broader world sketched only through city lights. Enough to gate ≥7.0; no extra environmental squeeze needed.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</question>
<comment>One dominant stake—memorialize before the last wire fails—tightens when Mara threads the spool. Escalation: each pop of cable removes an option. Micro-choice to whisper and release memory kites demonstrates agency turning escalating threat into legacy trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</question>
<comment>Themes of memory-as-precipitation and empty-space-as-archive emerge organically from actions, not speeches. Final ‘dusty starlight’ reprices the sky’s emotional weight without moralizing. No explicit thesis; meaning accrues from cloud-emotion pairings and relinquishment image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</question>
<comment>Lyrid-prose texture—‘battered barrel like a signature on time itself’—signals a collective, time-scarred voice. Distinct diction (‘spooled wholeness’) persists through cable groans and weightlessness. No dialogue dilution; compression sustains rhythm under rising stakes.</comment>

<grade>8.5</question>
<comment>Rhythm breathes from long orchestral sentences to punchy fragments matching lurching gondola. Every image earns purpose; no metaphor undermines physics (dust galaxies, burnt-coffee regret). Minor paraphrase loops near middle offset by high information density.</question>

<grade>9.1</question>
<comment>Fusing meteorology, memory storage, and sky gondola creates a non-obvious conceit. The telescope-as-memory-tap and release-as-ceremony feel inevitable once seeded. High risk paid off: story succeeds precisely because no element is generic or substitutable.</question>
