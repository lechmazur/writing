<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—vomiting the envelope, pressing the cameo to the drain—but the “curator” identity remains more label than lived vocation; no curatorial act is dramatized. The final merger with the page is earned and costly, yet the emotional stakes feel slightly abstract because relationships are off-stage.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Mara becomes the catalog itself, paying with every erased kindness. The nonlinear structure is taught early and holds; each fold of time tightens the conceptual cost under an Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The orchard, bathroom pod, and cameo are rendered with luminous specificity; the zero-g roses and galaxy-fruit constrain choices and charge the final image. Spatial choreography stays coherent despite surreal scale.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—“pursue forbidden knowledge or forfeit sanity page by page”—is visceral and escalates with every galaxy-fruit plucked. The tightening is driven by Mara’s own choices, and the cost (erased past deeds) is legible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: inheritance as self-curation, knowledge as recursive authorship. The final image of Mara as footnote offers a resonant, non-moralizing answer to the central question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet controlled; the orchard’s rustling refrain and the grandmother-lullaby black holes create a distinct sonic texture. POV stays single and coherent, with purposeful compression that never obscures causality.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; metaphors (time folded like origami, drain swirling with lost birthdays) are precise and never mixed. No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances image or pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The nonlinear-inheritance orchard and the pistachio-shell grafting tool feel wholly fresh; familiar tropes of memory and time are transformed through specific, embodied choices. The final symmetry—curator becomes catalog—arrives as inevitable yet unforeseen.</comment>
