<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mara’s cool composure reads consistently, and her decisive act (driving the spike) grows organically from prior motive; yet the emotional layering stays static until the final beat, giving us only one visible shift of stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot’s accumulative lyric movement tightens cleanly: every sonic image and goddess confrontation escalates stakes until the spike-split garden delivers a Charged Poise (RR) that reweights the central question — the cost is legible even though causal turns are few.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>“Sound wave garden” and “lavender reeds” ground space; the iron spike and barefoot pressure become tactile micro-settings that constrain Mara’s final move; sensory economy is tight and purposeful, yet a minor drift in “smoky flames” threatens physical logic once.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant desire (to re-catch the goddess) tightens through a single deepening: the goddess herself confronts Mara. A visible cost emerges — the constellation woman is drained, reeds straighten, silence now weighs iron — but escalation stays purely tonal rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Divinity as conversation, not catch, emerges implicitly from every acoustic image; “precise weight of an answered question that refuses to stop asking” crystallizes the theme without overt statement; resonance lingers without tidy moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>A consistent lyric-imagist POV with selective compression; no head-hopping; diction folds sea-iron mythos into Maraitic perception (“rail spike beats like a second heart”), creating distinct sonic texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Sentences breathe and tighten in step with pressure; figurative layering is disciplined except for one mixed metaphor cluster around “feral lullaby scream”; information density stays high without scaffold lines.</comment>

<grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>The constellation-as-sleepwalkers premise, welded to sound-driven horticulture and silence-as-lure, feels inevitable in hindsight; risk taken in cosmic-acoustic marriage pays off with fresh afterimage.</comment>
