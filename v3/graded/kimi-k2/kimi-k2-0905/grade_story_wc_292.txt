<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s exile-choice, salt-cipher obsession, and final refusal to leave the station are all driven by a concrete ancestor-loyalty that costs her comfort and status; the copper nail as stylus crystallizes inherited bravery. Interiority stays tactile (“imprinted her palm”) and avoids label-speak. The only drag is that Voss’s grief is revealed late, so their alliance feels slightly convenient rather than earned in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: Mara’s exile flips from punishment to voluntary custodianship of memory, the price her permanent exile in a mildewed sky-library. Causal chain holds—decode maps → locate wreck → prove heroism → choose to stay—and the Reversible Exile concept is paid off in the final line. Orientation is swift; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<comment>The station’s spongey plankwalk, screaming barometers, and glass walls that refract maps into rain turn the entire structure into a living chart—environment literally writes memory onto weather. The copper nail reappears as stylus, embedding coffin-origin into every future beam of light. One minor over-count: “spongey” is used for both plankwalk and sky-dread, slightly diluting the tactile anchor.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—prove ancestor’s bravery to reverse erasure—tightens when decoded stanza points to wreck inside restricted zone, forcing illegal dirigible launch. Cost is legible: permanent exile willingly embraced to keep the sky-library alive. Pressure escalates under causal lens; no coincidence resolves the core problem.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme—memory as weather that can be steered—emerges through images of rain refracting maps and exile becoming reversible only by making the wind remember. Final etched glass wall offers non-literal answer: history is a lens we install in the storm, not a shelf we keep dry. No moralizing, just charged image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person stays tightly latched to Mara’s map-maker perception: coastlines “inverted,” ink “bled into semaphore shapes,” final light “refract a map.” Rhythm swells with storm urgency, then settles into calm etching cadence. No head-hop; Voss’s grief is filtered through Mara’s noticing. Compressed lyric diction is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty—e.g., “barometers screamed and experimental kites fought the newborn wind shears” advances weather, stakes, and experimental station in one breath. No loops, no mixed metaphors. Occasional adjective richness (“color of old pennies”) stays motivated by Mara’s metallic obsession. Closure line is clean, unadorned.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fusing maritime log-cipher, climate-fiction jet-stream shift, and bureaucratic Reversible Exile Act produces a fresh angle on “history is written by the victors.” Salt-cipher as inverted micro-map feels inevitable yet new. Risk—making weather itself the archive—pays off in final image without gimmickry.</comment>
