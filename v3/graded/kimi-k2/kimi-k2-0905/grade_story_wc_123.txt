<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s embodied curiosity and meticulous streak drive every micro-choice; her contradictory impulse (preserve integrity vs. obey self-future) animates interior monologue and action. Moment-by-moment calibration of instruments, backward-writing of logs, and final solitude-with-storms show flaws feeding stakes. Cost of isolation, plus tangible risk of being vanished, is palpable at close.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: tomorrow-dated vellum → immediate lateral retreat → pneumatic descent → lichen map → log reversal → tube release. Closure earns resonant reconfiguration: she refuses to falsify data, accepts perpetual exile. Final image of rain on her face crystallizes cost without dialogue.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sensory selection (wet limestone, pigeon feathers, phosphorescent lichen) is filtered through Elara’s meteorological lens and constrains choices (narrow shaft, hidden valve). Courtyard dusk and pneumatic under-city are anchored early; micro-settings (gargoyle eye, valve seat) charge final isolation image. One minor cap: courtyard layout only sketched laterally.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—protect uncensored weather truth—tightens after vellum receipt; each beat lowers external options (city observer in shadow, sealed pneumatic layers, rogue zone itself). Cost scales: she forfeits return path, accepts permanent quarantine to preserve data integrity. Tension remains coherent throughout, one decisive tightening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Integrity-vs-surveillance theme never sermonizes, emerges from concrete tools (anemometer, vellum, lichen map). Final rain image reframes earlier “gentle forecasts” lie as silvered truth. Theme coheres through small particulars; backward-writing detail reweights the value of authorship without overt statement.</question>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is specific, lyrically precise: “sky bruised into violet,” “earth breathing slowly.” Sensory bias of a recorder’s mind suffuses perceptual signature; no head-hopping. Rhythm modulates under pressure (brief, elliptical passages in shaft descent). Line-level control supports theme without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<comment>Diction vivid (“silver message tube,” “storm screamed pressure”), metaphor coherence holds; no overwritten beats. One stray simile “lantern in wind” is minor, not muddled. Information density high; no loops, pronoun clarity secure. Minor scaffold (“the words were written in her own handwriting”) could be sharper.</comment>

<comment>Mundane conspiracy trope is refreshed by meteorological lens and hidden pneumatic city layer. Pigeons carrying forged self-notes is fresh; data-censorship as disease quarantine is conceptually sharp. Final inversion—she chooses exile to keep data pure—grows inevitably from established recorder psychology. Risky lateral movement mechanic enhances stakes without gimmickry.</question>
