<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lys’s interior contradiction—contractual chastity vs. awakened desire for collective freedom—is dramatized in embodied beats (palm to silver veins, barefoot prints of blood). The renunciation of escape for first-voice status carries visible cost and is earned by the echo-braiding sequence. Minor slip: “chaste by choice” is asserted rather than shown in a final micro-choice, capping the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each echo-knot tightens the pattern until the mirror-dark core reconfigures meaning. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Lys steps into her multiplied selves, surrendering stolen memories; the city’s awakening is the conceptual cost. Orientation is swift; spatial anchors (courtyard, plinth, fountain rim) remain coherent. One causal gap: how the echo-scatter instantly reaches every sleeper is elided, but the lyric contract permits the ellipsis.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prism sanctuary, mercury-weeping statues, and thawing cereus evolve with the beats—snow retreat mirrors knot-release, tiles expose predecessors, final garden of lit silhouettes charges the image. Bodily poetic veins literally map choice under her palm. Environment constrains: the courtyard’s exposed mosaic forces her to see lineage and refuse escape. No extraneous detail; every sensory note reweights the stake.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—break the lullaby or eternal conformity—tightens with each untangled knot; snow retreat and mercury tears make cost legible. One meaningful deepening: the mirror shows her commodified selves, foreclosing retreat and crystallizing her stance. Agency drives every turn; no external rescue. Slight reserve because the citywide awakening feels more conceptual than viscerally paid by Lys in the final beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of reclaimed voice emerges from the echo-harvest ritual and her refusal to echo again; no authorial thesis states it. The final poem spelled in blood-dew reweights all prior doll/confessor/cage roles without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: freedom tastes like “iron and lilacs,” terrifying yet necessary. Image-based closure avoids tidy uplift.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to Lys’s perceptual filter—veins as iambs, pelvic vibration, mercury orbiting her throat—creating a singular rhythmic signature. Pattern-taught elision (“between sigh and smile”) repeats with payoff at closure. No head-hopping; distance remains steady. Diction never exceeds her lived lexicon even under metaphysical stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High-density lines do double duty: “statues wearing frost like lace veils” advances atmosphere and stakes. Metaphors stay coherent—mirror-dark void, mercury tears—without mixed vehicles. One scaffold trace: “between sigh and smile” used thrice; justified as refrain. No loops or register drift; read-aloud rhythm accelerates with knot-release then exhales at collapse.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fusion of courtesan-spy and memory-weaver feels inevitable yet fresh; the echo-as-thread device transforms familiar rebellion-against-dystopia into bodily poetic. Risky lyric compression pays off in the mirror-dark renunciation. Specificity—“smelled of perfume, gunpowder, or breast milk”—anchors the fantastical. Concept commits fully; no retreat to safety.</comment>
