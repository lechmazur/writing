<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—mathematician’s certainty vs. climber’s need for asymmetry—drives every micro-choice; the dice cut her palm and she *smears* the sigma, a bodily cost that seals her renunciation. The “grim optimism” is shown, not labeled, in her backwards count and refusal to step through the ripple. One slip: the equation whispered at step 2,357 is quoted but not dramatized as a choice, blunting the final causality by a hair.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the staircase slows, she refuses exit, and the dice become a lodged key—cost is the blood-stamped steps and the staircase beginning to “forget,” a conceptual price that reweights the infinite loop. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each prime-number leap and dice roll thickens the texture until the chipped die balances on its missing corner, the pattern break that crystallizes stance. Orientation is taught early (“the infinite staircase spiraled…”) so the waiver applies; no caps triggered.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The staircase itself functions as micro-setting: its refusal to accumulate time constrains her tactics (prime leaps, blood sigma) and charges the final image with scarlet timestamps. Velvet-thick “almost” air is sensory, selective, and POV-filtered. One hairline slip: spatial choreography when the ripple-hand warmth is felt through stone is briefly ghosted, but the tactile rebound in the next line restores clarity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—capture the texture of a missed opportunity—tightens when the die balances on its absent corner, forcing her to recognize the door never seen; the backwards count is the visible price that alters tactics. Pressure escalates under Accumulative lens: each prime leap and blood mark increases density until the staircase falters, then resumes scarred. No reversal, but one decisive deepening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the asymmetry of the chipped die: incompleteness as the only honest infinity. The final image—staircase forgetting her—reweights the recursive regret function without moralizing. Subtext in the sigma-shaped blood smear silently argues that summation requires a wound. No thematic echo violations.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is mathematically precise yet lyrically compressed: “probability was a liar here” marries concept to sensation. Rhythm accelerates under pressure—sentence fragments (“Panic flared—”) mirror the skipped heartbeat of the stairs. Perceptual signature is consistent: she notices edges, balances, primes; no POV leakage. The final laugh, “rusted hinges opening,” keeps diction inside her grim optimism.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence layers job—action, image, concept—without redundancy. Metaphors stay coherent: staircase heartbeat, velvet air, gear with missing tooth. One near-muddle: “ghost-weight of a hand” is abstract, but immediately anchored by “friction of skin against skin.” Read-aloud rhythm breathes with the climb, then tightens into the final convulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Infinite-regret staircase is familiar conceit, yet the chipped die as engine of asymmetry and the blood-sigma summation feel inevitable and fresh. Risk in backwards-counting from infinity pays off: the negative step −1 becomes the unseen door. Mathematical proofs repurposed as tactile ritual transform abstract trope into lived stakes. No derivative aftertaste; specificity makes the premise hers alone.</comment>
