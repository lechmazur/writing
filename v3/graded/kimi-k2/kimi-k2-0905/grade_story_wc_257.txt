<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The jeweler’s grief is embodied in tactile micro-choices—folding vellum, placing cranes—so the arc from preservation to celebration is credibly earned. Interiority stays concrete, but the daughter remains a luminous absence rather than a second character, so the “relationship as crucible” test is moot. The final renunciation carries visible cost: she leaves the only place that lets her speak to the dead. Flaw: a few abstractions (“genuinely artificial,” “subdued ardor”) drift toward label-speak, blunting peak emotion.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each origami placement thickens pattern until the dissolved stencil becomes the final reconfiguration. Closure lands as Charged Poise—she exits, paper stars stay behind—cost legible in the irrevocable step through the door. Orientation is swift: jeweler, observatory, night, all within 50 words. One causal hiccup: the curtains’ slipstream physics is asserted but never constrains tactics, so the world rule feels ornamental rather than priced.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The observatory’s glass dome, acoustic curves, and mechanical orreries are filtered through the jeweler’s craft-eye, every surface potential setting for a brooch. Micro-setting triumphs: the tattoo stencil dissolves into the final crane, charging the closing image. Sensory hierarchy favors touch and candle-glow over visual cataloguing. Spatial choreography stays clean as she moves from telescope to clocks to curtains—no floating props.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will she keep freezing grief or release it—tightens when she dissolves the last relic instead of preserving it. Pressure is textural: each folded crane adds weight of impending departure. No external antagonist needed; the conflict is between obsession and relinquishment. Cost is felt—she forfeits the only space where her daughter’s voice echoes—but the escalation is a single crest rather than a progressive squeeze, capping the score below 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the shifting valence of “genuinely artificial”: memorials are love’s artifacts, not souls. The curtains of intention, origami coordinates, and dissolved stencil form a sparse motif cluster that reweights at closure without moralizing. Final image—paper constellations mapping acceptance—offers resonant ambiguity: is this transcendence or mere prettiness? The refusal to declare keeps the aftereffect alive.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person intimate maintains jeweler-level diction—brass, vellum, orrery—without slipping into editorial omniscience. Rhythm lengthens during folding, contracts at the final doorway, mirroring her held breath and release. No dialogue, so voice distinction is internal: precise lapidary cadence, never therapeutic. One filter-verb cluster (“she began leaving…”) is forgiven because the pattern of iterative action needs the iterative syntax.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sentences carry double duty: “She unfolded the tattoo stencil, revealing the coordinates her daughter had inked…” simultaneously exposes backstory and propels present action. Figurative control holds—mixed metaphors are avoided even when stacking celestial and craft imagery. Occasional scaffold (“each piece… each figure… each coordinate”) is purposeful accumulative pattern, not loop. Final line breathes, giving cadence payoff after long prior clause.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fusing mourning jewelry, liminal observatory, and origami cartography yields a fresh grief-topography; not a template I’ve seen. Risk: the “curtains of intention” flirt with abstraction, but the jeweler’s tactile handling keeps it from evaporating into concept. Transformation test passes—swap any detail and the emotional engine collapses. Freshness capped slightly because the “place outside time” device is familiar, even if repurposed.</comment>
