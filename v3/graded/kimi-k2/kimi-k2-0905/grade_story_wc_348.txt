<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is embodied and specific—grief, science, guilt braid into each action. Her choices (synthesizing resin, planting sculptures) all spring from the funeral’s “late call” refusal and the sister’s voice that refuses to die. The final walkaway is earned renunciation rather than closure; silence now has a cost she has paid. Flaw: sister reads more cipher than individual voice, but Mara registers as flesh.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the ravine becomes instrument, she composer, listeners performers—before/after visible in the glow across travelers’ faces. Causal because each sculptural lattice stems from the earlier “mold-it-as-heart” act. One minor ellipsis: how lab audio is embedded is skipped, but resonance suffices. Cost—loss of privacy, permanence—is felt in the final relinquishing.</comment>

<comment>The braided ravine is not backdrop; foam patterns teach the lattice geometry that becomes the material solution (Q3 quick met). Tactile shale, moonlight resin, warmth-actuated vibration lock the setting to every pivot—“river conduct[s] vibration up the radial artery” is literal physics tying place to body. Micro-setting fulfilled.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake: turn inert grief into palpable connection. River foam micro-observation tightens stakes into a single usable pattern. No external antagonist needed; loss and atonement escalate with each cured shell’s heartbeat. Felt cost: permanence—her voice becomes public, irreversible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: memory-as-polymer—threads of absence braided into lattice with tensile strength. The ravine’s confluent streams literalize the closing thought: “separation is only a temporary braid.” No explicit thesis; final communal chord reconfigures meaning without moral lecture.</question>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</quote>
<comment>Voice is dense with polymer vocabulary braided into grief idiom—“chalky runoff,” “fossilized moonlight.” Compression (e.g., “cicadas rose and fell”) taught early remains legible. No dialogue, yet perceptual signature holds. Final sentence’s metronomic syntax reflects river cadence under closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</question>
<comment>Syntactic variety, natural sentence openings, no loops or scaffolding. “Synagogue-cadenced” rhythm never flattens; figurative language kept local and justified (“chalky runoff,” “fossilized moonlight”). Micro-level clarity flawless.</question>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</question>
<comment>Transforms the memorial-into-art trope via polymer science; foam templating as epiphany feels inevitable in hindsight, not gimmick. Specific ravine, chemical procedure, and guitar-440 Hz tuning ground it in singular life. Fresh inflection: grief rendered as acoustical polymer conduit with social ripples.</comment>
