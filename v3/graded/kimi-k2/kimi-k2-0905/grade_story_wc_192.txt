<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Motivation clear—she stays out of compulsion and shared hurt, not exposition. Interiority concrete: the ring “grows warm” and her lungs fill “with starlight.” Flaws and self-deception (practicing suffocation daily) drive inevitable cost at the boy’s passage; Earned Stasis is felt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Situational lens holds: pressure from ghostly presence builds until she must act. Closure lands with CR—shadow keeper accepts perpetual solitude as Conceptual Repricing. Iron ring and sanctuary constraints shaped every tactic; boy’s release is bought at her own lifelong suffocation. Cost is explicit on page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Body, ring, and sanctuary walls actively restrict and empower—the altar circle, scorched threshold, ring warming between them. Sensory detail selective; starlight like “frozen tears” filters POV. Architecture guides movement and choice; final ring image recharges opening sensory seed.</question>

<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake explicit: teach the dead to let go. Escalates when ring links scars and shares lung-failure; single tightening turns option to remain ghost into compulsion to cross. Boy’s final breath gift for payment feels on page; no coincidences resolve stakes.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Theme emerges in shared suffocation under love’s weight—never stated, lived out through ritual. Metaphor of drowning and bridges burned resists tidy moral, lingers with loaded emptiness. Last breath gift reframes prior suffocation practice; subtle thematic echo, not lecture.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Lyrical POV sustains atmospheric compression without head-hop. Diction precise—ring “glows,” sanctuary “exhales”—yet stays character-bound. Rhythm modulates urgency versus elegy; no filter-verb drag. Voice distinctive, consistent at close.</question>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</question>
<comment>Vivid, specific prose, almost no loop: each image advances stakes; “memories burned like embers,” ring “cooling like frozen tears.” Avoids purple overload. Small clump in “she had been teaching herself to suffocate properly” is paraphrase, but doesn’t blur clarity. Sentence rhythm mirrors breathing restraint.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Fusion of ghost guide and survivor caretaker archetype made specific to suffocation metaphor and sanctuary ruins. Fresh inversion: death ritual is a breathing lesson. Risk of loaded emptiness trope is elevated by concrete bodily stakes and earned cost.</comment>
