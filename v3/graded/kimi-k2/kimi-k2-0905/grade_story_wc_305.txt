<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The caretaker’s interior contradiction—fleeing upward while carrying the emblem of return—grounds every beat; the hairpin stab that seals her lifeline makes the renunciation visceral. Sister-grief is embodied in knee-buckling and sap-scented palms, not labels. The final descent is earned because the grotto literally dissolves the boy, forcing her to carry the cost inside her chest. Only the sister’s off-stage treason feels slightly abstract, keeping it just under the 9 gate.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the fused shell-pin nesting in her sternum reweights the valley’s debt into heartbeat-currency, undeniable on the page. Causal chain holds—because she forgives, the boy appears; because she pins him, sap flows; because she absorbs the relic, the valley exhales. Orientation is taught early via “cloud-rooted limb” and “umbral grotto,” so disorientation serves closure. Persistent constraint: the relic’s pulse now dictates her every downward step.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The moon-ash’s vertical geography constrains every move—climb or fall are the only options. Cloud-crystal fossil and fermented-sap smell charge the final fusion beat; environment literally enters her body. Vineyard hush below acts as auditory tether, pulling her back down. Micro-setting (hairpin as trellis) meets the 9+ gate by guiding the descent compass.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—contentment vs. debt—tightens when the basin shows her future planting the pin; the option to stay aloft dies there. Escalation is accumulative: each spiral (boy, shell, sap) deepens the cost of return. The boy’s dissolution mid-air is the visible price that forecloses escape. Pressure stays coherent under the Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inversion: ascension is exile, descent is resurrection. The cycle is not stated but enacted—every climb births the next debtor-child. Final image of the lantern-grotto reframes prior sorrow as home-light, a Conceptual Repricing that needs no moral. No echo-statements; the shell-pin fusion does the talking.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lush yet disciplined, the voice marries viticultural tannins with lunar chill: “juice pressing against skin” as heartbeat. Compression like “knees scallop inward” teaches the pattern early and pays off in moth-dust scallops. No head-hopping; perception stays rooted in the caretaker’s sinuses and palms. Register never drifts above grape-moon lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary from crystalline fragments to long vine-like coils, rhythm mirroring ascent/descent. Every line carries dual duty—sensorium plus metaphoric charge—no paraphrase loops. Mixed metaphors are avoided: sap as fermented forgiveness remains consistent. Closure beat is uncluttered, letting the bell-ring roll downhill unimpeded.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The rebirth-cum-vineyard cycle feels inevitable yet unseen elsewhere; scallop as both shell and wind-boy is fresh without gimmickry. Risk-taking—vertical cloud-ash geography, sap-sealed lifeline—heightens stakes and meaning. Specificity of scalp-oil blackened prongs anchors the fantastical in bodily truth. Transformation test fails if retold with generic talisman, proving integration.</comment>
