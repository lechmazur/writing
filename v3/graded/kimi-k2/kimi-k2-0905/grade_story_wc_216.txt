<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aimless senior, prisoner of his own metaphors, is cleanly written; the crackle of the urn shard pressed against his thumb is embodied, specific, and his final attention-crystal (reverberations of dying hour glued to his eyelids) carries felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Mosaic accumulates through one neat transition (up ladder/run-down sale) and lands coherent closure (granular taste of metallic dust—quiet restart). Causal beats and poignant deepening both present.</comment>

<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dust motes as collapsed digits constrains his rediscovery; clay shard glint like “cracked hourglass glass” recharged at closure. Texture beats serve stakes, not generic scene dressing.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Pressure mounts via accumulating price tags that reconfigure memory as currency; final exchange (“genuine shiver” for first December minute) crystallizes cost under the lens.</question>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Memory-as-commodity theme emerges from concrete garage-sale action and the desperate re-valuation of ash. Final iron-taste of time reweights premise with conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Lyric, textured prose—phrase cadence taught early (“borrowed-time timekeeper”) and held steady. No POV leak; voice modulates with pressure. Distinct perceptual signature.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Crystalline micro-descriptions (“fine metallic dust on the tongue”) propel momentum. Some foreground poetic compounding, yet all sentences advance atmosphere or reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Synthesis of museum labels turned garage-sale currency is fresh; final “first minute of every December” crystalizes novelty without gimmickry.</comment>
