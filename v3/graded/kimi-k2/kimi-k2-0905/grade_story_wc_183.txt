<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The fused twin’s interior contradiction—left-foot loves heights, right-foot craves depth—grounds every stride in a visible, embodied conflict. Micro-choices (pressing palm to porthole, gathering heat-spots, opening coat to the rising water) keep agency alive under lyric compression. The final shared breath is earned because the text has made separateness unbearable; cost is felt in the sister’s first voluntary sigh. Voice-specific perceptual bias holds; no diagnostic label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each shard adds density until the emerald card’s dissolution rewrites the sky—an undeniable Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost (they can never be two again). Orientation is taught by deliberate disorientation (fog, mirror-maze, rewound time) that pays off in the closing book-metaphor; no penalty. Causality is poetic but traceable: card twitches → follows → gathers heat → speaks → dissolves → names them. Closure beat is on-page, irreversible, and charged.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The ship’s rotting plush, mildewed calliope, and rising water are not backdrop but instruments that pressure movement and finally swallow the text itself. Micro-setting (emerald card, mirror-pane shards) constrains choice: she can only follow the heat. Spatial choreography is clean—porthole → decks → maze → tarot stall → rooftop—even while time loops. Fog thickening into pages literalizes the book-metaphor and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover the lost shared name—remains legible throughout. Pressure tightens when blank tarot card demands “Recollect,” forcing a final expenditure of gathered syllables; the price is permanent fusion. Escalation is accumulative: each mirror-shard adds heat until ignition. No coincidence resolves; the ship’s polite sinking is consequence, not deus ex machina.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the paradox of twinhood: one body that must cease trying to be two. The garden of forgotten names is not a place but a tense—past imperfect, forever growing—an elegant conceptual repricing. No moralizing; the final lily spells only the first letter, inviting the next pilgrim. Image-based subtext (green fire writing in phosphor vines) carries the emotional aftershock.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyric omniscience stays tightly filtered through the chimera’s sensory braid: salt-streaked glass, mildewed chord, heat-spots stitched into coat lining. Syntax stretches into oceanic cadence yet snaps back in the final short sentence: “breathing for two, finally buoyant.” No head-hopping; the sister’s sigh is reported only as vibration through shared flesh. Register remains mythic without slipping into pseudo-prophecy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High figurative density serves the accumulative design; no mixed metaphors violate internal logic. Rhythm modulates from long breathless clauses to fragmentary beats under peak pressure. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold. One hairline slip—“unkindled solace” repeated twice—costs the final 0.4 to stay below 9.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fuses body-horror carnival, maritime ghost-ship, and lyric name-myth into a singular vision. The emerald card as both iris-fragment and ignition seed feels inevitable yet unforeseen. Risky structural choices—time-rewind, mirror-maze as text—heighten coherence rather than gimmickry. Transformation test fails: this exact chimera name-quest could not survive relocation.</comment>
