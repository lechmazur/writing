<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The archivist’s contradictory impulses—preservation vs. surrender—are dramatized in the final act of sealing the locket inside the tube; the cost (empty cuff, daughter’s glance) is felt. Interiority stays concrete, anchored to pulse, ink, salt. The micro-choice to “plant” memory rather than pocket it credibly alters her relational stance with the lost boy, her daughter, and the future demolishers. One hairline slip: “haunted euphoria” is named twice rather than embodied, keeping it from 9+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the locket’s relocation reweights the entire jetty from doomed lumber to living archive, cost paid in the mother’s literal loss of keepsake. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each sensory layer (barnacle, sunflower, walnut ink) tightens the stake until the final graft of photo to page crystallizes meaning. Orientation is clean by line 10; transitions are single-scene. No causality breaks; the tube’s future discovery is plausible ellipsis, not cheat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Jetty, tide, copper tube, and daughter’s piano are all tactile, selective, and filtered through the archivist’s professional eye. The regenerated covenant stones and sun-bleached petals constrain her sketching path and final hiding spot. Micro-setting (locket against wrist, photo edge absorbing ink) charges the closure image. One minor drift: “cheap replacement orange” is the only visual that feels generic, else 9+.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—save small moments from erasure—tightens when engines growl and security arrives, forcing the steep act of entombing the locket. Agency is archivist throughout; no coincidence resolves anything. Cost is the locket itself, plus the audible hush that braids boy’s and daughter’s laughter, narrowing future access to that memory. One beat shy of 9+: could use a sharper intermediate obstacle (wet page, near confiscation) to push tactics further.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges as memory’s verb-state: artifacts survive only by acting upon strangers. Subtext carries in the guard’s retreat from “planting,” the daughter’s unanswered question, the dried petals fused to wood. No moralizing; the final piano waltz lets resonance echo. The locket’s mirror-for-darkness reprises the negative-space sketch without stating the thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person hovers at a lyric middle distance, yet diction stays salted, ink-stained, barnacle-rough—utterly hers. Rhythm accelerates with shorter units as engines approach, then exhales into the waltz. Patterned elision (“she drew the space where he had been”) is taught early and paid off. No head-hopping; even the guard’s reaction is filtered through her gaze.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry triple duty: sensory, emotional, conceptual (“ink blooming like bruised violets across the parchment”). No loops, no scaffold, no mixed metaphors. Filter verbs appear only when voice-motivated (“she could almost hear”). Final line cadence mirrors tide-rise, piano stumbling—perfectly timed.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fusing archival craft with coastal ghost-ledger is fresh; the negative-space portrait of a drowned child reframes memorial art. Risk—burying the locket inside a future ruin—pays off by turning demolition crew into unwitting celebrants. Specificity of walnut ink, covenant stones, and sunflower petal grafts makes the concept irreplicable. The waltz epilogue avoids gimmick, landing as earned stasis.</comment>
