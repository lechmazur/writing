<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her trembling hands, the grip on the lantern—but the final shift from inherited guilt to “small rebellion” feels slightly under-cooked; the causal bridge between memory and resolve could be sharper.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The causal chain (drought → data manipulation → engineers’ guilt → suicides → Mara’s discovery) is tight; closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration where Mara chooses testimony over silence, the cost framed by the lantern’s glow and the tunnel’s throat-like darkness.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The tunnel’s damp chill, brass warmth, and carved tally marks are selective and purposeful; the lantern functions as micro-setting that constrains visibility and choice, charging the final image without ornamental excess.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether complicity can be expiated—escalates through each discovered journal entry; the tightening is driven by Mara’s agency (opening the box, deciding to speak) and carries a visible emotional price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the particulars: water as weapon, memory as inheritance, silence as complicity. The final image of the lantern guiding “these memories” offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is consistent, textured, and character-bound (“watchfully calm gait,” “bones picked clean”); free-indirect style stays clean, and the perceptual signature (what Mara notices under amber light) remains sharp throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and propulsive; only minor filter-verb clusters (“she realized,” “she remembered”) slow momentum, but no loops or mixed metaphors mar the peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The drought-as-social-control premise feels fresh, and the transformation of the lantern from historical symbol to present-tense beacon is earned; risk-taking lies in the quiet refusal of spectacle, sustained by concrete detail.</comment>
