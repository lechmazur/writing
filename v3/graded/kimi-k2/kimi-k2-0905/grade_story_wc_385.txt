<comment>Lira’s desire to “finish leaving” is embodied: she swallows gulps of older grief, sings through collapsed lungs, and the final transfer of warmth from seashell to cocoon is a decisive micro-choice that scales to her lineage. No stock interiority; every feeling is palpable—“taste the iron,” “reed-blown melancholy”—and the reunion with her mother produces earned stasis whose pulse registers in her palm’s heartbeat.</comment>

<comment>Closure is delivered by a Conceptual Repricing: the canyon’s rule-set (unfinished departures loop) is rewritten on the page when the mother’s cocoon dissolves, releasing decades-old grief. Progressive disclosure teaches the mechanics; each return of song is altered, narrowing Lira’s options to sing the necessary cadence. There is no drift of motive; the final beat makes audible the cost of finishing. All fragments link cleanly under a Causal/Accumulative hybrid lens.</comment>

<comment>The basalt trail keeps fresh fingerprints; every footfall “releases older footsteps” constraining Lira’s breathing. The corkscrew cavern and moth-silk gallery are more than backgrounds—they demand the song’s completion. The seashell’s warmth in her neck at dawn is micro-setting repurposed as closure tool. Spatial choreography (descending, ascending) is flawless and charged.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—existential dread of becoming echo—escalates when each rebounded question forces Lira toward the nexus. One tightening: the cocoon’s whisper is recognised as her mother’s voice, obliging Lira to choose completion or endure unending reverberation. Cost is legible physical—raw lungs, cold water slap of realisation—and metaphysical—the song must now fade rather than haunt. No coincidence; every turn is driven by Lira’s agency in song.</comment>

<comment>Question “Why do you echo?” becomes answer without moral: endings render lives portable, reverberations without purpose trap them. The transfer of the seashell to cocoon reconfigures the notion of legacy via concrete tactile ritual. Theme never lectures; it resonates in the fade of mother’s farewell and the new forward song drifting into sky. Quiet conceptual reweighting earns lasting afterglow.</comment>

<comment>Diction glints like iron—“thistledown on night thermals,” “corkscrew cavern” mirror narrator’s synesthetic gift. Poetic compression is taught early; readers recognise the pattern when the old woman speaks in brittle harmonies tasting of salt and dawn. Syntax modulates with breathlessness during ascents/descents, matching physical effort. Voice holds tight to POV distance, no leakage. The final image of silence in Lira’s pocket is rendered through texture, not exposition.</comment>

<comment>Lines glide without slack; no scaffold, no synonym churn. Metaphor density (echoes as woven silk, unstruck bells) is high but purposeful—each vehicle advances the argument of unfinished sound. Cuts are surgical: every phrase either propels descent or prepares final dissolution. The final line’s rhythm—“finished sentence carried by wind”—is perfect cadence payoff, echoing the opening syntactic arc.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>9.7</question>
<comment>Familial echo as unfinished departure loop is an angle fresh enough to feel inevitable in hindsight. The conceit that transparent moths feed on residual yearning and spin it into cocooned voices feels original and fully owned. Tropes of daughter-missing-mother and quest are subverted into ritual of sonic closure. No stock magic object—seashell’s childhood dreams and late payoff constitute specific invention. Risk of mystical without overexposition pays off in hushed final beat.</comment>
