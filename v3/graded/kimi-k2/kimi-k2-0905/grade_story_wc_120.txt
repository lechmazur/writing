<grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>The protagonist’s “chronologically homesick” ache is an abstract label without embodied contradiction or visible choice pressure. She executes symbolic actions but makes no micro-choice that visibly alters stakes; we see her ‘map’ rather than test memory against need. The interior conflict stalls in lyric mode, no tangible sacrifice beside exhaustion. Earned cost is asserted (“ache dissolved”) rather than dramatized.</comment>

<comment>Accumulative lens holds: each etched memory thickens the mirrored lake until the final Charged Poise converts horizon to internal ledger. Cause/effect remains legible—each note drawn reshapes the acoustic lake; closure crystallizes home as the self she refused, paying with collapse. The Orientation Test is not owed; the spire’s spatial rules are taught early and echo at the end.</comment>

<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Glass spire and mirrored lake constrain every move—foot placement prints ghosts, vibrations conduct the composition. The setting is more score than backdrop, literally dictating tactics. Micro-setting qualification met: the frozen lake functions as tuning surface and time mirror, shaping both conductorship and exhaustion. Selective sensory detail (ink-cotton basement, frost feathers) stays urgent and tied to action.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“compose her own childhood into audible home”—grows under time pressure of depleting stamina. Each stanza escalates the score’s density; the lake’s flex into staff lines is visible payoff for her agency. No external antagonist means pressure is exhaustion and mirrored refusal; cost is legible when she folds to glass.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme is the inversion: memory is portable score, home is authored rather than retrieved. Realized through image—not lecture—the final “horizon etched on eyelids” reframes the ache without meta commentary. Subtext stays embodied: silence after music becomes home. Avoids thematic echo penalties; no character verbalizes the thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is thickly textured—syntax coils like nautilus, line rhythm tightens with ascent. Perceptual signature distinct (“spelling you are already home in a language older than grammar”). Figurative stack sometimes nears excess yet pattern is taught early and holds to last crystallized pause. Compression serves the lyric drive without obscuring closure.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High information density—metaphors advance state (shell crumbles into scored bubbles) without scaffold. Minor figurative drift (“lake surface flexing into parabolic curves, each curve a staff line”) remains legible under musical logic. Read-aloud rhythm varies, no redundancy, clear propulsion to final held breath.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Transforms the familiar “climb and composition” arc into a memory-phonograph spire that records childhood into lake-light. Fresh synthesis: cookie fortunes as musical fragments, nautilus stylus etching reversed score into time mirror. Takes high risk—lyric conductor climbing a tuning-fork spire—yet lands closure cleanly without rule rewrite. Memorable voice and concept not swappable to generic analogue.</comment>
