<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mara’s interior contradiction—tradeswoman’s pragmatism vs. mystic reader-of-light—plays out in embodied micro-choices (kneel, hurl, speak aloud). Each spoken valuation is a pane fitted under pressure, the scar-as-Carina moment fusing flesh and cosmos with visible cost. No stock phrasing; every beat sharpens her hierarchy of values. The final renunciation of the prism lands as earned stasis: she forecloses ownership to become lens for the town, price legible in the dissolve.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens taught by first drip-ring and held: each concentric ledger entry tightens the stake of “debts of beauty unpaid.” Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—prism becomes invisible repair—cost felt in the loss of private talisman and dawn’s audit now shared. Causality intact: because she reads rings, therefore she speaks valuations, therefore prism is hurled, therefore town windows heal. No orientation debt; spatial anchors (ankle-deep, flat stone, pier post) clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Harbor, tide breath, salt wind, kelp, rust, gull quarrel—every sense note filtered through glazier’s professional eye for light and fracture. Prism-atrium and scar-Carina function as micro-settings that constrain choice: only this glass, only this flesh map, can enact the final repricing. Spatial choreography pristine: stone, water, rings, sleeping town windows track without drift. Environment supplies both tool and stakes; Pearl Bay at dawn is not backdrop but the ledger that demands payment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“illuminate value in the mundane before sunrise audit”—signaled in paragraph 4 and escalates with each ring-read: teacup, harmonica, scar. One meaningful tightening: the moment violet lattice meets water, the option to keep the prism closes; hurling becomes inevitable. Cost visible: loss of private prism, exposure of personal scar to public light. Coincidence (single drip) complicates, does not resolve; agency remains Mara’s speech and throw.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from particular relics: flawed vessels retain usable warmth, song, memory. No overt thesis; final image of invisible lens reframes earlier “debts” as communal, not individual. Subtext in the scar-Carina: bodily damage as private sky, reclaimed not erased. Resonant reconfiguration—town windows quietly rainbowed—invites reader to re-see their own cracked crockery without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited glazier-poet voice: perceptual signature of light-splitting, hairline cracks, refractive indices. Syntax lengthens and shortens with tide-breath rhythm; no filter-verb stacks. Diction stays within artisanal lexicon until justified lift into “noctilucent reckonings,” taught early. No dialogue, so voice carries every beat; final hurl reads as crystallized action, not exposition.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image, pressure, or cost. Metaphors (storms slide like apologies, rings as dark syllables) precise, non-contradictory, and pattern-taught. High density: “blood on a shard two winters ago, a careless moment that had birthed a scar shaped like the constellation Carina” performs four jobs in twenty-one words. Rhythm modulates from hush to riot without drumbeat monotony; final line sails into gull-cry release.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Premise—harbor glazier pays beauty-debts via prism-divided dawn—feels inevitable yet unexampled. Synthesizes artisan realism with lyric mysticism without gimmickry. Risk of hurling priceless glass earned by prior ring-reading stakes; transformation test fails if Mara is any other trade. Specificity of chipped teacup, ferry harmonica, Carina scar anchors freshness. Invisible lens outcome reconfigures familiar “let there be light” trope into quiet, secular miracle.</comment>
