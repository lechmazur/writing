<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ren’s interiority is vivid and embodied—his salt-taste memory, the rag-wrapped thumb, the unspoken promise—but the “intimately aloof” trait is asserted more than dramatized; still, his final act of transference crystallizes a credible renunciation with felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The mirror-crack incites a clear causal chain: shattered reflection → inland flight → cave discovery → shell painting → shell entombment. Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Ren forecloses return, paying with permanent exile while preserving the quay in secret.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Coastal diesel, gulls like saws, marram grass, salt-sweat cave walls—details are selective, sensory, and tethered to Ren’s painterly eye. The shell-as-micro-gallery and cave-as-cathedral constrain every subsequent choice, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes—“If the image breaks, I will go where no one has already painted”—are signaled early and tightened by each beat: mirror loss, wrong turn, dwindling air, shell’s impossible mural. The final act forecloses the option to return, paying the price of eternal absence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of “temporary eternity” emerges through image and action: the shell preserves what the wrecking ball erases, Ren’s miniature canvas becomes a time-capsule. No moralizing; resonance arises from the final entombment that reweights the premise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person lyric close to Ren’s perception; diction (“porcelain bells,” “cathedral veins”) is painterly yet precise. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens under pressure. Rhythm modulates with scene needs, though occasional poetic reach nudges toward overwriting.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, each sentence advancing image or pressure. Minor figurative excess (“gulls screamed like circular saws”) and a few stacked metaphors appear, but none obscure causality or dull the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The conceit of a shell containing an impossible, perfect replica of the doomed harbor—painted in pigments that should have washed away—feels fresh and inevitable. Risky lyric structure pays off in the final entombment, transforming loss into secret permanence.</comment>
