<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>“Cradle of sparks” internalizes into decisive micro-choices—mask off, bridge terminals—and an earned renunciation that sears her loyalty on the page. Character progression is compressed yet complete: defiance crystallizes while stakes remain personal. No label-speak, no passivity; contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene. Mask-fall counts as visible cost, aligning motives with closure shift.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal chain drives blackout-coded sundial angles into chain-room sabotage; lantern restart triggers micro-turn tightening options. Resolution lands decisively on drifting barges—Decisive Change anchored in prior mechanics. No false reversals, teleported props, or coincidence at payoff. Quiet waltz of gears closing the final gate satisfies cost and lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>“Luminous fort at twilight” is not scenery; darkness dictates lanterns-off tactics, blackout empowers plan, ramparts arc silhouettes against sky-barges. Continuous play: torches, pressure valves, copper coils tracked across space. Spatial choreography clean; madeira-purple sky mirrors mournful spark. Final drift framed by gates yawning—environment recharges image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake is fort blackout→barge liberation; each beat escalates under pressure culminating in drifting swans. Price: Garnet’s anonymity foreclosed; defenses slackened. Core conflict tracks through physical stakes without sidetracks. Coincidental blackout aids plan, not resolves battle; pressure coherent to final waltz.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from concrete defiance vs obedience girding mechanism: sparks kindle revolution through silent sabotage—not preachy. Final image asserts ownership of dawn without moralizing. Conceptual repricing occurs when light replaces ink, cost paid on page. Fresh synthesis vivifies industrial fantasy revolution at human scale.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Distinct perceptual lens: Garnet’s tactile noticing of gears, sealing wax, graphite, rhythm mirrors coiling tension. Free-indirect slips into internal machinery—“licking through corridors of sleeping power.” Dialogue sparse, subtext-laden; no head-hopping. Final hush crystallizes with “one suction of wind,” ending voice intact and resonant.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm accelerates under blackout, clacks awake without collapses. No synonym loops; filaments, cradle, chain-room woven into action sentences. Zero filter verbs; strong verbs (“bridges”, “slides”, “traces”) propel beats. Metaphor stable (“sparks inside her chest” vs “bruised violet sky”) with no contradiction across peak turns. Lint-free prose.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Premise weaves lock-girl fantasy into sky-barge plot with specific physics and cause; not retrod. Final act re-anchors rebellion on drifting barges rather than cataclysmic battle—a fresh inflection. Risk taken in compressed lyric beats that charge closure image. Near-echo of traditional fortress archetype transformed via blackout ingenuity.</comment>
