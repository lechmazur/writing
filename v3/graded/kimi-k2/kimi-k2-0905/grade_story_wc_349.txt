<question>1</question>
<grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>The vendor’s choices, especially agreeing to become the door, are the decisive pivot that reconfigures every narrative strand and grants the ending its resonant charge; her interior is specific and contradictory (rushes of wonder and doubt) and the final renunciation lands with a visible conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>2</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Mosaic structure (setup table → boy → librarian → her own dissolution) teaches Cadusal design; each micro beat because/therefore tightens until the last image crystallizes the negative-space rule; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration where absence is bottled and re-distributed.</comment>

<question>3</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The glimmering parole itself becomes the connective tissue—fruit project possible prologues, librarian’s memory is re-distributed, final beam re-orders narrative space; glass orchard library floating on clouds constrains physical orientation and supplies moonlit resources without ever feeling postcard.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The goal of “finding the beginning” escalates from passive to active as the vendor willingly subtracts herself, trading second chances for measurable absence—cost builds with each absence weighed and finally embodied in the door exit, reconfiguring both characters’ and readers’ stakes.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>The story’s true thesis emerges from concrete particulars: only by quantified absence can a beginning earn existence, the recursive articulation reframed at the door; subtext (stories begin where memory ends) lands without exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Second-person immediacy in meta-description and exquisite rhythmic control under mounting pressure create a distinct voice; POV remains stable with no head-hopping while doors and syllables mirror perception through specific sensual bias.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, high-density and rhythmically elastic—every image advances arc or atmosphere; zero loops, no ornamental flourish; the final image “becomes the outline of a door she had never opened” cleanly crystallizes prior beats.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Takes the tempting shop-opening-day micro-genre premise and transforms it into a mythic negative-space gate in 700 tight words; the synthesis feels inevitable and charged, balancing lyric lyricism with ruthless logic.</comment>
