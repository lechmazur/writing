<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her barefoot sprint, palm on damp planks, micro-adjustment of tape heads all reveal hierarchy of values. Contradictory impulses (fear vs duty to erased voices) coexist in-scene, driving the final broadcast. The only drag: “Indifference is a lock; memory is the key” is overt label-speak in a peak beat, blunting cost. Still, her earned stance crystallizes with visible price—arrest, exposure, loss of stealth.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because she holds the key, therefore she threads the tape, therefore she wires the ringer—each step forecloses retreat. Closure lands on-page: the citywide playback is a Decisive Change with undeniable social cost—her own lullaby used against her captors. Persistent constraint (spotlights, handcuffs) shapes the final image. No teleporting props; the reel-to-reel, copper feed, and emergency tower are pre-planted and tracked.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lagoon starlight, cracked booth glass, and copper wiring are selective, tactile, and filter through Mira’s artist-eye. The auric glow narrows to a single path that guides her final choice—setting actively constrains. Spatial choreography is clean: drones pivot, she sprints, officers hesitate at the lullaby chorus. One micro-slip: “auric” used thrice risks self-conscious poeticism, but it pays off in the closing image reweight.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reclaim erased voices—signals early and tightens when drones return, forcing the sprint. One meaningful turn: the playback reveals her own childhood call, converting abstract archive into personal loss, raising cost. Escalation is causal: each adjustment of the tape heads increases exposure risk until the final ring triggers citywide consequence. Price is legible—her anonymity and freedom forfeited in the spotlight.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from action: erased voices vs manufactured indifference, shown via clipped syllables on tape. Subtext lives in the switchman’s pixelated face and the officers’ hesitation when their own lullabies return. Final image—puddle map of un-silence—reweights premise without moralizing. Only minus: the looped whisper “Indifference is a lock…” flirts with thesis-statement, slightly diluting resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Mira’s perceptual signature—waveform puddles, stencil memories, dial-tone sigh. Syntax compresses under drone pressure: “key clenched like a fuse.” No head-hopping; retired switchman remains opaque, as he should. Distinct rhythmic control—Orion glints as Morse, copper uphill spill—teaches pattern early and pays off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence. High density: “starlight braided into copper” does image + theme + plot in five words. One paraphrase loop—“revised histories” repeated three times in 60 words—drops it 0.2. Otherwise zero scaffold, mixed metaphor, or register drift; closure image remains sharp.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: analog tape + drone surveillance + lagoon starlight maps feels inevitable yet unseen before. Risk-taking—broadcasting private memory over emergency tower—heightens stakes without gimmickry. Transformation test fails if Mira becomes generic teen rebel; her artist’s waveform eye and grandmother’s copper stories make her singular. No derivative-premise penalty; the piece commits fully to its tech-lyric myth.</comment>
