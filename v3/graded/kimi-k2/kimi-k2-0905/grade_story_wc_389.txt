<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s loneliness and compulsion emerge through embodied memories and contradictory desires— to transmit and to erase herself. The portico choice crystallizes her earlier shadow bargains and childhood prophecy into adult renunciation with irreversible bodily cost. Moments where her hand hovers on the key or her face meets cold metal give tactile embodiment of motive. The drive lens (Situational— stance under cosmic pressure) is sustained, and the Earned Stasis reads as fully motivated.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Opening anchors “stormlit observatory above clouds, rusted dial” provide rapid who/where/why. Coherent Situational lens— pressure forces posture crystallization— holds to final image. A single decisive turn at the “enter key” delivers Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): her dispersion into static constitutes before/after legible with on-page price (“her form dissolving”). No orientation drift; mosaic shards (radio past, cobalt future) are legible under one closure effect.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Selective detail: oil on fingers, lightning flashes, crackle of radios, cobalt door humming with unheard frequencies. Observatory above clouds functions as micro-setting and emblem— isolation presses against glass. The storm’s strobes literally power the final transmit choice. Spatial choreography of “storm against dome,” “hand over enter key” remains coherent and causally active in the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake voiced early: “better nightmares might build better realities.” Each fragment of lullaby tightens the cost of revelation. One escalation beat— Elara’s decision to broadcast— narrows all options to becoming the shadow that teaches. Concrete felt price: her erasure legible on the page (“dissolved”) reweights world stakes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</question><comment>Theme is emergent: “no allegiance except the variant ones we choose.” Reconfigures cliché of sacrifice through specific ritual of uploading self into static. Subtext carries in gesture— laughter “like breaking glass.” Final image reweights prior “ancient shadows” into new covenant. No moralizing, a non-literal resonance through concrete image of the girl in the basement feeling less alone.</question>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</question><comment>Lyrical density and compressed syntax serve character (“gritty whimsy bubbling up like blood from a bitten tongue”) remain under Elara’s POV lexicon. Patterns of radio static / glass shards create rhythmic motifs; interior monologue is consistent. Experimental compression (“temporal addresses”) is taught early and intelligible at payoff. No head-hop, voice coherent under stress.</question>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Sentences are crisp at pressure (“She hit the key and walked toward the cobalt portico”). High information density— each clause performs characterization and plot advance. Occasional lyric overdrive (“cobalt glass shards in her mind”) stays within pattern taught early. Minor moment of metaphor density mid-stream is isolated and does not blunt final cadence.</question>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fusion of solarpunk prophet myth with analog dread feels inevitble and specific. Subversion of “propaganda trope”— the broadcaster self-annihilates to offer permission rather than ideology. No close echoes to existing stories; details (cobalt door of frequencies, static laughter) transform. Risk distinction earned within band.</question>
