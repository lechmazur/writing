<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lira’s interior contradiction—pacifist schemer—surfaces early and drives her to accept her shadow rather than defeat it. Embodied gestures (palming the broken music box, palms to the shadow) give interiority concrete weight. The final refusal to carry the box back out crystallizes a credible renunciation, its price visible in her leaving the lesson behind. Micro-shifts (shadow softens into her younger face) mark the moment when the choice irrevocably narrows her path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands clean: Lira’s kneel to herself reconfigures the sanctuary into stillness, cost exacted in shared silence. Drive is Accumulative/Textural—each broken click deepens the pattern until memory saturates the ghosts and her shadow. Early orientation is taught through “reality shifts around her”; the wavering geometry serves closure, not confusion. The shift from lullaby vibration to silence provides on-page reweighting; no causal turns are required under this lens.</comment>

<comment>The sanctuary is rendered as a dynamic organism: walls breathe to silk, floor becomes lake—objects respond to thought. The broken music box functions as micro-setting: its snapped pins and dying heartbeat govern tactile choices. No white-rooming; every sensory detail is filtered through Lira’s body—hand clutching, cellular memory surfacing. Final still horizon caps the transformation of environment into moral landscape.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Dominant stake is Lira’s gambit to make memory outweigh vengeance; the tightening occurs when she must metabolize her own anger. Escalation is steady accretion: each memory summoned returns a shadow echo until Lira cannot outrun her echo. The still horizon that ends the story is not a truce but a suspension earned by shared cost—no option for easy forgiveness is left open.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Theme emerges organically: memory is not eraser but solvent—vigilance passes through grief and recrystallizes as shared burden. Final image (three silhouettes against unsteady horizon) reconfigures the premise without dictating any moral. Subtext lives in gesture (palms on shadow) and object (left-behind box), never in articulation of message.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Lyrical third-person limited clings to Lira’s senses; phrasing like “cellular memory flow both ways” is kept within plausible reach of an intuitive scientist rather than clinical jargon. Compression in the final paragraph (“the lesson was not in the sound but in the willingness to keep turning the damaged wheel”) delivers epiphany via image rather than exposition.</comment>

<comment>Prose keeps precision without ornament: “jagged pins plucking the air where strings of mercy should be” is taut sensory metaphor free of purple drift. Loop screen clean; no synonym churn or filter-verb stacks. Momentum sustained by short stacked fragments accelerating into “walls softening from stone to silk” then exhales into the longer final cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Few writers dare pacifism enacted as literal biological intervention in ghost memory. Each transformation rule (walls breathing, objects reappearing) feels discovered on the page rather than imposed. The broken music box re-threads the classic wound-object into a device that works precisely because it fails to play—fresh without gimmick.</comment>
