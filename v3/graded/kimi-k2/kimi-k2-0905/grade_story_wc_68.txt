<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Caldera’s refusal of vaccines and micro-dose immunity is dramatized through embodied action (tasting sewage) and carries visible social cost; her final public warning crystallizes a stance earned by prior choices. Interiority is specific, never diagnostic. The femur-cog stylus is a charged micro-choice that reweights the object and her resolve.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Caldera’s surfacing with the counter-narrative sheet cements a public stance that forecloses reintegration. Causality is tight—every descent beat (mapping tunnels, prying tablets, carving lead) directly enables the final ascent and speech. Lens is causal throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The drowned marble domes, rusted pipes, and burial sump are filtered through Caldera’s biased perception; each detail constrains movement and choice. The femur-cog stylus fuses body, tool, and setting into one charged object that drives the final act.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth versus sanctioned denial—tightens with every layer Caldera peels back. The act of carving the counter-narrative is a decisive, irreversible escalation that publicly forfeits her anonymity. Cost is immediate and visible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the tension between sedimentary denial and abrasive honesty; the final image of the cog-in-femur stylus reweights the entire narrative without moralizing. Subtext operates in silence: the crowd’s recoil is the only answer given.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Caldera; perceptual signature is distinct—mechanical metaphors of gears, tides, and strata mirror her mind. No head-hopping. Compression and lyric pattern are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence layers image and motion. No loops, no mixed metaphors. The cadence accelerates during descent and steadies at the final line, mirroring the dive-surface arc.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The fusion of plague archaeology, sewer philosophy, and clockwork imagery is non-obvious and fully committed. The counter-clock narrative carved into lead feels inevitable yet fresh, a synthesis that could not be transplanted to another setting.</comment>
