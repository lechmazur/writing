<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Jonah’s grief-driven return and gift of the ouguiya feel lived, yet Mara arrives engineered to mirror his ritual with little friction or status clash; the two voices begin to separate only at the spiral scene, so their shared calm reads as convenient echo rather than crucible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Earned Stasis—each relinquishes a token and walks opposite ends—cost legible and reconfigures the loop; causality holds but the chance coupling on the same night stretches coincidence more situational than earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lion-car interiors, peeling posters, spiralled currency, charcoal square—each object anchors a choice and the final fire’s blue curling respects spiral’s edge, a charged environmental micro-setting; diction avoids tourist excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Grief vs startup failure braid as mutual reflection, tightening through spiral ceremony and mutual gift; pressure is steady but lacks escalatory spike beyond symbolic exchange—decisive renunciation is felt, though stakes rest more metaphorical than visceral.</question>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Themes of cyclical legacy and controlled exit emerge from image and gesture, not sermon; final east-west walk gives resonant non-literal weight to “breaking the circle,” though an earlier tonal statement (“the world itself were considering its next confession”) teeters on overwrought.</question>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Melancholic lyric texture is character-consistent, with syntactic breathing that rises/falls like dusk air; occasional purple flourish (“polished calm lived between drip of rust”) but rhythmic control keeps psychic distance stable.</question>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Economic diction with sensory precision, only minor loops (“polished calm” twice without fresh angle); final sentence breathes once, breathes twice, sighs—a tidy cadence that lands without muddle.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Circus-grief-startup triangulation gives fresh axis; currency spiral as ritual map and charcoal tee as portable relic are specific, non-obvious tokens; premise could not swap names/places without loss, meeting transformation test.</question>
