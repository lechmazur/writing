<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Asha’s shift from radical preacher to Iron Cradle is embodied in tactile micro-choices—fingers reading shattered glass, placing tesserae—each carrying visible cost. The internal contradiction between remembered idealism and present renunciation is dramatized, not labeled. The earned renunciation at dawn forecloses her former path with felt weight.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each collected tessera tightens the pattern of forgetting until the final mosaic reconfigures the city’s relationship to memory. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the living constellation of fragments crystallizes mercy-through-forgetting with undeniable conceptual cost. The 49-day frame and 49 tesserae create a cadence shift that reweights the stake.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The ruined plaza, minaret base, and cracked stepping stone are not backdrop but tools—each fragment constrains Asha’s movements and charges the final map. The “shattered sky” and fractured Merciful Judge constellation mirror the internal fracture without overt symbolism. Micro-setting (tessera edges under fingertips) functions as tactile arena.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—how to wield memory/forgetting mercifully—escalates through each shard gathered: every tessera forces a choice of what to release. The mother-burning-book image tightens the moral calculus; Asha’s final act forecloses her prior absolutism with visible social cost (exile, legend). Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the concrete: knowledge as both burden and fuel, mercy redefined as selective forgetting. The final constellation offers a resonant, non-moral answer—viewers choose which held object to see—without authorial sermon. Aberrant mercy is earned through the mother’s guilty relief and Asha’s own complicity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is character-specific: tactile, spare, yet lyric when recounting fire memories. Perceptual signature—“fingers reading history in shattered glass”—remains consistent. No head-hopping; the collective “they” at the end is cleanly external. Rhythm modulates with pressure, tightening as dawn approaches.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and consequence. No loops or scaffold; “map of forgetting” is coined once and charged. Metaphors (knowledge as blade, tesserae as days) are precise and integrated. Final paragraph crystallizes without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The premise—using broken mosaics to build a cartography of forgetting—feels fresh and inevitable. The transformation of the Merciful Judge constellation into outstretched arms re-visions justice itself. Risky structure (legend after her departure) pays off by universalizing the act without diluting Asha’s specific cost.</comment>
