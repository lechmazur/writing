<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Queen's arc from sceptical ruler to fatalistic guardian of memory is fully embodied; every beat trades certainty for cost, earned in the final crown-burn. Imperfections are hairline slips in pronoun drift that don't breach causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Time-loop as memory-bleed is cleanly causal; the shared exhale repurposes dream as past guilt, driving a single irrevocable choice. Closure lands on-page with visible crown-weight cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Cobalt grotto and bleeding starlight act as living pressure plates—cooling her lungs, pooling forgotten names—directly enabling the final sacrificial act. Sensory filter remains character-biased, not tourist-cam.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mystery of existential erasure escalates under situational lens; each climb step narrows options until coronation equals erasure. One tightening turn is sufficient for tight scope.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Queen’s amnesia as civil forgetting resolves into deliberate crown-feeding; theme loops back on itself without sermonizing. Subtext carries in gesture rather than label.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Fevered lyricism mirrors queen’s dwindling breath; microscopic POV-slippage into cosmic overview is taught early and coherent. Filter verbs don’t tilt voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dense metaphors are purposeful—starlight as memory drip, ember as slow hearth—without clouding causal clarity. Occasional template cadence in “until” clauses keeps it from 9.0.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Circular reincarnation premise reframes trope into inevitable myth; firefly coda stitches risk and coherence in final image. Risk distinction applied for summer-warming foreshadow bleed.</comment>
