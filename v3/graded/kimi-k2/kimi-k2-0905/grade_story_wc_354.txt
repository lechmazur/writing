<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The tutor’s interior contradiction—grief for lost status versus exhilaration at a larger board—remains vivid and embodied in the stone’s dent. Micro-choices (aligning blood-iron with the field, stilling the thumb) externalize the conflict without therapeutic gloss. Exile is accepted with visible cost, satisfying Earned Stasis, though the leap from personal loss to “teach the world” is asserted more than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of silence→correlation→transposition tightens once when the electromagnetic hum resolves into readable “notation,” reweighting exile from end to opening. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the nexus walk-away crystallizes new agency with the stone’s dent as persistent constraint. Cost is legible in the final line—“darkness lit by certainty”—a conceptual repricing that forecloses return to the academy.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Magnetic nexus is more than postcard: its invisible geometries physically tug his blood-iron, guiding the decision to stay or leave. Twilight’s purple shimmer and crystallizing air are filtered through chess perception, integrating setting into cognition. The basalt stone acts as micro-setting, its evolving dent tracking time and erosion of former identity, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—redeem exile by finding a new student—emerges late but is compressed into the final beat where silence-correlation forecloses retreat. Pressure tightens once: the “window before the next phase” converts static grief into urgent forward motion. Cost is felt in the acceptance of teaching outside legitimacy; no reversal, but a meaningful deepening under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme—beauty forged in difficulty—emerges through chess sacrifice re-applied to political exposure, never stated outright. The eclipsed covenant image reweights from noble scandal to cosmic game, inviting reflection on larger boards. Final smile carries hopeful melancholy without moralizing; ambiguity lingers about who the “final student” will be.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyric third-person adheres to tutor’s perceptual signature: electromagnetic fields parsed as notation, silence as position. Syntax lengthens with clause-stacked crescendos then snaps short (“He turned”), mirroring strategic calculation. No dialogue, so voice remains pure interior monologue; diction stays within educated but not ostentatious register. Patterned elision (“thirty-two pieces…infinite variables”) is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentences open with prepositional fragments, participles, concrete nouns. High density: one sentence often layers sensory data, memory, and strategic metaphor. Minor loop risk in “beauty in the difficult” refrain, but each recurrence adds conceptual weight rather than paraphrase. No mixed metaphors or register drift; closure line is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fusion of chess pedagogy with geomagnetic anomaly feels fresh; exile-for-truth trope is re-angled through cosmic board expansion. Specific detail—basalt dent, algebraic notation, Lord Ashford’s political sacrifice—grounds abstraction. Risk: late leap to “teach the world” could tip into grandiosity, but stone’s dent anchors personal scale. Transformation test passes; story would collapse without chess logic driving every beat.</comment>
