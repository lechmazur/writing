<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (writing death vs craving healing) are embodied in the tremor of ink-stained fingers and the weft thread burning. The night-long vigil kneeling by the dried fountain makes her Earned Stasis—laying down the notebook for the first time in seven years—credibly painful and visible. Interiority stays concrete (“she understood suddenly that... this wasn’t thread but extracted presence”). No stock phrasing; every beat tilts present stance via micro-choice (winding, naming in dirt, planting last inch).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is Charged Poise: final dawn dissolves the garden shadows into words she authored, “absence became presence.” Each twist of the thread unravels a former absence and reweaves it into luminous memory; cost is dramatized in the inch-by-inch vanishing strand. Accumulative lens holds throughout—pattern taught in leaf-spelled names, climax reweights the same pattern into lived geography. No causal leaps; every turn is legible from initial pulse of thread to final seed in soil.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The garden isn’t backdrop; dried fountain, bare branches, and autumn leaf-mandala constrain pace—she must kneel, work before dawn. Thread as micro-setting weaponizes tactile warmth against her palm, later planted as seed, charging closure. Spatial choreography tight: three continents compressed to a single night kneeling. Sensory hierarchy filtered through her obituary eye—everything reduced to patterns of words—so season, soil, and shadow all feed her vocation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can absence be made bearable before she boards the “last ship.” Pressure tightens each winding: thread shortens, memories lengthen. Micro-turn at recognition she was her own first client, forcing her to trade notebook for soil—felt cost is the notebook left empty. No coincidence; agency lies entirely in choosing to stop writing and start planting.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme of curated absence vs inevitable presence emerges wholly through action: each name written in dirt embodies moral calculus of “chosen ending.” No articulated moral; instead, garden spells its own epilogue in fallen leaves. Subtext in final image: obituary author rewrites her own life into growth rather than erasure, resonance built on prior thread-seed motif.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Lyrific, accumulative sentences mirror carpet-weaving motion: winding, unmaking, planting. Vocabulary controlled to lyrical yet concrete registers. Rhythm crests and subsides with her exhalations of recognition. No dialogue required; internal voice stays specific and sensory throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Diction lush but every sentence carries dual freight (e.g., “extracted presence of every person”). Minor overwriting in first paragraph (“shadowed garden,” “ink-stained fingers trembling”) but tightens under pressure. Each image accretes meaning: fountain, leaves as letters, thread as lifeline. No loops, paraphrase, or scaffold—propels to final line.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Obituary writer who writes futures, not pasts: fresh frame. Weaving literal thread into living carpet stitches magical realism to grief work without gimmickry. Every trope (vanished clients, reverse aging, shadow-portals) is transformed by specific vocational logic. Culminates in self-obituary inverted into growth: bold structural choice that feels inevitable.</comment>
