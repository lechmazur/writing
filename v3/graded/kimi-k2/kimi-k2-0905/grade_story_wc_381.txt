<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The summoner’s interior contradiction—yearning to end the prophecy yet hoarding its final sphere—grounds every beat; the swallowed galaxy literalizes cost in bone. Micro-choices (placing, lifting, swallowing the cranes) chart a credible arc from vigilance to self-imprisonment. Emotional embodiment stays specific: “tasted copper,” “cold gripping ankles,” never label-speak. The smile that “stayed” is earned renunciation, foreclosing future intervention with visible weight.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the swallowed sphere of hush rotates inside him, a permanent, private cost that reconfigures the world’s soundscape. Causal chain holds—each crane multiplication and spoken “.” directly repels the cricket-drum code—until the final image of birdsong free of code proves the decisive change. Orientation anchors within 50 words; no lens ambiguity. Persistent constraint (internal galaxy) shapes tactics and final walk-away.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Brook, moonlight, and paper cranes function as micro-setting: water temperature grips ankles, reflection geometry births new cranes, constraining the ritual’s success. Sensory hierarchy mirrors POV—soundless ripples, copper taste—never tourist catalog. Spatial choreography is clean: kneel → place → step → lift → swallow → wade ashore. The swallowed sphere charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—silence the prophecy—signaled in line 4; pressure tightens when prophecy fights back as cricket drumbeat, forcing the summoner into the brook and the final spoken “.”. Escalation is causal: each mapped hush coordinate births more cranes, narrowing options to ingestion or failure. Cost is visible: internal galaxy forever orbits his heart, a lived constraint. No coincidence resolves; agency drives every turn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from action: silence as active, weight-bearing practice rather than absence. The swallowed sphere reframes tranquility as “mastery of blaze,” a resonant re-pricing without moralizing. Recurring cranes shift from gift to prison, charging closure. Subtext in birdsong “stripped of hidden integers” offers non-literal proof of victory yet perpetual private burden.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person POV stays tight to summoner’s perceptual filter: “terrestrially cosmic” diction mirrors his vocation, never drifts into editorial. Rhythm accelerates under pressure—fragments when drumbeat nears, then lengthens post-silence. Patterned elision (“.” as gate) is taught early, paid off at climax. No head-hopping; psychic distance controlled.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence detected. Figurative language is dense but purposeful—each metaphor (galaxy of absences, vacuum inside scream) reweights the stake. Zero paraphrase loops; every line advances image or causality. One near-mixed metaphor (“terrestrially cosmic mirror”) remains coherent within POV lexicon and does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Folding silence into origami cranes to swallow a prophecy is a fresh synthesis; the inverse-word “.” as weaponized punctuation feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking—lyric accumulation rather than causal reversal—heightens meaning without obscuring clarity. Specificity of “babies cried in binary” grounds abstraction in lived dread. Transformation test fails: story collapses if cranes, brook, or sphere replaced.</comment>
