<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The locksmith’s contradictory impulses—yearning to speak yet muzzling the cub—are dramatized in the mirror-shatter beat; the DNA-passport beat fuses body and tool, making the renunciation of her name feel earned and costly. Interiority stays concrete (“mouth full of constellations, throat scar glowing”) without label-speak. The only minor slip: the years-erasing corridor is summarized, not micro-chosen, slightly blunting the cost calibration.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each image (ivy keys, ink torrent, scar collar) layers density until the mirror-shatter reconfigures meaning with visible cost—loss of name and memory. Vega’s hint is seeded early and paid off in the ear-shaped keyhole, satisfying causality under lyric logic. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the scar hums, constellations rename Vega, futures scatter—cost is undeniable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Frost-slick marble, ivy leaves shaped like keys, and the ear-shaped keyhole micro-set the third gate; these tactile specifics constrain her choice of confession-without-language. The velvet pouch and lock of hair evolve from tool to scar, charging the final image. Spatial choreography stays clean through the spiral corridor and mirror-shatter; no white-room syndrome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—free the idea or remain muzzled—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens when the mirror demands she surrender her name to break it. The disorientation beat escalates by erasing years, foreclosing safe return. Cost is legible: name lost, memory scattered, scar humming—persistent constraint shaping future silence-as-song.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the cub’s muzzle-to-ink transformation: freedom is chosen noise, not silence. The scar-collar and renamed constellation reweight “improbable longing” without moralizing. No thematic echo; the final sentence reconfigures rather than states.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice maintains perceptual signature—cosmic scale filtered through locksmith’s tool-centric attention. Rhythm modulates: long breathless arcs mirror corridor spiral; clipped final line crystallizes stance. No head-hopping; compression (“she walked, each step erasing a year”) is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative language is patterned (keys, locks, stars) and never muddled. High density: “torrent of black ink… filling her with every word she had swallowed” performs triple duty—action, emotion, concept. No artifact touches closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>The lock that demands confession-without-language, the DNA ribbon passport, and the name-for-longing trade synthesize fresh mythic logic from familiar tropes. Risk—erasing protagonist identity—heightens stakes without gimmickry. Transformation feels inevitable: cub to ink to constellation keybearer.</comment>
