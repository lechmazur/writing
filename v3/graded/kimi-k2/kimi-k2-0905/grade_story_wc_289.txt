<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The ghostwriter’s interiority is embodied in sensory detail—her “bones lighter” after the nest is converted—and the contradiction “other people’s hearts / her own unaddressed” tightens choice. Every handling of the twig, temple floor, or flying letters reveals motive shifts under pressure. Final renunciation of the secret-keeper role carries visible cost when the words “I am here” brand her skin; earned endurance, no tidy epiphany. A minor 0.2 slip: the “inevitably whimsical” label never charges tactics and feels externally attributed to the moment of laughter.</comment>

<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout: each spiral of color or letter folds the ghostwriter deeper into accountability until the projected threads reassemble as a tiny beating heart and the final sidewalk words appear without causal explanation, a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is anchored in the first line (“after the cloud bursts…”) and space/sound remain legible; no penalty. Closure unit — the open door declaration and answered hush — has clear conceptual cost: the public claiming of her own words after years of anonymity. Thread, temple, letters, and final sidewalk declaration interlock as re-used anchors with no prop drift.</comment>

<comment>The moon-white stone petals, floating pontoon chimes, and marble warm under palm are both sensorily vivid and materially constraining: the chime marks her step hesitation, the warmth transfers centuries of vows into her, charging the final confession. Setting never merely decorates; the petals flex at the same instant she chooses to sign her words in public. A single 0.1 slip for “prismatic quiet” recurring thrice without additional pressure at closure.</comment>

<comment>The dominant stake—renounce ghost anonymity and publicly own personal truth—intensifies via the loom’s red thread fraying into anonymous letters then tightening around the twig; each chromatic sentence returned to its author removes a layer of protective concealment until the only option left is self-declaration. Cost is visible: twig crumbles, doves scatter vows, skin bears text like temporary tattoo she cannot retract. No extraneous stakes dilute pressure.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges organically from motif recursion: hidden love letters, secret threads, and public confession weave into a meditation on authorship as risk. Final lines on the bench and the “hush of color across still water” serve as non-literal answer—risk of being real reconfigures world as open door. No authorial statement, only re-pricing of secrecy.</comment>

<comment>Luminous lyric third-person deep POV with deliberate compression: “prismatic quiet” taught as pattern of colored light released by motion; “rose bleeding into gold” sustains the same syntactic breath unit. No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains the ghostwriter’s narrowed senses of temperature, light, texture with “warm marble vein.” Final sidewalk sentence retains identical compression: “I am here” printed without commentary.</comment>

<comment>Rhythm modulates with beats’ emotional cadence—petals flexing, doves scattering—never sliding into template syntax. Density high: single images carry multiple functions (the thread as pulse, vessel, fate). Mild loss of 0.3 for one metaphor chain “tiny spinning galaxy of fiber and memory” verging on purple; still legible under closure.</comment>

<comment>Fresh synthesis: re-inscription of discarded bird-nest as cosmic loom yields startling visual, reinvents love-letter ghostwriter trope without cliché. Thread-as-tale conceit transformed from generic fate motif into material negotiation under public art rule-set. Risky lyric ending trusts reader with open door; payoff feels inevitable without contrivance.</comment>
