<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Corwin’s trembling grip on the ink-stained bottle and his choice to uncork it into the press give us one clear, embodied micro-choice that alters the world; interiority stays concrete (“heart a cracked chase”). Yet the mirror-keeper is only a disembodied warning, so relationship-as-crucible and status pressure are absent, and no contradictory impulse is shown in-scene—he moves straight from desire to act without visible hesitation or cost to self. The arc lands as a credible renunciation (he forfeits the safety of the perfect library) but the cost is more cosmic than personal, so the felt price is present yet not sharply internalized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure is a crisp Resonant Reconfiguration: the library folds into a private sigil and Corwin steps onto cloud, eternity compressed into one skipped heartbeat—cost legible, lens (Accumulative/Textural) stable. Causality is taught early (“only in the hour when frost…”) and every beat adds density until the spiral frost rewrites itself; no teleporting props or outline drift. Orientation is taught by line 3 (floating deck, crystal fruit) so the waiver applies; the final image recharges the frost motif, satisfying the pattern payoff.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Glass orchard, cloud-sea, and steel-orchid press are tactile, selective, and filter through Corwin’s printer-perception (“gears petals, platen a stamen”). Frost patterns evolve from readable code to spiral exit sign, constraining the final step onto cloud; the library’s fracture song carries childhood minutes, marrying sensory hierarchy to emotional stakes. Spatial choreography holds as the deck lists and ballast-books slide; no white-room syndrome. World rules stay consistent—glass fruit ripen with stories, numerals tick—learned through action, never dumped.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“compress eternity into a moment”—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightens when the press bites the paper, destabilizing the perfect system; options narrow from “preserve the library” to “walk the cloud-sea.” The rupture is driven by Corwin’s agency (he uncorks, he feeds vellum) and the price—library collapses, keeper dissolves—is on-page. One meaningful deepening suffices for 700-word scope; coincidence complicates but does not resolve. Cost is cosmic, not personal, keeping it just shy of the visceral band required for 8.8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the tension between perfect systems and living rupture; no character states the thesis. The bottled whisper, frost grammar, and folding sigil form a sparse motif set that reweights at the end—his name now writes itself on untouched panes, inviting the next rupture. Ambiguity lingers: is compression liberation or vandalism? The final image answers non-literally, offering conceptual repricing rather than moral. No sermonizing or echo phrases; insight stays rooted in specific printerly action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Corwin’s perceptual filter—ink stains, type slugs, frost as copper wire—no head-hop. Syntax grows clipped under pressure (“He uncorked… The press responded…”) mirroring the accelerating collapse; longer lyric lines return for the cloud-walk, showing rhythmic control. Diction stays within a printer’s lexicon (em/en spaces, platen, composing stick) without jargon spill. No dialogue, so voice distinction bullet waived; internal voice remains singular and consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence or paraphrase loops. Figurative density is high but patterned—glass/copper/orchid/press metaphors interweave without mixed-vehicle clashes. Information density strong: one sentence often does two jobs (“glass apples cracked, revealing seeds of ticking numerals”). No scaffold, no filter-verb stacks, no register drift. A single typo-risk homophone—“breathe” for “breath” in the penultimate line—stops just short of 9.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The floating library of crystal fruit that ripens into stories is a fresh synthesis; the letterpress as steel orchid converts a familiar machine into organic threat. Risk-taking—compressing eternity into a heartbeat, walking on unsaid words—pays off in a legible closure image. Tropes of reality-rupture are transformed through printer-specific specifics (type slugs clinking like bells). The premise could not swap names/places without collapsing; the entire conceit is irreducibly itself.</comment>
