<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Interiority remains specific ("centuries of longing condensed into dew") and contradictory (tired yet climbing), but cost of centuries is conveyed more in abstract than embodied. Only late action—peeling postcard, sealing bloom—feels earned on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Earned closure lands the conceptual repricing: centuries of insomnia become a living armistice engine. Linkage across shards is lyric, not causal, but the final image reweights every prior moment with undeniable cost. Occasional orientation flickers ("postal stars collapsed") do not break frame.</comment>

<comment>The cathedral shell functions as crucible, body, and recording device; limestone, dew planatarium, and pearl chamber each shape what can be attempted. Spatial anchors (tower, apex, sand) keep motion legible and climax is charged by the structure itself.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>One dominant stake—relieve insomnia, end war cycles—is signaled early. Tightening occurs when postcard forces the literal planting; cost blooms in glowing walls. Agency is decision + renunciation; felt price comes through centuries surrendered.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Thematic question of inherited pain and its transmutation emerges from concrete objects (postcard, bloom). Closing image reweights the concept without lecture. Cherry pits sprouting future armistices is earned resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Poet’s perceptual signature is distinctive: tasting syllables, spiral arms cradling blooms. Rhythm and lexicon adapt fluidly to the lyrical register, no POV drift. Voice coheres under lyric compression.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose has natural ear rhythm and high compression: most sentences do double work (image + character tilt). Occasional ornate cluster (“reef-shadow joy colored by coral bruises”) risks overwriting but remains brief. Zero scaffolding breaks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: insomnia as generational sentinel armistice factory, gargantuan shell as living archive, postcard as literal seed. Concept feels inevitable in hindsight and risk elevates stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
