<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s embodied grief and tactile listening are vivid; the needle-to-memory beat crystallizes her arc. Interiority stays specific, never lapsing into label-speak. Relationship with Temen is spare yet charged, each gesture tightening stakes. Earned stasis lands when she welcomes raw grief, cost visible in the drum pressed to her chest.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the backward lullaby and newborn drum fuse past and present, making silence resonant. Causality is lyric-accumulative; each vibration rewinds memory until grief arrives with felt cost. Orientation is immediate; cavern anchors hold. Lens—textural accumulation—stays coherent to the final heartbeat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Cedar-and-goatskin cavern is rendered through touch and scent, never postcard. Micro-setting of brass phonograph and drum frame constrains choices—every surface transmits vibration. Spatial choreography is clean; bodies and tools track believably. Weather (frost, snow) intrudes only to mirror thawing numbness.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—defeat emotional numbness—tightens via each tactile vibration. Backward lullaby escalates stakes by forcing Mara to feel what she cannot hear. No external antagonist; pressure is internal and coherent. Final beat pays visible price: raw grief replaces numbness, foreclosing emotional anesthesia.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of listening through skin emerges from concrete action, never stated. Subtext pulses in gestures and reversed breaths. Final image—drum heartbeat against snow—reweights silence as living resonance. Avoids moralizing; complexity lingers in the cost of feeling.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is tactile, compressed, and rhythmic; sensory verbs replace abstractions. POV stays tight to Mara’s perception; no head-hopping. Dialogue is gestural, economical, and subtext-rich. Syntax mirrors vibration: short percussive clauses accelerate with scene tension.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet lyrical; every sentence layers scent, texture, or motion. No loops or scaffold. Metaphors (needle as filament of hush) are precise and paid off. Rhythm modulates naturally—long breaths for grief, staccato for filing metal.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Premise—deaf musician rewinding grief through vibration—is fresh and grounded. Tropes of grief therapy are inverted via physical sound. Risky lyric structure holds under pressure. Specificity of 78 rpm shellac and brass phonograph roots invention in lived detail.</comment>
