<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The scavenger’s interior contradiction—clinging to a broken camera while surrendering his mapped future—drives every beat; the final shared dissolution of the undeveloped squares makes the cost of his eroded ambition legible. Ghost-self as externalized conscience forces a micro-choice (breaking the wheel) that forecloses both nostalgia and cartography. Emotional embodiment stays concrete: “cold in my ribs” rather than labeled regret. Voice remains singular, never lapsing into diagnostic self-talk.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the frozen lagoon crystallizes shared erosion, wave mid-ripple becoming Charged Poise that reweights prior images. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each camera click adds density until the pattern break (snapping the wheel) halts motion without progress. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) taught by word 50 via “03:17” timestamp and floating deck; deliberate disorientation later pays off in the upside-down star projection. Cost is visible in the dissolving bench and the lone boarding at 03:27.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The obsidian mare functions as micro-setting that literally anchors the negotiation while cloudwater thickens into recording medium, constraining the final choice. Sensory hierarchy mirrors POV bias: hot brass hiss against cloudwater, salt-burnt smell of undeveloped night. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from carousel platform to mirrored walkway to center horse; no impossible shifts. Environment evolves—cloudwater freezes mid-ripple—charging the final image with conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—negotiate with own ghost to redeem or relinquish eroded ambition—signaled in paragraph 4. Escalation is textural: each spilled slide increases density until the lagoon freezes, foreclosing further negotiation. Protagonist agency drives the decisive pattern break (shattering wheel). Cost is felt in the dissolving bench and the ghost’s farewell wave, narrowing future options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: cartography fails against a moving sky, so shared erosion becomes the only map. Subtext operates in gesture—ghost hand passing through ticket-stub coat—implying empathy’s backward travel. Final image of dissolving bench reweights earlier bench slide without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: is stasis or surrender the earned wisdom?</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person voice carries a distinct perceptual signature: time tasted backwards, names spoken in hiss. Compression (“syllable of my own name spoken backwards”) is taught early and paid off at closure. Rhythm modulates with pressure—short clicks accelerate, then fracture into stillness. No head-hopping; ghost voice flickers but remains external, maintaining distance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence. Metaphors stay coherent—cloudwater as silver glass recording motion—without mixed vehicles. Information density high: one sentence often performs atmosphere, stakes, and sensory cue. Minor scaffold: “cloudwater” repeated three times in 40-word span, but pattern serves accumulative lens and does not obscure closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise—post-apocalyptic carousel above dead ocean used to negotiate with one’s younger ghost—feels inevitable yet fresh. Risk-taking (time running backward, undeveloped night as currency) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Transformation test fails if names/places swapped: obsidian mare, cracked camera wheel, and salt-burnt squares are irreplaceable. Specificity anchors universals of regret and self-revision.</comment>
