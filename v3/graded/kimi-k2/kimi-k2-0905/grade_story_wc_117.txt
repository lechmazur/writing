<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction (past/future, motherhood/healer roles) is dramatized throughout; the eclipse alignment demands her renounce certainty for wonder, an earned stance with felt cost visible in the resonant final image.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal strand is continuous: the eclipse mechanics govern tempo, the curl anchor to first astonishment reweights stakes, and the final note fays into Cloaked Blaze—clear DC at totality closes under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Listening Stone and silver sage are more than backdrop: their heat anchor and leaf silver-flash constrain body posture whistling and visually reconfigure surreal stakes, charging the closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The dominant conflict hinges on rekindling wonder across a generation at the eclipse moment; the shared sensory link raises cost, narrows magic’s deliverability, and crystallizes the single-unit escalation into totality.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Ordinary magic as a fragile belief system is tested and redefined when children see color stream from fingertips—an image that reweights the valley’s techno-fatigue; the thread charges the closure without a stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Lyrical compression (“moon’s hush, sun’s blaze”) braids sensory registers; POV retains therapist’s perceptual signature under eclipse stress, culminating in a micro-ellipsis at closure completed by shared heartbeat realism—no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>High information density with rhythmic phrasing (“deliberate steps thumping softly”) and clean zero loops; figurative language serves the beat, not décor.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>A non-obvious synthesis of music therapy with planetary alignment binds wonder and collective moment; the rooted sage-leaf voice feels inevitable under eclipse logic, adding inimitable specificity.</comment>
