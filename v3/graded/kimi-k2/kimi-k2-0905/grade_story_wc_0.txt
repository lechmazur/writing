<question>1</question>
<grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Mara’s interiority is anchored in sensory detail, but her contradictory impulses stay largely intellectual; the climactic renunciation earns traction from earlier beats, yet the cost feels more stated than embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Causality holds across a single scene; the butterfly-dust mapping to the pulsar data culminates in an earned Conceptual Repricing—watching the next storm rather than fleeing it—with the cost legible in her relinquished urgency.</comment>

<question>3</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The ruined greenhouse performs micro-setting duty, offering a cracked teak bench and fern-frond cradle that anchor every tool and sample; its progressive collapse shadows Mara's emotional surrender, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>One dominant stake—seeing change as accumulation rather than drama—tightens through one meaningful fractal overlay; the conflict is internal, but pressure holds and culminates in a stance crystallization where escape is foregone with visible consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically via micro-structures of scale and decay, culminating in the quiet reweighting that “drama is optional; change is not.” The message avoids overt statement, lingering as understated resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Free-indirect style stays consistent and textured; scientific diction retains poetic pulse (“cobalt fire,” “kindled humility”) while filtering everything through Mara’s perceptual signature.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Clarity is high; no loops or scaffold. Occasional stacked modifiers (“catastrophe is never a single frame...”) risk density overload but remain legible under pressure and do not dull the closure.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The pulsar-neuroscience-butterfly conceit is specific, lived-in, and necessary; removing any layer would collapse the intellectual architecture. The quiet inversion of global catastrophe into microscopic accretion feels fresh and inevitable.</comment>
