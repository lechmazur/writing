<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The lore-keeper’s hereditary charge and final refusal of power give her a clear, embodied arc; the “bridge” renunciation is earned. Interiority stays concrete—palming the wall, forehead to stone—yet some beats slide toward label-speak (“responsibility for maintaining the delicate balance”). No contradictory impulses are shown in-scene; the turn is declared rather than dramatized. Still, the single-POV pressure holds and the crown’s weight supplies a felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: she sits, crown settles, kingdom memory flows—cost is visible in the weight and smile. Causal chain (flake → map → door → spiral → throne) stays intact; each step is triggered by her deliberate use of prior gains. Orientation is clean within 120 words. One micro-turn suffices; no lens ambiguity. The ending’s “invitation not absence” reconfigures the premise with conceptual cost, meeting the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Paint strata, bioluminescent fruit, and ruby mortar are filtered through her tactile goal-directed action; the waterfall’s color-shift clock tightens choice. Spatial choreography is coherent—torch, door, spiral—no floating rooms. The throne-room ruby scale charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ constraint. Selective sensory economy prevails; no exposition dumps.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“until sunrise to find the stairway”—is signaled early and tightens via waterfall color shift. The spiral ascent narrows options from search to acceptance of bridge-role; price is the crown’s historic weight. Escalation is linear, not multi-reversal, but sufficient for 800-word scope. No off-stage rescue; causality intact.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: stewardship over conquest, future through past. The crown’s reassembly and her renunciation reweight earlier murals without moralizing. Final smile at “beautiful absurdity” offers resonant non-literal answer. No thesis statement; ambiguity remains—she is both keeper and throne—inviting reflection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to her perceptual filter; diction skews archaic-technical (“plasma torch,” “quantum key”) consistent with hybrid world. Rhythm modulates—long sensory lines vs. clipped “She stepped”—mirroring ascent tension. No head-hopping or register drift. Voice is distinctive without mannerism.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and propulsive; mixed metaphors are few. Occasional stacked participles (“painted by hands that had actually witnessed…”) slightly bog mid-section. No loops or scaffold in final third; closure image clear. High density overall; minor tightening would reach 8.5+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Familiar quest tropes—hidden heir, scattered crown—are re-cast through spacetime-bending architecture and a refusal-of-power ending that feels inevitable yet fresh. Ruby flake as 3-D map and paint-layer chronology are specific inflections not swappable with generic equivalents. Risk in blending magic-tech pays off. No close echoes of famous scenes.</comment>
