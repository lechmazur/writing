<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ellery’s grief is embodied in tactile ritual (the blower, the tunnel) and his contradictory need to both summon and accept absence is credibly maintained; the final kneel-and-whisper beat earns the shift from denial to stewardship of echo. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak. Only the wife’s off-page chuckle feels slightly convenient, not forced through his crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each sonic layer (engine, echo, laughter) tightens the stake of restored sound until the blower’s dying cough leaves a charged silence that reweights the premise. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Ellery does not get Quinn back, but the tunnel now holds an after-image whose social cost is legible in the waking suburb. Cost is visible: he kneels, relinquishes the cord, and accepts echo as proxy. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The tunnel as concrete throat, the blower’s cracked handle, and the empty hourglass form a micro-setting triad that constrains every sonic experiment; spatial choreography is immaculate (leaves, lights, dog bark ripple outward). Sensory hierarchy mirrors Ellery’s engineer-grief: mechanical howl first, then the impossible giggle. Final image of wind passing through the tunnel’s “organ pipe” ribs recharges the setting with earned poise.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore lost laughter—signaled in paragraph 1; pressure escalates through three sonic intensifications (cough → roar → lullaby) that each narrow Ellery’s options until the only remaining agency is to let the engine die. The tunnel’s echo complicates; it never solves. Visible price: public exposure (porch lights, dog, wife) and the final relinquishing of the cord. One meaningful tightening suffices; it lands.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of absence-as-void into absence-as-resonant-container; no character states this axiom aloud. The hourglass, blower, and tunnel accrue meaning through sonic displacement rather than symbolic tagging. Final whispered “Keep it safe” reweights the empty glass from terminus to vessel without moralizing. Complexity remains: the laugh is both real and not, a haunting the neighborhood now shares.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays latched to Ellery’s engineer-bereaved perceptual filter; diction (“macerated itself against his ribs,” “concrete throat”) is character-specific, not writerly flourish. Rhythm accelerates with blower RPMs, then exhales into longer cadence as engine dies, mirroring grief arc. No dialogue, so voice purity is uncontested. One micro POV slip: “the house itself exhaled” is metaphorical enough to pass.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image, sound, or emotional stakes. Figurative language is spare, precise, and physically coherent (“frantic ballet,” “glass marble dropped onto tile”). Read-aloud rhythm modulates from staccato pulls to legato lullaby without drumbeat monotony. Opening and closing lines bookend with glass-and-wind motif, creating propulsive ring-composition.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The leaf-blower-as-organ-pipe conceit is fresh, yet grounded in credible grief ritual; risk is high but never gimmicky. Transformation test fails if Quinn’s laugh is swapped for generic “voice,” proving specificity drives the piece. No derivative scent of workshop template; the suburban tunnel locale and sonic physics feel discovered, not assembled. Small deduction for echo-haunting trope being familiar, but execution transcends it.</comment>
