<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and embodied; the keeper’s contradictory impulses (to remember yet release her name) act in-scene. Micro-choices—pressing the mica to glass, driving shards into ribs—reveal hierarchy of values. Final renunciation of spoken name is earned by prior pain and felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the realm’s dawn becomes self-sustaining because the keeper’s blood-mica lens refracts collective song. Causal chain—lullaby → chorus → rupture of night—holds without gaps. Cost is visible in scarred ribs and shattered window.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Greenhouse’s inverted orchard and quicksilver roots are filtered through keeper’s urgent perception; every detail (chiming pomegranates, ticking seeds) constrains tactics. Final sunlight pouring through seared holes is charged by prior darkness. Spatial choreography remains coherent across mirrored planes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—rekindle the realm—is signaled early and tightened when silence severs dawn-weave. Escalation driven by keeper’s agency: each sung line narrows options until blood-mica fusion is the only path. Cost is visceral and legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of communal memory emerges from concrete events: songs once knit dawns, silence unravels them, restored chorus re-braids light. Final image of villagers teaching children the songs offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; perceptual signature filters every image through keeper’s sensory bias. Patterned repetition (“woven dawns,” “quicksilver dreams”) is taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; distance remains intimate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and propulsive; figurative language is purposeful, never ornamental. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances story or atmosphere. Metaphors (moths against glass, tarry vines) cohere with physical logic.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise—mirror world where reflections ripen into realities—is non-obvious and fully committed to. Synthesis of alchemy, memory, and song feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
