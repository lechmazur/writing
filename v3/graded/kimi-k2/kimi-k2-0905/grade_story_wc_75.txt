<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Aurelia’s interior contradiction— cataloguing vs sharing— is embodied, paid off in the final kneading of “H” for home. Chen voices resist stereotype, Mei’s loaf offering crystallizes a turning point, and Grandma’s barb (“rescuing you from forgetting”) stings with earned cost. One slip: emotional intensity swells into lyrical summary at “rescue wasn’t something that arrived—,” a micro-draft rather than moment-by-moment micro-choice, tempering the cap.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: Aurelia’s decisive renunciation of curator stance (setting down opera glass, taking up dough) constitutes an earned shift under the Accumulative/Textural lens— culture is revalued from artifact to communal act. The because/therefore chain holds across early cataloguing → dream dread → joint ovens → shared bread. No orientation drift, legible transitions, and the final image crystallizes stakes with visible cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Selective, textured specificity— “flour whitening her dark hair like premature frost,” crystalline limestone acoustics— anchors bodies and tools spatially and reweights meaning. The waterfall’s roar evolving from menace to lullaby constrains communal singing. One missed high-band gate: no single object constrains choice directly at closure; the opera glass fades rather than enacts.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving culture) escalates from passive waiting to active communal creation. Middle-deepening occurs when Chen family seizes the education center, narrowing options and imposing real resource demands. Final cost— Aurelia abandons objective observer role— is legible, though the price feels more conceptual than viscerally material, just shy of high-band gate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Emergent theme— culture as living practice, not museum relic— refrains from overt statement, crystallizing in the final image “art was... a lifeboat.” Subtext pulses in the exchange “You think we’re the ones being rescued...”. No thematic drift; ambiguity persists cleanly, inviting reflection without imposed moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Purposefully lyrical, textured voice— “museum city resonant like frozen waterfalls of memory”— remains consistently rooted in Aurelia’s heightened perception. Cadence modulates with scene pressure. Compression of time/space is legible and taught early via single paragraph montage (“three seasons since...”). No head-hopping drift or register dissonance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is vivid, propulsive; sentences layer sight, sound, and scent. Micro-scaffolding lurks in lyrical loops (“rescue... rescue... rescue...”) but never obscures clarity. One mixed metaphor— “rosewater dread” — edges into purple, mildly cooling density under peak stress.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Invents fresh synthesis of art-as-relief-in-displacement; museum rescue plot flipped on its head. Non-obvious reweighting of opera glass from seeing tool to transparency metaphor feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking (lyric collective voice, displaced persons self-organizing) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
