<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Hoshiko’s interiority is textured with dye-master perception, but the final purpose-shift—"teach others to disappear"—reads as declared epiphany rather than an act preceded by visible stakes or contradictory choice; the donor heart drives memory surfacing well, yet the moment of stance crystallization lacks prior tension to pay visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds cleanly. Closure lands in resonant reconfiguration: "ready to illuminate the story-ways for others" crystallises purpose; cost is echoed in the quiet loss of self-collection. Transitions between memory, wing, and painting are mosaic-taught by repetition of "dissolve / illuminate," keeping legible. Pattern suffices for short form.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Floating rock, tea steam, morpho scales—each element constrains attention and serves the final “disappear” instruction. Sensory detail is selective and biased by dye-master perception; the tethered silk, vapour blooms, and sun-track projection all charge the closure image effectively.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</question><comment>Dominant stake—why people magnetise stories—remains stable and gathers density through repeating ghost-images. No mid-story tightening that narrows option; instead the pressure accrues by revelation. Sufficient for 600-word scope, but lacks visible trade-off to drive higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</question><comment>Theme emerges: porous hearts as channels, not vessels. Achieved by mirrored dissolving of wing and of owner, then echoed in tea-steam dragons growing downward. Avoids thesis-speak near end; final folded painting gestures resonance without moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Lyrical compression taught early—“quietly explosive sparks beneath her ribs” signals micro-episodic mode. Free-indirect style stays close to Hoshiko’s dye-master attention; no head-hopping. Rhythm modulates with valley-mist inhalations and releases, mirroring ascent/descent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm breathes with scene altitude—steam blossoms, cable creaks—creating line-level lift. Occasional ornate stacking ("valley-mist wonder thickening") grazes density cap; figurative muddle stays below threshold and never touches closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of magical-floating teahouse as memory lab, morpho-as-map, and heart-transplant as story antenna is imaginative and specific. No close echoes; core risk—lyric non-causal piece—pays off in final image.</comment>
