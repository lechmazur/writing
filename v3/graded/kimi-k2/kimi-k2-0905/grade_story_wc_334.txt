<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mara’s choices progress from passive curiosity to active reclamation. The slice of the mushroom is the earned reversal, crystallizing her refusal to forget. The line “the chronically curious ache…suddenly quiet” embodies cost in the body.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Drives on a tight causal arc: discover ring → read bruises → face sextant → slice mushroom → memories return. Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration: “stars realigned” reweights meaning and memory repossessed; the final image of the hand “offering back the rain” carries conceptual and emotional cost. Lens is causal without drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The greenhouse’s drowned orchard, whale-bone ribs, and peach chandeliers are concrete, sensory, and constrain choice: she works under suspended roots, treading the fungal rings. Micro-setting (sextant shards reflecting her face at seven ages) directly charges the finale.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“remember or release”—intensifies as each memory surfaces and then is reclaimed. The reversal (reject the final forgetting by cutting the ring) narrows options to one path with visible price; the mushroom withers and ship timbers sigh accordion-like.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</theme><comment>Theme of memory-as-currency and the peril of chosen forgetting emerges through image and action. The rhyme about stars hiding in fungus becomes literal, then reweighted: “curiosity is just memory trying to find its way home” arrives without preachiness, fully earned by the orchard immersion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</question><comment>Unequivocally singular POV; voice filters everything through Mara’s folklorist attention—salt, leaf anatomy, Gaelic phonemes. Rhythm and diction stay particular and pressurized: “roots dangling like chandeliers of wet rope” internalizes tension while remaining vivid.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Prose is lush yet propulsive; every clause performs double duty. Near-echo “accordion’s last chord” threads back to father’s song. One minor surplus line (“the greenhouse air tasted of crisp nostalgia, cider and rust”) edges toward overdescription—only thing preventing 9+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>Folk-lore meets underwater greenhouse is fresh, non-obvious, and internally coherent. The fairy-ring-as-memory-bank and inverted peach-tree inversion generate original imagery that remains grounded. Crucially, the inversion pays off: the sextant shards mirroring her seven ages feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>Mara’s hands-on tool choice—to slice instead of surrender—creates the decisive beat that ends the theft trajectory.</grade>
<question>9 B</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>Ring appears early, governs middle (exchange temptation), serves climax as both threat and resource when sap is bottled.</grade>
<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</question><grade>“Decades later” frames stakes (childhood theft) but is passive backdrop; the immediacy of the scene reduces its causal pressure slightly.</grade>
<question>9 D</question><grade>8.8</question><grade>Curiosity as both superpower and flaw: drives her here, becomes cost when the sextant inhales her questions.</grade>
<question>9 E</question><grade>8.5</question><grade>Act of detecting—reading bruises and sextant shards—is the trigger that turns discovery into action.</grade>
<question>9 F</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>Constellation sketches guide her final alignment; their mid-story recall and final re-map memories.</grade>
<question>9 G</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>Setting constrains every move: salt-water air, submerged ceiling orchards, and creak galleon bones push her toward the ring.</grade>
<question>9 H</question><grade>7.0</question><grade>Phrase “when habits break” thematically charged but never explicitly time-stamped; functions more as metaphor than lived clock.</grade>
<question>9 I</question><question>9.2</question><grade>Desire for stolen memories is internal fuel and external threat; every beat (glove tremble, sap vial) dramatizes urgency and cost.</question>
<question>9 J</question><question>8.8</question><grade>Nostalgiac tone colors each description and modulates to bittersweet after she reclaims memories; accordion-sigh underlines the final release.</question>
