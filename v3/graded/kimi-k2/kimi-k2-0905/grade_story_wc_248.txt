<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Ember’s pyromania-as-epistemology is vivid, but the interior shift from “burn to destroy” to “burn to reveal” is declared rather than dramatized in a single, pressured beat; the grandmother’s deathbed whisper does the motivational lifting while Ember’s on-page micro-choices stay static until the final paragraph. The embodied emotion (“volcanic tenderness”) is repeated so often it becomes a label, not a felt contradiction. Because no secondary character shares the scene, the crucible is purely internal—acceptable, yet the text summarizes the stakes instead of forcing her to test them in real time.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the tapestry reweaves into the grandmother’s face, reweighting every prior arson as curated revelation. Causal linkage holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each artwork’s chemical trace functions as a breadcrumb—but the story withholds the concrete moment Ember deciphers the final coordinate, softening the decisive change. Orientation is waived because deliberate disorientation (soot, darkness, perfume) pays off in the glowing tapestry image. One loop of “volcanic tenderness” in the final third keeps the score sub-8.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The archive is evoked through scent (lavender-sulfur), temperature (warm threads), and bodily movement (fingers tracing soot), all filtered by Ember’s pyro-poetics. Spatial choreography is clean: archway → niche → collapse. The tapestry fragment acts as micro-setting that literally reconfigures in her hands, satisfying the 9+ gate. A single over-worked phrase—“volcanic tenderness” repeated four times—slightly dulls specificity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover the truth behind the burnings—is signaled early and tightens when the self-portrait map reveals itself. However, the escalation is narrated rather than tested: we are told the archive’s collapse “fulfilled its purpose” but never shown Ember choosing to let it fall or risking entombment. The cost (loss of the physical archive) is off-stage, so pressure peaks one beat short of the final image.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme—destruction as preservation—emerges organically through the tapestry’s reweaving and the chemical-coordinate device; no character sermonizes. The final image of Ember’s “face now complete” offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. One near-echo of the prompt’s “volcanic tenderness” in the last paragraph nicks perfection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tightly fused to Ember’s perceptual filter: heat, ash, chemical scent. Syntax lengthens under emotion (“her fingers tracing the soot-stained walls with volcanic tenderness”) then compresses at the reveal (“The fire remembers”). No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero. Repetition of the signature phrase four times edges toward template cadence but remains within tolerable pattern.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong information density—each sentence layers sensory, symbolic, and plot function. However, the metaphor “volcanic tenderness” is mixed (volcanoes are not tender) and appears four times, creating a loop that dulls the final beat. A single paraphrase pair—“burning bright in her memory where no fire could ever reach it” immediately after “illuminate rather than consume”—subtracts another notch. Otherwise rhythm modulates well and propulsion is high.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The arsonist-as-curator inversion feels fresh, and the chemical-coordinate cipher is a specific, non-obvious device that grows naturally from character obsession. The civilization that burns its own history to thwart invaders supplies a crisp conceptual hinge. Risk is taken with lyric repetition; while not fully transcendent, the synthesis is memorable and transformation-test passes—this plot could not swap names and still function.</comment>
