<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interpreter’s silent renunciation of the shard is earned: her prior insight causes the decisive turn. Interiority is embodied (“serenely electric pins that mapped constellations across her skin”). Dialogue is absent yet the psychic distance stays coherent.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elegant closure lens: causal Accumulative → lyrical final image requeues static. Setup–middle–payoff gates all present; the moon frame anchors who/where/why by beat three ("lunar perigee tugged").</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Radio-tower gorge constrains choice: cantilevered sway locks tactics, lunar pull widens channel for silence. Micro-setting (Hollywood sequin atop coil) charges final sunrise. Specificity > breadth.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Shard escalation follows pattern-break: silence eats thunderclap, then cocoons transmissions toward rebirth. Serenely electric vacancy visibly narrows options; tangible cost (gold sublimates into light).</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: gold fame renounced to locate the beginning in hush. Final image reconfigures endings as folds; no tidy moral, only hinge logic felt at cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Lyric third-person free-indirect style stays clean; rhythm compresses under pressure (“creaking as lunar gravity stretched”). No head-hopping; diction within lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Zero loops—high density (“sunrise bottled inside vacuum tubes”). Metaphor stream coherent: shard=cocoon. Filter-verb stacks absent: verbs strong, props tactile.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Specific synthesis: celebrity detritus transformed into cosmological seed. Tower-as-bridge concept feels inevitable; risky lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmicks.</comment>
