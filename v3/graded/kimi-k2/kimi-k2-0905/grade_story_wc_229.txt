<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical but interior conflict stays at abstract “soft vs. shout” metaphor rather than embodied choice. Micro-beats (vial kiss, cork release, palm pressure on railing) are tangible, but higher-stakes decision (abandon foghorn?) is merely implied, not dramatized with visible cost. Relationship crucible absent; mother off-stage, no second character. Earned stance exists but emotional cost stays muted—feels like lyric contemplation rather than irreversible choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Tight, continuous scene; causality reads as Accumulative/Textural—each pulse of scent/light layers pressure until final reconfiguration achieves Charged Poise. Orientation held within 120 w; anchor iron door, spiral stairs, garden gate. Closure image—water prism—reweights prior pattern: mechanical light now learns heartbeat. Cost legible in “unbearable love” freighted onto beacon rhythm; no cap-level flaws.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Environment (cobalt iron, salt air) and micro-objects (vial, coral rail) constrain choice and are repurposed at closure. Setting details integrated through senses—sudden dawn coolness releases scent molecules that literally carry intent. Garden becomes active agent. Minor slip: lighthouse interior details stay painterly rather than instrumental. Final prism effect qualifies constraint gate.</comment>

<grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake declared early: proving whisper > shout. Escalation is emotional accumulation, not causal narrowing; no material obstacle faced. Stakes remain metaphoric; lack of external opposition or visible tradeoff flattens pressure. Closure is earned, but cost is ethereal—felt, yet not materially dramatized—thus band holds below 7.0.</comment>
<question>5</question>
<grade>7.9</question>
<comment>Theme of transmission-through-tenderness emerges organically from sensory particulars without overt moral. Subtext in gesture (hand not waving but beckoning) crystallizes into final image of boat altering course due to vibration. Micro-epiphany on mother’s transformation survives as ambiguity without tidy resolution. Avoids sermonizing; slight drift toward lyrical abstraction in late paragraph prevents 8+.</comment>
<question>6</question>
<grade>7.5</question>
<comment>Lateral lyric voice with consistent perceptual signature; long rhythmic threads (cobalt—salt—gardenia—metallic) feel intentional. Filter-verb count low. Occasional elevated diction “mechanical heart learning rhythm” edges above POV plausibility, but compression serves mood. Distinct; minor register drift only.</comment>
<question>7</question>
<grade>7.3</question>
<comment>Prose is atmospheric and dense, occasionally overwriting: stacked metaphors “screaming tenderness” “ghost of every kindness” risk purple but stay legible. No template loops. Rhythm accelerates/relaxes with scene needs. Two near-repetitions of “set the cork”/“set it” could tighten but do not break clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question>
<grade>7.4</question>
<comment>Premise—lighthouse tuned to fragrant whisper—feels fresh synthesis of sensory synesthesia and maritime myth. Stakes not world-scale; risk remains intimate but coherent. Few echoes of prior lighthouse literature; freshness carried through specificity rather than scale transformation. Commitment to lyrical gamble holds without gimmick.</comment>
