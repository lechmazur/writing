<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Scraps’ contradictory hunter/curator drives compel every forward move; the limp is the visible price embedded in each choice. Kite’s tremble at the crank, the barefoot landing, the cylinder pressed to leaf—these micro-choices reveal her value hierarchy under pressure. The brother’s first words crystallize the earned renunciation: distance collapses only by naming, at tangible cost—no safety-hedging.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: “Name me and I am already home” reweights the leaf and the entire riddle-drive. The phonograph’s skipped needle that carves coordinates is the on-page Decisive Change, delivering scent-syntax usable by dog and girl. Under the Situational lens, persistent constraint—the preserved autumn—shapes every tactic until the wind shifts from gunpowder to orchard smoke, cost made unforgettable.</comment>

<comment>Selection is ruthless: “copper from iron” sniffs battlefield economy; “glass soil” and “wild hush” charge the theme without ever cataloguing ruin. The leaf’s wax pulses orchard firelight onto the hut floor—object-as-setting that literally shows the way. Distance across cracked wasteland is felt in paces, smell, heartbeat; no descriptive bloat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“translate distance into closeness”—never wavers; every beat tightens the pathfinding. The riddle is tangible pressure: answer or brother stays buried. Coincidence is avoided; the brother’s singing scent is a response, not luck. Endurance at dig-seven-kilometers extracts physical cost under the inferred Situational lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>No moral spoken; the orchard-waft after artillery is the thematic afterimage. Recurring objects—leaf, cylinder, hush—shift meaning: relic of past becomes map to future. Thematic charge emerges solely through smell-translated syntax; final “already home” resists tidy moral while reopening the war-shocked world to possibility without cheap redemption.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is canine: copper/iron ozone gradients, sweet-rot apple notes. Line rhythm accelerates with crank-crank-bark; diction never drifts into academic gloss. Dialogue is sparse, subtext-heavy: Kite’s whisper “riddle”, the brother’s echo. Free indirect slips into Scraps’ olfactory cortex without rupturing stance. Compression—wild hush, tint revelation—taught early and paid at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Zero loops; every clause multi-tasks (“bloodhound called Scraps limped between towers of rusted drones”). Metaphor density spikes yet stays coherent—“spilled blood that had decided to become a sunrise.” No scaffolding clutter; paragraph cuts feel purposeful. Voice-driven syntax remains precise under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Autumn-leaf-turned-navigation-device is wholly fresh. Recon-scented cylinder that sings in smell-language flips war-tech pastoral. Dog-as-scribe trope feels inevitable in hindsight, never contrived. Risky lyric accumulation never clouds causality; world logic holds. Specificity of cobalt breath, lithium trail stakes the story irreplaceably.</comment>
