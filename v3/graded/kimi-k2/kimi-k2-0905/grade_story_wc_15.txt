<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interiority is sensuous and consistent, yet Calyx’s internal contradiction—dream-surrender vs waking craft—never crystallizes in an on-page choice; the bleed and bloom are viscerally costed but the choice to prick palm feels pre-ordained rather than hard-won.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as earned Resonant Reconfiguration: “May what was unmade remember its name” and the orchid wave enact a legible before/after under Accumulative/Textural lens; loom sinking and footprints sealing crystallize the sea’s return without causal break.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Limited body/tool micro-setting is leveraged beautifully—illustration plate, driftwood loom, canyon’s stone memory—each constrains weaving choices and returns transformed in the final liquid mirror; specificity drives the close rather than decorating backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of restoring navigable sea is signaled early; tide-emptying is irreversible until Calyx bleeds optimistic red, narrowing possibilities; however, escalation hinges more on cosmic acquiescence than protagonist-driven reversals.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</question><comment>Theme of “repairing precedents through surrender” emerges from images of weaving and salt, not pronouncements; final image of orchids in brine reweights prior without sermon, though moment of articulated hope in dialogue nudges abstract.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.5</question><comment>Lush incantatory cadence modulates with scene urgency—“labyrinth exhaled centuries of salt”—maintaining coherent perceptual signature; single POV stays disciplined, drift and diction echo mythic weaver.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.3</question><comment>Economy in figurative layering, no scaffold loops; every clause does double duty—“inked orchids flaking into his skin like pollen”—information density and sensory propulsion intact at sentence scale.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Transforms archetype of mythic labyrinth-captivity into salt-weft cosmology; orchid-in-sea inversion feels inevitable, risk in moon-tide restoration paid without safety net.</comment>
