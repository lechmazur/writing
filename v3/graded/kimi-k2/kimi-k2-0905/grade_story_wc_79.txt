<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mother-haunted cartographer's quiet obsession is embodied in ritual pattern-song and coral collar throb; decisive turn in cracked whistle note earns closure at cost—the revelation that her mother chose horizon over home lands as earned reprise, not exposition.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Tremor pattern recognition → cracked harmonic → turtles wheel north → watcher revelation of gate’s true purpose → city turns back; each beat because/therefore linked with visible cost: future wanderers now guided toward the crack, not away.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Carapace bridges, living market stalls, geode-lit hollow, oxidized metal watchers—each tactile moment constrains choice and charges finale; turtle migration redefines horizon before abyss, bridging personal to mythic scale.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Gate closure as generational trauma; personal stake becomes collective when city lurches north; choice to play cracked pattern forces irreversible turtle course and moral reckoning; closure cost: future children will meet same choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Obsession vs. devotion to home surfaces wordlessly; final image rescales “Here Be Answers” from blank space to lived reunion inside the crack—conceptual repricing without moral preaching, dread transmuted to bittersweet lineage.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Lush, rhythmic prose mirrors cartographer’s synesthetic attention to sound-as-map; tactile verbs (“shudder,” “iron-tasting harmonics”), no POV drift, spiral-shell voice consistent through pressure peaks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Lines propel—“ink-stained thumb to nape,” “salt-crusted abyss”: sensory triads instead of filter phrases; only one mild loop in “sunwashed dread” repetition; cadence modulates with turtle tremor, no clutter in climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Turtle-city as living atlas, watchers as oxidized archives, pattern languages that are music—synthesis fresh yet inevitable; late crack that reveals mother’s fate reconfigures entire premise without gimmick, earns risk bonus.</comment>
