<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Motivation (“to reawaken beauty”) is voiced early and threads through each micro-choice; embodied emotion is vivid. Arc reaches earned renunciation (fall as wings), but some interior monologue lapses into abstract summation (“flawed genesis”), softening contradiction. Prince remains singular, no relational crucible on page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure with undeniable cost: palace begins its irreversible descent while the living ribbon escapes. Lens—textural accumulation—lands cleanly in the final image’s reweighting. All motifs trace forward without amnesia. One micro turn (ribbon unmaking gears) satisfies tightening without extra reversal.</question>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hanging citadel, stalactites, chandeliers, copper shavings, egg, moonlight prism—each functions as constraint and texture. Final fall uses suspended structure as tactile cost. No world-rule contradictions, spatial choreography impeccable.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (restore wonder vs ruin) escalates through soldered-heart beat, music necropolis raid, and cracked shell. Stakes tighten then flip—beauty refuses cage, taking palace with it. All cost is visible within 800-word frame.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from action alone: mechanization vs organic fragility. No thesis spoken aloud; final image of fall = first flight carries the idea. Ambiguity holds—mechanical remains are not evil, just exhausted.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</question><comment>Lush synesthetic diction matches prince’s febrile attention; syntax stretches without breaking. Pattern-teaches reader early (“rust wept”). No dialogue required; voice modulation under strain is consistent.</question>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</question>
<comment>Verbs and rhythms drive propulsion; occasional metaphor stacking (“bitterly sweet note of nostalgia—blue for mother’s laughter”) edges toward density but lands purposeful so near climax. Scaffolding minimal; paragraphs prune cleanly. One register drift: “Genesis Finch” legend paragraph slightly textbook; −0.3 here.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Fossil-marketed resurrection of a mythical dawn-colored finch welded onto an inverted dungeon palace—precise enough to be uncopyable. Risk (no on-page dialogue, lyric build to fall) heightens stakes without sacrificing coherence.</comment>
