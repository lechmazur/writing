<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The interior contradiction—needing to feed fear yet escape it—drives every beat; the clasp-hand-off to the gray child crystallizes self-forgiveness with visible cost. Micro-choices (skewering the photo, kneeling) are embodied and irreversible. Advisor’s hiss supplies external pressure, but its disappearance at the end is accepted because the arc is always inward. Emotional progression from frozen throat to “unfrightened heart” is credible under lyric compression.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the mirror-corridor collapses, the clasp is relinquished, and the advisor falls silent—cost paid, stance shifted. Accumulative lens holds: each distorted reflection adds density until the final intact mirror reframes the stake. Causality is lyric-forward but traceable: because the protagonist pins the cursed image, therefore the corridor of reflections opens, therefore the child-self can be met and absolved. No orientation debt; spatial anchors (clown mouth, booth, ticket counter) remain legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Funhouse is not backdrop but engine: tilted floor, sweating mirrors, and salt-dissolving glass actively constrain movement and metaphor. Micro-setting of the clasp—first heat-source, later verdict—charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy obeys crisis: candied-apple rot and copper narrow to salt and calliope as dread recedes. Environment, body, and tool interleave without static cataloging.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—trick fear into revealing its weakness—tightens when the protagonist must literally hand over the talon that once “held heat.” Mid-story deepening occurs in the photo booth: pinning the seven-year-old image forecloses retreat and opens the corridor. Cost is legible: the clasp is lost, the advisor silenced, the funhouse rendered inert. Agency remains lyric but causal under accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of self-forgiveness emerges from the image-bleed and mirror collapse rather than assertion. The paradoxical note reweights the premise—salvation already inside the fatal moment—without moralizing. Final image of “lingering luminance” reclaimed as interior light reconfigures earlier lure into self-possession. No thematic echo; resonance is imagistic and earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person voice sustains a gothic-lyric register that never drifts into exposition or therapy-speak. Syntax mirrors stress: elongated sentences in the maze, fragmentary bursts at the mirror confrontation. Perceptual signature is consistent—condensation, rot, jeweled roadkill—filtered through a single haunted consciousness. No head-hopping; advisor’s voice is externalized interiority, cleanly excised at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rhythm modulates from lullaby cadence to staccato heartbeat without mechanical patterning. Figurative language is dense but purposeful: “cotton-candy rot” compresses sweetness and decay in one breath. No mixed metaphors or scaffold loops; each image advances atmosphere or stakes. Final clause “light I finally recognized as mine” lands clean, unburdened by prior ornament.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Carnival-as-trauma-site is familiar, yet the photographically cursed booth that bleeds light into a corridor of mirrors feels specific and non-portable. Paradoxical note and dream-dictionary mechanic refresh the introspection trope without late rule changes. Risk taken in collapsing mirrors to salt dissolves setting into psyche, paid off by the reclaimed luminance. Synthesis makes the premise feel inevitable rather than borrowed.</comment>
