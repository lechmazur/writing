<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Luma’s drive—rediscovering joy through memory-exposure—is clear, embodied, and compels every choice; her micro-choices (pressing palms to cider wall, risking light-paint) narrow options and expose a tangible emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the “fold” of daydream unfolds into a crystallizing mural that rebinds joy to the wall; causality holds under Accumulative/Textural lens via layered glazes and ghost-given pigments.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fog suffocates the orchard like a living constraint; light, plaster, and color are filtered through Luma’s perception and physically guide her compression and framing. The fresco wall ultimately narrows her final reel.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Supernatural film exposure is the sole source of escalating options—and risk; the fresco fragment’s pulse triggers mural creation that forecloses other futures for Luma and the orchard.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Theme—the reclamation of unlost joy through deliberate risk—emerges solely from imagery and stakes, never stated; the final silent projection offers a non-literal answer that reweights childhood yearning.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Luma’s interior diction (“spectral dust,” “cinema screen,” “fermented stars”) is character-particular and rhythmically varied; no head-hopping; perspectival signature visible under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Compression is exquisite—sentences advance tact, color, or emotional charge; no loops or redundancy; figurative language crystallizes rather than obscures.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Synthesizes forgotten fresco, orchard fog, and light-painting into a non-obvious closure ritual; fresh, specific, and emotionally precise—risk transforms memory into mural.</comment>
