<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The statue’s internal contradiction—guard duty versus mercy—reads vividly; its micro-choice to crack the ampoule is earned and embodies visible cost as its own stone shell softens. Interiority remains coherent across telepathic chorus. The lack of a second on-page character leaves relationship crucible unused but not missed. An 8.4 with no closure-touching flaws.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure—Conceptual Repricing—lands: the droplet reweights reality under Accumulative/Textural lens, silt glittering “each mote a possible future.” Structure defaults honored; one seamless scene. Cause-and-effect reads as pattern deepening, not sequence. Cost is visible in the city’s literal shiver and the statues’ collective turning.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Garden’s spatial choreography is limpid: moonlight bruises, keystone mortar “turned to sugar,” coral shadows guide every footfall. Body-as-setting (alabaster skin softening) constrains the final choice and charges last image. Economy favors the necessary—no tourism. Sensory hierarchy stays under POV priorities.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Dominant stake—release of nuanced memory versus preservation of certainty—intensifies cleanly; the arch fissure literalizes the tightening. Protagonist’s agency crystalizes with one decisive act; consequence is felt as the city exhales. No reversals beyond necessary deepening.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</question><comment>Theme of “welcome”—door plus breath—resonates non-litigiously through the gardener’s foxglove laughter and her final wave. Subtext blooms in gesture: statues argue tomorrow rather than today. Final image leaves moral ambiguity undiagnosed; the reader inherits contradictions.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</question><question>Question 6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet exact; syntax sculpts marble syntax—phrases like “shedding flakes of calcified certainty” stay perceptually faithful to a mineral POV. Compression taught by line-break phrasings sustains clarity. No head-hopping or register drift. Slight lyric excess in “bruised glow… purple flames” nudge.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Line-level craft is controlled; density high—every sentence pulls triple duty of image, motion, cost. Only negligible artifact clusters—two stacked purple metaphors inside “violet film alive with captured twilight”—do not obscure closure. No filler scaffolding anywhere.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</question><comment>Reconfigures “drowned city” cliché into an animate memory museum. The gardener’s threading of her own recollection into liquid amber transforms exposition into living stake. Risk taken in non-causal, lyrical pattern is rewarded by resonant payoff. Specificity throughout: foxglove among roses, coral vault.</question>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Statue’s turn to act—cracking ampoule—alien yet inevitable under the new telepathy. Internal conflict (guard vs mercy) manifests in mineral softness. Closure hinges on its changed corporeality; story fails if any other figure were protagonist.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.9</question><question>Question 9</question><grade>8.9</comment>Object appears early, carried in left stone palm, used at climax against keystone seam, and its rupture is causal trigger for reconfiguration. Violet dye lingers as visual echo. Swapping ampoule for generic vial removes specificity of gardener’s memory signature. Score stays one notch shy of 9 only because its purple imagery brushes decorative.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</question><comment>Cascade of revelation is dramatized rather than summarised—each nearby statue wakes and the city shivers—so concept propels plot. The aftershock touches every calcified truth. Could lean higher if earlier beats foreshadow its physics.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.6</question><question>Question 9</question><grade>7.6</comment>Gardener’s “incisively kind” trait underwrites the city’s betrayal; gardener’s kindness threads mercy into memory droplet. Seen only via memory playback but that playback is the final beat. Trait drives stakes by refusing condemnation.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.0</question><comment>Threading memory into liquid occurs as off-screen backstory yet is felt every time violet droplet trembles. Without her act, ampoule bears no charge and plot stalls at guardianship stalemate.</question>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.0</question><comment>Keystone arch’s sugary mortar is signaled, pressure builds, and breaking droplet there causes the structural shiver. Mechanics lean abstract (“propagation through water”) yet sufficient for narrative logic. Would cap at 6.5 without earlier arch image.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Garden governs atmosphere, space, and choice: sea-grass bowing, coral vault opening telepathy. Removing the drowned location collapses the entire frame; no substitute possible.</question>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.9</question><comment>Timeframe marked by single transition from ‘after final secret escape’ to the live decision moment; urgency present but lacks granular pressure like a tide countdown. Functional but not pivotal.</question>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</question><comment>Desire to welcome nuance drives every movement of the droplet to stone; internal conflict—between duty and mercy—embodied in the choice. Cost visible in the city’s dissolution of certainties.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.8</question><comment>Animate lifeless tone stays coherent—statues weeping bronze, anemones questioning—modulating from stasis to possibility. Tone shift directly charges the closure image of garden growing again.</question>
