<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and character-specific; Lucien’s contradictory impulses around “aesthetic elitism” versus duty to speak are dramatized in the reversed memory marionettes. The final choice—writing questions rather than answers—costs patronage and reputation, foreclosing the prior stance with visible consequence. No slips in knowledge or motive: the micro-choice to burn the stick and endure the pain cements the new ethical credo.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the reversal-then-re-renunciation crystallizes the new mandate (“letter questions”) and the cost is palpable in lost patrons and ash-charged ink. Drive lens holds as Accumulative/Textural—symbolic images accumulate (ghost transmissions, stardust, ash-ink) until the final reweighting. Time and place anchored by ~120 words; deliberate disorientation (smoke marionettes) pays off inside closure frame. No orientation penalty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Decommissioned dome functions as active pressure cooker: broken panels leak moonlight like “half-lit epiphanies,” setting shapes the final act—Lucien writes letters on the curved interior in ash-ink vast enough for satellites to read. Spatial tracking remains clean; no static exposition. Setting constrains choice and charges the closing tableau, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Dominant stake—“ethical storytelling after public accusation”—tightens through the reversal ritual: first attempt at erasure reopens the question, then the micro-choice to keep ashes and ink raises tactical stakes for every future commission. Agency inescapable; no coincidental resolution. Price is embodied: pain from the stick burn and forfeited patronage; cost legible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</question><comment>Theme emerges from concrete image rather than statement: “letters large enough for satellites” and ash-ink that refuses conclusion. Final reprise—writing not answers but doorways—functions as non-literal repricing that reweights gallery quarrel and reversed memories. No moralizing summary; ambiguity preserved without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Perceptual signature is precise: urbane diction (“urbane calligrapher,” “aesthetic elitism”) and tactile specificity (“ink-stained fingers,” “grain of the stick”) remain coherent under pressure. No head-hopping; lyric compression taught via smoke marionettes and paid off in final ash-on-parchment texture. Voice distinct and consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Read-aloud rhythm: varied syntax and purposeful line breaks avoid algorithmic drumbeat; every sentence compresses meaning and tone. No loops, no overwriting in the final arc—metaphors are specific (“smoke curl into equations of regret”) and controlled. Micro-level clarity unbroken; closure image sharp.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Framing of post-argument ethical storytelling through reverse-ritual campfire stick is non-obvious and specific; transformation test passes—characters and setting are too particular to lift wholesale. Fresh inflection: using decommissioned radar dome as both literal refuge and symbolic antenna for ethical manifesto. Risk embraced yet clarity intact; originality earned rather than gimmick.</comment>
