<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Interiority is grounded in embodied memory (childhood train ride, tactile heat search) and shows contradictions between scholarly detachment and inherited prestige, but motivation is declared via exposition (dissertation, “lived to rescue”) more than micro-choices. The final renunciation is credible: abandoning family legacy by vaulting onto the semaphore, a visible, risky move we feel in the ribs as the letter presses. Still, the rational label “emotionally rational” repeats without being dramatized under fire, and one-note moral certainty edges the arc toward flat rather than contradictory. Flaws stay minor; closure cost intact.</comment>

<comment>Single-scene arc is cleanly anchored in place/time by ivy and moonlight within the first paragraph. The drive is causal: each beat is motivated by the previous (feeling tile heat → finding box → torchlight forcing leap → escape). Closure is a Decisive Choice with cost: the letter confiscated, bureaucratic danger explicit, history’s rails left behind. No teleport props, no resets; minor slippage in watchman coincidence (appears right after “unmasking time”) brushes but doesn’t break tight linkage.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The derelict station is never a postcard; ivy, soot, loose skylight glass, and semaphore arm all push choice (tile seams, climbing route, escape path). Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven: moonlit silver, torch nets—selective and urgent. Setting steers action through spatial clarity; the final image of vines tightening on obsolete dreams uses environment to crystallize closure. Micro-setting also serves: letter warmth against ribs constrains final cadence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“expose the first forged flourish to collapse dynastic authority”—remains front and center. Escalation is one sustained press: discover concealment → retrieve letter → evade night watchman; options narrow to one getaway. The cost is visible risk (leap across tracks, nettles). Coincidence (watchman arrival) complicates climax rather than resolves it. Stays within single-spot pressure needed at this length.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</question>
<comment>Theme emerges through tangible particulars: crimson petal-as-dried-blood, shedding nobility symbolized by the rosebush. No moralizing; subtext lives in image and motion (ivy editing dreams). Final reprise of the rose-blooming-again reweights history toward suspicion of beautiful myths. Yet the overt articulation “country finally learning to distrust” flirts near thematic echo, blunting resonance. Still, complexity sustained.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</question>
<comment>Third-person limited interior reads coherent and specific: tactile attention to oilcloth heat, childhood memory triggered by station scent. Diction favors precise, sensorial verbs and controlled rhythm. Only dialogue is one off-screen clang of night watchman—handled cleanly. Voice stays steady; no leakage or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.7</question>
<comment>Sentence rhythms flex with motion while staying clear; read-aloud ear test passes. One minor loop: phrases “noble lies” and “heroic meter” reused within 150 words without reweight. Otherwise high density without artifacts; no figurative muddle near climax. Tight control allows 8.7.</comment>

<grade>8.3</question>
<comment>Fresh angle: historian-as-thief infiltrating her own past to debunk national mythos. Familiar ivy-haunted ruin is reanimated through tactile, rail-specific peril (semaphore escape). Risk of genre cliché held in check by sensory specificity. Not wholly unseen, but synthesis feels inevitable by end.</comment>
