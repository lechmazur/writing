<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s interior contradiction—grief-numbed exile vs. irrepressible maker—stays embodied (laugh shocks her, hands need steadying narration). Micro-choices (burning chair, leaving dome) trace a credible arc from self-soothing to self-donation. Cost is visible: she forfeits the dome and any talismanic comfort. The beat that re-aligns “fault lines of sorrow” is earned by the prior thaw imagery and the narrated ritual.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each added object (bookmark, tape, cardamom steam) thickens the emotional density until the final renunciation reweights the stake. Closure is a Charged Poise—dome and bookmark left as “lighthouse” with undeniable conceptual cost: she relinquishes the first proof that her heart can thaw. Persistent constraint: the room now holds the only artifact of her recovery; she exits lighter but empty-handed. No causality breaks; pattern taught by first third.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Weather station thaws in real time, dripping mercury and cardamom into the air—details are filtered through Mara’s glassblower senses (color, viscosity, temperature). The swivel chair, magnetic tape, and cracked bookmark each become tools that constrain her building method. Spatial track is clean: console → floor → furnace → roof crash → exit ridge. Final image of silver puddles reflecting sky is charged by the prior metallic motifs, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“safe zone for inquiry”—tightens when she realizes the zone must stay, not flee. One meaningful deepening: narration shifts from parody to prayer, signaling commitment. Cost is the forfeiture of the dome; pressure coherent under Accumulative lens. Could use one earlier external obstacle to push her toward that choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete reversal: knowledge (forecasts, tape) is not discarded but re-purposed as structure for fragile curiosity. Final whispered invitation (“Enter, wonder, argue, forgive”) lets the reader complete the thematic equation—no moralizing. Bookmark-as-spine and dome-as-skull keep symbolism anchored in action. Ambiguity is meaningful: safe zones may work only when abandoned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Mara’s perceptual quirks (glass viscosity, scent of cardamom). Narrated stage-directions mimic the cadence of molten glass turning, a rhythmic signature. No head-hopping; psychic distance compresses under stress (“heart light enough to lift footprints”). Diction stays within her artisan lexicon; playful elevated cadence is motivated by her need to steady grief-numbed hands.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence. Figurative language is dense but pattern-taught (“mercury dreams,” “defeated army retreating”) and pays off in final silver puddles. One paraphrase loop: “weightless yet weighty” / “atmosphere of weighty lightness” costs −0.2. Otherwise high information density; each line advances image, stakes, or tool-use. No mixed metaphors or register drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fusing glassblower craft with meteorological detritus feels fresh; the “safe zone” concept literalized as a palm-sized dome is non-obvious. Thawing heart rendered as physical spring melt avoids cliché by anchoring in station hardware. Risk: lyric self-narration could read as gimmick, but here it grows from grief-coping need, so it heightens rather than distracts. Transformation test passes: swap crafts and the emotional alchemy collapses.</comment>
