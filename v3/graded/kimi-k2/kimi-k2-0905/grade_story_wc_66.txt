<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mila’s copyist precision and rosin-ink obsession are vivid; her interior contradiction—clandestine rebellion through archival discipline—drives every beat. The final endurance inside the chorded fog shows cost: she keeps copying while inspectors inhale stories, a visible forfeiture of safety. No second character on page, so relationship crucible waived; micro-choices (tuning, scraping, transmitting) steadily escalate stakes. Flaw: “she smiled” is a gestural shortcut at the climax; a hairline slip keeps her just shy of 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each night layers dust, rosin, copper, and song until the solstice chord reweights the world. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—inspectors silenced by the very stories they burned—cost legible in their ash-shedding uniforms. Orientation anchored by word 60; transitions clean. One causal micro-turn: broadcaster’s final instruction forces her to weaponise the hall itself. No plot amnesia; every object introduced (radio, rosin, stands) recurs in the climax.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The ember alcove, mist, and green dial light function as micro-setting: the dial’s glow literally guides her fingers and later becomes the planet-like afterglow that charges the final image. Copper filament woven through stands turns the pit into a tactile antenna—setting constrains tactics. Sensory hierarchy obeys a copyist’s ear-centric bias; visual details arrive as sound-shadows. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly as she pages the hall and mounts the transmit.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—smuggle narrative back into collective memory—signalled in paragraph 1. Pressure tightens when the broadcaster’s final line forces a single-night, irreversible transmit; failure means permanent silence. Cost is visceral: she sacrifices anonymity, inhales the chord she releases, and remains inside the contaminated hall at dawn. One meaningful deepening: rosin shifts from archival residue to active transmitter—an accumulative escalation that reweights the stake.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulate metaphor: dust = memory, rosin = preserved vibration, chord = reparative narrative. No explicit thesis; final image of uniforms shedding ash reconfigures censorship into fertile soil. Subtext in “mist is clouded testimony” implies collective guilt without stating it. The ending’s quiet reweighting—passersby pause as if “recalling a dream”—earns resonance through prior sensory layering.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person POV stays tight to Mila’s perceptual filter: sound precedes sight, light is measured by phosphor, emotion arrives as muscle memory in fingers. Syntax mirrors musical phrasing—cadenced, slightly elongated, never drumbeat. No head-hopping; inspectors’ POV is external only. Compressed diction under peak stress (“dial stung her teeth”) maintains voice while accelerating.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence openings avoid templates. Figurative language is dense but pattern-taught early (“mist curled like forgotten sheet music”) and paid off at closure. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or stakes. One strained metaphor—“thistled calm”—is idiosyncratic yet justified by the copyist’s tactile lexicon, so only a hairline deduction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise fuses banned narrative with pirate-interval encoding—fresh synthesis of dystopian and musical tropes. Rosin-as-ink and dust-as-archive transform familiar materials into irreversible transmitters. Risk: turning orchestra pit into antenna could read gimmick, but copper filament is grounded in tactile detail and causal payoff. Final image of ash-shedding uniforms reconfigures censorship into germination—an inevitable yet non-obvious reweighting.</comment>
