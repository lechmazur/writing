<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Kael’s embodied grief and the antique pull’s history are sharply tactile; the choice to pass it to Seris crystallizes his arc. Internal contradiction (trading relic for her release) is vivid, yet the guards lack individuation, flattening status dynamics and tempering score.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands through Conceptual Repricing—“forgiveness is not a sound but a space” reweights prior knots. Moon-phase causality is legible and sustained without teleporting props; the rope cast becomes an earned act that narrows options and carries cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The parapet stones, salt-heavy coat, mist-veiled bay are selective and purposeful; they constrain stance and shelter the final image. The micro-setting of the drawer pull itself constrains choice at the close, satisfying 9+ gate, minor slips in spatial tracking of both coastlines hold at 8.8 cap.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The single dominant stake—free Seris without a win-loss label—escalates through waxing-crescent timing and knot ritual. Stakes tighten on-page; rope’s vanishing splash shows cost. No extra reversals needed, but guards’ passive arcless presence blunts full pressure point.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: recycled mistakes as wisdom. The drawer pull transmuted key, rope knots literalize apology, the lullaby’s echo resounds without authorial sermon. No overt moralizing; ambiguity lingers—“a forge” keeps final sentence from lecture, earns high band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight and perceptual: “coated heavy with salt and regret” grounds POV voice. Elisions are taught early—“the leviathan corroded by centuries of impatient hands”—so compression is legible. Occasional elevated diction drifts momentarily above salt-stained realism, minor.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentences are dense and rhythmic—“moon remembers tide”—with near-zero loops. “Ink blooming like squid grief” risks ornate overload yet is balanced by stark “roved like siege engines.” Final cadence shift is clean; no artifact shadows closure, earns strong upper 8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</question>
<comment>The exchange ritual as lunar choreographed mediation feels fresh, not diplomatic-fiction stock. Rope ritual, antique pull, bay neutral zone together synthesize into an inventive yet inevitable gesture; only rope trope feels familiar without transformation, slight cap.</comment>
