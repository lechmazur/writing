<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mira’s kindly methodical drive is embodied through her precise line-level micro-choices: adjusting spectacles one-handed while balancing on the swaying arbor, stylus poised before every iron leaf clack. An earned change occurs when her mother’s waveform reorders meaning itself, making the seed’s transformation feel inevitable. The “touching distance” epiphany replaces clichéd grief with tangible grammar subtraction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The closure comes as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the silver bloom dropping into the mirrored sky becomes an obsidian plank that extends the bridge of haunted ambitions. Every magnetic leaf click early on spells Morse that later translates into the mother’s grammar equation under the same poles. No late rule breaks—physics remains tethered to the arbor’s sway.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>The cuneiform micro-glyphs on the filings, the obsidian-plank extension, and the slowed-heart seed form a micro-setting of iron and starlight that physically constrains Mira’s choices. These specific objects act as tactile anchors, inventing transitions between void and sky. No static travelogue; every plank’s appearance forces choreography.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Haunted ambitions escalate from labeled grief into living pattern: the magnetic arbor clicks “release,” the seed’s bloom becomes grammar, and the absent spirit is reconfigured into the shape of what lingers. Each reversal is forced by Mira’s analogical equation, not coincidence. Pressure crystallizes in the amber-cloud mirror without need for external antagonists.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The translated sentence “To leave is to linger…” renders absence as grammar, reweighting prior glyphs from sky to void. The mother’s waveform becomes a non-literal answer to grief’s physics, offering neither tidy moral nor open purge but an earned image of symmetry. Every prior detail—the iron filings, lullaby notes—charges the final reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The first-person interiority holds a distinctive perceptual signature: wind-shear units measure fear the way lullabies echo decay. No head-hopping; the magnetic arbor’s metallic bloom is seen through the seed’s slowing heartfilter. Compression and elided cuts are pattern-taught from stroke 1, paid off in the echoed equation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Lines like “knowledge fruit seed, black-purple and warm, pulsing like a slowed heart” accelerate pace without overwritten density. No loops or synonyms except one deliberate lullaby echo; every descriptive beat also propels causality. Occasional elevated diction when vehicles violate lexicon triggers a late sheepish −0.1.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The “haunted ambitions become love that hasn’t learned to change shape” is an inevitable synthesis earned by cuneiform equations and a crescent obsidian bloom. Specific synthesis; the risk of lyric abstraction heightens stakes without sacrificing clarity. No derivative templates or stock metaphors remain unaltered.</comment>
<question>9 A</question><grade>6.6</grade>
<comment>Mira’s translator identity drives setup (early glyphs Morse) and payoff (equation etched on the last leaf). One explicit beat impact when the seed asks for her sentence password; otherwise decisions land mid-range.</comment>
<question>9 B</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>The seed appears in three beats—warm palm, planting in rail joint, obsidian bloom drop—charging each with temperature and grammar. Late obsidian weight shapes the bridge extension.</comment>
<question>9 C</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>“Haunted ambitions” shift from grief label to operative pattern when formulas demand symmetry—spirit into grammar—altering live options rather than theme alone.</comment>
<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade>
<comment>Methodical kindness yields a deliberate bent-knee planting, calm humming in mid-stride; the trait constrains pace but lacks a visible cost until closure questions speed.</comment>
<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Reestablishing intimacy by translating absent voices is the core hinge; other beats orbit this drive without redundancy on the page.</comment>
<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Analogical thought appears when glyph clicks equal sky/void signs and gives birth to the equation, constraining the ascent’s logic more than mere flourish.</comment>
<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>The swaying magnetic arbor offers inverse weight and cloud mirror resources that pressure Mira’s micro-balancing; description merges with consequence rather than ornament.</comment>
<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade>
<comment>“After the spirit leaves” provides temporal tightness to origin and fruit warm-pulse countdown; sunrise-clock remains soft, time’s impact mid-band.</comment>
<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</question>
<comment>Understanding transition drives the quest but friction surfaces only at the seed-grammar reveal; interior conflict is more told than dramatized.</comment>
<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Touching distance tone lingers through image, not lesson—seed bloom obsidian image recharges earlier distance metaphors with subtle ascent modulation.</comment>
