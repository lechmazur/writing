<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Jin’s yearning for the “color of sound” fuels every move, but interiority slides toward poetic abstraction rather than embodied contradiction; the micro-choice to seal the safe and surface is understated, giving little felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Closure earns stasis: Jin’s renunciation of discovery for stewardship is legible under an Accumulative/Textural lens, but the “meteor hush” refrain risks pattern drift; a single clarifying beat showing the cost on Jin would seal resonance.</comment>

<comment>The drowned library is vivid, tactically navigated (book-bolts, air pockets, safe slot); the plankton-cloud turning lantern literalizes setting into constraint that recalibrates the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>One dominant stake—mapping sound into color—tightens with each submerged book, climaxing at the phonograph bloom; escalation is accretive rather than causal yet retains coherence and visible price in breath-risk.</comment>

<grade>8.7</question>
<comment>Theme refracts through the image of vows that stay luminous after voices drown; it avoids abstract moralizing and reframes Jin’s quest as being painted into a spectrum rather than authoring it—earned, but a hair under true complexity.</comment>

<comment>Third-person limited holds with lyric authority; diction blooms and compresses organically: “brass cold against his throat like a muted bell” sings POV texture without purple creep or scaffold repetition.</comment>

<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentence-length modulation mirrors immersion rhythm; only one looped echo (“meteor hush” x4) slightly dulls propulsion. Otherwise every image propels or recasts stakes cleanly.</comment>

<comment>Transforms the trope of “lost knowledge at sea” into an acoustic-color synesthesia quest. The bioluminescent plankton reading room feels inevitable given the premise—fresh angle executed without gimmickry.</comment>
