<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Juniper’s barefoot drift and refusal to touch the boards she laid with her father embody a believable, grief-sharpened contradiction. The interiority stays concrete—reading wind in wood, feeling floorboards “read” her soles—until the final paragraph, where “grain of our own becoming” slips into therapeutic abstraction. Motivation is legible: she returns not to find but to understand, and the renunciation of the drifting terrace costs her the childhood home. Still, no second character appears, so relationship crucible and status dynamics are N/A; the score reflects single-POV depth only.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the maze dissolves, leaving her walking forward into “necessary distance” with visible forfeiture of the terrace. Causality is lyric-accumulative; each ring, creak, and carved notch accretes until the spiral of notches yields the coordinates that let her step “through” instead of down. Orientation is taught early—barefoot girl, drifting terrace, valley of vanished labyrinths—so the waiver applies. One causality hairline: the leap from reading grain to “stepping into air” is not prepared by any prior rule that mazes can become portals, but the lyric pattern is consistent enough to carry the moment.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The drifting prism terrace functions as both macro-setting and micro-constraint: it migrates three inches yearly, creaks like a ship, and literally carries her to the western edge where she steps off. Wood grain, logbook pages “soft as moth wings,” and the carved spiral ground the sensory palette in tactile obsession. Weather is not backdrop but encoded data—tight rings for drought, swollen for flood—so environment shapes choice. The valley’s post-butterfly absence is sketched rather than seen, but the terrace’s slow motion supplies enough spatial coherence to satisfy the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake: decode what her father hid in wood so she can grasp “why thresholds feel sacred.” Pressure tightens once: the spiral of notches is found, foreclosing further search and forcing the decision to step off the edge. Cost is conceptual—she forfeits the physical home and accepts perpetual drift—but the price is stated more than felt. Under the accumulative lens, the deepening pattern of grain-reading suffices for escalation, yet the final beat would hit harder if the cost were tethered to a concrete loss on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the equivalence between physical distance and emotional becoming: mazes, weather codes, and growth rings all map the lag between loss and understanding. No character moralizes; the closest is the father’s aphorism about thresholds, which is embedded in action when she steps off the terrace. The butterfly effect is handled as lived history, not metaphorical garnish. Final image reweights “necessary distance” from abstraction to lived trajectory, achieving resonance without tidy moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tightly filtered through Juniper’s perceptual quirks—wood as text, wind as handwriting, floorboards as memory. Syntax lengthens and contracts with emotional swell, culminating in the fragment cascade of “falling not down but through.” No dialogue appears, so voice contamination is impossible. The only micro-slip is the single clause “grain of our own becoming,” which drifts into self-help register, but the vast majority of diction is character-anchored and rhythmically controlled.</comment>

<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: participle phrases layer sensation without clogging causality. Mixed metaphors are avoided; vehicles (moth wings, ship creaks, prism light) stay consistent within their domains. One paraphrase loop—“the terrace drifted… carrying her farther”—appears in adjacent sentences, costing −0.2. Otherwise, sentences perform double duty (action + atmosphere) and the final paragraph’s cadence mirrors the dissolving maze, earning high-band clearance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The corn-maze-as-weather-code conceit is fresh, and the notion of a house drifting three inches annually literalizes emotional tectonics without becoming twee. Butterfly effect is used as backstory catalyst, not gimmick. Risk is taken in the portal-like “step through” finale, but groundwork in pattern-teaching lyric makes it feel inevitable rather than contrived. Specificity of carved weather symbols in table grain keeps the concept from drifting into generic magical realism.</comment>
