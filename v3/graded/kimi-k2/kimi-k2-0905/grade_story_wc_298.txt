<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lira’s “fiercely gentle” contradiction is lived—she apologizes to bones, sags after the barter—so motive stays embodied. The narrator’s surrender of the humming memory is a micro-choice that costs, foreclosing retreat. Interiority is concrete, never diagnostic; the holes “whistle,” the silence is “cool snow.” Only the mother-hum loss is named rather than shown in the moment, a hairline slip that keeps it under 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the star-sprout emits the lost hum, proving holes must stay open—cost felt in the narrator’s new singing emptiness. Causal chain holds: card tear → memory drain → Lira collapse → sprout re-gift. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (“catacomb orchard… half-lit corridors”) and never breaks. No lens ambiguity; the final image reweights the premise under Causal lens with persistent constraint.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Catacomb orchard is not backdrop but market: roots tighten like wires, skull cradles trunk, gatekeeper skull accepts the planted star—each object constrains flee or bargain. Micro-setting (burned card, apple glow) charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV: damp earth, candle smoke, cold circle on forehead. Spatial choreography is clean; no floating bodies or props.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“patch the holes”—is signaled in paragraph 4 and tightened when the price becomes the mother-hum. One meaningful reversal: offering sunrise rejected, maternal memory demanded, narrowing options. Cost is visible: Lira’s collapse, narrator’s singing void. Escalation is single-crescendo, sufficient for 700-word scope; no false loops.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete barter: scars as doors, light needing holes. Final star-sprout reweights earlier “inlaying meaning” habit into living metaphor without moralizing. Ambiguity is purposeful—ledger stays unbalanced—and lingers. No thesis statement; insight arises from the hum returning from a skull-gate.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person voice carries a distinct dusk-lit, bone-apple diction (“fiercely gentle urgency,” “dusky resolve”) sustained to last line. Syntax lengthens and contracts with pressure; no drumbeat loops. Perceptual signature is consistent: idealist’s apologizing fingers, client’s coin-leak memory. No head-hopping; POV modesty intact—narrator infers Lira’s hollowness through her lighter weight, not mind-reading.</comment>

<comment>Sentences do multiple jobs: “She pressed the burned tarot card against the bark, whispering, ‘Every scar is a door,’” advances action, plants motif, reveals voice. Figurative language is controlled—no mixed metaphors, no purple stacks. Rhythm modulates from long breathless corridor sentences to the clipped “We stepped into the night city.” Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; opening and closing lines bookend with sonic echo.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—destiny black-market in a revolutionary catacomb orchard—is fresh, yet emotional core (trading memory for peace) is universal. Tarot card torn along burn line transforms generic fortune trope into irreversible surgical tool. Star-sprout reprise feels inevitable yet unforeseen. Risky structure—lyric accumulation rather than plot reversals—pays off in charged poise.</comment>
