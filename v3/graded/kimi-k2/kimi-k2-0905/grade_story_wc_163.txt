<comment>The astrologer's interior contradictions surface in "the rhythm of belonging among barnacled ghosts," yet her final micro-choice—silently committing to carry the city's cadence—remains credible and specific. Micro-choices (pocketing feather, striking match, exhaling through moon-pipe) are embodied under pressure. However, Vesper's echo lacks autonomous interiority; the ghost's pulse speech is too oracular, blurring relationship crucible pressure. Earned stasis reads, but cost could be sharper.</comment>

<comment>Causal chain holds: feather warmth → memory → chalk diagrams → matched ritual → exhaled ascent. Closure is a decisive reciprocation: she accepts the city's breath, then trades it for sunrise. One transition (corridor → atrium → catwalk summit) within a continuous descent-ascent arc. Lens = Causal; "automatic ascent" + torn page sacrifice reprice options with visible forfeiture. No time-space drift past first orienting paragraph.</comment>

<comment>Micro-setting of catwalk rails constrains stance; thermocline power, moon-pipe geometry, and bioluminescent copepods materially guide the final ritual. Sensory hierarchy is POV-biased: "green emergency light" versus "silver bubbles toward ceiling." Specificity anchors throughout; "gilded seats faced a stage no one could reach" charges the ending reprise. Spatial choreography remains exact—feather in pocket, catwalk treads, valve-crack act.</comment>

<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—drowned city’s ritual vs. sunrise auto-ascent—is signaled early. Escalation: "only until sunrise" tightens choices; rising copepods = visual countdown. One decisive mid-story tightening: ghost's pulse + match-strike turns passive observation into committed ritual. Cost = she forfeits recorded data forever. External constraint (facility clocks frozen) complicates but does not resolve.</comment>

<comment>"Belonging" emerges organically from reciprocal breath instead of thesis. Subtext in "memory of a match" vs. "paper bird that ignited" reframes signal flares without exposition. Murals ("whales through nebulae") layer exile without didactic moral. Final image reconfigures theme: belonging is sustained through unspoken rhythm, not ownership, with nuanced ambiguity.</comment>

<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate retains coherent stance; free-indirect texture in "her instruments stutter" grounds POV. Distinct perceptual signature—astrologer's celestial noticing vs. marine cold—and rhythmic control: sentence lengths mirror heartbeat of facility hum. No dialogue; this choice reinforces isolation. Occasional lyric elevation ("impossible depth") remains character-bound.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Prose shows varied rhythm and precise nouns—"shadowseam wonder," "salt-half-eaten catwalk." Information density is high—every sentence advances setting, motive, or ritual. Minor clumping of "chalk constellations" and "constellation diagrams" occurs mid-story; reads as thematic echo rather than loop. No muddle at climax; final line "horizon," "rhythm," and "what glows beneath" resolves by cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Frame—a drowned city as orrery whose clock froze—feels fresh. Integration emerges through character-centered decisions, not ornament. Transformation test: removing feather, copepods, or moon-pipe would collapse ritual logic. At climax, the story commits fully to its ocean-sky inversion without hedging. Subtle inflection: exiled opera house seats re-imagined as audience to abyssal stage.</comment>
