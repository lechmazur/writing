<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hurt widow-alchemist emerges fully realized: brittle interior monologue cracks open, embodied tears add exact weight to infant breath. Micro-choices—pocketing coin, gold scar to sternum—anchor twin grief and redemption without therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causality holds cleanly: each limit—name weighing, gold seam, weight redistribution—tightens because/therefore chain to closure. Closure lands as earned stasis: she learns a scale she carries is also a burden, visibly weighted.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Rain-slick anvil, still-warm steel that hisses—concrete stimuli constrain and echo inner rupture, charging the final kintsugi image. Metaphor feels inevitable rather than ornament.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can a name outweigh grief? Tightening choices weld that weight to a golden scar, narrowing options toward acceptance with a felt price. Quiet but decisive escalation.</question>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Redemption through loving fracture emerges from specific grief events; closure images the gold scar as necessary counterweight rather than moral. Theme refuses tidy moral, lingers.</comment>

<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Distinct perceptual signature: alloyist diction (alembic, calcined, ductile) remains coherent; rhythm bends under emotional pressure. No head-hopping, steady interior voice.</comment>
<question>7</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>High information density, zero scaffold or ornamental loops. Luminous regret is propelled through fresh syntax, specific steampunk tools; each sentence advances momentum.</comment>

<comment>Kintsugi frame plus factually mystical sigil-coin feels inevitable synthesis, not gimmick. Specific emotional arc transforms alchemy cliché into personal grief calculus.</comment>
