<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Interior contradictions (“jealousy of past selves,” fear of the grave) are embodied and propel micro-choices like writing on bark and stepping into moonlight. Final stasis (leaving the stone, resuming chronicling) costs her past certainty; flaw remains active. A slight drift toward abstract self-diagnosis just before the spiral entry keeps it from perfect cohesion.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: releasing the scroll to erasure forecloses escape and crystallizes resignation. Pattern taught as Accumulative/Textural under lens—image clusters reiterate until weighted final snow. One faint causality wobble: the chronology of “already seeing the grave” vs scrolling future text isn’t fully reconcilable, but the accretive logic holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Cabin, snow, stove, the stone by the vanished scroll—all constrain posture and gesture while radiating emotional tone. Moonlight “slicing snow into blue glass” charges the ending with crystallized detachment. Spatial coherence never slips; the mountain exhaled once and the reader felt it.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“will I land or keep witnessing?”—compresses to a single cost: forfeiting the scroll/ending. Escalates by pattern repetition; pressure deepens as word after word dissolves into snow. No reversals, but the choice is visibly paid by relinquishment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Theme of erasure as continuation emerges silently from scroll’s vanishment against the untouched stone. Subtextual weight is legible without articulation. Penalize minimally for overt line “every story ends mid-sentence”; a hair too overt.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Voice is textured and chronologically unstable in a way that feels authorial. Diction shifts (“jaded wonder rattling in her ribs”) animate interiority without drifting from the single POV. Rhythm propels rather than decorates; no voice leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Near-flawless line craft. Information-dense, vivid syntax (“mountain wind sounded like a page turning”) with zero repetitions. A single mixed metaphor—“time folded like badly stacked paper”—touches the closure margin, minor but not damaging.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses dream-recon ranger with recursive chronicle in a way that feels non-obvious yet inevitable. Specificity lodges the reader in cedar smoke and snowglass; generic tropes transformed through physical weight. Risk of metafictional abstraction stays grounded.</comment>
