<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is rendered in dense, embodied specifics—holding the pendant, “interrupted cadence of breath and heartbeat”—that ground every beat. Her choices (walking upstream, surrendering future time) reconfigure stakes and exact a felt cost. The final image of the sealed loop captures both renunciation and earned stasis. Minor note: the roster-sketch list in the third paragraph is a touch repetitive.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Causal linkage holds: each step upstream buys borrowed seconds that tighten the arc toward the moment she must settle her “ledger.” The giant-nap ellipsis is taught early, pays off in the time-reversal canal. Closure lands with unmistakable cost—surrendering her unspent future to uncage the last half-finished syllable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The rooftop canal is never static: water flows backward, time packets crawl like fish, cyclical bridges yawn. These details constrain choice—only by walking upstream can Mira accrue time. The final dissolve into the echo-womb is richly specific and recharged by prior images.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—uncaging the final syllable—tightens across the beat of surrendering her future time. One meaningful deepening: the infinity pendant morphs into Möbius strip price. All pressure routes through protagonist agency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—choosing which memories to let live or release—emerges from concrete beats rather than abstract statements. The echo-womb reframes loss as deliberate curation; the spared silence at the end crystallizes this without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual filter—Mira’s noticing of reverse ripples, the sigh of snow inside childhood bedroom—anchors each observation. Syntax modulates with pressure: pristine in calm beats, compressed under the giant’s inhale-exhale cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is controlled—cadence-shifts mirror heartbeat breathing. No loops; each line advances. One line of padded ancillary mirroring (“silverfish fleeing a net”) slightly softens propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fantasy premise (giant nap, sky-canals, time-pawned memories) is synthesized so organically that the ending feels inevitable. No generic placeholders and the final doorway of sound is un-exchangeable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Decisions to walk upstream and surrender future minutes anchor two beat-level turns. Anchor applied after micro later exposure but visible cost and reprise secure mid-7 range.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The pendant appears early, returns as Möbius strip that melts to settle the ledger, and is the exact object whose loss seals the ending—indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>The “interrupted cadence” is dramatized: incomplete breath and heartbeat constrain every step and decide the final offer; however, it never morphs tactics in a third distinct beat.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>“Sculpts time” manifests in paying borrowed seconds via relinquished future minutes; the mechanic changes choice-space, though its rules remain narrative shorthand rather than systematized.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Uncaging the echoes is set up via Mira’s climb and resolves the central plot thread—story would fracture without it—but is partly foreshadowed rather than reversible.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Borrowing time is explicit buy-back mechanic; its rules are signaled early and result documented at the ledger, yet the transaction itself happens in summary-off-stage.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The rooftop canal is essential: Mira must walk the wrong-way water to accrue seconds, and the echo-aviary perched above forms the natural greater history setting.</question>

<question>9 H</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The giant-nap clock constrains all action; the final exhale snaps time taut, reweighting choices and consequences with a live countdown.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Seeking the echo-birthplace is explicit desire from line one and drives every decision; friction between want (mother’s voice) and cost (absence of future life) reaches closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Quiet, wonder-inflected gothic tone modulates to stoic sacrifice and lingers in silence; consistent voice plus reprise in imagery gives mid-7 leverage but without sharp tonal swerve.</comment>
