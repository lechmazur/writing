<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maela’s interiority is vivid—her pulse syncs with the lantern’s turbine-hum, her fingers smell shipwreck and pitch—but the “perpetually learning” trait is asserted more than dramatized until the final renunciation of GPS. The driftwood carving choice is embodied and costly, yet the spiral’s moral weight is slightly front-loaded rather than earned in-scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the miniature archway becomes a pocket throat that re-weights every prior journey. Causality is lyric but legible—each chisel cut because/therefore releases a shadow-sailor, and the GPS refusal crystallizes the new map. The lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds without slippage.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The storm-tossed archway is no postcard; its basalt throat literally swallows half the horizon and later re-appears in miniature as the carved conduit. Salt spray, turbine-hum, and moonlit spirals constrain every choice, culminating in the glowing driftwood arch that must be set on the tidal line.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes tighten from “gift or geas” to “become the ledger.” One decisive escalation: wedging the slide into the driftwood fissure forces the fleet to gain weight and Maela to carve with, not against, the wood’s memory. The cost is the GPS left drowned—an unmarked future accepted.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: history is a living ledger that demands new entries, and art is the stylus. The spiral’s rotation and the sailors’ silent salute reconfigure meaning without exposition; the final image of gulls wheeling through the real arch offers a non-literal answer to the question of inheritance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is oceanic—salt-bit, pitch-dark, turbine-hum cadenced. Perceptual signature is sharp: “foam across her lenses so the world blurred into turbine-hum reverie.” No head-hopping; lyric compression is taught early and paid off in the final hush of oarlocks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet aerodynamic: “gears of salt and starlight,” “curl of driftwood fall like a word forgiven.” Zero loops or scaffold; figurative language serves the pattern without muddle. Final line—“just horizon, just wood, just the next breath of wind”—lands clean and resonant.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The premise—driftwood sculptor reads a living archive through storm-lit spirals—feels inevitable yet wholly fresh. Risky lyric structure pays off: centuries spin inside a lantern slide, then compress into a pocket arch. No derivative echoes; the synthesis of maritime myth and material craft is singular.</comment>
