<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The net-mender's interiority is textured—her contradictory impulse to mourn labor yet embrace invisibility is embodied every time she lifts or knots thread. The spiral walk and final whistle re-walk the lost path, but the change in her stance (accepting anonymity) is more asserted than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure is earned: the whisk reappears, and her final whistle reconfigures the entire parapet into an audible moon path that alters a stranger’s course. Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the pattern builds to a resonant reconfiguration with visible poetic cost: every invisible labor reshapes unseen lives.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The wet marble, cooled stones, firefly constellations, and spiralling droplets all become tactile tools that pressure movement, sight, and sound; the parapet literally conducts heat and moonlight into her choices and the oarsman’s course correction.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>A single sustained pressure—reconciling hidden effort with meaning—escalates through deepening emotional stakes rather than reversals; the final whistle crystallizes the choice with felt cost, but the shift from despair to duty reads more internal than tested.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The theme of invisible labor as silent constellation emerges organically from knots, fireflies, and whistle paths; the final image of nets storing light enacts conceptual repricing without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Lyrical accumulation is purpose-taught in early moon-path metaphors, then paid off in echoed spirals on wood and water. Compression, synaesthesia, and near-whisper cadence heighten pressure without ever breaking orientation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Sentences pulse like tide-swells, with rhythmic repetition that mirrors net-mending. Information density is high; each descriptive layer (moon, water, firefly, wind) threads into action and no line is mere scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Synthesizes mythic net-mender lore, grandmother artefact, and firefly navigation into a fresh meditation on unseen labor; the moon-path as audible stitching feels inevitable and specific to this coastline night.</comment>
