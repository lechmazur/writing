<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Myrrh’s olfactory gift and ambition are concrete from the first beat; every micro-choice (testing seed on cheek, mouth-breathing to mute scent storm) is filtered through that trait. Interior contradiction is alive—ambition loosens into gratitude—yet the shift is shown via sensory beats, not labeled. The only drag is the filial echo: the mother functions more as memory-device than on-page pressure, so relationship-as-crucible isn’t tested. Still, the final renunciation (leaving the notebook for wind-spirits) carries visible cost and is earned by prior causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (tide-thought, sap-rising, perfume arc) tightens the stake without causal reversals. Closure lands as Charged Poise—notebook wrapped, path foreclosed, serenity reweighted—cost legible in the indigo sacrifice. Orientation is taught early through scent-anchors and bridge-narrowing; no penalty. One scaffold only: “serenity within motion” is repeated mantra-like, but it pays off in the final image, so deduction stays minor.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The treetop village is never described in panorama; instead, the narrowing plank-to-twig ascent becomes the setting, constraining every footfall and forcing the graft-site choice. Olfactory micro-setting—iron, bruised banana, sweet death—acts as weather does in other stories, guiding timing and threat. Corpse-flower seed itself serves as mobile set-piece, its changing scent-state altering tactics. Final image of reversing tide re-anchors the world without exposition dump.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—graft seed before stench alerts predators—signals early and tightens through scent-clock. One meaningful deepening: ambition loosens into gratitude when village “holds still,” reweighting the cost from ego to offering. No antagonist needed; pressure is ecological and olfactory. Price is legible: ten-year bloom accelerated, notebook relinquished.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from pattern: hidden feeds revealed, motion births stillness. No character states the thesis; the notebook sacrifice enacts it. Ambiguity lingers—are wind-spirits real or merely sensitive neighbors—yet the ambiguity charges the closing image rather than fuzzing it. Almond-gum memory and smoke-wrapped hare recur with shifted valence, satisfying resonance without checklist ornament.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person hovers at a lyric distance that stays inside Myrrh’s olfactory cortex; no head-hop. Syntax breathes with canopy sway—long sentences for ascent, clipped fragments for scent spikes. Diction is botanically precise yet never glossary-like (“cambium,” “carrion promise”) because filtered through her trained nose. Compression like “tide thinks” is taught early and paid off at closure, so elision reads intentional, not opaque.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; paragraph lengths mirror altitude narrowing. Information density high—one sentence often does scent, emotion, and world-rule. Only micro-loop: “serenity within motion” appears twice close together; otherwise no scaffold or synonym churn. Metaphors stay coherent (smoke spiral, bloom exhaling birds) and culminate in the final image without purple swell.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Familiar “young adept performs ritual in living tree” is retooled through olfactory science and gift-wrapping custom, making the trope species-specific. Risk taken: entire plot is a quiet graft, yet stakes feel life-or-death because scent-clock is irreversible. Transformation test passes—swap seed, village, or custom and the emotional arc collapses. Fresh inflection: notebook left for wind-spirits turns reader into next unwraper, extending the custom beyond diegesis.</comment>
