<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority conveys Alden’s quiet obsession without diagnostic clichés—his choice to whisper at the climax, breaking his own silence, shows an embodied shift under cost. Missing contradiction between his fear of shattering the covenant and his refusal to leave slightly blunts the interior spike expected at 8+. Ghosts lack individuated pressure beyond the head beekeeper and child, reducing secondary crucible effect; still, the earned renunciation is legible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Alden seals the fracture, accepting the weight with visible cost—“pressure equal to the desert’s heat pressing against his ribs.” Lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of words increases until the final comb-covenant reweights stakes. Fracture payoff on stained glass lands cleanly. Orientation established within 120 words; no teleports or timeline breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Abandoned beekeeping frames, cracked wax, and ash-laden wind function as micro-setting that constrains; “largest hive shell” becomes sanctuary that will later cradle the box. Sensory selectivity shows ash spirals “like missing bees,” integrating action. Occasional phrase repetition (“tranquilly perceptive”) blurs specificity enough to keep outside 8.5 band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve unspoken words or watch ghosts disperse—tightens once when box pane fractures. Agency escalates through Alden’s ritual, acceptance of new ghost-child’s weight, and final sealing; cost accumulates viscerally on chest and box. Stakes remain clear and legible without external coincidence at resolution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of carrying memory as an act of mutual resurrection emerges from concrete handling of soot and silence; final “scent of blooming clover” reweights covenant from burden to reciprocal love without moralizing. Subtext thrives in gesture and object, not statement. One minor echo—”mute eloquence,” whispered again—ticks toward thematic tautology yet stays inside single-instance tolerance permitted at high bands.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person close voice holds consistent perceptual signature: ash spirals “like disappointed bees,” stained-glass hues “splintering her spectral face into violet and emerald shards.” Syntax modulates with pressure—short bursts when box inhales weight, long winding clauses during dawn ritual. No register drift or POV leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is precise, mostly artifact-free; slight density clump at phrase “weight more than stone” + “burden unspoken” in adjacent lines registers minor loop. No scaffolding or mixed metaphors. Rhythm breathes during ritual scenes without lull. Safe from any penalty at closure, so no cap triggered.</question>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Concept—burdened ghost-librarian of silence—combines fresh stakes and tangible objects (stained-glass, hive shells) within speculative beekeeping wasteland that never feels recycled. Final clover aroma transforms ash landscape to living promise, non-obvious yet inevitable from setup. Minor points deducted for thematic sentence that almost restarts premise at midpoint.</comment>
