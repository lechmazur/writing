<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s self-recrimination fuels every pivot; her choice to stop relying on metal instead of marrow crystallizes the arc. Interior shifts are embodied, not labeled, and her renunciation lands with audible cost. Flawed, specific, and irreversible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the cracked compass is abandoned, and the paddle strokes become the new rhythm. Causality locks—regret tightens into forward motion via utility-pole navigation. No exposition, only image and consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The kayak, body, and sea function as micro-setting—cold water baptism, hull slap as Morse code. Utility poles constrain direction; fog erases landmarks, forcing auditory navigation. Tactile, coherent, and specific.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Stakes escalate when regret’s backlash becomes the recalibration tool. Each pole light forecloses the former star-map, narrowing options. One decisive intensification carries felt loss.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the synthesis of broken instruments and broken selves—ambiguity lingers but the final image reweights meaning around flickering faith versus silence. No tidy moral, only embodied cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Merrily melancholic tone modulates from ironic prayer to quiet baptism in cold water. Rhythm and diction shift under pressure; no head-hopping, POV stable. Final line crystallizes the stance without explication.</comment>

<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythms mirror kayak cadence; metaphor density is purpose-driven. Only one small template cadence in peak beat; keeps propulsion. Read-aloud test passes.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Salt as percussion revisits without cliché; forsaking charts for pole lights feels inevitable yet fresh. Conceptual repricing reframes navigation as a moral act. Risk distinction in lyric-mosaic pacing charges closure.</comment>
