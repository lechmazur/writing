<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Naram-bel’s economical ardor (trading barley for a tile he hesitates to use) grounds him, and the hushed, covenant-seeking decision to guard the secret at cost earns palpable sorrow in the climactic kneel. Flaws: the sister’s “faith in math outlasting empire” arrives as label sentiment rather than embodied contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Causal drive holds cleanly: because empires erase knowledge, therefore he must act before dawn → discovers tile-as-key. Closure is decisive (kneel, vow, disappearance) with crystallized cost: vanished astronomer replaces erased chart. One micro turn in “empirical irony” feels earned.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Obsidian table, cracked lapis lions, starlit clerestory are tactile and used: dust, cedar doors, and starlight guide action and pressure choices rather than decorate. Micro-setting qualifies, but palace cube remains slightly abstract—cap 8.3.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake is protecting intangible knowledge from tyranny; dawn deadline keeps pressure legible, tile-as-key is coherent escalation. Final narrowing (eternal vigilance replacing discovery) has implicit cost, though price could be more visceral—slight reservation, high 8 band.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.7</question>
<comment>Theme of devotion to unknowing crystallizes without sermonizing: cosmic order persists beyond empires. The magic square reconfigures as prophecy rather than possession, letting ambiguity linger in the dusky aftersound—quiet resonance over tidy moral.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Third-limited stays clean; perceptual signature (“frugal astronomer,” “pale constellations of dust”) is distinct and sensory. Diction remains poetic without purple drift; slight hiccup “empirically ironic” as meta-comment, but context contains it—just under 8.2.</comment>

<grade>8.2</question>
<comment>Most sentences carry double-duty (e.g., “stone sighed; mechanisms older than language”) with varied rhythms. Occasional noun stacks (“encrypted devotion sealing uncertain futures”) verge on over-density in mid-closure, but do not obscure beat clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.6</question>
<comment>Fusion of magical square + Babylonian astronomy + political interregnum feels fresh, not ornament. The premise commits fully; transformation test passes—swap elements and the story collapses. Subtle risk in choosing contemplative covenant over spectacle pays off.</comment>
