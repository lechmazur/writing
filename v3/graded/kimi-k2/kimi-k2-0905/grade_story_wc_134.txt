<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction is dramatized in the immediate choice to accept the pearl, embodied pulse against scar. One slip: the transfer of “clairvoyance” leans label-lean (“vision fracturing”) rather than action-consequence. Relationships operate as crucible: her loss, his gain, both irreversible with embodied cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands with conceptual repricing: exit required, entrance vanished; cost is visible—“the cave sealed the transaction”. Causal lens held throughout because/therefore sequencing; choice narrows options irreversibly. Orientation crystal-clear by 120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The cave constrains every tactic—the still lake absorbs light, corridors branch “like frozen lightning,” exit vanishes. Treble-clef scar as micro-setting object charges final image under sternum-beat music. No exotic props introduced late; built-in logic of crystal acoustics governs choice pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—magnify everyday magic—tightens with one reversible-to-irreversible exchange. No reversals; one pressure point: accept pearl, lose guide. Coincidence complicates exit but is not used to resolve; price is visible (entrance gone, singer condemned). Escalation coherent under causal lens.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the transaction: surrender is the only way to enlarge ordinary beauty—demonstrated via rain-as-symphony. Final image reweights initial rumor into earned truth without moralizing. No motif flogged; pearl dissolves into skin, not lectured. Subtext in silence at vanished entrance, humming to children.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature sustained: the pilgrim’s “hear the layer beneath traffic” internal texture remains unique. No head-hopping; seer’s POV is filtered through pilgrim’s new hearing. Rhythm modulates—“glassily dark,” “luminous water absorbed”—fitting awe and pressure. Compression taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Every sentence multi-functions: sound advances stakes, description loads theme. Zero scaffold loops; syntax pulses in step with musical imagery. No metaphors violate logic under stress (“still lake… a hole in the world” precisely mirrors nullified reflection). Micro-choice beats land without padding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: clairvoyance traded away, mundane scent reborn into symphony—risky premise paid. No stock fantasy portals or chosen-one beats; the magic is attention, not wonder-drug. Risk heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; closure reconfigures ordinary commute into celestial playground.</comment>
