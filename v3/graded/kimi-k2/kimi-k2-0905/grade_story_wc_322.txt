<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Architect’s interiority is vivid—her fingers “weaving patterns into the air itself” shows embodied motive—but the composite man remains a cipher, diluting relationship-as-crucible pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: “she was the thread, the pattern, the space between” crystallizes the premise with conceptual cost. Accumulative lens holds; each gallery shift is a neuron firing toward final integration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Gallery breathes, folds, bleeds color—selective sensory triangulation anchors the impossible geometry. The space actively constrains her weaving, becoming a neural network that reconfigures at climax.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“discover the texture of connection”—escalates as each stitch alters the gallery’s living architecture. Cost is conceptual but legible: she forfeits external witness to become pure medium.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through image, not statement: connection as sinew, gallery as synapse. Final dissolution of the composite man reweights the premise without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lyric, fevered diction stays consistent; “auroras of pigment that tasted like nostalgia” is character-specific perception. No head-hopping; POV remains architect’s synesthetic lens.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density, zero loops; metaphor is coherent—“walls erupting in slow motion” sustains physical logic. Rhythm accelerates with weaving cadence, then settles into dawn calm.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Premise of dream-built gallery mapping human bonds is fresh; transformation test passed—story collapses if gallery is generic museum. Risky lyric structure pays off in closure.</comment>
