<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vespers’ contradictory impulses—thief vs. mentor, rule-breaker vs. wonder-seeker—play out in the queen sacrifice and the final gift of the lid; the laugh that “sounded like breaking seals” embodies embodied, risky emotion. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak. The passing of the lid to the child crystallizes a visible, costly hand-off of identity; the zero-shaped chess piece closes the arc with felt forfeiture. Minor slip: Halcyon’s fear-of-heights secret is told, not embodied, so the relationship crucible never fully ignites.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the sky’s “crooked seams” reweight the rule-set after Halcyon steps onto shadow stairs and the spire dissolves—cost is undeniable. Causal chain holds: sundial lid → wrong quadrant → shadow stair → lord rises → spire falls. Orientation is taught lyrically by line 3; waiver applies. One micro-turn—bishop swap—tightens options under the Accumulative/Textural lens; no lens ambiguity at end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Icebound spire, glacier chessboard, and pocket lid as micro-setting all constrain tactics: the tilting board obeys the new secret’s gravity. Sensory hierarchy skews to touch (warm pieces) and auroral sight, mirroring Vespers’ wonder-seeking bias. Spatial choreography is clean: climb, summit, descent, hand-off. The lid’s final snap recharges the opening image, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“steal what people no longer dare to keep”—is signaled early and tightened when the bishop swap tilts the board, foreclosing Halcyon’s rule. Escalation is textural: each whispered secret increases density until the sky convulses. Cost is legible: lord abdicates, spire collapses, Vespers leaves with empty pockets. One meaningful deepening suffices; no reversal overload.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of wonder-as-theft emerges through image, not thesis: stealing certainty and leaving astonishment. The zero-shaped chess piece reconfigures the premise—everything left to steal/give—without moralizing. Subtext in the backwards lullaby and “cautious abandon” invites counter-readings of risk vs. protection. Final image of crooked-seamed sky offers resonant, non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to Vespers’ perceptual signature—notes freeze into bells, sky tastes of aurora. Rhythm accelerates with sentence fragments during collapse, breathes during the hand-off. No head-hopping; Halcyon’s interior arrives only through whispers and laugh. Compression like “cautious abandon” is taught early and paid off in the stair dare.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image, stakes, or sound. Metaphors stay coherent—sky “bleeding like bruised glass” sustains the color-wound motif. No register drift; diction remains within lyric-fantasy idiom. Final line “perfect zero” is crisp, propulsive, artifact-free.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fusion of chivalrous thief with wonder-apprenticeship feels inevitable yet fresh; the chess-for-secrets economy is specific to this world. Risk-taking in the shadow-stair physics pays off conceptually. Zero-shaped closure reweights all prior steals into gifts. No close echoes; voice synthesizes fairy-tale cadence with modern compression.</comment>
