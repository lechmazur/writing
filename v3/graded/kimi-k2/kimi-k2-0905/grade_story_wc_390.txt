<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mireya’s interior contradiction—engineer’s logic vs. whale-bone grief—drives every beat; the “logically emotional” trait is lived, not labeled. Her micro-choices (bowing tempo, key in wood) externalize the hierarchy of values: town vs. glacier vs. self. The final renunciation—letting the marina live by teaching darkness to listen—costs her the key’s teeth and her own heartbeat’s privacy, a price felt on the page. Only the absence of another on-page character keeps this from 9+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the Echo is healed, the pier stands, but the key is smooth, the coat now thrums with perpetual duty—cost is legible in the cooled iron and her glacier-time pulse. Causal chain holds: because the bone cracks, therefore she bows; because she matches glacier memory, therefore shadows listen; because she sacrifices the key’s frequency, therefore town sleeps. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“creaking pier of the drift-ice marina”). No lens ambiguity; the final image reweights the rule-set—nightmares are not destroyed but acoustically house-trained.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Drift-ice marina is not backdrop but instrument: ice calving underfoot forces the climactic third-path choice. The azure coat absorbs the Echo’s thrum at the end, turning garment into portable lighthouse—object-as-setting that charges closure. Sensory hierarchy is engineer-precise: frequencies before color, torque before temperature. Spatial choreography is flawless; we track body, key, bow, bone, tilting slabs without drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—keep nightmares liquid—tightens when cracks release “micro-shrieks” and shadows form wet human shapes. The midpoint calving ice ups the ante: save artifact or save town. Mireya’s third-path invention (invite shadows to listen) forecloses both easy exits and leaves her holding a now-silent key—visible price. Escalation is causal, single-cycle, sufficient for 750-word frame.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the sonic metaphor: mercy is not silence but tuned attention to what terrifies. The spiral of whale ear-bone and the spiral of stars at the end reweight each other—absolution is an acoustic map, not a moral. No thesis stated; the final tear tasting of “salt, iron, and whale song” is the non-literal answer. Complexity is honored: darkness is not erased, only taught to listen.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Voice is engineer-poet: precise yet salt-lyric, “frequencies rather than ridges,” “logically emotional.” Rhythm accelerates with bow-strokes, then lengthens into glacier time without losing immediacy. Perceptual signature is biased to vibration—sound is color, color is torque. No head-hop, no register drift; the prose itself becomes the vibrational instrument.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops; each sentence advances image, stakes, or sound. Metaphors are coherent under acoustic physics—“pilings hum like organ pipes” sustains the sonic through-line. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves with spiral star-map that recharges whale-bone spiral. Only the density of figurative language in the calving sequence keeps this from a perfect score—one near-mixed metaphor of “altars” amid “mother whale” frequency.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade>
<comment>The fusion of maritime gothic with acoustic engineering feels inevitable yet unseen before: whale-bone Echo, frequency-forged key, nightmare-as-soundwave. Risk is maximal—teaching shadows to listen could read as twee, but the piece commits, pays off in luminous townsfolk silhouettes. Transformation test fails: swap whale for any other creature and the entire vibrational cosmology collapses. A fresh inflection that reconfigures both horror and mercy.</comment>
