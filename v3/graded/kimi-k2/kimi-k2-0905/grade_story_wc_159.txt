<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira’s interior contradiction—love for Por against the duty to erase herself—drives every beat; the foxglove-heart image embodies the cost. Her micro-choices (selecting which memory to burn) are specific and painful, and the final smile registers earned self-erasure. The only limit: no second character on-page, so relationship crucible is absent by scope.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: Lira’s name becomes the last sound, proving the caretaker must become the final extinct feeling—cost is the entire self. Accumulative lens holds: each memory-for-name exchange tightens the pattern until the silhouette is hollowed. The bamboo tube’s return in the child’s hands reconfigures the stakes for the living, sealing the before/after.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Opal library, chandelier of hollow bulbs, and glass-orchid petals are not backdrop; they supply the only means to trap sound and pay memory. Spatial choreography is tracked: mezzanine, lectern, drawers, dome—each move is tactile. The micro-setting of the cracked tube itself becomes the final conduit, charging the closing image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—save names or lose marvels—is signaled in paragraph 5 and escalates through each memory-for-name transaction; options narrow as Lira’s silhouette thins. The final bulb’s demand for her self is the irreversible tightening. Cost is cumulative and visible on-page after every sacrifice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the mechanism itself: preservation devours the preserver. No moral is stated; the child’s single note reweights the entire museum’s existence. The foxglove regret motif recurs only as lived cost, never as commentary, yielding ambiguous after-echo: remember or vanish.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tightly bound to Lira’s perceptual filter; diction (“dropped pearl,” “silk scarves through needle eyes”) is consistent with her glass-orchid sensibility. Rhythm accelerates with shorter clauses during the memory-shedding sequence, then exhales into the single floating note—voice modulates with pressure without losing clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sentences carry double duty—image and causality—without scaffold; no paraphrase loops. Figurative language is dense yet each vehicle serves the sound-as-light premise; mixed metaphors are avoided. A single nit: “audible light” is momentarily strained, but the physics is established early and does not obscure the final transfer.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The premise—names as filament, memory as fuel—feels inevitable yet unseen before. The inversion of caretaker into specimen is a fresh emotional calculus; the child’s pickup re-seeds the world without sentimental safety. Risky lyric compression pays off in the closing echo, proving originality serves stakes, not ornament.</comment>
