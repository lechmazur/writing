<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mara’s shift from detached debunker to someone who sings away her vision is visible, but the inner contradiction (“I serve truth” vs “I want my private memory back”) is summarized rather than pressed in scene. Body-level cost (color-blindness) lands, yet choice beats are slightly abstract—“admitted,” “understood”—instead of forced micro-decisions under mounting stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The Causal lens is clear: because the shell leads, therefore Mara returns to the pond; because she sings, therefore the garden archives; because the archive feeds others, therefore isolation becomes plural. The closure (Mara discards the shell, sunrise on her colorless skin) meets the Earned Stasis requirement with a visible price (permanent pigment loss). One small stutter: “shell’s instructions” are accepted on faith, not tested on-page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Rare sensory exactitude—“velvet garden… bruise,” “wisteria singing the same three-note lament”—anchors us, and the garden’s black-vinyl pond constrains the final action. Spatial anchoring is strong early, but several paragraphs drift into impressionistic light without positional markers, nudging orientation once.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>The singular stake—Mara’s right to her quarantined childhood—escalates tangibly: first she follows, then chooses the lullaby knowing color will be the fee. Only the Memory Containment Act’s off-stage nature keeps the societal pressure abstract, slightly softening the threat level.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The story threads a singular idea—“memory prefers to live in plural”—through flora that literally becomes pages. No moralizing lecture, just the closing image of strangers humming her lullaby. A single thematic echo—the three-note tune—might feel one-note, but its transformation (private song → anthem) is earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The narrative voice is lush, compressed, and never slips POV. Syntax—petals “folding into pages, stems binding into spines”—manages high lyric charge without opaque density; however, several stacked modifiers (“tragically radiant,” “ghostly resolve”) flirt with overwriting in the final third.</question>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Information-dense lines propel—“stem exhaled chlorophyll mist”; “colorless but unquarantined.” A few metaphors verge on overwriting—“trespassing inside a bruise”; “ghostly resolve” repeated—causing minor density drag without true obscurity. Near-duplicative phrasing like “resonant structures vibrating”/“resonance structures mapping” could be tightened.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>The fusion of bureaucratic memory deletion with a living botanical archive is fresh, and the shell-as-key is a specific, non-obvious object. Late arrival of “public archive blooming” risks feeling like a neat civic payoff, but the earned color-payment and communal lullaby redeem the concept.</comment>
