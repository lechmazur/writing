<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lark’s contradictory impulses—wanderer vs lantern-bearer—are dramatized in the spiral-building beat; the final card inscription costs him the safety of anonymity. Marin’s shift from guard to co-conspirator is shown through micro-choices (tearing intake forms, feeding poems to fire) rather than declared. Status swing is legible yet the “bloom” metaphor is once self-diagnosed, blunting interior contradiction half a point.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the library spared, new identity inscribed, ashes still warm—cost is the shed skin and shared risk of being caught. Causal chain (inventory ruse → Rourke retreat) is thin but acceptable under situational lens where cooperative pressure, not brute logic, rewrites rules. Orientation is taught by line 3; no debt. One tightening beat suffices; lens holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rusted beams, roof holes, potbellied stove, and paper cranes are tactically used—shelving becomes spiral nest, dictionary hides wings. Desert wind and moonlight filter through Lark’s poet-perception, guiding choices (when to hide, when to speak). The coffee tin serves as micro-setting that constrains the final identity card; environment charges closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—save the library from bulldozers—signaled early; secondary personal stake is Lark’s survival of the molt. Pressure tightens when Rourke enters; the joint bluff narrows options to stand or flee, with on-page cost of possible discovery and literal burning of past selves. Agency is cooperative, fitting situational lens; coincidence (Rourke’s quick buy-in) slightly blunts escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of “beauty clawed from anarchy” emerges through concrete acts: feeding verdicts to flames, folding bureaucratic forms into birds. No explicit thesis—final image of paper wings inside dictionaries reweights prior motifs without moralizing. Ambiguity remains: library saved yet prisoners still caged, giving resonance beyond the beat.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lark’s voice carries poet-percussion—“words arrive jagged,” “luminous fracture”—syntax mirrors half-formed skin and later steadier cadence when identity settles. Compression like “blooming resistance” is taught early and paid off. No head-hopping; perceptual signature stays consistent under stress. Dialogue carries subtext (“tasting the bones, not the marrow”) and distinguishes speakers by register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High information density: one line often performs atmosphere, metaphor, and action (“Heat licks their faces; new shadows sprout—winged, collaborative”). Rhythm modulates with tension—long lyrical coils for moonlight, clipped phrases during Rourke’s entrance. No loops, scaffolds, or mixed metaphors in peak beats; figurative language stays coherent to closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Personality-molt as prison-library survival ritual is fresh; synthesis of Neruda spine, paper-crane counterfeits, and ash compost feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk—guard-turned-ally inside carceral space—heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specific lived detail (commissary library card, green flame from ink) prevents abstract allegory; transformation test passes—story collapses if elements swapped.</comment>
