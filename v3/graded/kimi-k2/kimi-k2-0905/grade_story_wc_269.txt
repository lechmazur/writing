<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her pulse against steel, the eel waking in her chest—but the “witness” role is more label than lived contradiction; no micro-choice visibly risks her status until the final dive, so the cost feels generalized rather than personal.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The causal chain is tight: missing map → hollow echo → submersible descent → holographic reef. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—Path 27 is not erased but hidden—cost paid by Mira’s acceptance of perpetual guardianship, signaled in the resumed tapping.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Setting is selective and sensorily rich: salt-feathered paper, hollow metal, limestone ridge shaved clean. The station and ridge constrain every move; the hologram’s reef-light recharges the blank square, making environment an active agent in the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—why reefs vanish and who remembers—tightens when the atlas page’s absence forces the dive. Agency is Mira’s choice to insert the page, triggering the hologram; cost is the knowledge that memory alone cannot restore what is lost, only guard its echo.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the tension between erasure and stewardship; no moral is stated. The final image of the station as “a gate left ajar” reweights the premise: disappearance is not deletion but invitation to witness, with the conceptual cost of endless vigilance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise—“white mantis above the lagoon,” “cartographic skin”—and remains in Mira’s perceptual register throughout. The patterned tapping motif is taught early and paid off sonically at both micro and closure beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; metaphors are fresh and coherent (“reef crest where the color dropped away”). No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. The final cadence—“whatever next assembled beneath the waves would know the witness still kept time”—lands with rhythmic closure.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The conceit of a reef archived in stone pillars that answer human tapping is fresh and fully committed. The synthesis of climate grief, cartographic erasure, and ritual technology feels inevitable; no trope is left untransformed.</comment>
