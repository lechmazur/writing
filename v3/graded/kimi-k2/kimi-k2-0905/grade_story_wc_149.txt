<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The ghost bride’s contradictory impulses—vengeance and mercy—co-exist in the same beats, her “lovingly venomous” touch literalized as frost on the boy’s lashes. The boy’s inherited guilt is embodied, not labeled: pupils dilate, wrist offered without prompting. Their final exchange (“Debt is a vine…”) crystallizes a hierarchy of values: blood < seed < forgiveness. Both characters endure visible cost—she scatters to ash, he keeps a seed that will demand ordinary seasons of care—earning the closure under Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the bead bursts into song, yanks guilt out like an iron splinter, and dissolves the greenhouse into moonlight petals—undeniable conceptual cost on the page. Causality holds: each nightly cameo accelerates fruit-ripening, tightening the accrual pattern until the golden apricot becomes the single payable coin. The 120-word orientation anchor is met: ghost, greenhouse, endless night, and bead’s pulse are all spatially and temporally fixed. No lens ambiguity; the final image reweights the premise from “debt must be paid in life” to “debt can become gift if carried far enough,” satisfying Accumulative/Textural drive.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The greenhouse is not backdrop but crucible: copper pipes exhale steam that feeds silver pomegranates whose runes pulse when the ghost passes, constraining her movement and timing her appearances. The low-hanging apricot of mirror-bright gold is the micro-setting that literally ties the thread of memory around the boy’s heart. Spatial choreography is flawless—veil trails between grafted quince, bead sinks through skin and lodges against the heart wall, lantern burns without flame beneath the cot. Environment, body, and tool converge in the final image: seed pressed into lifeline, greenhouse roof vanished, dawn finally touching an ordinary horizon.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—extinguish ancestral guilt—tightens through accrual: each cameo ripens fruit faster, turning the orchard into a countdown clock. The seventh-night standoff forces the boy’s stance crystallization: coat stitched with aluminum thread hurts the ghost, yet he stays, foreclosing denial. Cost is legible—bead bursts, glass dissolves, trees wither—altering the tactical field forever. Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the single decisive intensification (golden apricot plucked) reweights the stake from “pay with blood” to “pay with sorrow distilled,” meeting 8.8+ cost test.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the seed-to-fruit arc: debts can become gifts if carried far enough, never stated outright but enacted when the cracked bead yields a living seed. The silver-to-gold fruit shift reconfigures the meaning of currency itself, a conceptual repricing that lands in the final image. Subtext resides in gesture: boy offers wrist, ghost shakes head—violence refused, sorrow embraced. No moralizing; the stranger who will one day receive the first silver apricot invites the reader to continue the chain, leaving resonance open yet charged.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Voice is lush, frost-laced, and rhythmically controlled: “veil trailing like smoke through the alchemical orchard greenhouse shrouded in endless night” teaches the pattern of stacked modifiers that never stall momentum. Perceptual signature is ghost-bound—no lungs to taste iron air, yet she remembers hush—and sustains lyric compression without head-hop. Under peak stress (“voice like broken bells”) diction tightens to monosyllables, mirroring cracked glass. Experimental elision (“she scattered, atoms of ash becoming moths”) is pattern-taught early and paid off at closure, legible under Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or pressure. Figurative language is dense but purposeful—molten-silver pomegranates, furnace-wind leaf—teaching the alchemical rule-set that money grows on grief-warmed trees. No mixed metaphors; vehicles stay within greenhouse physics (steam, copper, starlight). Final third is artifact-free: “light poured from his mouth…thread tied itself around the stone bead” maintains clarity and propulsion. Read-aloud rhythm modulates from long breathless arcs to fragmentary bursts at the burst-beat, earning high-band density without muddle.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise fuses ghost-revenge with speculative carbon-credit orchard; the combination feels inevitable, not grafted. Risk-taking—ghost as creditor, fruit as coin, boy as innocent debtor—heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Transformation test fails if names/places swapped: only this greenhouse with rune-etched pomegranates can distill sorrow into tender. Fresh inflection: the bead-eye of a wedding necklace becomes the seed of a post-debt future, recharging every prior image. Specificity anchors universals—silver apricot offered to stranger extends the chain beyond the page.</comment>
