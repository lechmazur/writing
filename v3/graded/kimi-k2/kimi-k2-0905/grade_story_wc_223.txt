<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mara’s shift from actor to historian is embodied in the kneel-to-square ritual and the lace noose; Kestrel’s first unrehearsed line carries real cost, but the patrol leader’s interiority is sketched more thinly, nudging the score from 8.8 margin.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The single shard holds a clean causal arc: missing pieces → discovered archive → collaborative stance crystallization. The dawn arrival is the before/after hinge, and the lace loop leaves visible conceptual cost, satisfying closure under a Causal lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Whispering stone mouths, lantern angles, and the ebon-maple board are tactile and co-active; the lace noose physically constrains the queen and thus the closing choice. A slight lean toward the ornamental in the lilac/iron description keeps it below gate-band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to keep small gestures alive in the interim—is threaded from the opening clocks to the dawn pact. The turn when Kestrel asks the maid’s name forces an immediate revision of tactics; cost is the irrevocable sharing of the archive.</question>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The theme crystallizes without statement: memory as benevolent violence. Subtext lives in the lace noose, chess gaps, and final overlapping footprints, all reweighted by the quiet renunciation of gunfire.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical compression—“benevolently ruthless,” “nomadic penumbra”—is taught early and sustained without head-hop. Syntax breathes into pressure syncopation; the final overlapping cadence reads as intentional, earning high-band voice control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Metaphoric density is purposeful, not over-dense, and each clause advances goal or texture. Only one mild mixed scent (“iron and lilac”) flirts with overload without harming clarity; line craft remains propulsive to the last sentence.</comment>
<question>8</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Combines interregnum-as-chess-with-missing-pawns, stone whisper-gallery, and walking-spelled archive in a fresh synthesis. Risky compression heightens stakes and coherence; final image feels specific, inevitable, and non-derived.</comment>
