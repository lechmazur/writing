<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The burned spy’s interiority is vivid—scar tissue “pulling tight as if smiling” embodies earned pain—yet the absence of any second on-page character limits relational crucible pressure to memory alone.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the crushed pillbox and the snowdrop crystallize the reconfiguration—transmission sent, identity shed, cost felt in the “silver dust glinting like frost.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Zephyr Bluff’s mist and salt-stained consoles are tactile constraints; the pillbox battery jump-starting the dead keypad fuses setting and action into one beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—transmitting proof before capture—tightens once: the keycard’s data versus the spy’s life. The final act of crushing the pillbox forecloses retreat with visible cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>“Spies are gardeners of possible futures” reframes the entire narrative; the snowdrop’s white flag becomes the non-literal answer to “where unused courage waits,” reweighting the premise without sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Voice is spare, weathered, and consistent—“silver hush,” “molten loyalty”—with purposeful compression that never breaks the single POV or leaks into exposition.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and propulsive; only the phrase “tilted-spring air” edges toward poetic excess, but it modulates rather than stalls momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The fusion of espionage tradecraft with botanical metaphor feels fresh; the pillbox-as-battery and snowdrop-as-receiver are specific inventions rather than genre tropes.</comment>
