<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her shift from certifier to mourner is dramatized through tactile micro-choices. The stoically sensitive trait is shown, not labeled, in her wince at the gull and her palm pressed to the stone. The final renunciation—walking away without looking back—earns its cost from every sealed confession. Only the absence of a second on-page character keeps it from the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens is taught early and held: each inserted note layers memory into the structure until the keystone void becomes a charged eye. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—the inked confession on stone reweights the entire survey. Causality is tight: every fissure she fills forecloses her own return. The final image of future scholars coring the stone crystallizes the cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The submerged pavilion is rendered with selective, sensory precision—rust chains like censers, marble steps echoing coins. The environment actively constrains her movements and choices; water depth dictates where she can place each note. The moonlit ribs and circular void become metaphors that earn their place by shaping the final inscription. Only a touch of ornamental phrasing keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether to preserve or entomb memory—tightens with each inserted confession. Agency is continuous: every pried stone narrows her future options. The cost is visible in the dissolving ink and the irreversible lime seal. A hairline slip: the engineers’ off-page judgment feels slightly abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the pattern of absence made present: each missing tile reveals the next, every sealed crack stores a dream. The final inscription—“I am here to mourn what we almost kept”—delivers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in the silence after the gull’s cry and the ink’s vanishing bloom. No redundancy or thematic echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The lyric third-person voice is consistent, textured, and purposeful; compression like “boots kissing the wet marble” teaches the pattern early. POV distance remains stable, filtering every detail through Mara’s stoically sensitive perception. No head-hopping or register drift. A single clause—“a code of hollows she alone could read”—skates close to exposition but is earned.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence advances atmosphere or character. Metaphors are precise—“ink clung like a secret bruise”—and never obscure causality. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Rhythm modulates with pressure: short clauses for descent, longer cadences for reflection. Final line lands with crystalline clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The conceit of a surveyor who archives abandoned dreams inside the very wounds she measures is fresh and fully committed. Tropes of drowning cities and lost love are transformed through tactile specificity and the inversion of repair into burial. The risk of lyric excess is balanced by concrete stakes. Feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
