<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Leo’s terror-versus-duty contradiction is vivid in every beat; the shell’s whisper converts his shakes into tactical identity, a credible renunciation of the “expendable muscle” label. Micro-choices—kneeling to read the cast, placing the shell on the projector—embody the new spine he needs. Interiority stays concrete, no therapy-speak. Cost is felt: he walks toward the lot still quaking, stride “firmly adaptive,” foreclosing anonymity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: DNA news → shell hunt → cast clue → shell → broadcast of trembling take → exit with proof. Each because/therefore linkage narrows options and raises reputational cost. Closure is a Decisive Change: he abandons the safety of silence, stakes future on leaked reel—cost legible in “heart still quaking.” Orientation anchored by 120 words; no teleporting props.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rusted library, iron stacks, perforated roof, drainage alcove—each spatial node is traversed under pressure and constrains stealth options. Starlight through roof holes becomes projection aperture, turning setting into accomplice. Shell as micro-setting cups the ear, re-configures identity. Detail is selective, filtered through stuntman’s eye for hazard and frame.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“prove vulnerability is power” versus being digitally erased—tightens when heirs’ henchmen enter; live option of silence is foreclosed. Escalation is single sustained rise: each clue shrinks hiding space and increases exposure risk. Cost visible in real-time: raw footage of his shakes will be permanent, career-ending or career-making. No coincidence resolves; projection delay buys exit, not victory.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from beats: edited lie (“frame”) versus uncut tremor. Shell’s final whisper reweights earlier rooftop stunts—audience empathy claimed over heroism. No moralizing; last line keeps tension between shake and stride. Conceptual repricing: vulnerability reframed as live wire, not flaw.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>First-person voice carries stunt-jargon filter (“stunt beats,” “gels,” “feed reel”) and phobic sensorium; syntax shortens under threat, lengthens during discovery. No head-hop; child’s dialogue carries cryptic indirection suited to oracle role. Rhythm mirrors heartbeat count, then steadies after shell speaks—audible modulation with pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry triple duty: “rusted library under the stars groaned like an old prop ship” sets tone, stakes, and POV metaphor in one stroke. No scaffold loops; each image advances. Figurative language stays consistent—film, sea, star motifs—without crowding peak beats. Strong verbs (“blurred the rust into galaxies”) propel rather than decorate.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Industry-insider stuntman with impostor syndrome + whispering maternal shell + leaking uncut fear-footage synthesizes into fresh angle on authenticity. Trope of switched-at-birth is inverted: revelation brings no wealth, only obligation to expose exploitation. Risk of showing cowardice on purpose is fully committed to, not hedged. Specificity of “betray the frame” as instruction makes concept indelibly this story’s.</comment>
