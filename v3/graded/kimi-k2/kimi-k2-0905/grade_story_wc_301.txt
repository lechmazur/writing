<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lila’s contradictory impulses—self-lacerating guilt versus the need to chronicle—are alive in every tactile beat; the accordion’s surrender to the stream is a credible, costly renunciation that forecloses her medicated detour. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak. The only bar to 9+ is that the sister/lover sins remain abstract labels; a single sensory flash would have sealed the arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the submerged accordion and fractured reflection reconfigure guilt from erasure to navigation, cost paid in the lost instrument and unmedicated clarity. Causal chain holds: map → graffiti cue → stream → recitation → release. Orientation anchors by line 3; no teleporting props. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) taught early and held.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The ivy-choked platform, weeping brick, and mica-flecked water are filtered through Lila’s hyper-lucid withdrawal gaze; each sensory pick constrains her path toward the stream. The taped bellows functions as micro-setting that charges the final image when the water claims it. One notch off 9+ only because the boiler-room spring reference stays off-stage and thus exerts no tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—guilt navigation versus self-annihilation—tightens when the graffiti line forces her underground; the accordion’s immersion is the visible price that forecloses denial. Escalation is a single deepening, not reversal, perfectly adequate for 700-word scope. Could reach 8.8+ if a mid-scene obstacle (slip, cold cramp) had tested her methodical trait under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: forgiveness as bearing, not erasure. The water’s memory motif migrates from bathroom wall to stream-surface glints, re-weighted when her reflection stays fractured yet real. No moralizing, only image-based repricing. Slight reserve because the plagiarized article etc. remain catalogued, not dramatized, muting thematic complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited clings to Lila’s nerve endings; perceptual signature of withdrawal-bright pulse shapes every clause. Rhythm accelerates with short beats on the stairs, then widens into cavern echo during the accordion’s last wheeze—pattern taught and paid off. Zero head-hopping; diction stays within her lexicon. A hairline slip toward lyric omniscience in “the river inside her kept speaking” keeps it from 9.3.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sentences carry double duty—action + metaphor—without crowding: “map fluttering like a white flag” advances both prop and interior state. No loops, no mixed metaphors, zero scaffold. One clause of elevated register (“conceptual repricing” risk in “forgiveness was not a destination but a bearing”) is voice-motivated and earned. Clean copy, varied paragraph rhythm, strong read-aloud ear.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fusion of withdrawal realism with underground-railway myth feels fresh; the accordion-as-confessional is a specific, non-obvious synthesis. Risk taken in quiet, lyric closure rather than twist, and it pays. Slight deduction for echo of familiar “water remembers” trope; graffiti freshens it but not enough to feel wholly unprecedented.</comment>
