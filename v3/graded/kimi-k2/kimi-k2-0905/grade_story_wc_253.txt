<comment>The performer's interior contradiction—“reported neighbors for insufficient smiles, then later forged joy coupons”—is sharply embodied, but the final shift from blankness to shoulder-lightness feels asserted rather than dramatized; micro-choice legibility dips at the watering beat, slightly blunting the earned stasis cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the crow’s insertion of the feathered stick into the turbine joints the remade hush; the final planted stems plus single tear land Earned Stasis, but the causality between whittling and literal rainfall is more poetic leap than motivated linkage, so the closure cost tingles rather than burns.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Wind-turbine shadows slicing strawflowers, microphone collar scraping in the remade hush: the setting’s sensory immediacy constrains every carving move; the only minor wobble is the vague farmhouse interior sightlines, but spatial choreography holds through the two-character porch scene.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—lightness vs enforced silence—tightens when the officer joins the knife work and the turbines whoosh into shared rebellion; one clear narrowing of option occurs when both blades cease pattern-shaving and plant stems in bare soil, felt cost legible.</comment>

<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Grief-as-cultivable-soil motif emerges through particulars rather than statement, culminating in the darkened patch of soil “as if remembering rain,” yet one slightly sermonizing line—“Item: memory retention optional”—leans toward prompt-echo, preventing full subtext purity.</question>

<comment>Lyrical, controlled voice toggles expertly between the performer's reportorial monotone and the crow's oracular diction; no head-hopping and syntactic rhythm modulates under pressure, though the crow’s dialogue “whittle me a space...” flirts with stylized oracle-speak in an otherwise minimalist soundscape.</comment>

<comment>Every sentence layers texture without loop repetition: “shavings the wind turbines above snatched” crams action, sound, and micro-physics into one clause. Metaphors are consistent; only the phrase “television left on after the station signed off” nudges cliché but slips by without harming propulsion or closure.</comment>

<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The happiness-mandate premise is fresh, the crow’s wooden feather rebellion is both mythic and mechanical, and the fusion of grief-farming with turbine surveillance is specific enough that swapping any detail would fracture thematic integrity—earned risk pays off.</comment>
