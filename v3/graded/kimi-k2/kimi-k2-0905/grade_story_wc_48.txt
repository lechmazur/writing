<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s interior contradiction—cowardice vs. the need to finish—drives every beat; the shell’s growing weight externalizes the cost of her choices. Embodied emotion (“heat spread… beneath her sternum”) keeps therapy-speak at bay. The final renunciation (offering back the shell) is earned by the prior accumulation of absolved characters. Only the pianist and boy remain slightly generic, capping the score just below 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the shell becomes a lighthouse, Lira dissolves inward, and Mara’s stance crystallizes with the felt cost of “empty pockets.” Causal chain holds: each collected hope increases shell weight → forces the choice to surrender it → rewrites her internally. Orientation is taught early (“feral nexus… braided channels”) and pays off in the final fog-funnel. No teleporting props or amnesia.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The nexus is never described for tourist effect; every fog curl or salt taste is filtered through Mara’s urgency (“mist tasted of salt and wet paper”). The spiral shell functions as micro-setting, constraining her grip and later her choice to release it. Spatial choreography is clean: boy → pianist → Lira arrive from distinct vectors, tracked without drift. One notch off 9 only because city coda is sketched, not lived.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“collect hopes or lose contract/home”—is signaled in first third and tightens when each absorption makes the shell heavier, narrowing her options to keep or release. The mid-scene micro-turn (wanting the fragments to weigh her down) escalates under Accumulative lens. Cost is visible: pianist’s chord grains, boy’s freckle, Lira’s palm-print heat. No external coincidence resolves the tension; the release is her own decisive act.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme—unfinished art as living obligation—emerges through concrete images (unread proofs dawn, cursor blink) rather than assertion. The shell’s transformation from hoarding vessel to lighthouse reweights the premise without moralizing. Final street “that might yet be kind” keeps ambiguity honest. No thematic echo sentence mars the close.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person POV stays tightly latched to Mara’s perceptual filter: “marginalia” on eyelashes, “quotation marks” of fog around ankles. Syntax mirrors pressure—long liquid sentences for mist, staccato cursor blink at desk. No head-hopping; pianist and Lira remain externally seen. Voice remains distinct under peak stress without register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative language is selective and purposeful (“fog curled into quotation marks”) and never clogs the high-pressure beats. Information density is high: one sentence often performs scene, emotion, and metaphor simultaneously. Copy is clean; no scaffolding or mixed metaphors.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The “abandoned characters return as tide-ghosts” premise feels fresh yet inevitable; no trope checklist is visible. Specificity of the mother’s ear-trumpet-turned-lighthouse anchors the concept in lived detail. Risk-taking—lyric accumulative structure instead of causal plot—heightens meaning without obscuring clarity. Slight deduction for echo of ubiquitous “sea remembers names” line.</comment>
