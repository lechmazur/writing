<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Her patient-strategic trait is proven under pressure; visible micro-choices (testing arrow balance, using the chaining itself as a non-violent weapon, pressing a single seed into cracked ground) manifest cost and reconfigure her path, earning the final renunciation/gift. The contradictions between liberation and legacy, and the felt weight of the rusted manacle, remain embodied on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>A Causal lens holds: every beat (arrow retrieval → decoding piano chord → non-combat guard delay) drives the therefore-link to the seed vault and the final arrow release that reweights meaning. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: planting while chains drag away from the vault clearly forecloses remaining in place and charges the final line.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The redemption-center mirrors, dust, netting, and cracked ground are repeatedly activated to shape tactics—mirrors frighten guards, netting tangles boots, dust allows footprints that spell C-E♭-G-B♭. Setting constrains every move and provides the final image: dry soil opening to the seed. Micro-setting doubles as tool.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“so children... might taste bread”—is announced early, escalated by each tactical beat: retrieving seed, blocking regime looting, risking burial under wall. Meaningful tightening occurs when the choice to plant seeds (visible cost: walking away unarmed in the sirens) narrows her options to future, generational rather than immediate safety.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Theme emerges from specific materials—cellophane feathers, manacle cuffs, seed pouch glints—growing into a quiet meditation on seeds outlasting tyrants. The final image (arrow catching sunlight like a banner, soil cracking around hidden seed) offers an earned non-moral about what liberation actually costs and plants.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</question>
<comment>Consistent lyric compression and carnival argot (“dictator’s parade float,” “teddy-bear feathers spinning like a ride”) provide an unmistakable aural signature. Voice remains steady under pressure—no head-hopping, no cliché drift, diction tailored to POV priorities during crisis.</comment>

<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>High diction propels without obscuring: “staggeringly graceful,” “regime’s final tantrum,” etc., vary syntax rhythmically; only once does “patient as drought-grass” risk ornamental density, but the image serves stakes rather than padding. Information density stays high; no paraphrase loops.</question>

<grade>8.6</question>
<comment>Post-apocalyptic carnival hideout + seed-vault myth + non-violent heroine constitute a fresh fusion rooted in gritty tactile detail. No derivative echoes; the specific cipher (minor jazz chord) and the re-purposed prize feathers feel organically invented, not borrowed ornament. The risk of tonal dissonance is balanced and coherence maintained.</comment>
