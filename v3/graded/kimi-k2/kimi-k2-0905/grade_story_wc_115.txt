<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Mara’s skeptical interiority is vivid (“religiously skeptical to the marrow”), bodily (her pulse as a hunter’s sway), and contradictory (rational doubt vs. compulsive faith acts like “kissed”). Micro-choice to unscrew the wheel shows value hierarchy. Cost is felt when the wheel “jerked” in her grip. Slight under-realized secondary pressure from radio-psychic callers who are never on stage. Final renunciation/forgiveness leans more lyrical gesture than concrete loss—enough for this length but keeps it beneath absolute top-tier.</comment>

<comment>Causal lens anchored in brother’s confession → search tunnel → physical trial with valve → tag revelation reweights guilt → acceptance. Each turn is contiguous and driven by her agency. Closure (Conceptual Repricing) hits when the wheel balances and the ghost-clank quietens: 12 years of unfinished motion halted. Cost is viscerally paid in the “swallowed truth” becoming bearable brass rather than lead.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Tunnel anchors are immediate—rusted rail, dripping culvert, mineral stink—integrated with action (hoist wheel, screw cap). Foundry drains feeding in create plausible spatial lattice. Beaded valve itself evolves from artefact to character witness. Environment constrains final stance when draft carries the machine pulse that aligns with her heartbeat. No orientation drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake locked in by confession: “what really happened.” Pressure tightens incrementally: valve weight → sloshing secret → brass tag → balanced wheel. Only one decisive reversal needed at pay-off; the tag forces reframing of brother’s guilt. Luck never rescues, stakes cost legible when she finally forgives and leaves the spin to silence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</question>
<comment>Themes of guilt, witness, forgiveness emerge from concrete particulars (wheel beads vs rosary). Re-emergence of “mercury or guilt” subtly reweights religious resonance. Story refuses tidy thesis; final equilibrium is secular yet sacramental in feel. The brass tag functions as secular reliquary—image reconfigures premise without sermons.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</question>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Mara’s sensory lattice—rhythm, perceptual signature, and diction track her drowsy-alert state (e.g., “dense as a lead slug,” “drowsy alertness that had carried her”). Elision is coherent (no sudden head-hop). Dialogue sparse but purposeful: her single challenge to the dark carries subtext. Rhythm modulates to sentence fragments under final stress without breaking continuity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</question>
<comment>Read-aloud line rhythms vary and are high-density. Not a single paraphrase loop or filler stem found. Minor overwriting haze in one metaphor string (“hush…damp wool…dense lead slug”) risks minor density drag. Sentence mechanics clean; pronoun and tense stable. Opening line anchors voice and stakes, final line resolves by image that recharges beads as gyroscope. Still within publish-now tier.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</question>
<comment>The ghost-shift locked-in factory mythos is familiar, elevated here by bodily metaphor (heartbeat rhythm inside wheel) and brass tag as witness artifact. Synthesis of mechanical haunting with secular confession registers fresh. Lacks an additional conceptual risk that would vault into 9+ originality, hence mid-8s ceiling.</comment>
