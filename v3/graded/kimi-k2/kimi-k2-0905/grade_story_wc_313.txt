<comment>Marisol’s contradictory impulses (duty vs self) are dramatized in her micro-choice to pocket the label, the label’s tearing, and the shift to photographing communal memory; each choice carries visible cost. Embodied dread appears in “hush inside her chest” and palms releasing “blue flakes”; these moments anchor interiority without generic labels. The father’s secret love is rendered through the single Polaroid, re-weighting Marisol’s past; this motivates her closure decision. Relationship with the drowned town itself serves as crucible, forcing her stance crystallization.</comment>

<comment>The lens is Accumulative/Textural: photograph trail, bottle label, and Marisol’s new trail build density that reweights the dominant stake from secret grief to shared memory. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration—“building a new trail… ready to spin” –a Charged Poise where the choice and its conceptual cost (sharing her father’s hidden story) are legible without tidy resolution.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The ridgeway, submerged roofs, ankle-deep silt, and re-stringing the wind chime act as living micro-settings that constrain navigation and symbolize re-emergence. Each object—Polaroid flakes floating on dark water, chime first silence then questioning notes—recharges the ending image with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Stakes escalate from “souvenir divers” to exposure of the father’s hidden life and eventually to Marisol’s decision to trade private grief for communal memory; each tightening is driven by her deliberate action under pressure. Cost feels tangible in the torn label and her red-rimmed eyes standing dawn watch.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of shared loss surfaces through specific objects and decisions rather than statement; closure offers a non-literal, resonant reweighting: the Swan re-inscribed from betrayal to collective healing without a spoken moral. Subtext operates in gesture, silence, and the trail of photographs; the hush itself turns from private secret to collective listening.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person close tracks Vega’s precise, risk-calibrating perceptions; sensory focus contracts from flashlight beam to slime under boots to silt under fingertips, reflecting urgency. Each sentence’s rhythm stretches or tightens with flashlight sweep, echoing emotional intensity. No head-hop; single, stable lens held to closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Lines do double work—e.g., “the water retreating one deliberate foot per day” compresses geologic timescale into heartbeat. Sensory stacking in phrase “twilight clung to the midnight ridgeway like damp gauze” is earned; density under pressure without overwriting. Tense, syntax, and spatial choreography remain clean; no loops or scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The premise—ex-dam reservoir slowly disclosing drowned town while warden renegotiates family story—is fresh, specific, and never gimmicked. Emergence of the Swan lounge, photographic trail, and final chime re-stringing all feel inevitable and grounded; transformation test passes as specifics refuse generic substitution.</comment>
