<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The reaper’s interior contradiction—needing to name fear yet denying he is worth sacrifice—drives every beat; the plague-cot memory bodies his guilt and the final paper-souls gesture renounces his immortality with visible cost. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible waived. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak. Micro-choices (tracing tentacle, shattering cylinders, folding scraps) all expose the hierarchy: absolution over existence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the ledger of stolen years becomes a pulse that reweights his undeath. Accumulative lens holds—each star-sentence adds density until the atlas mirror forces the irreversible recognition that every reap paid for his time. Orientation anchored by word 60 (“ancient observatory at dusk”). Causality intact: because he listens, therefore the sky speaks; because he understands, therefore he releases the voices—cost is the brother’s gaze dissolving and his own newly mortal pulse.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Observatory, atlas page, copper mirror, and paper scraps function as micro-settings that successively constrain choice: the atlas tentacle pinhole literally opens the star-channel; the copper pool becomes the ledger-surface that names his debt. Quartz dust under boots, brine-and-gunpowder smell, frost reacting with ink—tactile specifics tether the fantastical to body. Spatial choreography clean: roof splits, copper rises, scraps rise. Final image of borrowed starlight re-uses the dome’s rupture as the cost aperture.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can the reaper escape the nameless fear—tightens when star-sentences crystallize into the ledger question “What was sacrificed for you?” forcing an unanswerable moral invoice. Pressure escalates by density accrual: each wax voice attached to a star-sentence increases the weight of unpaid deaths until the copper mirror manifests the brother’s gaze; the reaper’s agency is the cylinder-smashing that converts accrued guilt into released names. Cost is legible: immortality becomes mortal pulse, paper souls ascend instead of falling. One meaningful deepening suffices; no reversal needed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sacrifice as an unspoken economy emerges entirely through image—kraken sketches as widows’ recognition tokens, star-sentences as unpaid debts—never lectured. Final paper-souls ascent reconfigures the earlier atlas boat capsizing: what once drowned now flies, reversing the commerce of death. Theme attains complexity: humanity’s terror has fed him, yet his recognition does not restore life, only relinquishes theft. No moralizing line; resonance lingers in the warm “tear” on bone.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person POV remains locked to the reaper’s perceptual signature—starlight “drips,” copper “pools,” voices “attach”—syntax grows clipped under pressure (“jaw only clicked”). Lyric compression taught early (“boots grinding quartz dust”) and sustained; no head-hop. Diction stays within reaper’s cosmic yet tactile lexicon; no filter-verb clusters. Rhythm accelerates with enjambed images during dome rupture, then exhales with soft ticking—modulation serves emotional arc.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sentences carry triple duty: “ink reacted, swelling until the creature’s eye became a pinhole” shows action, transformation, and metaphor in one breath. No paraphrase loops; each image advances. Figurative language peaks at the star-sentences bleed-to-question moment without muddling causality. Minor scaffold: “echo of sacrifice” phrase repeated twice; does not touch closure. Opening and closing lines bookend with dust vs. pulse, satisfying arc.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fusing maritime bestiary with astronomical necromancy feels inevitable yet unseen; the atlas kraken as sacrificial receipt is a fresh angle on death-commerce. Risky second-person address to reader avoided; instead, cosmic scale stays grounded in wax cylinders and paper scraps. Transformation test fails if names/places swapped—observatory, quartz dust, copper mirror are irreplaceable. No trope recycling; even “reaper learns he’s mortal” gains new economic engine.</comment>
