<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mason’s contradictory impulses—clinging to past glory while auditing relics for cash—are dramatized through tactile micro-choices (patching the mic, speaking the set-list). The final stance crystallizes with visible cost: he trades solitary nostalgia for communal listening, foreclosing the safety of detachment. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak. One slip: the TikTok humiliation is summarized, not embodied, muting the sting that motivates the drive to the quarry.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the quarry’s natural delay returns his own words, reweighting “applause” from external validation to internal resonance—cost is the surrender of anonymity. Causal chain holds: Polaroid → mic repair → spoken set-list → foreman’s offer, each beat because/therefore. Orientation is clean by line 4. One minor causality gap: the foreman’s abrupt reversal from cancelling to commissioning feels convenient, not driven by on-page negotiation.</comment>

<comment>Diesel-stink ledger, torn grille cloth, starlit quarry bowl—each sensory shard is filtered through Mason’s audio-tuned attention and later constrains the final act of speaking into the pit. The trailer’s PA unit, once used for shift calls, becomes the literal instrument of transformation, charging the closure. Spatial choreography is flawless: envelope under desk, mic in crate, cable wired with amp copper. Only the courthouse steps remain a white-box sketch; no weather, crowd density, or limestone dust to ground the public failure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“find the sound that stays in tune”—tightens when the bugle debacle severs income, forcing return of deposit; the Polaroid then reframes the stake from survival to legacy. One meaningful deepening: speaking the unfinished set-list into the quarry turns embarrassment into communal archive, foreclosing retreat. Cost is legible: he must expose the very voice that once failed publicly. Pressure plateaus rather than spikes after the foreman’s entrance; no new obstacle complicates the archive offer.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges implicitly: resonance > applause, loss transmuted into listening. The grille cloth migrates from souvenir to membrane, reweighting memory as medium rather than relic. Final image—voices stitched across workers—answers the thematic question without moralizing. One near-echo: “applause he missed was never out there” flirts with thesis-statement but is saved by its placement inside embodied echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Mason’s audio-metaphor cortex; every noticed detail is pitch, wattage, or venue. Syntax lengthens and compresses with his breath—“pulse thudded like a kick drum” vs. “+52 volts, signal return”—mirroring emotional gain. No head-hopping; foreman’s interior remains opaque, read only through gesture. One micro-drift: “confidently uncertain” sounds like editorial caption rather than Mason’s own idiom, a 0.2 blemish in an otherwise singular voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose breathes with variable sentence lengths, no template cadence. Figurative language is sparse, precise: “vacuum it left” compresses arena silence into bodily sensation. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or causality. One mixed vehicle: “frayed edges humming with memory” fuses textile and audio, but the context (amp repair) justifies the overlap and does not obscure action.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Fusing antiques authentication with rock-roadie tech is fresh; the patched PA mic as archive instrument reconfigures both trades into one vocation. Polaroid-as-trigger risks contrivance, yet the specific 2004 album-cover van anchors inevitability. Risk taken: lyric accumulative structure held inside single scene, paid off by quarry echo. Could edge higher if the foreman’s offer carried a sharper occupational twist unique to limestone extraction.</comment>
