<question>1</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Maya’s choices directly trigger multiple plot turns (laser use, fold discovery, convergence); contradictory impulses (grief vs rescue) play out in scene, culminating in a clear renunciation of duplicates with felt loss that earns closure.</comment>

<question>2</question>
<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Closure unit lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (merging Lucs into a single, freed self). Tight causal chain—laser folds → duplicate revelation → choice to fold them again—holds under the Situational lens, with visible emotional cost on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question>
<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Spatial choreography remains crisp; the laser‐pointer skips act as the primary constraint enabling Maya’s breakthrough. Blue mushroom glow charges every beat and the final image, constraining tactics and perception throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stakes (retrieve vs release Luc) crystallize at spiral nexus; escalation is driven by Maya’s spatial choice that compresses the “duplicate strangers,” forcing a trade-off that forecloses an all-happy resolution and articulates real cost.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of grief replacement emerges organically through plot turns rather than labels. Final spiral’s light dispersing grief offers a CR that reweights closure, avoiding tidy moralizing while acknowledging complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Distinct perceptual signature (“topology fold,” “bioluminescent breath”) underpins POV, rhythm modulates with urgency, and purposeful elision (gaps in Luc’s reunion) serves pressure. Voice remains consistent, no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>High information density, rhythmic variation matching escalating tension, zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language (spores copying shape) is precise and paid off at closure without muddle.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: uses grief duplication as embodied spatial problem rather than sci-fi gimmick. Spiral-compression ending feels inevitable, rose without borrowing a famous meme. Bold architectural risk delivers resonance without abandoning clarity.</comment>
