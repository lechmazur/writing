<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied; the alchemist’s contradictory impulses (logic vs. reverence) act simultaneously in scene. The final choice to dissolve the crystal is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost—loss of the orchard’s wonder. Minor drift: the “dying starling” anecdote is told rather than dramatized, slightly diluting pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the world outside is unchanged yet reweighted by the crystal’s memory. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each sensory layer tightens the stake until the final image reconfigures meaning. Orientation is immediate; no drift.</comment>

<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The orchard’s mica-flashing roots and quince scent constrain the search and charge the final image. Micro-setting (the ribbon from her mother’s dress) becomes a tactile anchor that alters the ritual. Environment, body, and tool all shape tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—harmonizing logic and wonder—is signaled early and escalates through sensory intensification. The crystal’s dissolution narrows options irreversibly; the cost is the orchard’s vanishing wonder, felt on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically from the alchemist’s struggle; no explicit moralizing. The final image of the quince fruit that ripens “only when wonder is weighed and found measureless” offers a resonant, non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Distinct lyric texture with controlled rhythm; perceptual signature is consistent. Occasional poetic density (“embered halos,” “sapwood of time”) risks overwriting but remains legible under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; no loops or scaffold. One mixed metaphor (“liquid iron” starlings) is minor. Final third is clean, supporting closure.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemy, starling murmuration, and orchard myth; feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking (transparent flame, time-peeled orchard) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
