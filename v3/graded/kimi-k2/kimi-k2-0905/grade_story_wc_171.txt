<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kaelen’s interiority is rich and embodied—his trembling hands, the weight in his eyes—but the “operatively gentle” trait is asserted more than enacted under pressure. The final renunciation (casting the clipboard skyward) is earned by prior ritual logic, yet we see no live contradiction between gentleness and the act of burning memory. Secondary mourners remain archetypal, not crucibles.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The ritual arc is cleanly causal: because the terrace awakens, therefore Kaelen must pay the price of remembering rightly. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing—the shattered clipboard reweights war from conquest to shared burden. Orientation is immediate; the lens holds without drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The terrace’s obsidian and silver veins are not backdrop but active agent—drinking starlight, pulsing with heartbeat—constraining the final choice. Micro-setting (the altar stone’s warmth) anchors each beat. Sensory selection is purposeful, never catalogic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“remember rightly, not forget”—is signaled early and tightened when Kaelen realizes burning is insufficient. The price is visceral: each spoken name cracks his voice. No external antagonist is needed; internal pressure suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the ritual’s demand: redemption is daily practice, not absolution. Subtext lives in gesture—feather, scale, lily—never sermon. The final image of shared fragments reconfigures war’s meaning without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays close to Kaelen’s perceptual signature: “the obsidian drinking in the starlight until it reflected not the sky above, but the war below.” No head-hopping; lyric compression is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “the terrace became a conduit between what was and what could be.” No loops or scaffold; figurative language is selective. Rhythm modulates with ritual cadence, never purple.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The premise—ritual memory-keeping as war’s transformation—feels inevitable yet fresh. Tropes of peace treaties and celestial alignments are re-grounded in tactile grief. Risk lies in quiet renunciation rather than spectacle, and it pays.</comment>
