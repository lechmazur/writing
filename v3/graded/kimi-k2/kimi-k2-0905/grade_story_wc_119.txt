<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Chen’s spy-sage duality is vivid via embodied details—spectacles doubling as lenses, palming film with a rye-smudged hand—yet the internal contradiction (seer vs. eraser) is stated more than dramatized after the midpoint; the final renunciation earns path-closure but lacks new contradiction on the skiff.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The closure unit lands cleanly: Chen disappears, the keeper feels the island inside him ("stone tuning his ribs"), and the lighthouse keeps confessing—an earned stasis with conceptual cost; causality holds under accumulative lens, but microdot insertion beats read slightly elliptical, shaving 0.3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lighthouse granite keyed like a lithophone, moonlit combers developed as negatives in a tray—environment constrains Chen’s exit and is mirrored in the final bodily "rock standing inside"; selective, urgent sensory detail throughout justifies high band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (vanishing vs. legacy) is signaled early, tightens when the keeper pockets the fortune—one choice disables capture forever; the deepening cost is felt in the final chord of “salt and departure,” though escalation plateaus between scenes rather than compounds.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of accidental prophecy emerges through image (lighthouse as darkroom) rather than statement; the island-rock inside the body is the literalized metaphor, reweighting the premise without moral statement. Slight drift to “cryptic” rather than earned complexity keeps it beneath 8.0.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Diction—rye, Fresnel, microdot—stays authentic to Chen’s educated spy lexicon; rhythmic propulsion mirrors sweep of the lens: “pulse syncing with the turning beam.” Keeper’s dialogue distinguishes drunk simplicity vs. Chen’s murmured craft; free indirect slips are clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose carries read-aloud rhythm: “the island slide inside him, its stones tuning his ribs”—no loops, no mixed metaphors; occasional density (“lithophone”, “lithic register”) is voice-motivated, not ornamental.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Fortune-cookie-embedded-spy motif is fresh; transformation occurs when the cookie itself becomes both camera and farewell letter. Risk taken: lighthouse as “open secret darkroom” that literally prints futures, yet the final image crystallizes without gimmick.</comment>
