<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical but stays anchored to the chronicler’s bodily experience of ink, petals, starlight; the moment she names her own insomnia as the temple’s grief crystallizes a credible cost. Micro-choices (speaking the petal-syllables, pressing flower to brass) visibly alter the world, so agency is on-page. Relationship with the boy is thin—his single tear and first spoken name feel more symbol than crucible—but the self-reckoning is strong enough to satisfy the arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the star brightens, the dome re-solidifies, and the chronicler exits with “smooth glass” stories inside her—an earned stasis that costs her prior detachment. Causality holds: each beat (telegram → star fade → temple bloom → ink healing) follows a because/therefore chain under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is swift; place, time, and POV are clear by line 3, so no penalty applied.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Copper dome, refractor brass, sandstone pillars, and spectral pollen are selective, sensory, and filtered through the chronicler’s vocation. The observatory’s physical layout constrains movement—every action is either at the telescope or pressed against it—so setting actively shapes choice. Micro-setting (the flower between star-diaries) functions as the charged object that seals the lens crack at closure, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“decode before the star dims”—is signaled early and tightens when the star’s fade becomes a doorway she must enter or lose the inscription forever. The mid-scene deepening (temple grief = her insomnia) escalates psychological cost under Accumulative pressure. No external antagonist is needed; the shared burden itself supplies the opposing force, and the final brightening forecloses retreat, leaving her permanently changed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>“Shared burdens become shared light” emerges through the dramatized transfer of sorrow into stellar pollen, not through thesis statements. The daylily’s reprise at the end reweights its first appearance as mere map, now as healing agent—an organic recurrence. Final line rides electromagnetic winds to sleepless listeners, offering invitation rather than moral, keeping complexity intact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to the chronicler’s synesthetic perception (ink smells, petals bruise, starlight drinks pigment). Syntax lengthens and softens under solace, then compresses during the star’s fade, mirroring her pulse. No head-hopping; the boy’s interior is rendered only through observable tears and constellations, preserving distance control.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is lush yet information-dense; each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and mythic registers without paraphrase loops. Mixed metaphors are few and purposeful (“star’s dimming was not darkness but a doorway”). Occasional elevated diction (“spectral ink,” “celestial period”) fits the chronicler’s vocation and does not stall momentum. No artifacts appear in the final third; closure image remains crisp.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fuses lucid-dream cartography, variable-star Morse, and grief-etched temples into a coherent mythic tech that feels inevitable in hindsight. The daylily telegram as both map and medicinal ink is a fresh inflection not seen in standard dream-fantasy. Risky lyric compression could have collapsed into purple haze, but line-level control keeps the concept legible and emotionally grounded.</comment>
