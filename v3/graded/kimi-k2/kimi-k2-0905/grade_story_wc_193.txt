<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Lira’s survivor trauma is filtered through bodily sensation—cold brass bolt, copper spores—and crystallizes in the conscious decision to twist the bolt; choices actively foreclose the “pay pressure into a diamond” path with felt cost at climax.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Single POV arc adheres to Causal lens: irritate → parallel-text edge → diamond release; stakes reset across the beats without drift, closure is a decisive shift of debt into tangible diamond with undeniable cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Submarine hull, root-cave, bioluminescent caps all function as pressure chamber and sensory filter; setting constrains movement (tight root-cave harness), feeds final diamond formation, and mirrors internal compression.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“translate pressure into diamonds”—escalates from unpayable debt to literal crystallisation; one tightening (twist into mantle circuit) drives the transformative beat that reconfigures option cost.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Emergent theme: extracted promises harden into debt forms; handled via embodied image (diamond), never thesis-stated, final silence after toss suggests earned but unspoken equivalence between forgiveness and capitalist sins.</question>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Compressed lyric syntax suits survivor hyper-awareness; glitch-text intrusions modulate pacing; delivered in concrete local diction without unearned epiphanies; voice remains consistent and pressure-heightened.</question>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>High-density lines (“squeezing through a seam between worlds”) combine with rhythm shifts at pressure beats; zero loop repetition; metaphor vehicles stay coherent across fungal roots, pressure physics, and felt guilt.</question>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Bold synthesis: scam trauma + subterranean mushroom farms + quantum debt as physical matter offers fresh grounding, late confirmation crystallised pressure into diamond is earned; risks remain anchored in survivor stakes.</question>
