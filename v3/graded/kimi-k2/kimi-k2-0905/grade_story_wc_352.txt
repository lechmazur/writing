<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ilyra’s prism-minded trait is dramatized through her spectral-band perception and micro-choices under pressure; the interior contradiction between urgency and whisper-lullaby modulation is embodied, not labeled. Her motivation to rescue the Archive’s memory is rooted in childhood study and visibly escalates stakes when the doodle blanks and gravity snaps back. The final landing among ferns crystallizes her earned competence and the cost of spent tool. No stock phrasing or diagnostic self-talk intrudes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The causal lens holds: each beat links because/therefore—kernel mapping requires spectral recall, doodle blanking signals closure, gravity’s snap forces the leap. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (“lip of the serpentine grotto in mist”) and reinforced by spatial choreography throughout. Closure is a decisive change: the Archive’s memory restored via the re-drawn tail, with visible cost—the doodle spent, grotto sealed, inversion ended. No teleporting props or soft resets.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The grotto’s ultraviolet veins, upward-dripping lanterns, and ceiling-floor reversal are not backdrop but tactical terrain: Ilyra navigates color bands and threshold patches to avoid kernels. The manuscript margin doodle doubles as micro-setting and compass, its ink reacting to proximity and finally blanking to mark mission end. Spatial choreography is flawless—bodies, droplets, and gravity vectors track cleanly. The final fern-floor re-anchors the inverted world with sensory specificity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore the Archive’s memory—tightens when the doodle’s beam reveals fleeing combinations and kernels stir. One meaningful escalation: the kernels threaten bloom, forcing Ilyra to modulate voice to a whisper-taste of iron, narrowing options and raising visceral cost. Resolution is earned by her spectral navigation and final re-drawing, not luck. Pressure remains coherent under the causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the concrete struggle to rescue memory itself; no abstract statement intrudes. The spiral-eyed fish, kernels, and inversion form a quiet meditation on how knowledge hides and must be re-inhabited at personal cost. Final image—blank doodle fluttering like a white flag—offers resonant, non-literal closure without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: next inversion will again demand risk.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Ilyra’s prism perception; no head-hopping. Voice is textured—“clandestinely luminous,” “sideways along that color”—yet never purple; syntax mirrors her fracturing vision under stress. Perceptual signature is distinct: she sees moments as hues and steps through stillness. No filter-verb stacks or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and propulsive; no loops or synonym churn. Metaphors (“each droplet a tiny lantern”) are precise and paid off. Sentence variety accelerates during the sprint along the indigo afterimage. Zero artifacts in the final third; closure image lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The inversion conceit is synthesized through lived detail: gravity as tactical puzzle, memory as physical seed. Risk-taking—spectral perception, color-walking—heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The spiral-eyed fish doodle evolves from compass to spent talisman, a fresh angle on the “guide object” trope. Feels inevitable yet non-obvious in hindsight.</comment>
