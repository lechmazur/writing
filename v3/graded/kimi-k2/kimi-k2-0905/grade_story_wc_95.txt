<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elian’s mechanical arm and Vale’s foil are vivid, but interior contradiction is only gestured at; the shift from rivalry to partnership feels summary. The “danish needle card” anchors reflection cleanly, but the emotional pivot is compressed rather than dramatized under pressure.</question>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Causal arc lands: the missing sundial quadrant and reversed brook reframes the rivalry into collaboration. Closure satisfies CR—time’s geometry re-weights the ethical question at palpable conceptual cost—earned rather than asserted.</question>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sundial, brook reflection, and card float charge choices; spatial clarity remains crisp, and reflective water completes the pattern on the page. Sensory hierarchy skews visual, but the final refraction image tightens the conceptual arc.</question>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</question><comment>Dominant stake—the ethics of inquiry—tightens when Vale’s blade taps Elian’s shoulder instead of cutting. No physical reversal but an irreversible choice to co-author; cost visible in the foils lowered, the rival stance dissolved.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Theme emerges through geometry of light and water: inquiry should serve partnership not provocation. No moralizing—the chime and floating card offer non-literal resonance—subtext holds in gesture, silence, and refracted image rather than statement.</question>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Ceremonial-scholar diction matches characters; rhythmic control rises under pressure (“hydraulic grace … sang”). No head-hopping; the brook’s whisper and gear tick embed distinct perceptual signatures.</question>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</question>
<comment>Clean momentum, high density: “traces the incomplete arc … brass fingers drumming” compresses setting-act-emotion. One scaffold echo—“they walked,” then again—slips but never obfuscates; clarity survives to the dusk-reflection cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Transformation—philosophical duel resolving into co-authorship—feels inevitable once the sundial angle is redefined by water. Not flashy newness, but specific, lived synthesis that only this pair could negotiate under glass and streamlight.</question>
