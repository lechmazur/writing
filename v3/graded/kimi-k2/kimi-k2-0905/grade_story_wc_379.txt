<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mira’s curator instinct and need to “prove listening heals” are concrete and embodied; her choice to sit tool-less at dawn is a visible micro-choice that costs her warmth and certainty. Interiority stays specific (“settle like dust between her ribs”) and avoids label-speak. The final Earned Stasis—accepting the box must remain closed—grows directly from these traits, paying the price of permanent mystery.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the heartbeat slows, the courtyard re-tunes, and Mira forecloses opening the box—cost is the surrender of curator control. Accumulative lens holds: each rumor grain adds density until silence itself becomes the decisive change. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no lens ambiguity or teleporting props.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rose-gold tiles, clicking locket, borescope sliding under rust—details are filtered through Mira’s collector gaze and constrain her tactics (she borrows the scope, then abandons it). The courtyard shrinks or expands with collective attention, charging the final hush. Micro-setting (mailbox throat as “rusted jaw”) directly shapes the climax choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove listening heals—tightens when the borescope shows nothing, forcing renunciation. One meaningful deepening suffices: the shift from investigative intrusion to communal witness narrows options and makes the final silence feel paid for. Cost is legible: Mira forfeits both answer and artifact.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from pattern, not statement: objects return to stories, not places. The locket’s migration from doctor to mailbox to collective chest reweights “healing” as shared bearing rather than solution. Final image—empty velvet cushion—offers resonant, non-moralizing answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person stays tightly latched to Mira’s perceptual bias—brass compasses “yesterday’s finds,” mailbox “rusted jaw.” Rhythm modulates with pressure: long breathless sentences for rumor storm, then clipped fragments at dawn silence. No head-hopping or register drift; lyric compression is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty—action, atmosphere, and metaphor in one motion (“the whole neighborhood had become one vast ear”). No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; figurative language peaks at the closure beat without obscuring causality. Read-aloud rhythm accelerates with rumor accumulation, then exhales into final hush.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Familiar healing trope is inverted: cure is refusal to open, not extraction of secret. Locket-as-heart returning to iron ribcage feels inevitable yet fresh. Risk—renouncing mystery instead of solving it—heightens meaning without gimmickry.</comment>
