<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The knight's interior contradiction—withdrawn savior bound by private oath—drives every motion toward cost. Embodied shame in blackened armor and final wooden surrender is visceral, earned, and irreversible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative-lyric lens taught by surreal tableaux drives closure as physical surrender to wooden fate with felt price. Seamless time/place anchoring; final image crystallizes reweighted existence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Greenhouse breathes as crucible: mercury gravity, inverted roots, clockwork seeds and silver sap all constrain movement and foreshadow transformation. Micro-setting (marionette stage) charges final exchange.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—soul-exchange for freedom—is signaled early, tightened by unsnapping clasp, paid in bodily and existential cost. Progression by accumulative images rather than causal reversals.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is lush yet disciplined, shifting rhythms mirror dance instruction and surreal gravity. Distinct perceptual signature of weary knight turns precise wooden hinge at climax without lapses.</comment>

<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Striking diction and sensory precision: “molten mercury sky”, “silver sap sealing cracks”, zero scaffold. Cadence breathes with scene needs, only hairline over-alliteration remains.</comment>

<grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Surreal fable fuses marionette metaphysics with inverted orchard and eternal exchange—entire architecture feels singular, inevitable, and emotionally credible without genre templates.</comment>
