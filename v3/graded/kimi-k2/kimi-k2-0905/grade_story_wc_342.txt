<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied—"her limitation is not failure but filter"—but the final renunciation is more stated than dramatized; the cost is felt yet not fully earned on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the painted sky becomes a charged poise that reweights the premise. The coin’s indentations → wall braille sequence is causally tight and the demolition countdown supplies visible cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Tree-trunk library is tactile and constraining—roots grown around texts, knothole window—while the candle’s final flicker charges the closure image. Spatial choreography remains coherent under vibration.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve memory before demolition—tightens with each brushstroke and the three-siren countdown. Agency is clear, cost is the imminent loss of sanctuary.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of “identity in negative space” emerges through the fractal sky and coin-braille without overt statement; final image of “sky-shaped absence” offers a resonant, non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Lyric compression and patterned elision are taught early and held; voice is distinct—“fractally precise strokes,” “sky-shaped absence”—with no POV slippage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; only minor scaffold (“each eyelash rendered in mathematical succession”) and no mixed metaphors. Final cadence accelerates with demolition tremors.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise of a face-blind artist painting memory via coin-braille in a living library is fresh and fully committed; transformation of limitation into filter feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
