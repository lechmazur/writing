<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Kael’s interior contradiction—yearning to break the 97-year rooted death-pattern yet cringing at exile—drives every micro-choice; the gear’s warmth, the step off-path, the final relinquishment embody cost. The “otherworldly sentimentalist” label is shown, not worn: his sonar questions ache with nostalgia for places never visited, a lovely irrationality. Only the grandmother’s quoted thesis drifts toward label-speak, slightly blunting the edge of embodied grief.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: Kael’s renunciation of the gear severs the inherited cycle, the garden’s cool glow now answering distant travelers—cost legible in the crumbled beacon and the crack that never opens in his heart. Accumulative lens holds: pattern density (falling petals, gear scratches, 97-year fractures) tightens until the sonar chord reweights the stakes. Orientation is swift—who, where, stakes all inside 50 words—so no penalty applied.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The nebula garden is not backdrop but instrument: pollen sucks at boots, suspended petals stall time, the cracked beacon physically enables the flameless ignition. Micro-setting (the brass gear’s impossible ratio) likewise constrains tactics, forcing Kael to abandon measurement for resonance. Sensory triage—ionized scent, diamond pollen, starlight fragment—mirrors his narrowed crisis attention.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—share light without fire vs. ancestral self-immolation—tightens when the foreign sonar echo modulates through the gear, forcing the off-path choice that breaks the 97-year death pattern. One meaningful deepening suffices; the price (beacon dust, gear abandoned) is on-page. Pressure is coherent under Accumulative lens: each echo thickens the chord until options reconfigure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from pattern, not lecture: transmission over rooted sorrow crystallizes when the gear’s infinite ratio resolves into rhythm rather than number. The final image—garden singing with distant answerers—reweights every prior exile scratch without moralizing. Only the grandmother’s quoted “we are roots” skirts thematic echo territory, but it is immediately complicated by Kael’s lived counter-proof.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person hovers at a lyric middle distance, filtering cosmic imagery through Kael’s sentimental sensorium; diction (“petals of ionized gas,” “calculating machine gear”) stays within his plausible lexicon. Rhythm swells and subsides with sonar pulses, no drumbeat monotony. No dialogue, so voice distinction clause waived; internal voice remains coherent and particular.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening, propelling the accumulative swell; mixed metaphors are avoided, vehicles consistent (garden, wave, bell). One scaffold pair—“quiet sigh of falling petals” repeated—earns poetic echo status and is not penalized. No filter-verb stacks or register drift; information density high. Final third clean, allowing 9-band eligibility.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The flameless-light premise fuses cosmic-scale SF with elegiac lyric in a way that feels inevitable yet fresh; the impossible gear ratio turned musical resolution is a specific, non-obvious synthesis. Risky choice to let petals pause mid-air pays off by externalizing the pattern break. No derivative echo; the piece commits fully to its own logic.</comment>
