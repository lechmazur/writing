<question>1</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Elias’ interiority remains consistent—the fear that the keeper has vanished—and his stone-adding gesture is an embodied choice under pressure, but the absence of direct interaction flattens possible status dynamics; backstory is woven to the moment but never turns the present choice in a newer way, limiting the earned cost.</comment>

<question>2</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Closure arrives as Charged Poise: Elias rows backward so the tower stays in sight while cradling the bottled warmth—an earned reconfiguration where silent witness becomes active preservation, fully legible under an Accumulative/Textural lens with felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The lantern room’s shadows and wet-iron scent press tactile pressure on Elias’s choices; the sea glass and ballast stones physically anchor the micro-environment, though the larger sea remains more postcard than constraining.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Stakes are clear from the first line—lamp gone, keeper possibly gone—the single beat of stacking the fourth stone tightens option space by committing Elias to carry the memory forward rather than intervene aloud, but physical loss risk is only intimated, not tested.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Thematic weight emerges in gesture: witness as surrogate light; no overt statements mar the resonance, though the “bottling safety” could slide toward metaphor-declaring if heard too loudly.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Consistently filtered through Elias’s reticent, observant POV; rhythmic control in phrases like “salt-ghost” and “luminescent ache” teaches the diction early and sustains it without overwriting or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Lyrical without purple density: sentences do simultaneous work of atmosphere and internal pressure; occasional compound cadence is intentional, no loops, prop tracking clean.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Familiar tower-keeper silence tropes are refreshed through the logistical ritual of ballast stones and sea-glass bottle; the non-verbal letter-chain device feels specific, not gimmick.</comment>
