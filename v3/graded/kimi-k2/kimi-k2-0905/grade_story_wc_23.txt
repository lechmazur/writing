<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The navigator’s stitched-together body and inherited tools externalize grief in a way that forces every micro-choice; soldering her own hair is a visceral cost. Interiority stays concrete, never drifting into label-speak. The final dissolution—loosened seams, spinning compass hand—earns the Earned Stasis closure because the text has shown her body as map all along. Only the lover’s voice crackling in wiring feels reported, not dramatized, keeping her just shy of the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the station lifts as idea, she becomes the geography, cost is the literal un-stitching of self. Accumulative lens holds—each midnight call adds density, moon-phase weight shifts reweight stakes—until the final image crystallizes. Causality is lyric, not linear, but every beat (spiral of hoses, censer foot ring) is anchored to her bodily map. No orientation debt; who/where/when is clear by line 10.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The starlit dish, oil-stained concrete, and patina censer foot form a micro-setting that literally constrains her spiral layout and final step into the center. Moonlight sliding a millimeter each night is a lived, trackable environmental rule that governs the climax. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—she feels hydraulic tremor “die beneath her skin” before any visual note. Setting never stalls; every descriptor is braided to action or stakes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reverse-migrate into the geography of loss—tightens when each call demands a new bodily offering; options narrow from panel removal to hair soldering to final self-dissolution. Pressure is accumulative: moon wanes, censer foot lightens, station powers from her copper blood—each intensification reweights the same stake rather than pivoting plot. The visible price (burned fingertips, loosened seams) is legible on the page. No external coincidence; the dish moves only by moonlight rule she has always known.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the central image: migration is not travel but translation of body into map. Subtext lives in object handling—censer foot once swung for the Festival of Returning now anchors her return as dust. Final image (white flowers opening only in starlight) reweights the premise: solace becomes a place others will navigate, not a lesson stated. No moralizing; the meaning stays in the sensory residue of cedar and salt.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Voice is irreducibly her own: “maps of everyone who had ever left” compresses lineage and vocation in one breath. Syntax mirrors bodily fragmentation—em-dashes, clause layering—yet rhythm stays controlled, never spiraling into noise. Perceptual signature is tactile first, visual second: palm to cold iron, weight in pocket, mercury tears. The rusted-water voice of the phone is the only external dialogue; its diction is alien, keeping POV purity intact.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image, stakes, or body-state. Figurative density is high but patterned—moon as clipped coin, hydraulics as heartbeat—so the lyric overload reads as taught texture, not clutter. Opening line anchors voice and stakes simultaneously; final line releases a charged callback (“directions backward”) without exposition. Occasional elevated diction (“azimuth,” “gibbous”) stays within a navigator’s plausible lexicon.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>The conceit of stitching ancestral navigation tools into a living body, then soldering one’s own hair into a dead station to reverse-migrate a whole town, is a risk that pays off emotionally and logically. Moon-phase weight-shift in bronze is a fresh physical law that feels inevitable once introduced. No derivative echo; the closest cultural touchstone is Hayao Miyazaki, but the execution is singular. Risk heightens coherence rather than gimmickry.</comment>
