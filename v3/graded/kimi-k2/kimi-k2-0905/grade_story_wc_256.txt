<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The bell-ringer’s contradictory impulses—clinging to obsolete chimes while craving new resonance—are dramatized in her spiral act and final renunciation. Interiority stays concrete (“her fingers traced the carbide lamp lens, feeling its powerfully gentle weight”). The cost of leaving the lens behind is visible, but the collectors remain ghostly; no individual secondary pressure emerges, muting relationship-as-crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the laboratory’s purpose flips from preservation to co-creation, cost paid by the lens left behind and the silence she now carries. Accumulative lens holds: each added voice thickens texture until the final cadence reweights meaning. Orientation is swift; no因果 breaks. One tightening suffices for this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>“Cathedral of forgotten frequencies” and “golden shadows” render the lab as a living instrument that guides choice. The cracked carbide lens serves as micro-setting, its refracted light literally redirecting the group’s stance. Spatial choreography stays clean through the spiral build. Environment constrains the final offering, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can obsolete sound find new life?—tightens when she fractures programmed pilgrimage routes, forcing a collective either/or. Escalation is textural: each added voice increases density until the old mandate collapses. Cost is legible (abandoning bells, leaving lens), though external antagonism remains abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: artificiality is not loss but bridge. The lens’s shift from miner’s guide to spiral sun reconfigures meaning without moralizing. Final image—“cracked glass… refract light into unexpected rainbows”—offers resonant CR. No thematic echo in final paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to her sensorium (“pockets clinking with fragments”), syntax lengthening with song. No head-hopping; collectors’ interiority surfaced only through audible reaction. Distinct perceptual signature sustained under pressure. Dialogue minimal but purposeful.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with scene: short beats for arrival, lengthening phrases for communal song. Figurative language is dense yet patterned (light/sound marriage) and pays off in final refraction. No loops or scaffold. One mixed metaphor—“equipment drooping like wilted flowers”—barely grazes closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Post-blackout “laboratory of lost sounds” is fresh; coupling it with a bell-ringer who abandons bells flips expectation. Carbide lens repurposed as liturgical sun feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk—equating digital stability with spiritual lack—pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
