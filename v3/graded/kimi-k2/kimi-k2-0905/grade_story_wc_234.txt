<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Corin’s interior contradiction—quantifying emotion yet craving presence—drives every beat; the shell-handoff crystallizes a credible renunciation with visible cost. Mira’s micro-choice (whisper + tear-salt) reweights their history without exposition. Only minor slip: “scientifically romantic” is named, not embodied in diction. Still, the final shared crush lands as earned alteration.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: crushing the pocket-sun releases rather than preserves presence, reconfiguring the premise with felt cost. Causal chain holds: mentor’s riddle → seven-year misapplication → Mira’s counter-gift → renunciation. Orientation anchored by word 60; no teleporting props. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) taught early via light-density metaphors and held to last image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ember nexus functions as micro-setting: volcanic glass sings under released starfire, constraining the final gesture. Shell’s spiral recurs with shifting charge, culminating in the salt-taste transfer. Selective sensory hierarchy—heat, glow, salt—mirrors emotional narrowing. Spatial choreography clean; no white-room lapses.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to weigh presence without killing it—tightens once: from selling absence to releasing it. The shell-transfer is the single deepening that reweights options. Cost legible: years of misapplied craft and the destroyed pocket-sun. No antagonist needed; pressure is conceptual yet visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges via spiral image: presence is not compressible mass but shared motion. Final gold-wash reprises earlier light-commerce, reversing value without moralizing. Subtext in Mira’s deliberate “accidental” finger-brush carries unspoken years. No thesis statements; meaning stays embodied.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person lingers inside Corin’s scientifically romantic perceptual filter—oxytocin milligrams, starfire density—without head-hop. Syntax lengthens under abstraction, shortens under crush: “He crushed it.” Dialogue sparse, indirect, goal-driven. No register drift; diction stays within alchemist’s lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes: long reflective sentences build, then fracture at climax. Figurative language disciplined—each metaphor (elastic time, caramel heartbeat) returns reweighted. No loops or scaffold; information density high. Minor purple flicker—“whispered promise”—but does not dull closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Pocket-sun commerce + nautilus heart yields fresh angle on memory-commodification. Spiral as non-linear value circuit feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk: lyric compression over plot, but coherence holds. Specific salt-transfer detail prevents abstract drift.</comment>
