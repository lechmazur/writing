<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara’s convictions—play the unresolved chord, plant the seed—are crystal-clear, embodied, and drive every beat; the final walk-away is an earned renunciation with visible artistic cost, sealing credibility.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/lyric arc taught early; four deliberate fragments of “unfinished” music escalate toward the sunrise transformation. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration where refusal to end the note births the seedling; cost—silence, serenaded by drowned bells—is unmistakable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>The sunken greenhouse is restrained yet sensorily specific; its broken glass/car soot presses the seed, and the shipwreck circle supplies a micro-stage. The root pierces the bowl directly toward the submerged bell—setting as actor, not backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>One dominant stake: “beauty in the unresolved.” Each harmonic fragment tightens the hush, narrowing resolution options until silence itself becomes the doorway. A ventriloquism beat—the bell clink—adds explicit marine pressure without deus ex machina.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Beauty as invitation, not abandonment: theme emerges from iterative refusal to finish cadence and seed sprout. Ending crystallizes—green note refusing closure so something else may begin—without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature channels burned-ring acoustics; micro-choices like “let the note wobble on purpose” anchor in body. Dialogue minimal but resonant within lyric design; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Vivid, purposeful compression: “charred mango pits” and “copper sky” select key senses, never wallpaper. Rhythm breathes with scene pressure—soft echo arcs down.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Transforms “unfinished music” and “beauty in the burned” into a singular artistic credo; the seed-bowl-wire resonator is non-obvious yet inevitable. Risk pays off—quiet open ending charges renunciation stakes.</comment>
