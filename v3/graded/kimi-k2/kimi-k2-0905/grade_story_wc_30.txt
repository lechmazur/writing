<question>1</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Lacks embodied interior contradiction; emotions described rather than enacted. Flexes only in final smelt beat, but decisions mostly observational and labeled.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Closure is lyrical re-crystalization without a legible before/after caused by librarian choice; waits for moon to act. Causality is external, not character-driven.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Moonlit brass, salt crystals, bamboo fibers unfolding memories—concrete sensory anchors that evolve with pressure and charge the final ribbon glow.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Explicit task (smelt identities) provides pressure, but escalation leans on moon cycles; no visible cost or felt narrowing of options from librarian agency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>“Preserve wonder in routine” surfaces in dialogue, but tension wavers; identity ribbon is forged because needed, not because theme pressed harder.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Voice is ornate yet coherent—selective attention, brass-tick rhythms, lunar cadence—never swerving into confusion; reads like a single devoted consciousness.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Paragraph turnover, lunar rhyming metaphors, and net-like syntax heighten pressure without clutter; a hairline purple line in “tomorrow dissolve into foam” keeps it under 9.</comment>

<comment>Identity-ribbon kintsugi conceit feels inevitable yet fresh; mythology of titan-gear mystics melded with tide lore offers an arresting synthesis seldom seen.</comment>
