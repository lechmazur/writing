<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Arin’s claustrophobia and compass-heritage are embodied in humming shanties and the ribboned needle; the final step onto the circle crystallizes her trade-off between fear and cartographic freedom. Interior contradiction is vivid, yet the “wistfully necessary” rebellion is stated more than dramatized, muting cost. Still, the earned stasis—claustrophobia buried underground—lands cleanly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a crisp Resonant Reconfiguration: the key taken, tunnels sealed, dawn overhead—cost legible in the cracked glass circle that mirrors the compass hole. Causal chain (ledger → organ → spatial mutiny → shaft) holds; the “echoes mutiny” clue pays off in the warping rails. Orientation is swift; lens stays situational-pressure throughout. Minor slack: the organ’s mechanics remain off-stage, but coincidence is allowed to complicate, not resolve.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The nexus, compass point, and cracked glass roof function as micro-setting that literally bends choice; the lavender dawn vision reconfigures the stakes. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—cold rail, wet-parchment air—never touristic. Spatial choreography is immaculate; no floating rooms. Environment constrains the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—retrieve key or remain buried with fear—tightens when the roof sinks and rails bow, forcing the step into the compass circle. Agency drives escalation: Arin anchors the needle, descends, accepts the vision’s bargain. Cost is visible in the cracked sleeper and the forever-sealed tunnels. One meaningful deepening suffices; no reversal overload.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of internal cartography—mapping fear into freedom—emerges through mirrored ages and the lavender-overgrown future, never sermonized. The keyhole-shaped starlight reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext in the cracked mirrors and missing glass circle lingers. Slight abstraction in “mutiny inside her” keeps it from top band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person POV stays tight to Arin’s perceptual filter—compass quivering like a dowsing rod, night air thickening into wool. Syntax lengthens under claustrophobic pressure, then clips during descent. No head-hop; diction remains within her plausible lexicon. Voice is distinct, rhythmic, and pressure-responsive.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “notes sliding off the curved iron ribs like slow rain” does triple duty. No loops, no scaffold, no mixed metaphors. Rhythm accelerates with shorter sentences during shaft descent. One hairline slip—“wistfully necessary” feels editorial—but closure image is unmarred.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Familiar quest tropes—lost key, hidden vault—are re-forged through spatial mutiny and a compass-as-keyhole conceit, making the geometry itself antagonistic. The lavender dawn reprise feels inevitable yet fresh. Risk in lyric compression pays off without clarity loss. Not quite 9+ only because the organ’s off-stage source edges toward convenient mystery.</comment>
