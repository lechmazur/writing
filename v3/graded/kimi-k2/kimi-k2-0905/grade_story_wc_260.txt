<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Miren's contradictory impulses animate every gesture; the ring-drop and braid-loosen are tangible micro-choices that manifest her collapsing creed. Grief and duty compound until she inscribes each fragment of tail with a vow, a hierarchy of values that forecloses the old self at exact cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: the discovered fraud triggers stripping ceremony, each layer shed literally clears space for cedar plaque construction, and the final gesture Aster leaving the cage reconfigures options without tidy reconciliation. Closure is Earned Stasis: Miren walks back into mist willing to carry richer doubt tomorrow; visible price is her abandoned certainty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</question><answer>The cedar table, iron stove, and refrigerated drawer are tactile anchors used to dismantle and rebuild; the misted workshop itself becomes constraint as Miren must step outside to confront the live question. The cage remaining on the field charges the final image, object left behind like the con.</question>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</answer><comment>Pressure sharpens relentlessly: five lizards dead, guild ring surrendered, hair unbraided—each forfeiture narrows retreat until only cedar plaque survives as guide. Agency is renunciation and inscription; price is unmistakably paid with each deliberate loss.</answer>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><answer>Theme—the cost of compassion under imperfect trust—arises wordlessly from the tail-fragment circle and the plaque vows; no moral is announced, only the living question framed in bone-white reminders. Final moment of Aster blending into star-darkness reframes the earlier con without naming it.</answer>

<question>6</question><answer>9.4</answer><comment>Voice is crystalline, tactile, and relentlessly specific—“tiny paintbrush dipped in moonlight,” “bone-white reminders” possess perceptual signature anchored in Miren’s grief-driven synesthesia. Syntactic rhythm breathes with pressure: long rolling sentences collapse into line-by-line vows on cedar.</answer>

<question>7</question><answer>9.0</answer><comment>Each sentence advances, tightens, enacts with zero redundancy; “tail tip clipped without cruelty left to spare” is economical horror. No loops or scaffold—the single mention of mist or starlight returns amplified in final cadence without repetition.</answer>

<question>8</question><answer>8.9</answer><comment>The conceit—remedy via self-disassembly—transfigures familiar redemption arc into literal shedding of identity tokens, then literal reassembly of lizard remains into vow-inscribed vertebrae. Specificity of wildlife-handler detail rescues from template abstraction, risk rewarded.</answer>
