<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira’s claustrophobia and need to “stretch her lungs” are embodied in every micro-choice; the final release of the doll’s stored silences is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost. Interiority is specific, contradictory, and never lapses into label-speak. The only minor slip is the pruner’s quick appearance, which slightly dilutes the single-POV pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens is taught early and held to the end: each silence collected tightens the pattern until the final release reconfigures meaning. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Lira’s renunciation of the flawless silence—paid for by the weight she now carries. No orientation or causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The inverted trellis, porcelain doll, and gilded hush are rendered with sensory precision and directly constrain choices (planks yield/firm, doll stores silence). The environment evolves with the character’s ascent, charging the final image. Only the pruner’s brief presence keeps it from 9+.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—collect vs release silence—escalates through each beat; the hourglass of inverted gravity tightens options. The final renunciation is an active, costly choice under the Accumulative lens. One tightening is sufficient and cleanly landed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the concrete act of tasting and releasing silences; no direct statement intrudes. The final image of audible colors only the claustrophobic can see offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of how to live with inherited fear. Complexity is preserved—no tidy moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature (“gilded hush thick as honey yet weightless”). Patterned compression is taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and propulsive; no loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Sensory specificity and syntactic variety serve pressure without purple overload. The final paragraph’s cadence mirrors the gravity righting itself.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The inversion of gravity for one hour to harvest silence is a fresh, non-obvious frame. Every fantastical element is grounded in Lira’s embodied claustrophobia; the risk of lyrical excess is navigated with precision. The synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
