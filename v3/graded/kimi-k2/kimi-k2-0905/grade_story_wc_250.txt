<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The guardian’s muteness earns interior depth with “silent empathy” made tactically visible; each shutter-angle adjustment and micro-choice under starlight embodies cost. The backstory of the lost child is brief, anchored in present reflection, and tilts her final stance (“offering back” the mirror) into an earned renunciation of speech.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: star-light density builds across the dock plank by plank until the darkness is reweighted (“pulsed with remembered starlight”). Final Charged Poise crystallizes in the act of “offering back” the dental mirror, binding the pattern to an undeniable felt cost of letting the memory go into water.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The dock after rain, the mirror-caught helix, and the wet coat-wing all act as micro-environments; they physically constrain where the guardian can kneel and adjust the shutter angles. Each environmental cue tightens the same beat of star-light weaving.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: darkness itself must learn it can “cradle wonder.” Tightening occurs each time the guardian dims or redirects lantern-light; the spiral brightens and finally “nurses it like an ember” at an unavoidable conceptual cost for both darkness and guardian.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of shared worth arises from image, never statement: darkness gains the ability to carry light, rewriting the tragedy drowned beneath the pier. The ending’s hush answers the core question wordlessly through final dock shimmer and barge whispers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Elegant second-person compression—“the darkness leaned closer, tasting”—creates signature diction aligned with the mute guardian’s silent tactility. No dialogue appears, so the lyric texture remains unbroken under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Metaphor is purposeful and never congestive; each image folds back into the weaving action (“starlight dripped,” “pooled, curious”). Read-aloud rhythm modulates naturally, and every sentence advances setting, motion, or reflection.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</question>
<comment>The canal-guardian-as-cosmic-weaver is fresh, yet grounded in salvage planks and a salvaged dental mirror. Darkness becomes an emergent character taught wonder, an angle untransformed in any prior canon I know.</comment>
