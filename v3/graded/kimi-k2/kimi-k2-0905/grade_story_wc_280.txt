<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The ghost’s craving for one more ovation is stated often yet lacks interior contradiction or micro-choice; Lila appears largely as memory-function rather than full partner.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Closure lands in Earned Stasis: the ghost gains an endless encore but remains bound to the theater’s hidden wing, the quince tree holding the re-sealed time ribbon. Cause-and-effect holds: because he ties coin to tree, time folds and the theater blooms into presence. Cost is legible as the ghost’s visible immortality—the show plays for eternity and he is its prisoner.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vivid specificity—velvet curtains, frost footlights, pear footlights glowing—serves as the stage itself and constrains every move; the orchard garden’s cracked marble stage and blooming quince tree are not passive backdrop but active prop that re-seals the timeline, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—salvaging possibility against despair—tightens once when the ghost agrees to “lure it” instead of merely mourn; price is the eternal encore, an undeniable, perpetual performance that forecloses release, cost paid on stage.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>The refracted theme is memory as renewable theater—each echo a ticket. It emerges through concrete particulars: Lila’s thimble spins, the tarot coin threads centuries; the final bow carries unresolved, resonant ambiguity rather than a stated moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Voice carries a lyrical, velvet-gilt cadence suited to backstage; synesthetic layering of scent-as-chords (“buttered popcorn…rosin”) is consistent and purposeful; no head-hopping, POV coherence holds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Lines are densely textured, propulsive, and prop-serving; only one synonym pair slows no more than −0.2 (“applause…wash”), easily beneath 9+ gate; no artifact touches the final bow.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</question><comment>Ghost-orchard-theater as living relic, tarot coin that literally re-stitches time, and synesthetic paint that tastes starlight—each synthesized rather than quoted; risk heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
