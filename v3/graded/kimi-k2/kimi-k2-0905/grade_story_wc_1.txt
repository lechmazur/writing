<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied; the artist’s contradictory impulses (profit vs. conscience) are dramatized through tactile micro-choices—crushing the charcoal, reclaiming beads. The final renunciation is earned and carries visible cost. Minor drift: no second character on page, so status/relationship crucible untested.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: she steps off the path encoded in the ledger, scattering its ashes and boarding the blank-route bus. The cost—loss of revenge, embrace of uncertain purpose—is legible in the charcoal line fading on her arm. Drive lens (Situational) holds from canyon pause to final poise.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Frost, schist warmth, and obsidian shard function as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory selection is purposeful and POV-filtered; canyon walls narrowing to “a blade of starlight” mirrors her narrowing options. Environment actively guides tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—purpose versus complicity—tightens when she reads the smugglers’ schism in the ash circle and chooses to step off the encoded route. The pause crystallizes into irrevocable stance; cost is the forfeiture of mapped revenge. Escalation is one decisive intensification, sufficient for length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of “purpose in the pauses” emerges through image and action, never assertion. The scorched testament’s transformation from map to permission reweights the premise without moralizing. Final image—molten light awaiting shaping—offers resonant, non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; perceptual signature (“glass fragments ignited into floating sparks”) is consistent and character-bound. Compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates with emotional intensity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and propulsive; figurative language is selective and purposeful. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances story or atmosphere. Occasional elevated diction (“drifting resonance”) is voice-motivated and does not obscure clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Transforms familiar revenge-quest into meditation on ethical refusal; glass artistry as witness to erasure feels fresh. Specific synthesis—beads as paused breaths, charcoal as glaze recipe—makes the conceit inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
