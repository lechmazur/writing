<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The copper-veined storyteller’s motivation—fear of silence outweighing fear of curse—drives every beat; her embodied calcification and the final swallowing of the diamond dramatize an irreversible cost that forecloses her life yet births the lexicon, a perfect Earned Stasis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the statue’s cupped palm and crystal heart reweight the entire quest, making the language immortal at the price of her flesh; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds from first texture-note to final echo-choir, each beat thickening density rather than causal chain.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Bone towers, diamond, and her own petrifying body function as micro-settings that constrain every tactic; the canyon’s echo-tunnel literally shapes the grammar she forges, and the final ivory statue charges the closing image with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—save the river-tongue or perish—tightens once yet decisively: swallowing the diamond fossilizes her, a visible price that reweights the stake from personal survival to linguistic immortality; agency and cost are legible on the final beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: translation demands mortal sacrifice; the final heron-wing pattern etched by a living bird crystallizes the idea that meaning must migrate or die, a resonant non-literal answer with no moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyric third-person hovers at mythic distance yet keeps perceptual signature—copper veins, reed-mat sorrow—tightened through rhythmic cadence that mirrors fossilizing heartbeat; no head-hopping, no register drift, pattern taught by line one and paid off in the echo-choir.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence layers texture-into-sound without metaphor clutter; the final “word being born, wet and blind” is precise, visceral, and propels closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of linguistics, petrifaction, and migratory bird grammar is non-obvious and inevitable; risk-taking—turning protagonist into stone phonograph—heightens stakes without gimmickry, creating a singular mythic stance.</comment>
