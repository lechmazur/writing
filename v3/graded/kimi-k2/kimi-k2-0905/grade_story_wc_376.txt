<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Aurelia’s interior contradiction—gilt as both armor and prison—drives every micro-choice; the moment she lays calfskin among unopened letters, her renunciation costs the only trade she owns. Corin’s single matching fragment turns their shared ache into mutual pressure, satisfying relationship-as-crucible. The “lonely beneath my gilt” line crystallizes flaw and need in one breath, paying the visible cost required for 9- territory; only the slight under-dramatized shift from isolation to partnership keeps it shy of the top band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the cathedral becomes a living post office and the two silhouettes emerge unafraid—an undeniable before/after charged with conceptual cost. Causal chain holds: map fragment → cathedral → candor → vines lift, each step tightening options under the Accumulative/Textural lens. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchor within 120 words and the final image reweights the premise without exposition. Persistent constraint—she now carries zinc, not gold—shapes future tactics, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Greenhouse city, filtration veils, and pneumatic postal roots are lived-in, not catalogued; the Fern Cathedral’s broken panes and sagging vines mirror emotional collapse while supplying the exact stage for candor. Zinc fragments function as micro-setting, pocketed and fingered at junctions, constraining her path like prayer beads. The toxic sky never changes, but its reflection in the final glass recharges the stakes—an environment that charges the closing image, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“where lost conversations go”—is signaled early and tightens when she realizes the map leads to unopened letters, foreclosing her private myth of gold. The act of reading them aloud with Corin is the single meaningful deepening that reweights cost under Accumulative lens; no reversal needed. Price is legible: she abandons her last gold foil and future livelihood for unpaid postal nights. Could edge higher if the city’s breath ration had pressed her in scene, but the pressure is implied rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the tension between gilt performance and unspoken thirst; no character ever utters “truth is water,” yet every image—wilting vines, oxidized copper wax, zinc postmarks—repeats the equation. The final silhouette of two unafraid speakers offers a non-literal answer: candor, not water, irrigates. No moralizing line distills the insight; it’s left humid and breathing. Only the faintest echo of prompt language in “candor in small moments” keeps it from perfect integration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person stays latched to Aurelia’s perceptual filter—gilded letters curl like scorched petals, zinc ridges feel like promise—without head-hop. Syntax lengthens in humid languor, then clips when she “slipped out before curfew,” mirroring risk. No dialogue to test voice distinction, yet internal diction remains artisan-specific: “nib,” “calfskin,” “gilt.” The single filtration-veiled line Corin speaks is plain, letting joint candor feel like shared breath rather than writerly flourish.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm breathes with action; no template cadence or synonym loops. Metaphors stay coherent—ink as lie, zinc as map-bone—without mixed-vehicle clutter. Information density high: one sentence often layers sensory, symbolic, and causal work (“She set her calfskin strip among the letters, an offering to the cathedral’s humid silence”). A single scaffold phrase—“the toxic sky was still opaque”—is justified as echoing stasis; it does not dull the final image, so 9- remains reachable.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Post-apocalyptic postal noir is familiar, yet the splice of gilded illumination with pneumatic zinc plates feels singular; no other story would hinge calligraphy on honesty-as-photosynthesis. The map-to-letters inversion—treasure as abandoned intimacy—reweights genre expectation without gimmick. Risk is taken: no villain, no water found, yet stakes feel absolute because livelihood and loneliness are wagered. Transformation test fails if names change; the craft-specific vocabulary is irreplaceable.</comment>
