<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Liora’s curiosity-driven arc is embodied in every micro-choice; the nickel’s bargain crystallizes her shift from certainty to wonder with visible cost—her identity as restorer dissolves into perpetual apprentice. Interiority stays concrete, never drifting into label-speak. The nested copies dramatize her internal split without head-hop confusion.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the city’s recursive awakening re-weights the premise, trading finished murals for endless inquiry. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each fold intensifies the same stake—while the final image (“story merely paused”) enacts conceptual cost. Orientation is taught early via the sound-garden rules.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The garden’s sonic architecture is no backdrop; its basalt slabs and mirrored echoes actively constrain tactics, forcing Liora to swap spoon for nickel. Sensory detail is selective—ringing glass, warming coin—filtered through her restorer’s ear. The folding spatial logic remains coherent and charged at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—curiosity vs certainty—is signaled in the nickel’s whisper and tightened at every fold; each nested Liora forfeits the comfort of completion. Agency drives escalation: her choice to invert the note drains color, foreclosing the old method. Cost is visible in the ghost outlines left behind.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: restoration as endless conversation between city and restorer. The nickel’s dissolution into “paint flake of pure inquiry” re-weights prior mosaics without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture—the spoon’s silence after the nickel’s B-flat.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Liora’s sensory filter; no head-hop. Compression (“city exhaled, slabs shifting”) is taught early and paid off. Syntax modulates with pressure—short percussive clauses during folds, longer lullaby cadence at close.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or filler; every sentence layers image and motion. “Color drained… into possibility” is precise, not purple. Rhythm accelerates with each fold, then breathes in the final lullaby, mirroring the city’s pulse.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The hobo nickel as coin-of-attention is a fresh, non-obvious engine; nested awakenings invert the typical “art fixes city” trope. Risky recursive structure pays off by making the reader feel the vertigo of endless curiosity. Specificity of 1937 buffalo with bindle grounds the fantastical frame.</comment>
