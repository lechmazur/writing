<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mireya’s shift from passive sorter to active Keeper is embodied in tactile micro-choices—handling leaves, placing monuments—each tightening her perceptual stakes. The cost is visible: her palms moss-covered, her senses permanently altered. Interiority is specific, never diagnostic. One slip: “mossy delight unfurling like fern fronds” edges toward label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the sky accepts the monuments, leaves descend, equilibrium restored. Causal chain—leaf runes → map → monuments → sky-mirror—holds without gaps. Orientation is immediate; stakes escalate through each dawn ritual. Cost is felt in Mireya’s irreversible sensory transformation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The arbor’s silver bark, floating catwalks, and peat-scented mulch are filtered through Mireya’s seed-tuned senses, constraining where she can reach and what she notices. Spatial choreography is flawless; distances track as she climbs. Sensory hierarchy narrows under urgency. Final mulch blanket anchors the transformed world.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake: prevent the grove’s dissolution via ascending leaves. Pressure tightens each dawn; each monument exacts a memory-tax. Agency is continuous—every placement forecloses other memories. Cost is cumulative and visible in Mireya’s altered body. No external antagonist needed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of remembrance emerges from concrete acts—labeling acorn cups, weaving feathers—never stated. Subtext in the hush between star-fade and bird-cry. Final image of drifting mulch reweights the opening ritual. No moralizing; resonance is tactile.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays inside Mireya’s perceptual filter; no head-hopping. Syntax mirrors her seed-sorting precision: short, tactile clauses. Occasional lyric lift (“gray vault of sky”) is earned by pattern. Voice remains consistent under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers scent, texture, and motion. No loops or scaffold. Metaphors are coherent—moths, peat, moss—anchored in setting. Minor over-modulation in “mossy delight unfurling” but does not obscure closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise of floating arbor whose leaves demand monuments to forgotten things is fresh, yet grounded in sensory specificity. Folklore inversion—“leaves rise, the forgotten speak”—avoids cliché. Risky structure (ritual repetition) pays off in mirrored arbor. Transformation test passed: story would collapse if elements were generic.</comment>
