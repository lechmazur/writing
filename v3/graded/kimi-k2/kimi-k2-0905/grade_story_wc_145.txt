<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is sharp—Maren’s cataloguing instinct collides with wonder—and each micro-choice (ignoring the radio, tearing the page, descent) emerges from a trait that has already been staged (‘dry-witted,’ ‘subtly confident’). Motivation is legible until the final beat; only the falcon’s resurrection-by-updraft slightly blurs cost, keeping the score just outside the 9-band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the map dissolves into living waterways, replacing conquest with witness. Causality is intact—each beat adds density (the warm exhale-spiral, the chime responding to Quechua)—until Maren actively chooses to transmit the image rather than coordinates.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Place is never decorative: the corroded tripod becomes lifeline and compass, the throat-shaped limestone balcony supplies footing, the frozen lake constrains every move. Micro-setting objects (ice fracture, survey rope) actively shape tactics and are recharged under the ending image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Single dominant stake—how to be the first witness—tightened once by the Registry’s demand and again by the decision to transmit the ephemeral map rather than betray it. The choice exacts an on-page cost (sacrificing confirmation, erasing the artifact) that crystallizes the stance.</comment>
<question>5</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The question of origin emerges through repeated river words and glowing microorganisms, culminating in a resonant gesture: map becomes river, secrecy becomes transmission. Theme is earned without direct articulation—ambiguity lingers, inviting future children to dream.</comment>
<question>6</question>
<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is controlled throughout: Maren catalogs, annotates, and breathes spirals. Compression (“she listened for rivers learning to speak”) is taught early enough; no lines obscure interiority or leak distance.</comment>
<question>7</question>
<grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Lines do multiple jobs (setting + body + metaphor) without figurative clutter. Rhythm accelerates at descent—condensation, chime, rope rungs—then softens into the final image. No filler or synonym loops dull the closure.</comment>
<question>8</question>
<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Forges a fresh angle on the “hidden source of all rivers” idea through bilingual etymology, glowing biome map, and the ethical pivot of letting truth propagate instead of archiving it. The synthesis feels inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
