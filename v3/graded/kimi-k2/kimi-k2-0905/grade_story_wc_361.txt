<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s jittery interiority is embodied through pulsing pendant moments and micro-choices, but his final shift from courier to mythic figure feels more allegorical than organically driven; the motif of “fade” is stated more than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens is taught early via charged echoes (“vanished mentor” seeds closure) and lands a resonant Crystallized Poise—Elias stepping across legend’s seam with visible mythic cost crystalized in the final auroral charge.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>“Aurora-lit ridgeway” is rendered with sharp sensory economy; wind-whipped light visibly presses Elias toward the ridge seam, making the micro-setting a felt limiter that narrows his route and charges the final leap image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Ordinary courier vs. vanishing mentor stakes are tethered to the ridgeway fade, but escalation is more poetic widening than tightened cause-effect; the climactic transfer to mythic identity alters stakes but lacks mid-escalation trade-offs felt on page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Wonder vs certainty theme emerges through recurrent dragonfly motif and mentor’s vanishing act; yet its articulation leans on stylized oration rather than scenes that shift reader valuation, leaving ambiguity as ornament.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyric lens maintains intimate tremor-wash of sensation; rhythmic compression (“liquid sky,” “jittery waltz”) heightens pressure, with no head-hopping. The lady-figure’s cut dialogue is crisp mythic without voice bleed.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Language is vivid and propulsive despite poetry lines; few filter verbs and no template cadence; minor purple moments (“eternal dance”) slightly muddy direction. No loops or scaffold that dulls the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Synthesizes mentor vanishing trope into fade-between-realities rift—a fresh angle refracted through aurora physics; the courier-to-legend transformation, though mythic cliché, is given intimate specificity via dragonfly crystallization and auroral reprise.</comment>
