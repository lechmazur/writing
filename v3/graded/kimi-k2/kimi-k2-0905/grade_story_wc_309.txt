<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elian’s underachiever status seeds all choices; shame & wonder drive the badge removal. Interior contradiction flickers—“confessed, voice cracking”—without therapy-speak. Cost is visible: loss of guild identity, exile into unbarcoded dark. Endurance renounces upward path; earned stasis lands with frost-cold seat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Drive lens holds to Accumulative/Textural closure: luminous quota → keystone surrender → unmeasured night. Causal stair dissolves, but the RR of invisible joy crystallizes meaning. No orientation drift; spatial anchors stay legible. The badge-melt darkening is decisive, cost legible in server rounding-error log.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Frost-laced balcony and drifting snow-island ground Elian’s exile; chill constrains every move (dangling legs, cold seat). The keystone’s dulling opal becomes micro-setting that powers closure. Sensory hierarchy stays within POV’s priorities—no tourist catalog. Setting charges final image without overwriting line-level flow.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“luminance as credit”—tightens toward quantified vs unquantified joy. One meaningful deepening: keystone dims garden, exile darkens horizon, choices foreclose ascent. No antagonist but algorithmic sealing delivers external pressure. Agency lands in badge sacrifice; cost is visible (expulsion) and emotional (invisibility).</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: sacred as non-commodified wonder. No explicit moralizing; images of paper boats and unbarcoded snow carry latent commentary. Final quiet laugh embodies CR by repricing grace without doctrine. Complexity preserved; reader exits contemplating unpatented light vs automation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds stable, voice tinted by Elian’s sardonic fatigue. Diction—“algorithmic auroras,” “scent of printer toner”—is character-coloured, no tourist gloss. Syntax modulates with descent: mist stair breathless, garden a still mirror. Metaphor density is purposeful, never obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sentences advance multiple jobs: “The ribbon became a stair of mist spiraling downward through the cold air” delivers setting, stakes, verb. Rhythm flexes with panic breaths, then settles back. Occasional ornamental flourishes, none muddle causality in peak beats. Final line’s “darkness felt exactly bright enough” lands with precise cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Trope remix—magical dystopia, luminous soul-currency—is grounded in concrete body & badges. Folly as sacred valve reframes familiar “hidden garden” image. Paper-boat release offers fresh, risk-taking closure. Premise integrity maintained; no gimmickry.</comment>
