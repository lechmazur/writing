<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mara’s interior contradiction—fixer vs. haunted witness—crystallizes in the final image of leaving the mainspring yet carrying the stub. Emotions are embodied (thumb resisting winding square, paper warming to cable). The renunciation feels earned because the earlier beat of watching her past self forecloses the loop with palpable cost. No therapy-speak; actions reveal hierarchy of values: ascent over repair.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: leaving the barrel and taking the stub reweights the earlier crack-through-time motif. Causality is circular (elevator loop) yet the choice to walk out breaks it, showing on-page cost: the child solidifies, moon-shadow cast. No orientation debt. Lens remains Accumulative/Textural—pressure accumulates through ghost silence—then crystallizes in the choice, perfectly coherent.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The ticket office’s spatial choreography is immaculate: desk groans, linoleum pulses, rafter crack glows. Body as micro-setting: Mara’s knees bend under the weightless burden, then ascend via ghost-ladder. The ADMIT ONE stubs fall as physical snowfall—environment constrains the choice at closure. No external world-building needed; internal place feels lived and pressuring.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake is laid out in the third sentence—“horologist’s mainspring barrel rumored”—and tension tightens via the ghosts’ silent pressure. One decisive reversal when Mara sees her own past self inside the elevator: choice becomes renunciation, foreclosing the repair path with felt weight. Cost is visible: she leaves the coiled heart and accepts the ticket stub’s unfinished sky.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The theme emerges without exposition: cycles of ascent and fall, the ethics of witnessing one’s own collapse. Subtext glows in the frost the child presses into the crack—“what ceilings hide” becomes what time hides. No moralizing; the ending simply reconfigures the image of ascent as acceptance of cracks. Thematic resonance lingers through specificity, not statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is dense, metallic, and haunted: “dust accumulation patterns on the countertop like a detective reading Braille.” Perceptual signature is Mara’s technician-eye—she reads building-pulse instead of heartbeats. No head-hopping. Compression in ghost silence creates rhythmic pressure—sentences tighten like springs until the final stub melts into possibility.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lines are high-density poetry: “ghosts did not speak, but their silence pressed questions against her eardrums.” No loops or scaffold. Syntax breathes with scene: long coils of description then sudden fragments. Metaphors are precise, never purple; “a coat tailored exactly to her ribs” shows earned cost through sensory economy.</question>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</question><comment>The elevator ghost-seer premise synthesizes horror with vocational precision; technician + haunted circus office is fresh. Re-use of the mainspring across past/future self without gimmickry. Risk-taking in circular structure heightens stakes yet closure remains legible. Specificity of ticket stubs ‘ADMIT ONE TO THE SKY’ roots abstraction in concrete artifact.</comment>
