<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s interior contradiction—scientific curiosity vs. reverent listening—drives every micro-choice; the decision to ring the bell instead of the siren crystallizes her hierarchy of values with visible cost (loss of civic protocol, personal risk). Embodied emotion is precise: “heart drumming louder than the bronze.” Father’s pine-tar ghost and the rope’s twitch supply concrete, character-specific memory cues. The final renunciation—leaving the toggle for next year—earns its quiet sting because prior beats have tied her identity to this act of listening.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: six bell waves reconfigure the city’s relationship with the mountain and Mara’s with her father’s legacy; cost is audible in the “after-ring living in the stone.” Causal chain holds: pressure dip → rope twitch → bell choice → valley awe → dawn descent. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“windblown sanctuary above the clouds”). No lens ambiguity; accumulative pattern (microclimate data + bell resonance) tightens once and pays off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The brass barometer, cathedral bell rope, and moon-“nailed” sky function as micro-setting that constrains every move; the rope’s frayed fibers and pine-tar scent literally steer Mara’s decision. Weather is not backdrop but antagonist: the 03:17 pressure dip is the inciting pulse. Spatial choreography is immaculate—balcony → corkscrew stair → belfry → descent—each level re-weighted by the bell’s timbre. Final image of “ghost of six low notes” charges the city’s air, making environment and aftermath inseparable.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“will the mountain speak and be heard?”—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightens at 03:42 when the second dip forces the illegal switch. Agency is pure: Mara’s hand-toggled splice triggers the reversal; coincidence merely nudges. Cost is legible: civic disobedience, paternal legacy risk, and the irreversible acoustic signature that replaces warning with wonder. One meaningful deepening suffices; no escalation loops.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of “courtesy toward the world’s whispers” emerges solely through event: bell waves translate invisible downdraft into communal awe. No thesis statement; the final line’s “reminder” is an image, not a moral. Subtext hums in the rope’s twitch—mountain as co-author—and in valley radios crackling “wonder instead of civil-defense anger.” Ambiguity is preserved: next solstice may choose siren, cost already paid.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Mara’s perceptual signature—wind that “carries sorrow,” glue glowing “dull silver,” bell notes “warm stones into cold milk.” Syntax lengthens and shortens with altitude breath. No head-hopping; city’s reaction is filtered through radios she cannot see. Compression (“slow whales beyond the stone balcony”) is taught early and paid off in the cloud-sea that swallows bell waves.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: long breathless ascent sentences vs. staccato time-stamps. Information density high—each sentence advances barometer, memory, or myth. Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors. One scaffold risk: “after the glue dries” refrain could feel template, but its final echo (“trust becomes the only tool left”) reweights it with cost, earning its repetition.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: microclimate science + monastic bell lore + civic civil-defense ritual, all braided through a single sensory object (rope). Transformation test fails if Mara is generic meteorologist; her specific filial grief and pitch-perfect ear make the tale irreplicable. Risk taken—illegal swap of sacred bronze for mechanical siren—pays off in communal re-enchantment. No derivative echo; the sky’s throat and inverse chimney feel newly minted yet grounded.</comment>
