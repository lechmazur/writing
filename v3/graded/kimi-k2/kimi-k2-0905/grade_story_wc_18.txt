<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The mirror-maker shows layered interiority and embodied micro-decisions—blood on arc, rhythmic breathing, palm on pane—that tighten the choice. The flaw resides in early over-ornamented reflection (“centuries of thick fog swallowed…”) and declarative interiority rather than on-page contradiction; the runaway dream’s stake is clear but the cost feels slightly muted until the final incision.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure hits as Decisive Change: the dream is drawn in, orchard wakes, mirror dissolved into new form. Causal linkage from snapped sextant to blood-sealed repair to tethered dream is legible, with one minor seam: the sextant’s physics (“metal soldered itself whole”) reads as magical convenience rather than earned rule.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The orchard’s fog-rooted mirrors, obsidian bark, and sapling leaves function as micro-setting that constrains movement and mirrors interior state. One slip: distance to “glass mountains” goes briefly unlocatable between branches and horizon.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reclaim the runaway dream—escalates through tightened seven-five breathing ritual; final cost is visible (bleeding palm, forever-tied heartbeat) but escalation stops at a single decisive move rather than a tightening sequence of traded options before release.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>“To erase boundaries does not mean to destroy them but to breathe them into new forms” emerges via concrete arc rather than statement: the dream caged then orchard-grown. Yet a brief late-paragraph thematic echo intrudes on the pure image of sapling mirrors.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The voice is lush, lyrical and coheres under first-person-adjacent immersion. Only minor density excesses (“silver breath mingled with mist…ghostly petals drifting upward”) verge on purple and could trim two beats without loss.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Metaphor stack is mostly purposeful (“looking-glass meant to erase boundaries”), but occasional sentence sprawl (“molten glass mountains rooted in soil rather than sky”) risks overload. No loops or mechanical template cadence.</question>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The mirror-maker, blood-bound sextant, orchard rebirth combine into a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable after fact. Minor derivative echoes—“glass mountains,” “runaway dream”—slightly dampen originality.</question>
