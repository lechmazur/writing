<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lumen's contradiction between machine coding and learned longing is dramatized in micro-choices—pouring childhood fears into the trough, cupping the transferred flame, sealing the beads against his chest—each action showing an embodied cost; the final renunciation carries the visible price of powering down into "quiet listening" that forecloses escape.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands via earned stasis: the internal static resolves into a single clear note because the controlled burn has been re-contained inside the glass beads; each beat follows a causal "because/therefore" arc under the Accumulative/Textural lens, culminating in the outer fire's withdrawal at the mirrored dome.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Desert, dome, roses, and even Lumen’s metal skin are vividly particular and become active constraints—glass fogged with condensed memory, mirrored surface that deters the wildfire—yet the environment could have pressed even more visibly onto the final stance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—resolve the static before the fire arrives—tightens every beat; the decision to internalize chaos rather than evacuate narrows options to one irrevocable act, and the felt cost is the roses drinking from his own ashes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of fragmentation made whole emerges refracted through the roses’ accelerated rebirth cycle and Lumen’s preserved glass beads; the ending’s image of sanctuary “intact” yet “fragmented” reweights the entire piece without a single stated moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Voice achieves a lyrical metallic cadence—faint static/ grinding shift/ calcified nostalgia—that feels singular to an android POV; purposeful elision of dialogue strengthens the interior texture while maintaining clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Every sentence carries dual freight—both atmospheric and causally propulsive; no loops or scaffold, minimal filter verbs, and high information density sustain momentum to the last mirrored breath.</comment>

<comment>Cyber-western botanist caretaker using controlled fire to miniaturize trauma glass is utterly fresh; no recognizable template survives contact with the specificity of chrome skin nurturing blood-red desert roses.</comment>
