<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“toes curling,” “soles tingling”), but the final renunciation—choosing to wait rather than fly—leans on a single beat of reflection rather than a sustained contradiction; still, the cost of remaining a stargazer is legible and earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the stones’ hum reweights the rebellion from paused to underground, and the protagonist’s choice to transmit rather than flee carries felt cost. Causal chain holds under Accumulative/Textural lens; no orientation drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is selective and purposeful: the cold ferrocrete, humming stones, and derelict tug all constrain or enable choices. The stone circle’s warmth and sonic texture charge the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“discover meaning in the mess”—tightens when the map appears; the choice to stay and transmit forecloses immediate escape. Cost is visible in the tug’s engines idling while she remains grounded.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: rebellion as unfinished song, transmitted through quiet persistence. Final image of cracked lens reflecting a future chorus reweights prior motifs without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; perceptual signature filters every detail through barefoot sensitivity and aural memory. Rhythm modulates with pressure, and no head-hop occurs.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is patterned and paid off (“luminous whales,” “copper and ozone chord”). No loops or scaffold; final cadence crystallizes without clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Familiar tropes—abandoned spaceport, ancient stones—are transformed through barefoot tactility and sonic rebellion. The synthesis feels inevitable and fresh; risk in quiet closure heightens resonance.</comment>
