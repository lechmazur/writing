<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motives remain abstract—the guardian simply “waits” and “practices.” The acolyte’s return offers a late emotional beat, yet his transformation feels narrated rather than earned through visible interior struggle. No contradictory impulses act in-scene; the guardian’s interiority stays lyrical rather than conflicted.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise: the boundary holds not by force but invitation—uncertainty sipped like tea with visible reconfiguration. Accumulative lens lands: cadence and image density deepen until the final exhale reweights earlier mist sentences. One mild orientation wobble until “between two toppled marble lions” (≈140 wds) but it later serves the final image—no penalty. Pendant’s darkening and footprints becoming text create legible before/after with felt quiet cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Garden’s frost scripts, petrified herbs, and mist-sentence palimpsest pressure the guardian’s attention and define the final re-encoding. Rosemary thawing under the acolyte’s steps releases memory, binding setting to closure. Spatial anchor holds; detail is selective, vivid, and thematically co-extensive with stakes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—holding the membrane of knowing—pressured by warming pendant; guardian’s interiorizing tightens the drumskin once. One quiet decisive turn accepts uncertainty as guest, narrowing future tactics. Forfeit cost is conceptual (library tilts closer yet still unreachable) and felt in the guardian’s steaming fur.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—the hospitality of uncertainty—emerges from organic iterations: mist into language, echo-key into lock, uncertainty given a warm corner. No didactic statements; resonance arises from final bead of night and footprints re-authored. Resists neat moral, embraces charged ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice operates in dense lyrical compression; recursive syntactic pattern (mist = sentences) taught early and paid at closure. Perceptual signature is singular: guardian reads garden as text, experiences dimensional tug. Dialogue spare, carrying subtext (“I was told you eat certainty”), stays consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is sculpted, rhythmic, high density; occasional nominal padding (“dimensionally homesick”) is offset by sonic payoff. No loops or redundant stems detected; final image crystallizes clearly. Register holds across lyric altitude without slippage.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Library guardian at the seam of story-text and night ice is fresh synthesis; intrusions of dream children, echo keys, and frost alphabets transform portal trope into lyric metafiction. Risky conceit is fully committed, coherence intact, and feels inevitable in retrospect.</comment>
