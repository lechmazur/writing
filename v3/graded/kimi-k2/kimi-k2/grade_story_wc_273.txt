<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Alba’s serene anger is embodied and consistent, driving every micro-choice; her immunity to panic and refusal to flee are credibly rooted in her physiology and seventeen-year history. The final decision to step through the doorway is earned by prior beats and carries visible cost—she forfeits safety to rescue the others. Interiority is specific and character-bound, avoiding diagnostic speak. Only the chronographer’s late appearance limits relationship crucible depth.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Alba’s calm stance reweights the premise that crisis-time is mercy, and the cost is felt in the amber-frozen colleagues. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of ink patterns and drone data tighten until the doorway crystallizes. Orientation is anchored early; no causality breaks. One minor ellipsis (how the drone “holds the doorway open”) is acceptable under lyric compression.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The wind-carved encampment, drone, and ink function as micro-settings that constrain choice: sandstone walls shift under drone signal, ink flows uphill to shape thresholds. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (“white hair catching the first pale light”). The final image of amber-suspended researchers is spatially coherent and charges the closure. No orientation debt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover the vanished researchers—signaled in paragraph two. Escalation is Accumulative: each new ink pattern tightens the mystery and narrows Alba’s options until only the doorway remains. The cost is legible—she risks eternal terror to attempt rescue. No coincidence resolves the conflict; her calm agency drives every beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: time’s apparent dilation in crisis is mercy, not malice, a reconfiguration earned through Alba’s embodied experience. Subtext operates in the ink’s silent equations and the drone’s holographic field. The ending offers a resonant, non-moralizing image—amber colleagues—rather than a thesis. No thematic echo in final paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct, lyric, and POV-locked; perceptual signature is Alba’s tracker precision (“patterns shifted when she looked away”). Compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure. Syntax modulates with pressure—long sentences for reflection, fragments for action. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet clear; figurative language is purposeful (“ink eating the minutes”). No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Rhythm accelerates during ink-flow beats and breathes during reflection. One minor filter-verb cluster (“she understood then that…”) does not obscure causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of temporal ink, albino immunity, and serene anger feels inevitable and fresh. Risk-taking in the lyric, accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The premise is transformed through specific character physiology and emotional stance. No derivative echoes.</comment>
