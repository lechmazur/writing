<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira’s interior contradiction—cartographer vs. pilot—drives every beat; the shard’s pulse forces micro-choices that escalate cost. Embodied emotion (“tears freezing”) and the final renunciation (pressing the shard into the floor) earn the change. Minor: younger-Lira beat is summary, not dramatized, slightly diluting agency.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the shard stilled, weight released, “the weaving between worlds had become her ordinary breath.” Causal lens holds—each cycle narrows options until she chooses return. Orientation taught early via “folded like paper”; transitions legible. Cost is legible in the final hush.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Abandoned bay and shard-as-micro-setting constrain every move; the bay’s rust and sideways corridors guide redirection. Sensory specificity (“oil-stained deck,” “recycled air”) filters through Lira’s map-maker bias. Final image—shard sealed in the crack—recharges the setting as map.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—why the shard tugs her—tightens when younger Lira slots it and the memory explodes. One decisive deepening: realizing the world sought is a moment, not a place. Cost crystallizes in “weight of the withheld truth settling into her bones.” No escalation drift.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the pilot’s silence protecting the crew; final image reframes the bay as map of interior silence. Subtext in the shard’s stillness after cycles of motion. No moralizing; resonance lingers in “spaces between worlds where truths wait to be spoken.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyric, compressed voice mirrors Lira’s synesthetic perception (“console sang a chord that tasted of ozone”). POV remains tight; no head-hop. Rhythm modulates with pressure—longer cadence for reflection, clipped for pulse. Occasional elevated diction (“cyclically spontaneous”) fits map-maker idiom.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>High density, zero loops; each sentence layers sensory and emotional data. Metaphors precise (“catwalks that arced into other versions of the same night”). Minor scaffold: “folded like paper” appears twice—acceptable as taught pattern. Closure line clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: sensory cartography + multiverse recursion + memory shard. Risky sideways gravity corridors pay off in closure. Transformation test: story collapses if shard is generic crystal. Specificity of “green glass from cockpit window” anchors universality.</comment>
