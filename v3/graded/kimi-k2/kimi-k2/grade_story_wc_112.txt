<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lira’s grief-bound interiority is embodied and coherent; her obliging nature collides with secret obsession to move her choices. Final decision—log the proof yet carry sideways grief—earns resonance. Compassionate flaw (never refuse) forecloses full healing; cost legible on page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure: Charged Poise as Lira re-enters “the subdued awakening of possibility,” now charged with sideways grief. Causal chain holds: lever opens time corridor → proof collected → corridor collapse → escape → grief repricing under new nexus configuration. Lens tight throughout. No causality break.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Kepler-9c station, moth-whale tanks, ozone air, and zero-g choreography anchor action. The magnetic nexus as micro-setting directly constrains the proof attempt and reappears imprinted with her brother’s name. Sensory specificity charges closure with intimate cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove lateral time—is signaled early, then tightened by corridor collapse forcing flight. Trade-off emerges: obtain proof, lose brother from linearity; corridor failure reweights the stakes, cost visible in “tasted like thawed frost.”</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges from sideways grief without preaching; final “sideways moment” reweights temporal premise non-literally. Recurrent moth-whale dreams and pier images accumulate toward inevitability. Emotional specificity rescues concept from abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lyrical compression is earned; voice stays in Lira’s perceptual register—“mechanically warm,” “violet clouds,” “subdued awakening.” Diction modulates under pressure without drifting. No exposition dumps.</comment>

<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Rhythm pulses with urgency; sentence variety under corridor-sprint is tight, no paraphrase loops. One small scaffold redundancy “hush of beating wings at rest” echoed thrice—minor damp, not damaging at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fusion of moth-whale dreams with temporal physics is inventive; “sideways time” concept plus grief physics feels organic. Transformation test passes: any swap alters emotional logic.</comment>
