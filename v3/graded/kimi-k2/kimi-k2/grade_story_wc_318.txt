<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—grief vs. the need to reanimate laughter—are embodied in every micro-choice (grip on cord, throttle modulation). The final smile is earned by the causal chain of her risky séance with the blower. Interiority stays concrete and idiosyncratic; no therapy-speak intrudes. Minor cap: no second on-page character, so relationship crucible is moot.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: each gust thickens the pattern until the house itself exhales the punchline. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—laughter re-enters the household with visible cost (fuel spent, grief shredded into confetti). Orientation is immediate; no teleporting props. One hairline slip: the hourglass reset is off-page, but the final ticking engine supplies felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The tunnel and blower function as micro-setting that physically constrains tactics (sound ricochets, leaves trapped inside). Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered; moonlight becomes “pale, quivering notes.” Environment evolves with action—walls drink sound, then release it altered. Meets 9+ gate: the blower’s cooling ticks charge the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore lost laughter—is signaled in paragraph three and escalates via each modulation of throttle. One decisive tightening: when she eases to idle and kneels, the house’s withheld joke is released. Cost is palpable (fuel exhaustion, emotional exposure). Agency drives every beat; coincidence never rescues.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the concrete act: grief must be physically dismembered and re-inhaled by the house itself. No explicit moralizing; the final chuckle is earned, not stated. Subtext operates in the distorted echo of the lullaby. The ending reweights the premise—laughter is not retrieved but re-created at cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with rhythmic control that mirrors blower surges (“macerated into slivers sharp enough to cut memory loose”). POV stays locked to Elara; no head-hop. Compression and elision are taught early (“echo chamber tunnel”) and paid off at closure. Distinct perceptual signature throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; every sentence layers image, sound, and motion. No loops or scaffold; metaphors stay coherent (“laugh the bricks drank”). Occasional elevated diction (“macerated”) is voice-motivated. Final third is artifact-free, allowing the cooling ticks to land clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise—leaf-blower séance to reanimate laughter—is non-obvious yet inevitable given the particulars. Tropes (haunted house, grief ritual) are transformed through the blower’s crankshaft and off-key wind. Specificity of the inherited tool and the unfinished joke anchor universals. Risky lyric escalation pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
