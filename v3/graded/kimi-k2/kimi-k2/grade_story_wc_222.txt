<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael’s contradictory impulses—honor versus theft, fear versus wonder—play out in the moment he offers his birth-name. The embodied cost is visible when the dawn spills from the lid and he leaps, renouncing the old self. Lira’s sacred playfulness pressures him into the final choice. Only the birth-name reveal feels slightly expository, not fully dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the wrong sky is rewritten by Kael’s act of release, and the cost is the loss of the spire and his former identity. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each image layers density until the dawn bursts outward. Orientation is immediate; no teleporting props or causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The icebound spire, pocket sundial, and chessboard all constrain choices: altitude limits stamina, the lid’s wrong-sky rule times the move, the board enforces the swap. Micro-settings (mirrors, whale-bone squares) charge the final image when they melt into birds. Sensory detail is selective and urgent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake: amend the wrong sky by amending the self. Pressure tightens once—when Kael must trade his hidden name for wonder. The swap of knight for pawn narrows options; the leap forecloses retreat. Cost is the spire’s dissolution and his unmoored identity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the concrete: wonder demands relinquishing fear and fixed identity. The snowdrop petal pressed into soil reweights the earlier swap—what was preserved must be planted. No moralizing; the final line “nothing lasts, but everything amends” is earned image, not thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise: “colors tasting of thunder and honey,” “wind tugging their coats like impatient children.” Perceptual signature is consistent; no head-hopping. Compression and elision are taught early (“the sky was wrong”) and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and propulsive. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Figurative language serves pressure: “ice groaning like a cathedral organ” escalates stakes. Minor elevation in diction is voice-motivated and coherent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of chivalrous thief, wrong sky, and apprentice of wonder feels inevitable yet fresh. The chess swap as ritual amendment is non-obvious and integral. Risk-taking (lyric leap into dawn wings) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
