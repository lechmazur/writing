<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The walker’s shift from mourning to stewardship is embodied in the glove-removal and pulse-counting beat; interiority is specific, but the monks remain off-page furniture, so relationship crucible is absent. Motivation (preserve the echo) is clear and drives every beat; the cost—surrendering control—is dramatized in the silent shard distribution. No stock phrasing; emotions are tactile (salt on lashes, warm hinge). Micro-choice hierarchy is legible: diagonal line → clearing → shard offering.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the echo divides into communal shards, reweighting memory from private grief to shared stewardship. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of image and cadence shift carry the turn. Orientation is anchored by “murmuring pavilion” within 120 words; no causality breaks. Cost is visible: the clearing folds back into her heartbeat, a private atlas now communal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The kinetic parapet breathes beneath the floor, constrains the shard distribution via its tuning-fork vibration, and reappears in the final image as keeper of the silver speck. Micro-setting (silk diaphragms inhaling wind) is selective and POV-filtered. Sensory hierarchy narrows under ritual pressure. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions. Weather outside contrasts with the pavilion’s sealed hush, charging the final calm.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve the prophet’s echo—is signaled early and tightened when the walker must surrender control to communal memory. One meaningful deepening: the echo becomes visible, then divisible. Cost is felt in the private atlas now shared. Agency is renunciation rather than confrontation; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens. No coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the tension between solitary grief and communal stewardship; no direct statement. Subtext lives in silence, diagonal motion, and the silver speck’s pilgrimage. Final image reweights the premise: wisdom is not hoarded but circulated. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in “perpetually revised.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; perceptual signature is tactile and oblique (“gauze darkened by tears yet strangely honest”). Syntax modulates with ritual tempo; no head-hopping. Diction stays within POV lexicon; no filter-verb stacks. Compression is taught early (“step diagonally into spaces no map claimed”) and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentences advance multiple jobs. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful (“candle flames leaned inward like agreeing children”). Information density is high; every line advances atmosphere or stakes. No line-level artifacts in closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—memory as migratory light sustained by kinetic stone and communal silence—is fresh and fully committed. Diagonal walking as ritual method, whisperfield calm as tone, and the silver speck’s pilgrimage are non-obvious syntheses. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring closure. No close echoes of familiar scenes.</comment>
