<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her throat tightening, the glass eyes warming—yet the “mathematics of emotion” remains abstract, slightly undercutting the final renunciation. The Earned Stasis (keeping parentheses open) is credible, but the cost feels more conceptual than visceral.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (drops, petals, sap) reweights the stake of ambiguous loss until the final image crystallizes a stance. Closure is a Charged Poise—Lira steps into the tunnel with the ache now accompaniment—cost is felt in the softened ache and relinquished need for solution.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The cavern orchard is not backdrop; its calcified peach, dripping stalactites, and chipped mosaic constrain every action and charge the final fern image. Micro-setting (glass eyes pressed into stone wings) literally guides Lira’s ritual, making environment inseparable from choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—how to live with ambiguous loss—tightens through sensory accumulation rather than causal reversals. One decisive intensification: the sap-drop births a fern, reweighting the orchard from hushed auditorium to slow-returning song, with Lira’s agency intact.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: grief is a corridor, not a wall. The final image of Lira walking the glowing path without turning back offers a resonant, non-moral answer—loss balanced rather than solved—charged by the earlier parentheses motif.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise; perceptual signature filters every detail through Lira’s conjurer’s gaze (“lantern trembling like a guilty thought”). Patterned elision (prime numbers, fruit names) is taught early and paid off in the whispered sequence, no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and emotion without redundancy. Only minor scaffold: “step by numbered step” edges toward instruction, but rhythm accelerates under pressure. No figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: taxidermist glass eyes + cavern orchard + ambiguous loss creates a singular mythic space. The chipped mosaic as living equation feels inevitable in hindsight; risk-taking (geode-peach, parentheses moon) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
