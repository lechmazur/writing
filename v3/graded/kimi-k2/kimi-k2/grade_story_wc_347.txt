<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Nadia’s reluctant caretaker role is embodied in micro-choices—crouching under the limb, cracking the nut, guiding with silence—each revealing layered motives. Interiority is concrete and contradictory: duty to the orchard vs. need to escape. The final renunciation (walking away without touching) is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost. Secondary characters (hikers) remain off-page, so relationship crucible is N/A.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Nadia forecloses her own escape path by planting the nut’s smoke, paying the orchard’s price. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of blueprints, nut-oil corridor, frost rings—culminating in a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is anchored early (orchard gate, cliff lip) and held. No causality breaks; every beat advances pattern or cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is not backdrop but active antagonist: branches rasp, fruit hisses, labyrinth shifts under exact footfalls. Mechanical birds patrol and demand tribute, constraining tactics. The cliffside corridor glowing “ugly, crooked” becomes the final bridge—environment literally shapes the rescue. Micro-setting (pearl-varnished nut) functions as compass and cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—guide hikers to safety before frost—tightens each beat. Pressure escalates via nut-oil corridor assembly and bird negotiation; cost is the nut itself and Nadia’s forfeited exit. One decisive turn: she trades her own release for theirs. Coincidence (hikers’ lantern) complicates but does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from particulars: inheritance as curse, caretaking as self-sacrifice. Subtext in the orchard’s “guilty prayers” and Nadia’s “footprints carved from moonlight” reframes escape as ghostly legacy. Final image of smoke smelling like “winter ovens” reweights the nut from promise to funeral pyre—no moralizing, only felt cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise: “thin wire of the orchard gate,” “rust-eaten orchard,” “clockwork eyes.” Perceptual signature is Nadia’s—selective, wary, tactile even when not touching. No head-hopping; compression (“nearly not at all”) is taught early and paid off. Rhythm accelerates under pressure, then exhales in the final line.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence layers image, action, or stakes. Metaphors are coherent—“branches rasp like a saw,” “fruit hissed like steam”—and serve pressure. High information density: “she touched nothing, yet the branch sagged” compresses agency and consequence. No artifacts in closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: mechanical birds as typewriter-winged archivists, orchard as guilt-engine, nut as compass/heartbeat. Familiar tropes (cursed inheritance, labyrinth) are transformed through exact, embodied detail. Risk-taking (leaving without touching, ghost-bridge) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
