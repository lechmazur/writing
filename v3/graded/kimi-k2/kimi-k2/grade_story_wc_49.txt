<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Liora’s mix of tinkering brilliance and lyrical empathy feels organically her own; her reluctance-shed-of-burden transition is visibly paid for by the dirge that costs both breath and tears, foreclosing silence with golden afterglow.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure (Heartroot revives via earned song cycle) lands with unmistakable conceptual cost—village futures rerouted—and the causal because/therefore chain from tendril-crank to golden seep holds the Accumulative lens to the final moon-dip.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The arbor’s dew-laden dawn and amber moon-slit canopy directly pressure choices (public vs silence, risk vs ritual) and returns as charged final imagistic echo; specificity never drifts into static postcard.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Escalation proceeds via each song tightening stakes: silence feeds rot → Lilt revives leaves → Dirge demands total breath, narrowing options until golden stories are the only outcome with visible vocal cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme sharpens on ontological cost of forgetting: story threads replace exhausted ritual; the quiet dirge offers an image answer—living vine on wrist—not a moral, leaving golden residue in reader mind.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Lyrical POV with tactile idiom (“clinking seed pearls,” “vine softens like living bracelet”) stays decisively single; no filter sky intrusion; emotional pressure bends syntax into breath-timed rush matching dirge cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Sentences propel—elisions taught by moon threading leaves, no scaffold loops; figurative language (“coin sliding into slot”) is earned and never clouds the final image crystallizing cost under harvest light.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Synthesizing forgotten song as tech-free remedy is fresh angle on eco-myth revival; risk lies in leaning on quiet not spectacle, yet images feel specific, inevitable, and internally consistent without obvious template overlap.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Liora’s whimsical identity threads through tactile tinkering (gears, crank) and drives the literal restoration choice. Each micro-choice redefines tactics (deciding to sing the Dirge with voice–cost), and absence would excise the story’s hinge.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Vine tendril appears early as stethoscope, is cranked mid-scene, then coils into living bracelet at finale—three beat cycle with reweighted meaning framing the Heartroot’s resurrection; removal would collapse focal sensory link.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Harvest moon physically positions the arbor’s amber hue and times the song cycle; its withdrawal is the cue cueing silence’s peak. Without its light-threaded presence, choices would lose live clock pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Heartroot’s ability to “spin golden stories” is neither label nor adornment: without the song feeding it, leaves yellow and harvest collapses. Story logic unravels if golden output does not gate village survival.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Remedy is the entire arc: fear → crank attempt → full dirge performance. It redefines options from mechanical gear-fix to collective vocal cost. Remove this action and the Heartroot stays mute.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Forgotten songs are seeded by grandmother memory, tested in sequence, and their mechanics (voice exhaust) govern pacing. Without them there is no causal path to revival—swap any other tool and stakes break.</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Verdant arbor at dawn supplies acoustic hush, moon-lit canopy for moon positioning, and leaf overhead that unfurls change. These micro-pressures actively constrain choice volume and light and shape the dirge efficacy.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Alignment timeframe is announcedas the harvest waning; each songbeat is paced against moonset. Remove the live countdown and urgency deflates, tactics remain abstract.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Restoration desire is dramatized in early fear of grey leaves and culminates in the vocal endurance cost of Dirge. Internal friction (fear vs cost) is enacted, not told; removal voids personal stake.</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Gathering hush governs every sensory register—dew silence, moon slipping, dirge reverberation—culminating in charged bracelet silence. If replaced, final resonance diffuses and image loses its crystalline echo.</comment>
