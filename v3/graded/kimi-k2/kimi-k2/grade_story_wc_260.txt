<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her trembling chest, cooled sweat, fierce smile—yet the “shedding layers” metaphor is asserted more than dramatized; the final resolve feels slightly pre-ordained rather than wrested from contradictory impulses in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the incubator’s violet dome and the star that “refuses to fade” crystallize a new vigilant-tenderness stance with visible cost (reporting the crime, anonymity for the chameleons). Causal lens holds; each beat flows from the revealed con to the reconstructed tail to the decision to act.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The misty cedar-and-iodine workshop, skylight constellations, and micro-tools (tweezers, bio-gel vials) constrain every move; the incubator dome becomes the charged final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered, anchoring without clutter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to respond to betrayal without abandoning compassion—tightens once: from shock to reconstruction to reporting. The cost (loss of innocence, exposure risk) is legible, though the external pressure plateaus after the raid reveal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of trust’s fragility emerges through the tail’s re-growth and the “Mirage” label; no moralizing, only a charged image of dawn cutting mist. The final star reweights earlier skylight constellations into quiet jury, achieving conceptual repricing without statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise—“shattered opal,” “tensile like spider silk”—and stays rooted in Mara’s perceptual bias. Syntax modulates with pressure; no head-hop or register drift. Compression (“she swept shattered glass into a bin”) advances momentum cleanly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; only minor loop risk in “shimmering stillness” echo. Metaphors cohere; no mixed vehicles. High information density—each sentence layers action, tool, and emotion—without scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: wildlife-trafficking revenge told through micro-surgical regeneration of a single tail. The ethical calculus feels non-generic; risk lies in the quiet, lyric mode rather than thriller beats, and it pays off in the final image.</comment>
