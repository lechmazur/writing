<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is lush and embodied—frost silvering lashes, sextant warming in gloved hands—yet the core contradiction (fear vs. surrender) is stated more than enacted in scene. The final renunciation is earned by the auroral crucible and the brass reflection beat, so the arc lands with cost. Still, a few abstractions (“creativity burst outward, not as fire but as snowfall”) edge toward performed epiphany, keeping it just shy of 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each image layers density until the mirror-flash reweights the premise. Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration—her spoken vow carries conceptual cost (“carry the unwritten inside me until it learns to burn quietly”) and forecloses the safe path. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no teleporting props or causal breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The archway stones, sextant mirror, and auroral fire function as micro-setting that actively constrain choice—degrees glow, spirals vibrate, reflection redirects gaze inward. Selective sensory triage (cold, green light, brass warmth) keeps economy tight. One hairline slip: “footprints filling with green light” risks magical convenience, but the prior vibration cue licenses it.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—freeing creativity from fear—is signaled early and tightened by each failed artwork memory. The midpoint mirror-turn forces the trade-off: look at self, not sky, or remain caged. Cost is legible in the final vow’s “burn quietly,” a persistent constraint. Could use one more micro-choice beat mid-text to push above 8.5.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the concrete pattern of light-as-language: stardust, aurora, mirror-flash. Final image reweights “unwritten” from lack to latent fire without moralizing. One soft echo of grandmother wisdom near end slightly over-articulates; otherwise subtext stays in gesture and glow.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person lyric remains tightly focalized; perceptual signature is dreamer-specific—“small ghosts,” “celestial grammar,” “wounded bird” sonata. Rhythm swells and contracts with insomnia breath, no head-hopping. Brass diction stays within her lexicon; any elevated phrasing reads as her sky-struck idiom.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Line-level craft is virtuosic: varied sentence cadence, zero paraphrase loops, high density (“ribbons writhing like ink in water”). One metaphor stack in the climax—“cloak of indigo and bruised violet”—skirts purple but serves the rapture tone. No scaffold or filter-verb clusters; pronoun tracking clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fusion of aurora-archway, antique sextant, and creativity-as-cosmic-grammar feels fresh yet inevitable. Grandmother stardust motif could verge on twee but is saved by tactile scattering and later vascular humming. Risky lyric compression pays off in the mirror-flash inversion. Not quite a 9 because the core arc—artist overcomes block via mystical encounter—remains a known shape, merely elevated by execution.</comment>
