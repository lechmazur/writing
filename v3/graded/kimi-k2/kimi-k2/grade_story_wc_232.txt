<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s interior contradiction—promise vs. self-preservation—drives every beat; the final renunciation is earned by the tactile memory of Lila’s choice. Embodied tremor, moss-scent, and the warming chip keep emotion concrete. Micro-choice to pocket the chip and step back crystallizes hierarchy of values. Cost is visible: the cavern closes, path gone forever.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: promise → storm → ants → chip → doorway → refusal. Closure is on-page Earned Stasis with felt cost (doorway seals, creek rises). Orientation anchored by 80 words. No lens ambiguity; every beat tightens options until the final irrevocable step back.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Setting is selective and functional: creek’s rise, moss-lit cavern, petrified lintel—all constrain movement and mood. The chip-as-micro-setting constrains the final choice. Sensory hierarchy (copper, lilac, wet stone) mirrors Elias’s narrowing focus. Spatial choreography remains coherent; no floating geography.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—keep or rewrite Lila’s fate—signaled in paragraph two. One tightening: doorway offers rewrite, Elias refuses, path closes. Cost is the lost chance and sealed return. Pressure grows causally with rising water and fading bloom; no coincidence resolves anything.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of honoring chosen absence emerges through image, not statement. The D-shaped chip and obsidian mirror reweight the promise without moralizing. Final image—mist, singing creek—offers resonant non-literal answer. No thematic echo in final paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is antique-dealer precise yet lyric: “petals of light unfurling,” “blind fish circled like unanswered questions.” Perceptual signature filters every detail through numerate intuition and grief. Rhythm modulates with pressure; no POV leakage or register drift. Dialogue absent, so no penalty.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet clear; each sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative language is sparing and purposeful. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Strong verbs and concrete nouns throughout. Final paragraph’s cadence mirrors the cavern’s exhale—earned stylistic shift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: cartography, type metal, ant navigation, and obsidian doorway interlock organically. Transformation test fails—story collapses without these exact elements. Risky lyric compression taught early and paid off. No derivative premise; specific details feel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
