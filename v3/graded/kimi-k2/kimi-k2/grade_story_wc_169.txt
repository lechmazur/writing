<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira’s desire remains abstract; the “equation” is more motif than conflicted internal engine. Her epiphany arrives more as conceptual mirror-telescope than as painful renunciation—no true contradictory impulse plays out in the final beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands crisply with the seed-spit of the gauge becoming a reality-shifting tree; the Accumulative/Textural lens teaches its patterned ballooning and pays off by reweighting despair→pollen. Visible cost: Lira relinquishes linear certitude for recursive stewardship.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The grotto, corals, and basalt floor are milked for luminous specificity, but the living environment does not hard-tether any final option; it enables wonder rather than constraining choice. Still, the mirrored leaves and coral pulse bloom in the ending image, lending charge.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes—“transform despair into possibility”—are signaled early and tauten as balloons turn from leaks into returning pollen. Escalation is gently textured, not sharply obstructed; the price is conceptual recursion, not tactical loss, keeping score a hair below elite bands.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: hope realized as shared iterative method. The mirror-leaves complete a conceptual repricing that reframes despair as a variable without sermonizing. No final thematic throat-clearing drags the score.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Luminous, glass-lit diction that stays inside POV. Syntax breathes with tide motion; patterned elision (“silver filigree, looping into fractals”) is taught and paid off. No head-hop, no register breach even at peak.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Few paraphrase loops; density is high (“luminescent coral… recorded visitor’s heartbeat”). Minor pocket of “balloon… balloon” repetition within thirty-four words dulls propulsion slightly but does not blur closure.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Takes the tired trope of “scientist seeks hope” and folds it into quantum memory-maps and balloon neurons. The final recursive face-to-face with aged-Lira feels inevitable rather than contrived. Specific detail (“the scent of cinnamon from a kitchen untouched by war”) anchors universal ache.</comment>
