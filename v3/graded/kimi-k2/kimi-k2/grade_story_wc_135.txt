<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara’s exile-grief and archivist instinct are vivid in embodied beats (salt on lashes, sole-ripples), but the interior contradiction—collect vs. let go—stays lyrically asserted rather than forced into a single costly choice; the final “blew silence” is luminous yet feels arrived at more by spell than by prior micro-choices that foreclose an alternative path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each shard adds density to the absence-map until the trumpet-pendulum reconfigures the harbor’s meaning; causality is poetic but legible (valve→label→eye→barnacle phrases→returning sails). Closure lands as Charged Poise—silence-beam reveals possible fleet—cost is the lifelong labor of compiling now visible in one trembling beam. Orientation anchors early; transitions are lyric but taught by refrain “staggered intervals.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Ivory harbor, rain-slick cobbles, cracked lighthouse lens, and the trumpet valve itself compose a micro-setting that actively constrains action: every object is a stylus for reading absence. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—archivist notices ink bruised into clouds, gulls as misplaced punctuation. Spatial choreography is clean across pier, warehouse, lighthouse, seawall. Final beam-path literalizes setting as staff of music—setting charges closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“compile fragments into meaning that lets exiles return”—is signaled early and deepens as each absence yields a syllable. Middle tightening occurs when barnacle voices force backward reading of lexicon, narrowing options to silence-as-signal. Cost is the perpetual deferral of certainty; agency is attention and arrangement. Escalation is accretive rather than causal, fitting lens, but one sharper external obstacle could have raised pressure another notch.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of “absence as composable negative space” emerges through concrete imagery (blank margin, crossed-out names, cracked lens) rather than statement. Final silence-beam reweights prior fragments without moralizing. Subtext resides in objects’ muteness—trumpet valve now metronome for unread stories. Some lyric phrasing edges toward poetic thesis (“sound returns to the vessel that shaped it”) but is earned by accretion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tightly focalized through Mara’s archivist-perception: selective attention to labels, barnacle shells as pages, rope as coastline. Syntax is compressed, rhythmic, pattern-taught (“staggered intervals” cadence). No head-hopping; diction remains within her salt-logged lexicon. Filter verbs are minimal; metaphor is dense yet purposeful, pressure-matched.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is high-density poetry—most sentences carry image + motion + thematic resonance; occasional metaphor pile-ups (“horizon stitched by rain, each drop a syllable”) risk overwriting but pattern is taught early and sustains voice. No loops, scaffold, or register drift. Grammar clean; punctuation inventive yet legible. Final beam-sentence is crisp payoff.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: post-exile archivist maps silence with a vandalized trumpet valve; absence-as-score feels new yet inevitable. Risk-taking in lyric mosaic structure heightens meaning without obscuring clarity. Could edge higher with one more specific world-detail that only this harbor could contain.</comment>
