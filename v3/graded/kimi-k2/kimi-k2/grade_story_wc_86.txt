<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is precise—her micro-choice to hold silence until the guard stills reveals status mastery—and her final exhale carries visible cost. The prisoners’ regrets are embodied (trembling fingers, whitening knuckles) rather than labeled. Only the boy’s “voice cracking like thawing ice” edges toward cliché, keeping this just shy of 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the snapped cords and fallen drawer pull reconfigure meaning under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the mirror-bright brass reflecting both moon and Mara's furrowed face as undeniable cost. Causality holds—every beat because/therefore—without a single unmotivated ellipsis.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The parapet’s darker stone line, the boiling ravine fog, and the brass pull’s worn ridges all constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered; only the “filed coin” moon risks over-cleverness.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recycling mistakes into wisdom—tightens when the cords stretch and snap; the price is the audible sigh of severance and the mirrored brass that now reflects only half a moon. Agency remains with Mara’s ritual design and the prisoners’ final exchange.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the ritual itself: naming regret without apology, then walking until sincerity breaks the tether. The final image of the drawer pull at the midpoint offers a resonant, non-moral answer—wisdom is the scar left by the break.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet disciplined, with rhythmic control under pressure (“cords stretched, silver threads singing”). Perceptual signature is distinct—Mara reads clouds in faces, measures distance in sincerity—and no head-hop occurs.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; every sentence advances stakes or atmosphere. Only the phrase “penitent’s shawl” edges purple, but it is isolated and does not dull the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The moon-phase treaty, drawer-pull ransom, and regret-naming ritual synthesize into a fresh, inevitable whole. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; the premise would collapse if transplanted wholesale.</comment>
