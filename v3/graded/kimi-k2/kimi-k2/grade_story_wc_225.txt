<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Arlen’s guilt and need for atonement are embodied in micro-gestures (drumming openings, chilled ribs) and crystallize in the final seated renunciation. The prodigy’s wordless tipping of the invisible king is a perfect externalization of interior cost. One slip: “productive fidget” edges toward label-speak before it is dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Arlen accepts the draw, the labyrinth dissolves, and the village exhales—cost is the unrecoverable years and the prodigy’s absence. Causal chain holds: forbidden move → labyrinth confession → seated release → raindrop restart. No orientation debt; time-frozen rule is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The platinum labyrinth’s corridors literally narrow choice, and the stalled village’s first raindrop recharges the entire setting. Sensory detail is selective—chill metal, stalled clouds, single raindrop—each constraining or releasing action. Micro-setting (chair-square) functions as final crucible.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—self-forgiveness—tightens when each decoded thread whispers “You taught fear.” One decisive turn: sitting in the chair and accepting the tipped king. Cost is the irreversible loss of the prodigy and the years in exile; pressure is coherent under situational lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of forgiveness as release emerges from the chess metaphor and the tipped king; no moralizing. The woven hush shifts from accusatory silence to spacious possibility. Final image—door left open—reweights the premise without statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise; perceptual signature filters every detail through Arlen’s chess mind (“naming squares under his breath”). Rhythm modulates with pressure—short clauses inside the maze, longer breath after release. No head-hopping; POV remains locked.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence layers image and motion. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is disciplined. “Polished regret,” “grain separated from husk” land without overwriting. Final line breathes with the village—perfect cadence shift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Transforms the familiar “guilt-ridden mentor” trope through the time-frozen village and platinum labyrinth, both organically grown from chess logic. The tipped invisible king is a fresh, inevitable image. Risky lyric compression pays off in closure clarity.</comment>
