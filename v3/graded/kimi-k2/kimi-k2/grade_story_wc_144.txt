<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s embodied blindness, tactile craft, and maternal grief fuse into a single, urgent motive; the drone’s pulse against her cheek and the lullaby hummed at the end crystallize her interior stakes with felt cost. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, so the 9+ quick test is narrowly missed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Mara releases the drone and resumes her vigil, the cost the silence after the emerald glint vanishes. Causal chain—sound of anchor → patch → launch—holds under a tight Accumulative/Textural lens; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The mist, skylight rain basin, and hummingbird drone form a micro-setting that literally guides Mara’s choices; the refracted rainbow on her wrist is the tool that locates the crack. Environment constrains and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decode drone data before Orion sails—is signaled early and tightened by the loudspeaker countdown; the single deepening is Mara’s race against the whistle. Cost is the audible absence after the drone departs.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of repair as covenant emerges through tactile particulars; the lullaby and water-basin light reprise reweight the premise without moralizing. Resonance lingers in the depot’s patient hush.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is tactile, rhythmic, and blind-filtered—“glassy sighs,” “water’s mirrored song”—with no head-hop. Compression and patterned elision are taught early and paid off in the final drip of rain on tin.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers craft, emotion, and world detail. One minor loop—“magnetic calm” twice—keeps it from 9+ perfection.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Blind artisan decoding starlight through water refraction feels fresh and inevitable; the hummingbird courier and rain-basin compass are specific inventions that transform familiar rescue stakes.</comment>
