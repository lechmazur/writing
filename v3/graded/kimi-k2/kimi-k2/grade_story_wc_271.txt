<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s embodied trauma and micro-choice to plant the photograph in the olive tree are vivid and earned; the “quiet talent” label is slightly abstract but her somatic markers ground it. Interior contradiction—grief beside hope—plays out in real time. Cost is felt when she re-folds the photo along new lines, foreclosing denial.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each sensory layer tightens the emotional density until the final image reweights memory itself. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—planting the photograph crystallizes a stance with visible cost (“Still possible” written, grief acknowledged). No orientation drift; causality of memory-work holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Arboretum, cliff, olive tree, and salt wind are selective and filter through Mira’s grief-sharpened senses. The olive tree’s hollow and the stone circle constrain her final action, charging the ending. Spatial choreography is clean; weather shifts mirror internal cadence without cliché.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</question>
<comment>Dominant stake—how to carry memory without being devoured—is signaled early and deepens through each sensory beat. The tightening is the moment she presses the photograph to bark and chooses to plant it; this narrows her path from paralysis to anchored witness. Cost is the irreversible act of inscription and exposure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Theme of bearing irreparable loss while still choosing futurity emerges organically from concrete particulars—orange-blossom cake, drone rotors’ taste. Final image of the lighthouse dark yet standing offers non-literal answer: obsolete signals still mark the coast. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</question>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Mira’s perceptual signature; diction is spare, rhythmic, salted with sensory specificity. No head-hop or register drift. Compression (“somatic markers,” “pearl of stillness”) is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</question>
<comment>Prose is lean yet lyrical; every sentence advances atmosphere or interior motion. No loops, no mixed metaphors. Rhythm modulates with wind and breath counts. Occasional elevated phrasing (“conceptual repricing”) is justified by reflective mode and remains legible.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</question>
<comment>Familiar grief-landscape trope is transformed through drone-strike specificity and the olive tree as living archive. Risky compression of lyric and material detail pays off in a charged final image. Feels inevitable yet fresh.</comment>
