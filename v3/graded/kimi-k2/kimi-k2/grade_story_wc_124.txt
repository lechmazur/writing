<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elian’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the shift from broker to mourner is dramatized through micro-choices (uncorking the vial, tasting regret). The final renunciation carries visible cost—empty vial, evaporated weight—yet the epiphany “every scent is a seed” edges toward tidy wisdom, capping the score just below 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each pulse of violet light layers memory until the final release reweights the premise. Closure lands with Conceptual Repricing—the greenhouse glows from within, the vial is empty, and the cost is felt. One minor drift: “years later” coda dilutes the single-scene pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The greenhouse is rendered with tactile specificity—sweating glass, phosphorescent veins—and constrains the final act: Elian kneels among the leaves to return the drop. The ultraviolet lamps shift from revealers to embers, charging the closure image. No orientation debt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to sell or return the last memory—is signaled early and tightened through sensory escalation. The decisive release narrows options and carries felt cost. Pressure is coherent under the Accumulative lens; no external reversals required.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: commodified memory versus living remembrance. The final image of the midnight cereus blooming nightly offers a resonant, non-moralizing answer. Subtext in gesture (pressing vial to lips) deepens without exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; perceptual signature filters every detail through Elian’s aromatic lens. Syntax modulates with emotional intensity—long, breath-held sentences collapsing into shorter grief. No POV drift or register clash.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; figurative language serves pattern and payoff. Minor loop—“crystal shadows” thrice—does not obscure closure. Rhythm breathes with scene needs; no filter-verb stacks or mixed metaphors in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise of scent-as-lantern is fresh; transformation of extinct flora into living elegy feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric compression is taught early and paid off. No derivative echoes; specificity anchors universals.</comment>
