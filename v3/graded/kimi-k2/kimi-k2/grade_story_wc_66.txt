<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The copyist’s drive—“to teach dust to tell stories”—is anchored in every micro-choice: bending over brittle scores, coaxing motes, vial next to heart. Her interiority is vivid without label-speak; the single contradictory fear (silence vs release) underpins the final choice. Relationships are absent, so crucible tests are moot; the earned stasis—carrying the luminous vial away—carries visible price of ongoing vigilance. Minor slip: tears+taste on cheeks lands as slight cliché in an otherwise tactile final image (-0.2 for register drift).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A causal lens holds cleanly: because pirate songs arrive → therefore copyist transmutes them, the last beat foreclosing the path of solitary hoarding. Orientation is immediate (“ruined conservatory”, “broken columns”), transitions are legible, closure is Earned Stasis (vial tucked, cost framed as lifelong guardianship). One hairline causal hiccup: pirate’s smile crossing static is borderline convenient (-0.1); price is undeniable: she must now “keep them safe until ears grow hungry.” Meets Q9 requirements.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Shortwave radio dial repeatedly constrains tactics—signal hunt sets scene; then it flares to set up the “submarine light” beat used to see pirate outline. Setting is economical, non-generic, the “mist clung to broken columns like unfinished phrases” marries atmosphere to copyist’s vocation. No spatial drifting; instruments made of dust in the last beat reweight earlier “dust remembers.” Meets 9 quick test.</question>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—replant narrative seed vs hold silent—escalates through one tightening: pirate’s lyric offers release but demands ongoing vigilance. Choice is hers; no lucky rescue. Cost is legible: perpetual stewardship. A single mid-scene micro-turn (dust swirling into book) reweights the problem; felt price stays visible. Lacks external jeopardy beyond abstract “story famine” (-0.2) so band caps slightly under 9.0.</question>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from specific particulars: copyist’s act of giving dust narrative agency becomes metaphor for memory stewardship without any final preach. Key image (golden motes inside vial) non-literally answers “what survives after stories?”—legible conceptual repricing. Motif resonance arises from literal object reused, not appended symbolism. No epiphany-shorthand; tension holds.</question>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is lyric but disciplined: perceptual signature filtered through copyist’s craft—metaphors tied to score and ink. Compression taught early (no exposition dumps) and paid off in final breaths (“submarine light” inside dial). Non-standard punctuation fits micro-fragments without obscuring causality. Dialogue limited to pirate’s crackle; syntax remains coherent. Close to 9+ standard.</question>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prosodic control: sentence length and rhythm modulate with emotional crest. No scaffold loops, filters, or synonym churn. One stacked modifier “thistled calm that always preceded the pirate broadcast” skirts purple but sustains voice. Information density high: single sentence carries setting, character, foreshadowing. Minor metaphor muddle on “dust remembers every footstep” (-0.1), otherwise flawless.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Combines familiar tropes (pirate radio, post-apocalypse) through music-copyist lens to reframe story-as-virus. The dust-becomes-music-instrument is a specific, non-obvious execution no other frame could house. Risk taken in lyrical, accumulative mode is coherent and heightens stakes. Transformation test passes: swapping occupation would break entire plot logic.</question>
