<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Hara’s interiority is embodied in trembling hands, salt-tongued whispers, and the rope’s warmth; his contradictory impulses—hunger for knowledge vs reverence—drive every micro-choice. The final renunciation (to weave, not store) is earned by the tactile ordeal and the weavers’ charged lesson, with visible cost in the glowing coil he now bears. Flaws (naïve faith, fear of loss) complicate the coaxing and remain unresolved, yielding Earned Stasis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Hara’s stance shifts from collector to carrier, foreclosing hoarding with the glowing rope as Charged Poise. Causal chain—summons → decoding → coaxing → keeper knot—holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens; each knot tightens meaning until the final image reweights the premise. Orientation is anchored within 120 words; no teleporting props or causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fog, snow, and glowing dock planks are filtered through Hara’s seed-collector gaze; every sensory choice (salt, pine resin, warm rope) constrains his tactile decoding. The fulgurite bead lodged in rope fibers becomes the micro-setting that charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; weather actively muffles and reveals, shaping tension.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve pre-industrial memory—is signaled early and tightened when electricity’s erasure looms. Escalation is accumulative: each decoded knot increases the cost of failure; the final keeper knot forecloses the option to merely store seeds. Agency remains Hara’s; no coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the concrete act of weaving knowledge into rope: memory survives only when continuously re-enacted. Subtext lives in the weavers’ silence and the rope’s slow pulse—no moralizing. The final aurora over quiet sea reweights the premise without statement, leaving resonant ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with salt-tinged diction and rhythmic compression that mirrors knotting syntax. POV remains tight third; perceptual signature (seed-collector’s taxonomy, reverence for embryos) colors every image. No filter-verb stacks or register drift; even the weavers’ “speech” is rendered as tactile tugs.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence layers sensory, emotional, and symbolic work. Metaphors (lightning-kissed sand, white moths on lashes) are specific and earned. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; clarity at closure is pristine.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The fusion of seed-collecting, knot-language, and lightning-glass into a single mythic gesture feels inevitable and fresh. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring causality. No derivative templates; the synthesis is singular.</comment>
