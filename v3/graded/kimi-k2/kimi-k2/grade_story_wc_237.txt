<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority is vivid—scars crystallizing under stress, the itch of memory—but the final “soft skin” reset feels slightly too neat, muting the cost of transformation. Motivation is clear and embodied; micro-choices (holding breath, tapping quill) reveal hierarchy of values. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in the same beat, so the 9+ quick test is narrowly missed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the rock rises, scars become pages, breath released—cost is the literal shedding of crystallized shame. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of memory → rune → scar → page tightens until the final image reweights everything. Held-breath constraint is taught early and shapes every tactic.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Floating rock, tea platform, and crystallizing scars function as micro-setting that constrains breath and posture; lanterns swaying without wind cue the uncanny early. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—rain needles, cedar scent, ink like starlight—charging the final ascent. Environment directly shapes the climax: the rock rises because stories lighten it.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—transform scars before composure shatters—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightened by the held-breath clock. One meaningful deepening: crystallized scars loosen into pages, foreclosing the option of silence. Cost is visible on the page: lungs burn, platform lurches, scars leave soft skin behind.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: scars as unspoken stories, transformation through articulation. Final image—teardrop becoming feather—offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture (bow to empty platform) and silence; ambiguity lingers about who will read the book.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise; perceptual signature filters every detail through Lira’s rune-scholar lens. Syntax modulates with pressure—long breath-held sentences, then short releases. No head-hopping; psychic distance stays intimate. Purposeful elision (Master Tenju never appears) is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; every sentence layers image, memory, and bodily sensation. No loops or scaffold; metaphors stay coherent (ink like starlight, scars like frost). Rhythm accelerates with the storm’s held breath, then exhales cleanly. Minor elevated diction (“saturated hush”) is voice-motivated and consistent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Premise—floating rock tea ceremony to transmute scars into stories—feels fresh yet inevitable. Crystallizing skin and breath-between-storms are non-obvious syntheses that grow from character need. Risky lyric compression pays off in the final reconfiguration; no close echoes of familiar scenes.</comment>
