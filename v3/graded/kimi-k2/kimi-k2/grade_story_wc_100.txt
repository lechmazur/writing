<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s stubborn refusal to let memories go unrested is dramatized through embodied micro-choices—stepping into the sea, bleeding ink, writing his own name—each with visible cost. Interior contradiction surfaces when he hesitates over his own name, yet writes it anyway, foreclosing his return to ordinary life. The final smile and quiet return to burying the dead crystallize earned stasis without tidy resolution.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the lighthouse rekindles, the lens gone but its light whole, reweighting the premise that “some signals are meant to be answered.” Causal linkage holds—each inscribed name flares the lens, the final inscription cracks it, the beam rises. Cost is legible in the collapsing library and Elias’s soaked, shivering return. Lens ambiguity never arises; the Accumulative/Textural pattern taught early (fractured light → whole beacon) pays off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The broken lighthouse lens functions as micro-setting and recurring object, constraining every choice: it guides Elias down the coral staircase, flares with each name, and finally shatters to birth the new beam. Sensory selection narrows to cold water, barnacled shelves, bleeding fingers—details filtered through Elias’s undertaker’s eye for finality. The underwater library’s pressure and decay mirror the weight of unburied memory, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—giving the unburied rest—tightens once: each name inscribed narrows Elias’s own future until he writes himself into the ledger. Agency drives escalation; coincidence (the sea parts) complicates but does not resolve. The visible price is the library’s collapse and Elias’s self-inscription, foreclosing ordinary life. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens: density of names → intensity of light → irreversible cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the concrete act of writing the dead back into being; no moral is stated, only enacted. The final beam sweeping the waves offers a non-literal answer: memory itself can become a guiding light. Subtext operates in the silence that settles like dust, the blank pages that bloom with names, the cracked lens that becomes whole by breaking further. Complexity lingers—Elias gains rest yet remains bound to his task.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is textured, tactile, and undertaker-specific: “cracked halo,” “ledger of the dead,” “permanent address for rest.” Syntax modulates with pressure—long, liquid sentences underwater, clipped cadence on the pier. No head-hopping; focalization stays locked to Elias’s selective perception. Compression (“the sea did not resist him”) is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence advances story or atmosphere. Figurative language is selective and purposeful—“constellation of glass,” “chased stillness”—never crowding high-pressure beats. No loops, scaffold, or register drift. Rhythm accelerates during inscription, breathes during ascent, matching scene needs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The premise—undertaker restores a drowned library to bury the unburied—feels inevitable yet wholly fresh. Tropes (lighthouse, lost city) are transformed through Elias’s vocation and the ledger of blank pages. Specificity anchors universals: salt-stained note, coral staircase, wax-sealed book. Risk-taking (underwater library, self-inscription) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
