<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lucien’s serenity and calligraphic skill are embodied motives: every puppet and word is driven by his quiet need to undo past propaganda, turning silence into actionable ethical performance; interior contradictions flare in moments of mirror-script and recantation, costing him prop choices and shaping the ending.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The puppet-show reversals are cleanly linked: tyrant puppet → backward question → child rewriting sparks into FORGIVENESS forms a monolith of causality that lands on the dome wall, narrowing options until only listening remains; closure is a reconfiguration of previous lies with visible cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Half-lit phrases on the stick literally generate glowing moths that guide spatial choreography inside the radar dome; the dome’s residual electronics flicker with radar echoes, grounding us in place. The stick’s curved surface and cooling mechanical ticks become tactile anchors for each reversal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Tension escalates sentence-by-sentence: the tyrant puppet’s “Truth is whatever survives the scream” forces the story-stick to reverse, then the child puppet rewrites sparks into fireflies that spell FORGIVENESS—each move tightens stakes and makes silence more costly. Meteor-hush pressure charges the final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade>
<comment>Ethical storytelling isn’t preached; it emerges as the only path that does not burn. The tyrant’s question reframed through the child adds conceptual weight: what survives when no one dares scream becomes the reconfiguration that reweights every word ever used to start wars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>First-person-plural “we” as the campfire collective stays coherent; lyric, calligraphic prose mirrors the mind of a man practicing restraint in real time. Rhythm alternates between stateliness and snap-staccato when stories spark, achieving Charged Poise without voice slip.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Every sentence is crafted to advance the puppet image or silence stakes; high information density, zero loops, vivid synesthetic moths—no figurative muddle even in peak reversal. Dialogue cadence tightens under dome echo and cooling metal ticks for propulsion.</comment>

<comment>An urbane puppeteer reversing a tyrant inside a radar dome with calligraphic fireflies is original synthesis; risk lies in turning rhetoric into light. Mourning mirror-script at climax proves irreversible, charging the ethical after-image.</comment>
