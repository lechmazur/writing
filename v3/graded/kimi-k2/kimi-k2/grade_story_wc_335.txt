<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira’s contradictory impulses—mentor vs. exile, tenderness vs. combat—are embodied in her backward steps and the trembling glass; the final choice to drink reverses exile with visible cost (loss of ghost-weight). Interiority is concrete, but the younger self remains more symbol than autonomous character, capping depth.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the girl’s sip renegotiates exile and forecloses Lira’s ghost-state; cost is the library’s new stewardship burden. Causal chain (mirror → tea → staircase → sip) holds under a Causal lens; no orientation debt. One seamless transition from library floor to staircase is clean.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The forgotten library’s dust, creaking swing, and shifting shelves actively constrain tactics—each railing a lesson, each pane a gate. Micro-setting (lectern, saucer, staircase) charges the final image. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered; spatial choreography is exact.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—reversing exile—tightens when the shadow must choose to drink; refusal would trap both as ghosts. Escalation is causal: each annotation narrows options until the sip forecloses exile. Cost is palpable in the girl’s newfound weight and Lira’s relinquished ghosthood.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of resilience as “returning lighter” emerges from the spiral staircase image and the final annotation, never sermonized. Subtext operates in the swing’s creak and the steam’s shackles. Final image reweights the premise without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise—“dust motes drift like slow constellations,” “combative tenderness braided tight.” Syntax mirrors Lira’s backward motion and glass-tremble. No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates with pressure. Distinct perceptual signature sustained.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence layers image, motion, and stakes. No loops or scaffold; metaphors are coherent. Rhythm accelerates during the sip, then exhales. Line-level craft supports closure without clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Reversible exile via tea-leaf geometry and shard-mirror mentorship is a fresh synthesis of memory-magic and library myth. Risky backward-walking motif pays off structurally. Specificity—iron-and-lilac tea, raven-quill stylus—anchors universals. Feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
