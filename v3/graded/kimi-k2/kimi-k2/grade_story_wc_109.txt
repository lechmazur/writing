<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Interiority is embodied and specific (“mildly obsessed heartbeat”); motivation to map silence is vast yet simple. No contradictory impulses on stage—oracle acts with monolithic resolve—so the final renunciation feels pre-ordained rather than wrested from conflict. Micro-choices (tearing sleeve, pressing dot) carry visible cost, but flaw or struggle is absent.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each silence captured thickens the ambered hush until the final dot swallows the page—Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost. Orientation is immediate; causality is pattern-based rather than event-based, taught early and paid off. Closure lands in the obsidian mirror that reweights all prior mapping.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Storm-tossed ridge fort, flaking gold, salt wind, and obsidian page are vivid, selective, and integrated into action. The ambered hush itself becomes a micro-setting that constrains the oracle’s movements and charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; no white-room drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—charting silence to guide the future—is signaled early. Pressure escalates through denser silences and the guttering star; the final dot forecloses further mapping. Cost is conceptual (the page turns black, oracle’s task ends) but lacks visceral forfeiture.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of silence-as-legacy emerges through concrete cartographic acts; no moralizing. The final black mirror offers a resonant, non-literal answer to how one charts the unsayable. Subtext resides in the evolving symbols (spiral, circle, dot) rather than exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric, compressed, and consistent; perceptual signature is oracle’s synesthetic attention to texture of silence. Syntax modulates with pressure—long sentences for accumulation, single dot for climax. No head-hopping or register drift; diction stays within plausible oracle lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every image advances atmosphere or stakes. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Rhythm breathes with scene needs; final obsidian page lands clean. Minor elevated phrasing (“marbled hush,” “velvet dark”) remains purposeful and patterned.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: cartography of silence as survival guide after last star. Tropes of oracle and apocalypse are transformed through tactile map-making. Risky lyric accumulation pays off in closure image. Specificity of symbols prevents generic feel.</comment>
