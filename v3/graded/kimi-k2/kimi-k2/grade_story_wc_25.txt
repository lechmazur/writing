<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is concrete and embodied—her neon harness, the coin’s heat on her thigh, the hush between thunder and tide. The micro-choice to shorten her stride to match the guide’s rhythm crystallizes her motive under pressure. The final “remember” is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: the port city itself becomes her echo chamber. Minor slip: the grandfather backstory is a single cue, not a reflective block, so BRR is met.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the whispered word “remember” reconfigures the entire labyrinth into a resonant instrument, felt cost legible in the city-wide hush. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of light threads, coin pulses, and map folds intensify until the final cadence shift. Orientation is anchored by 120 words; no causality breaks. The key-with-no-lock and Aquarius prints are set up and paid off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The towering container labyrinth is not backdrop but pressure system: catwalk sway, barcode-less door, storm-lit violet ribbons all constrain movement and sight. Micro-setting of the velvet-dark container interior folds space, forcing Mara’s gait to become the only light. Weather and geomagnetic storm tighten the clock and distort compasses, directly shaping tactics. The setting’s final reconfiguration into a city-wide sounding board charges the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“prove whispers travel farther”—is signaled early and tested by the escalating challenge to match the guide’s stride. Pressure tightens once: from silent coin to audible city-wide echo. Cost is visible: Mara’s private experiment becomes public, irreversible resonance. No coincidence resolves; her whisper alone drives the climax.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: the power of softness over volume, memory over command. Subtext lives in the zodiac coin’s silent pulses and the microphone’s cotton-candy static. The final non-literal answer—“remember” rippling three kilometers—reweights every prior shout and murmur without moralizing. Complexity lingers: the city hears its own lullabies, ambiguous comfort.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise: “storm painted…violet ribbons,” “librarian closing a book.” Perceptual signature is Mara’s—she notices compass spins, mildewed paper, coin heat. No head-hopping; POV distance stable. Compression taught early (“hush that lived between thunder and tide”) and paid off in the freight-train echo. Dialogue is whispered subtext, not spoken lines, handled cleanly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive: “footfall ignited a thread of starlight” does world, character, and metaphor in one stroke. No loops, no scaffold, no filter-verb stacks. Rhythm modulates—short beats under pressure, longer cadences in wonder. Metaphors stay coherent; no mixed vehicles. Final line “each step a quiet signature” crystallizes without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: geomagnetic storm, zodiac coin, and shipping-container labyrinth combine into a single mythic engine. The “whisper > shout” premise is non-obvious and fully committed. Transformation test fails if names or places change—specificity of port, storm, coin sigils is integral. Risk-taking (physics-bending container maze) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
