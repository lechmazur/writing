<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Liora’s contradictory impulses—trapping light yet releasing grief—are embodied in the folding of cranes; the final smile is earned by the visible cost of relinquishing the memory-sphere. Interiority is specific and sensory, never diagnostic. The only cap is that the sister remains off-stage, so relationship-as-crucible is absent.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the cranes scatter the dream, reweighting grief into hope; the basilica’s dimming and the island’s descent make the cost legible. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each polished facet and folded crane tightens the emotional density until the final constellation. No orientation debt; anchors are clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The basilica’s living glass and inverse gravity constrain every motion; the moonstone sphere and paper cranes function as micro-settings that charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective—starlight on tea leaves, violet flame on wings—filtered through Liora’s artisan eye. Environment shapes tactics: the rotating nave forces her to fold while “falling upward.”</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transform grief without erasure—is signaled in paragraph 4 and tightened by each crane; the cost is the cracked moonstone and the literal release of the memory. One meaningful deepening: the hundredth crane triggers the basilica’s shudder, foreclosing the option to keep the dream. Agency remains with Liora throughout.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the concrete act of folding grief into flight; no moral is stated. The final sketch of a lantern-lit ward reweights the origami trope from mourning to hope without sentimentality. Subtext operates in the warmth of the returned crane—an unspoken promise rather than exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with rhythmic control under pressure: “descends while ascending” becomes a mantra that modulates with emotional intensity. Perceptual signature is artisanal—light, glass, paper, starlight—never generic. No dialogue, so no voice contamination; internal monologue stays within Liora’s lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; each sentence layers image and emotion without redundancy. Metaphors are coherent—“petals of blue fire,” “tear of distilled dawn”—and serve the luminous torment tone. No loops or scaffold; the final line lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of lantern craft, dream crystallization, and origami grief feels inevitable and fresh. The paradox of “descends while ascending” is not a gimmick but the story’s structural heartbeat. Risk-taking in inversion and constellation payoff heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
