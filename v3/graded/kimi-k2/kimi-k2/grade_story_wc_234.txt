<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Liora’s contradictory desire to bottle time yet yearn for unconfined presence is embodied in micro-choices—aligning the shell, crushing the vial—each with visible cost. Relationship with Cael acts as crucible: the forehead press and final pocketing of the curl crystallize their shared arc. Interiority stays specific, avoiding label-speak; flaws (hubris of bottled suns) complicate the final renunciation. Only the “scientifically romantic” tag edges toward diagnostic shorthand, keeping it just shy of 8.8.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the helix folds into the curl, reweighting their lifetime into one breath—felt cost on the page. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of images (embers, gold, lattice) tightens until the cadence shift at “gravity remembering its purpose.” Orientation anchored by line 3; no causality breaks. One hairline slip: “scientifically romantic” stated rather than shown in final beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Ember nexus, cooling lava glass, and the curl itself function as micro-setting that constrains every gesture; the plaza’s tiles literally drink color, guiding Liora’s stance. Sensory hierarchy skews visual but is filtered through POV urgency. Final image of “phosphorescent dew” recharges the entire palette. Meets 9+ gate: the curl’s reknit lattice charges the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to inhabit presence without capture—signaled in paragraph 1 and tightened when Liora crushes the last pocket-sun, foreclosing the bottled-time path. Escalation is accretive: each ember, vial, and filament increases density until the helix crystallizes choice. Cost is visible: loss of all pocket-suns and the lifetime compressed into one breath. Agency drives every beat; coincidence absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: presence is chosen, not captured. Subtext lives in gesture—forehead press, tucking curl into Cael’s pocket—never sermon. Final lattice image offers non-literal, resonant answer without moralizing. Earlier “we were wrong to bottle time” is the only near-theme-statement, but it is dramatized immediately by crushing the vial.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; perceptual signature filters every detail through alchemical metaphor. Syntax modulates with pressure—short fragments at climax (“She crushed the crystal”). No head-hopping; POV stays locked to Liora. Compression and elision taught early (“equations had learned to blush”) and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; each sentence layers image, emotion, and motion. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is patterned and purposeful. Occasional elevated diction (“columella curl,” “conceptual repricing”) fits alchemist POV. One mixed metaphor—“comet’s tail” paired with “controlled wildfire”—barely grazes clarity, not enough to mar closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Pocket-sun alchemy and bottled dusk are fresh, yet grounded in tactile detail. The reversal—liberation instead of capture—feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring causality. No derivative echoes; synthesis of mythic and scientific registers is singular.</comment>
