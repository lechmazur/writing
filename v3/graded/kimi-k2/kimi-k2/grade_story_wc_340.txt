<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lina’s contradictory impulses—obedience vs. preservation of memory—are embodied in micro-choices (catching the goggles “softly,” fitting them to her own eyes). The final gesture of placing them on the captain earns the shift from servant to co-witness of reclaimed flight, with visible cost in her relinquishing control of the moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the captain’s laughter re-starts “like engines restarting in midair,” crystallizing the stake of restored joy. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each floor adds density of memory until the prism light reweights meaning. Cost is legible in Lina’s “affectionate detachment” as she steps back, forfeiting intimacy.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The icebound spire, frost-latticed glass, and prism windows constrain every move—Lina deciphers the diary by scattered light, the roof wind needling cheeks mirrors internal chill. The goggles-as-micro-setting charge the final image when cracked lenses refract a private aurora, making flight visible again.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—restore the captain’s joy before the fleet arrives—is signaled early and tightened floor by floor. The decrypted line “Joy is the lift you feel when sorrow is ballast thrown overboard” forces the final choice to cast the ten floors of sorrow skyward; the price is Lina’s self-erasure in the moment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the tension between memory as wound and memory as lift; the diary’s decoded joy reconfigures the tower from prison to lighthouse without moralizing. The final image of frozen tears catching color offers a non-literal answer: flight reclaimed through shared vision.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise—“gears singing like icicles tapped by wind,” “tears freezing into brief crystals.” Perceptual signature stays anchored in Lina’s tactile, light-focused sensorium; no head-hopping. Compression (“affectionate detachment”) teaches the pattern early and pays off in the final step-back.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and function—“wind needling her cheeks” advances both setting and stakes. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is selective and pattern-taught. Rhythm accelerates with elevator lurches, then breathes on the roof.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The icebound airship exile, prism-cipher diary, and cracked goggles synthesize into a fresh emotional engine. The ten-floor elevator ascent as memory escalator is non-obvious yet inevitable; risk-taking (lyric compression, cipher via light) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
