<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Interiority is tactile (“thumb-smooth”, “salt wind”) and choices reveal hierarchy of values (trading grandmother’s tremor for indigo boat). Still, some lines edge toward theme-declaration rather than dramatized memory, slightly thinning embodied urgency.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure is Charged Poise plus Conceptual Repricing: protagonist returns carrying the burden of translation with visible cost (“price in salt” dissolves, boat pinned as “second heart”). Framed as accumulative lyric – density, pattern break, cost – yet lens never wavers.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Early anchoring of aerial market and lighthouse parapet is precise; catwalks, stalls, painted gutters perform micro-setting duties. The fragment itself is handled, re-handled, and finally projected across clouds in closure – environment as tool constraining choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</question>
<comment>Dominant stake – stewardship of overlooked histories – tightens through each interaction: pigment, canvas, final sky. No reversals; intensification is density & conceptual cost. One concrete loss: a specific childhood memory paid in salt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</question>
<comment>Theme emerges from particulars: histories as sails vs. chains. Subtext lives in gesture (painter’s nod, boy’s older smile). Final prism on clouds offers unobtrusive “eternal instant” without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</question>
<comment>Voice is consistent, lyric, and POV-locked; diction (“elusively tangible weight”) signals a translator attuned to color. Rhythmic variation accelerates under portal beats; no register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Almost flawless line craft: each sentence performs dual labor (scene + emotion + world rule). Occasional purple glint (e.g., “language of almost-lost things”) but never clouds causality or closure. No loops, pronouns clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</question>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: floating alchemical market where memories are traded for pigment is non-obvious but grounded. Risk in lyric collage pays off in closure; premise would collapse without these choices.</comment>
