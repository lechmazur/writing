<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lira’s interior contradiction—painting memory while fearing erasure—drives every beat; her micro-choice to weave memory-threads into a new floor pattern visibly costs her blank self-portrait and anchors the ending. Embodied ache (“salt water kissed her ankles”) keeps emotion off the therapist’s couch. The final acceptance is earned by prior causality: only after she re-stitches reality can the walls retreat. Flaw: the keeper’s skeleton feels observed more than interacted with, muting relationship-as-crucible pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—density of warped portraits and bleeding cards escalates until pattern-break (new floor-mandala) reweights stakes. Closure: Charged Poise—the glowing co-created portrait propped against ribs crystallizes cost without tidy release. Orientation locked by word 60. One transition (descent/ascent) stays within scope. Minor slip: keeper reveal leans on coincidence rather than earned discovery.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The lighthouse-library’s narrowing spiral and salt-stained canvases physically constrain movement and perception; the cracked lens becomes the final rainbow-fractured beacon that charges closure. Dust like “pale plankton” and “brine and ink” darkness are selective, POV-filtered, and evolve with action. Environment, body, and tool (sable brush, tarot cards) jointly shape tactics—no postcard backdrop here.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will Lira be pressed into paper or redesign reality?—is signaled early. Escalation: walls inch inward, shelves “breathe,” forcing the redesign act; cost is the surrender of her untouched self-portrait and immersion in “necessary darkness.” Agency drives every intensification; coincidence only complicates (keeper’s location). One meaningful tightening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of memory-as-creation emerges from concrete acts: tearing, weaving, painting. Subtext lives in gesture—leaving the co-portrait glowing in the keeper’s ribs answers “who owns a memory” without sermon. Final image of downward-beaming lighthouse reweights premise: dark descent is the source of light. No thematic echo in prompt-speak; complexity lingers.</comment>

<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Lira’s perceptual signature—metaphors of plankton, salt, ink—remains consistent and pressure-responsive. Syntax breathes with scene: longer clauses in calmer moments, clipped descent cadences. No head-hopping; psychic distance shifts are intentional (external sketching of the keeper’s skull vs. internal ache). Distinct texture sustains lyric compression without opacity.</comment>

<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence openings avoid algorithmic drums. High density: “dust drifted like pale plankton” layers atmosphere, stakes, and POV in one stroke. Zero loops or synonym churn. Minor elevated diction (“phosphoresce”) fits artist-POV lexicon. Closure beat remains lucid: “glowing like plankton in deep water” lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: tarot-as-memory-fragments inside a drowning library reconfigures gothic and metaphysical tropes. Risk-taking—collapsing reality into woven floor-mandala—heightens stakes without gimmickry. Transformation test fails if names change; specificity of salt, cracked lens, and plankton light makes it irreplicable. Feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
