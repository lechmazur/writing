<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara’s skeptical stance is embodied early and tested by the tile’s memories; her micro-choice to kneel and transcribe crystallizes the shift from doubt to witness. The internal contradiction—yearning to flee yet choosing to carry grief—drives every beat. Final renunciation (leaving the tile but taking the song) costs her certainty and earns the closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each square she copies intensifies the pattern of memories, tightening stakes until the date of her mother’s death reconfigures meaning. Closure lands as Charged Poise—she returns lighter because the memories have been given shape, not erased. Cost is legible in the notebook left fluttering under stone.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The tower’s stone arches and migrating whales constrain her attention and meter her work; moonlight sliding across the tile is a micro-setting that literally reveals hidden lines. Environment guides choice: salt wind and dawn light force her to finish before sun erases the magic. Final image of empty tower against wind recharges the opening “tuning fork.”</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</question>
<comment>Dominant stake—whether to abandon wonder or bear witness—tightens with each transcribed square; the date of her mother’s death is the irreversible deepening. Agency is decision, not confrontation; her choice to return next migration forecloses the option of permanent escape. Cost is the emotional weight she now carries back to the city.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of memory as communal responsibility emerges through the tile’s shifting squares and whale migration as map/clock. Subtext in the unheard symphony suggests grief shared across time. Final whispered promise offers resonant, non-literal answer: listening becomes the act of remembrance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays close to Mara’s skeptical, astronomy-trained perception; selective sensory detail (moonlight, salt wind, whale song) mirrors her interior state. Syntax tightens under pressure—“tears blurred the page, but her hand remained steady”—without losing coherence. No dialogue needed; voice carries through precise, weighted description.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is lyrical yet disciplined: no loops, high density—“silver scars across moonlit water” compresses migration and starlight in one stroke. Metaphors (tower as tuning fork, whales as galaxies) serve rather than stall momentum. Rhythm modulates with emotional beats; final paragraph breathes open like the horizon.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Familiar elements—magic object, grieving seeker, whale migration—are transformed through the tile’s magic-square mechanics and the concept of memories as migratory patterns. Specificity of the date and the unheard symphony make the synthesis feel inevitable. Risk lies in quiet closure, but it lands cleanly.</comment>
