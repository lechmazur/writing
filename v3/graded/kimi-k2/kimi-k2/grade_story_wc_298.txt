<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira’s contradictory impulses—reckless grafting vs. fierce gentleness—are dramatized in every beat; the final choice to stay and become root-memory is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost (her foreclosed futures). Interiority is embodied (sap “like blood,” warm bark) rather than labeled. Status shift with Ardan is subtle but legible. No slips touching closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the inverted tower-bud reweights the premise, cost is felt in the vanished tomorrows. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density and cadence shift reconfigure meaning. Orientation is clear by line 3; no causality breaks. One meaningful tightening suffices.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Catacomb orchard constrains every move: roots cradle bones, sap becomes currency, the final bud grows from the graft. Micro-setting (burned card into cambium) charges the closure. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered. Spatial choreography is clean.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—bartering her own futures to repair her soul—is signaled early and tightened once when the tree drinks another tomorrow. Escalation is accumulative: each heartbeat forecloses an option. Cost is visible on the page. No coincidence resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the particulars: reckless repair vs. patient transformation. The inverted tower-bud offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture (Ardan’s shared palm). No thematic drift.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Distinct lyric texture sustained; diction stays within Lira’s plausible lexicon. No head-hopping. Rhythm modulates with pressure. Dialogue minimal but subtextual (“feed them mine”).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High density, zero loops or scaffold. Metaphors are precise and coherent. No overwriting in peak beats. Final image crystallizes without clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: tarot grafted into living bone-orchard, destiny as sap. Premise is non-obvious and fully committed. Transformation test passes—story collapses if elements swapped. Risk heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
