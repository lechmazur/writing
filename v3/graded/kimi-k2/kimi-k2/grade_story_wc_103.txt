<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the crayon memory and trembling fingers anchor her obsession. Yet her final dispersal feels more metaphysical than earned—no prior flaw or contradiction visibly forces the surrender. A stronger micro-choice at the split-willow moment would have locked the arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer tightens the weave toward the final photograph. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration—she becomes the fabric she sought, cost paid in bodily erasure. One causal wobble: the halo’s crack releases the maze-of-light without prior seeded constraint.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The living bridge, hyperbolic water, mirrored leaves, and dissolving body form a coherent micro-setting that constrains every step. Specificity—“water climbing hyperbolic steps whose angles hurt to follow”—grounds the impossible. Final image of warm/cool fabric is earned by tactile build-up.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—grasping time’s texture—escalates through sensory intensification and bodily loss. Each beat narrows options: photographs burn backward, skin flakes into light. The cost is visceral and continuous; no reversal, only deepening toward fusion with the garden.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: time as tactile, communal fabric woven from every footfall. The final photograph rippling into garden-breath reweights all prior corridors from puzzles to nets. No moralizing; resonance is carried by image alone.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise—“geometry folded like wet silk,” “time…like wet clay over broken glass.” Perceptual signature remains consistent under dissolution; no head-hopping. Compression and elision are taught early and paid off in the final lattice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; each sentence layers texture without redundancy. Occasional elevated diction (“retrocognitively trapped”) is justified by the narrator’s vocation. No loops or mixed metaphors; final cadence slows to match exhalation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fusion of hedge-maze craft, living architecture, and temporal ontology feels inevitable yet fresh. The crayon maze returning as liquid light is a non-obvious synthesis that reconfigures the premise. Risky dissolution is fully committed to, not hedged.</comment>
