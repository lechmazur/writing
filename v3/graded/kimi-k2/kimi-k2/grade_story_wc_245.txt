<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is embodied and specific—"quiet blaze of determination inside her chest warming the night air"—but the final epiphany ("she had been mapping herself all along") arrives as summary rather than dramatized contradiction, capping the score below 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of absorbed languages → melody → stillpoint → grief named. Closure is a Charged Poise: the melody settles inside her ribcage as a new compass. Cost is felt in the hush where "the forest noise dropped to a hush so complete she heard her own heart map the silence."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ultrasonic forest, quartz trunks, platinum ring, and starlight pool are not backdrop; each constrains movement and charges the final image. The ring’s shift from cold star to soft lavender needle directly shapes the climax.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—"uncharted emotional depths"—is signaled early and tightened when the melody demands she name grief aloud. One meaningful deepening suffices; the cost is the irrevocable internalization of the song.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the accretion of languages and the final naming of grief; no moralizing. The ending reweights the premise: cartography turns inward, a resonant non-verbal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise—“colors had folded themselves into a single dark chord”—with rhythmic control that accelerates through the quartz trunks and breathes at the stillpoint. No POV leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; occasional stacked metaphors (“melody folded over her like wings”) risk overwriting yet serve the accumulative design. No loops or scaffolds; final image crystallizes cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: blind mapmaker who “reads” forests via ultrasonic leaves and absorbs languages as pigment. The stillpoint as moment rather than place is a non-obvious reconfiguration that feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
