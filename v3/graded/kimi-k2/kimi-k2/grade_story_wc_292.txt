<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lila’s “nervously confident” refrain is embodied in trembling fingers yet sure drawer-shuts; the copper nail warms, anchoring ancestral dread in her palm. The final substitution beats—stepping aside yet keeping the blunted nail—crystallize a hierarchy of values (lineage over self-preservation) with visible cost. Interior contradiction is sustained: she wants rescue but accepts exile, shown not told. Only the ancestor’s silent question leans on label-speak, keeping it just shy of 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: stanza recitation → hatch unlocks → mirror exchange → jet stream rerouted, each beat tightening options. Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Lila remains ashore but exiled in Morag’s aged body, cost legible in “sea-etched” reflection. Orientation anchored by word 80 (“Cape Wrath…inside”). One micro-turn—realizing the journals were messages, not wreckage—deepens rather than breaks causality. Persistent constraint: the copper nail above the doorframe now marks her irreversible exile.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Weather station oozes salt, ozone, kelp-soaked iron; barographs click faster under rising pressure, guiding Lila’s descent. The copper nail functions as micro-setting, constraining the final choice when pressed into the mirror. Mirrors fogged by condensation double as sensory anchor and plot device, reflecting backward-aging selves. Spatial choreography clean: hatch beneath anemometer, spiral stair, chamber lined with mirrors—no impossible positions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reverse exile or accept it—signaled in paragraph 5. Escalation: each stanza narrows possibility until the mirror offers only substitution, not rescue. Price paid: Lila forfeits her youth/identity, shown in “sea-etched” reflection. Pressure coherent under causal lens; no off-stage rescue. Could edge higher if intermediate costs (fatigue, disorientation) altered tactics on-page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme—exile as mutable weather—emerges through mirrored reversals rather than statement. Copper nail reweights from relic to tether; final pinning above doorframe non-literally answers “can exile end?” with “it can only be traded.” Ambiguity lingers: Morag free, Lila trapped, yet both continue mapping. No moralizing; resonance arises from specific image of clouds shaped into unnamed archipelagos.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Lila’s perceptual filter: “spongey dread oozing up her calves” externalizes visceral fear. Diction—“barometric drums,” “temperature anomalies”—reads like a map librarian’s precision under stress. Rhythm accelerates with shorter beats as storm rises, then slows into resonant final line. No head-hopping; ancestor’s silent question rendered as lip-movement, not interiority.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty: “She aligned the copper nail with the station’s brass meridian ring, feeling it tug” marries action, object, and foreboding. Figurative language disciplined—no mixed metaphors; “shadows pooling like spilled ink” fits ink-stained journals motif. One paraphrase loop: “nervously confident” repeated thrice; trim one for 9+. No scaffold, high density, strong propulsion into final image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fuses climate-fiction with ancestral haunt in a way that feels inevitable: jet stream as literal and metaphysical exile. Journals-as-bottles-forwarded-through-time reverses the usual message-in-bottle trope. Mirror substitution trades bodies instead of mere places, fresh yet foreshadowed by “reversible exile” rule. Risky second-person question from ancestor paid off by earned cost. Specificity of Cape Wrath, Hebrides, Morag’s tar-and-heather scent anchors universals.</comment>
