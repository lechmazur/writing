<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lysandra’s fierce “yeast” motivation and embodied micro-choice—kneading initials into bread—propel the climax and demonstrate genuine struggle; interiority remains vivid, even as speech pattern convergence slightly softens individual edges.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>One continuous scene under the Accumulative/Textural lens, culminating in the Earned Stasis of baking and sharing bread; causation relies on rising memory instead of plot reversals, cost legible in the oven’s final exhale.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The grotto’s limestone alcoves and humming waterfall are selectively tactile; the oven, lens, and stalactites constrain action and re-signify memory, meeting the 9+ constraint requirement on micro-scale objects.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Single dominant stake—the revival of living culture—tightens as bread’s aroma summons voice fragments; pressure felt rather than escalated; visible cost in abandoning old alphabets to communal harmony.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: culture is process not relic, enacted through baking, sharing, and reconciliation; subtext of colonial loss and hybrid identity lingers without explicit declaration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</question>
<comment>Lyrical third-person distance luxuriates in metaphor (“rosewater dread”, “honeyed chords”) while disciplined specificity ties every percept to Lysandra’s trained eye and ear; rhythm modulates with steam and water.</comment>
<question>7</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sensuous metaphors sustain clarity; occasional density (“emerald-tinted opera glass lens” used twice) risks slight redundancy but never stalls the final image, remaining above the artifact thresholds.</comment>
<question>8</question>
<grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Recombines post-imperial refugee tropes and baking ritual into a fresh, localized image; risk resides in soft, familiar metaphors rather than structural boldness, landing just beyond derivative.</comment>
