<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Emil’s interiority is vivid—hands “remembered every lullaby,” chip dims with doubt—yet the moment of self-doubt (“was he worthy?”) is narrated rather than embodied in micro-choice, keeping him just shy of the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each beat (chip on fork, song spirals, tethering gears) tightens options until the fused twilight-dawn gear reconfigures the world. Closure lands with visible cost—Midnight’s surrendered sliver and Emil’s irrevocable promise—earning the 9+.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The resonance chamber’s bronze parabola and rusted covenant are not mere backdrop; they constrain acoustics and corrode choice, culminating in the chamber flooding with reclaimed light. One hairline slip: “soft red snow” momentarily blurs the rust’s physicality.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—return dawn to children—escalates through each tethering beat; the covenant’s counter-attack raises cost until Midnight’s bargain is broken. The price (Midnight’s essence surrendered) is legible, though the external stakes could feel more viscerally pressed on Emil’s body.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of reclamation through honest repair emerges organically; the fused gear of twilight and dawn offers a resonant, non-moralizing answer. No late thesis statements—image does the work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct—tactile, musical, clock-work precise (“gears that hummed like sleeping bees”). Rhythm modulates with pressure, and no head-hopping occurs. Compression (“mending what isn’t torn”) is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is selective and patterned. One minor loop—“rust loosened… rust peeled”—is forgiven because it tracks causal progression. No artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fusing a philosopher’s-stone chip with Midnight’s shadow into a twilight-dawn gear feels inevitable yet wholly fresh. The risk of personifying Midnight as a frightened child pays off emotionally without gimmickry.</comment>
