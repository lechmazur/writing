<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lila’s contradictory impulses—filial loyalty vs moral revulsion—are embodied in the ink pot’s weight and the chill of Alvarez’s wrist; her micro-choice to stamp the forged certificate crystallizes the cost. Interiority is specific, never diagnostic. The final “borrowed shoes” image shows earned endurance with visible cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test. Only the director’s flatness keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: every beat links because/therefore from forged passport → courier interception → corpse as prop → stamped certificate. Closure is a decisive change—Alvarez’s death is now official, her father legally dead—paid for by Lila’s complicity. Cost is legible in the final pocketed certificate and ink pot. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The prep room’s formaldehyde-lily cocktail, porcelain table, and blotter are not backdrop; the blotter’s position enables the stamp breach. Micro-setting (ink pot, corpse wrist) constrains the final choice. Sensory hierarchy narrows under pressure—smell of iron-violet ink overrides visual clutter. Meets 9+ gate: the ink pot charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—father’s asylum—signaled in paragraph 4. Escalation tightens once: director’s suspicion → Lila’s breach → irrevocable stamp. Cost is the moral ledger she must now carry. Agency drives every turn; coincidence complicates (courier caught) but does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of “fairness as process” emerges from the corpse-exchange equation and the ink’s spreading guilt. Final dawn image reweights the premise without moralizing: borders remain negotiable, complicity permanent. Subtext in the director’s “paper-cut” eyes and the corpse’s ambiguous smile deepens ambiguity. No thematic drift; resonance is earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is Lila’s perceptual signature: synesthetic (“ink…like cataracts”), con-taught counting (“one Mississippi”), tactile metaphors. Syntax tightens under pressure—final paragraph’s cadence mirrors dawn cracking. No head-hopping; psychic distance stays intimate. Dialogue minimal but subtextual (“My father asked me to witness…”).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers sensory, moral, and tactical data. No loops or scaffold. Metaphors are precise—“politician’s final compromise” for sewn mouth. Rhythm accelerates during stamp beat, then exhales at dawn. Clean mechanics; no register drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Forging asylum via corpse swap is fresh; the ink pot as inherited guilt-object transforms familiar noir tropes. Specificity—vintage pot’s dented cap, iron-violet scent—anchors universals. Risky moral calculus (one death = one life) is fully committed to, not hedged. Final dawn reprise feels inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
