<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira’s contradictory impulses—hunger for visibility vs. self-erasure in walls—are dramatized through tactile micro-choices (coaxing tape, pressing it under the board). The final act of giving away the fragment costs her the custodian’s literal voice, earning her a mirrored visibility; cost is felt but not yet paid in full, capping at 8.7.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Lira’s choice to plant lullaby II beneath the runaway crystallizes her stake and reweights the premise—visibility now travels both directions. Accumulative/Textural lens holds; the sapphire hush pattern intensifies to final image with undeniable cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The library’s crawl-space arteries, sweating pipes, and hollowed beam actively constrain tactics and cache choice; the sapphire hush recurs to charge the final image. Micro-setting (tin box, felt patch) functions as extension of body and stakes.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—becoming visible—tightens when Lira sacrifices the custodian’s fragment to comfort the stranger; the trade-off is legible and irreversible. One meaningful deepening suffices under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of reciprocal visibility emerges through concrete acts, not statement; final image of tears traveling “both directions” reweights prior motifs without moralizing. Subtext in tape’s warmth and girl’s silent cry carries the resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with perceptual signature rooted in Lira’s braille-like touch and sapphire synesthesia. Patterned elision (“sapphire hush”) is taught early and paid off at closure; no head-hopping, cadence modulates with pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is selective and purposeful. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Minor risk of overwriting in “cobalt smears” but does not dull closure.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost-current lullabies, crawl-space cartography, and reciprocal invisibility; premise feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
