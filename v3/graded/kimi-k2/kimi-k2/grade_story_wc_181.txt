<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—curiosity vs. self-preservation—are dramatized in the orchard and bathroom beats; her final surrender is earned by the prior Möbius-loop logic and carries visible cost (memory erasure). Interiority is concrete, e.g., “vomited stardust,” avoiding label-speak. The only minor slip is a touch of diagnostic self-awareness in “understood that the shell was not a key but a seed,” but it is immediately embodied in the planting action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara’s acceptance of eternal guardianship crystallizes in the final image of galaxies unborn in her eyes. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each return to the bathroom deepens pattern and cost. Causality is nonlinear yet coherent; the Möbius logic is taught early and paid off. Cost is unmistakable: “her memories began to peel away like petals.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The astral orchard is not mere backdrop; its star-blooms and question-mark leaves constrain choices and charge the final image. Micro-setting (porcelain cube lavatory) functions as portal and pressure chamber. Sensory detail is selective and urgent—“wind that tasted like childhood and ozone.” One minor spatial drift: the exact distance between lavatory and oldest tree is elided, but this serves the dream logic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—inherit the orchard or flee—is signaled in paragraph 5 and tightened when Elara sees her own future weeping self. Escalation is driven by her agency: planting the seed, pressing the cameo into bark. The price—loss of self and memory—is legible on the page. No external reversals are needed; the Möbius structure supplies the deepening.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of cyclical knowledge-as-curse emerges through concrete events rather than statement. The final whisper “Ask me anything” reweights the entire narrative without moralizing. Subtext operates in the rustling equations and ultraviolet panic. The footnote bloom is a perfect CR, making the conceptual cost undeniable.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with a perceptual signature—“crystalline petals that fell like snow from trees of living starlight.” Syntax modulates with pressure: longer, spiraling sentences in the orchard, clipped fragments in the bathroom. No POV leakage; even the reflection speaks within Elara’s psychic frame. Experimental compression (“simply complicated”) is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative language is patterned and purposeful—“tree grew simply complicated.” No loops or scaffold; “vomited stardust” is the only high-pressure metaphor and it lands cleanly. Minor register elevation in “nonlinear inheritance” is justified by the Codex frame.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The nonlinear-inheritance premise is transformed through tactile specifics: pistachio shell, question-mark leaves, footnote bloom. Risky structure—Möbius loop, bathroom portal—heightens stakes without gimmickry. The synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight; no other names or places could substitute. Fresh inflection: knowledge as literal tree-feed.</comment>
