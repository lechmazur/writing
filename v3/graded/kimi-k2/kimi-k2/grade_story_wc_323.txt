<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority is precise and embodied; grief as pressure is palpable. The anchor link’s evolving meaning charts a credible arc from memento to compass. Final choice to dive and teach carries visible cost—she leaves the known grid forever. Only minor: wife’s voice is reported, not dramatized, so relationship crucible is off-page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of glyphs and anchor reweight meaning until final CR redefines “horizon.” Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—abyss becomes sky—cost is the irreversible departure from human maps. Orientation is taught early; no causality breaks. Meets 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Benthic city, trench, and anchor link as micro-setting constrain every move; pressure of depth literally shapes the final image. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered (“cold pressure…press the grief deeper”). Environment charges closure: water sphere suspended in vacuum reconfigures the world rule-set.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—learn alien navigation vs. council prohibition—tightens once when she chooses to follow glyphs. Cost is exile from city and human epistemology. Escalation is a single deepening under Accumulative lens; felt price is legible at the dive.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</question><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: grief, forbidden knowledge, and reimagined horizons. Final image (“stars that shine from the bottom up”) offers non-literal, resonant answer without moralizing. Subtext in anchor’s weight and mirrored facets carries the conceptual reweighting.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet disciplined; perceptual signature is marine, mournful, precise. Syntax modulates with pressure—long sentences in calm, clipped fragments at the dive. No head-hopping; POV modesty maintained. Distinct texture sustains throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density—“pressure felt like forgiveness,” “memory of gravity.” Metaphors are coherent and pattern-taught. Rhythm breathes with scene needs. No artifacts in closure beat. Read-aloud ear test passes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of grief, alien cartography, and abyssal inversion. Premise is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Risky structural choice—lyric accumulative arc—heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specificity of benthic city and anchor link prevents template drift.</comment>
