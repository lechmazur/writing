<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Azim’s interiority is textured and embodied; the retrocognitive flash anchors motive. Leylah’s presence supplies relational pressure, but her arc is under-sketched. The final act of pressing the tessera is earned and costly, yet Azim’s “gentle radical” identity is asserted more than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: mosaic fragments accumulate meaning until the final reconfiguration. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—the plaza’s memory is renamed with visible cost (shared labor, shard cuts). Orientation is clear by line 3; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Frost-rimmed colonnades, star-pooled flagstones, and the chipped minaret tesserae are vivid and selective. The mosaic stepping stone constrains the final choice and charges the ending image. Spatial choreography is coherent; weather affects mood and action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: whether the plaza’s memory can be redeemed. Pressure tightens as each shard placed forecloses prior grief. Agency is collaborative; the cost is bloodied fingertips and exhausted softness. One clear deepening—renaming rather than rebuilding—suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of “aberrant mercy” emerges through action: surgeons’ kindness as harm, mothers forgiving soldiers. Final image reframes mercy as slow, painful reconstruction rather than absolution. Subtext is carried in chipped glass and withheld lullaby. No moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet grounded in tactile detail; perceptual signature is consistent. Compression (“history folded like wet parchment”) is taught early and paid off. Dialogue is sparse but natural, carrying subtext. No POV drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is patterned and purposeful. Occasional poetic overload (“stars dripped through the seams”) risks purple, but rhythm modulates under pressure. No loops or scaffold. Line-level clarity supports closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Post-war mosaic-repair as ritual of renaming feels fresh. Combines lyric fragment, tactile labor, and ethical ambiguity. Transformation test passes: story would collapse if setting or object changed. Risky compression heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
