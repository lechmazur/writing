<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied; the locksmith’s contradictory impulses—fix the world yet accept personal erasure—are dramatized in the final fusion. Motivation is rooted in childhood loss and sustained through tactile micro-choices. The cost is palpable when the brass key fuses to her skin, foreclosing escape. One notch below 9.0 only because the “rhythm of repair” refrain edges toward label-speak once.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the world mends while the locksmith becomes the lock. Causal chain—uncap vial → gears hum → mirror sings → key fuses—holds under Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is swift; stakes and lens are legible by line 3. Cost is unmistakable in the final heartbeat shift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Frozen library, frost bells, sky-whale coat, petrified tear—each detail is selective and charged. The hall of mirrors constrains choice by forcing confrontation with stolen memories. Micro-setting (brass key, petrified tear) directly shapes the climax. One hairline slip: “driftwood nostalgia” is lovely but slightly abstract.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—mend time at personal cost—is signaled early and tightened once through the mirror crack. Escalation is driven by her agency: pressing the tear into the fracture. The price—eternal stasis as the lock—is legible on the page. No extraneous reversals; pressure coheres.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of repair versus self-erasure emerges organically from action and image. Final line reweights the premise without moralizing. Recurring eclipse motif shifts from external wonder to internal cost. Subtext in the mirrors’ stolen memories deepens the thematic question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lush yet disciplined, with rhythmic control that mirrors the ticking cadence. Perceptual signature is distinct: metallic tastes, frost rings, daylight bleeding. No head-hopping; POV remains locked to the locksmith. Compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. Metaphors are precise—“shard of driftglass,” “daylight like blood.” No loops or scaffold. Minor register lift in “conceptual repricing” phrase, but it fits the elevated mythic tone.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fusion of lunar-eclipse locksmith, sky-whale coat, and petrified tear feels inevitable and fresh. Premise transforms familiar “mending time” trope through embodied sacrifice. Risky lyric structure holds coherence under Accumulative lens. Specificity throughout prevents template drift.</comment>
