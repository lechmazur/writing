<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The mapkeeper’s interior contradiction—hoarding silence vs learning to release it—plays out in embodied micro-choices (closing fist, opening hand, scoring her arm). The final renunciation costs her the comfort of certainty and is earned by the preceding beats. Flaw: the energy being’s motivation remains abstract, slightly softening the relational crucible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each repetition of “bloom of hush” deepens the pattern until the final placement of the stone reconfigures silence from absence to resonance. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with visible cost—her maps are now incomplete. Orientation is clear by line 4; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The harmonic caves, echo chamber stone, and frozen rivulet constrain every move: the stone’s placement literally changes the cave’s song. Micro-setting (ice cracks as living map) charges the final image. Sensory economy is tight—luminosity, hush, and pulse guide choice without clutter.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will she cling to hoarded silence or release it—tightens through each interaction with the stone and the beings. The final act of placing the stone forecloses her old method of map-making; cost is the loss of her curated archive. Escalation is one deepening, not multiple reversals, fitting the lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the transformation of silence from commodity to living resonance; no explicit statement mars the ending. The final image of the caves singing her heartbeat offers a non-literal answer to the central question. Subtext in gesture (hand closing/opening) carries the moral weight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct lyric texture—“hammered repose,” “bloom of hush”—remains consistent under pressure. POV is tight single-focalizer; no head-hopping. Compression is purposeful and taught early; the closing cadence matches the cave’s exhale.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances image or pressure. Metaphors (ice cracks as river delta, silence petals) are precise and internally consistent. Rhythm modulates with the hush—long vowels, then clipped consonants when the being approaches. No artifacts in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of cartography, acoustics, and alien pedagogy feels inevitable yet fresh. Risky lyric compression pays off in the final resonance. The premise would collapse if any element were swapped—stone, caves, or mapkeeper’s skin-archive are irreducibly specific.</comment>
