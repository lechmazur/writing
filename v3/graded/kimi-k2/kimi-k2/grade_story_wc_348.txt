<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The polymerist’s interior contradiction—science vs guilt—remains embodied on every beat, culminating in the micro-choke when she decides to bind resin to stone; that choice costs the option of total erasure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure satisfies Decisive Change: the braiding waters re-converge and her life-path pivots; because/therefore linkages land the cost—she will return to the burn ward, carrying a mutable guilt now converted to usable polymer.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Braided ravine is no postcard—the quartz vein literally becomes the suturing plane the chrysalis is fused to, cementing the central metaphor and constraining her final stance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Dominant stake—transform loss into connection—tightens once when the river foam patterns reconfigure from threat to instruction; the visible price is her relinquishment of the shell—she cannot take it back to the lab.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges only from image and choice; the final amber lens answers “how to live with irremediable loss” without any explanatory tag; grief is metabolised, not solved.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Chemist’s voice weds material precision—benzyl alcohol rising like benediction—to lyrical compression; every sensory note filtered through her grief-numbed perception, with no drift in tone or POV.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Rhythm accelerates under pressure, information density is high, and no loops survive—only deliberate repetition of braid, shell, quartz to coil tension, not spin wheels.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>The carbon-to-polymer-of-memory conceit is fresh; no stock lab-fire trope survives intact; chrysalis re-purposed as lens re-weights the entire grief science nexus without gimmick.</comment>
