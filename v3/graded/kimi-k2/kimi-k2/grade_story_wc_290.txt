<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s claustrophobia and prudence are embodied in micro-choices (counting steps, mapping exits) and collide with her need to reach the organ; the fused key and final “I’ll map the sky for you” crystallize earned change with visible cost—her mother’s ghost released and her own fear unhooked. Interiority stays concrete, never lapses into label-speak. One slip: the phrase “spatial mutiny” is diagnostic shorthand rather than embodied perception, a hairline nick.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the labyrinth exhales, corridors widen, starlight pours through, and Elara walks out carrying the fused key—cost is the irreversible loss of her mother’s ghost. Causal chain holds: compass point → organ note → spatial warp → reunion → fusion → release. No orientation debt; anchors are clear by line 3. Lens is Causal throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The nexus is rendered through Elara’s body—shoulders brushing walls, lungs tightening—so setting actively constrains choice. Starlight shards, black-glass pedestal, and the organ’s spirals are vivid yet selective, never stall momentum. Final starlight pooling like water recharges the opening image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover the key and confront the labyrinth’s theft of her mother—tightens when the corridor seals behind her, forcing a one-way plunge. Escalation is causal: each spatial shift narrows options until the organ’s note reconfigures space itself. Cost is legible: the mother’s ghost fades, Elara’s claustrophobia transmutes into vastness. One minor slack: the “vital key” label is repeated without fresh pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of inheritance and reclamation emerges through the twin compass points and the organ’s fugue; no moralizing, only the final whispered promise. Subtext hums in the labyrinth’s “wistful rebellion” against its own forgetting. The fused star-chart etched in light on her skin reweights the premise without exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is tactile, slightly breathless, and filtered through Elara’s spatial anxiety; syntax tightens in narrow corridors, widens in weightless drift. No dialogue, so no voice leakage. Distinct perceptual signature—“starlight bled through in silver shards,” “walls bowing outward like lungs inhaling”—and rhythmic control under pressure satisfy the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image, motion, and stakes. No loops, no mixed metaphors, no filter-verb stacks. Occasional elevated diction (“reverberation that rippled outward”) is earned by the cathedral acoustics. One near-repeat—“reverberation” twice in two lines—barely grazes the ear.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The Cartographers’ Guild, spatial mutiny, and crystallized starlight fuse into a fresh mythos that feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky choice to make the labyrinth a sentient archive of grief pays off; no derivative echoes. The transformation test fails if names are swapped, confirming originality.</comment>
