<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zev’s embodied vigilance and tactile memory anchor every beat; the micro-choice to re-weave the release sequence crystallizes his arc. Interior contradiction—pride in past fix vs dread of future failure—drives the scene. Cost is palpable in raw palms and the moonlit dummy. Only the rookie anecdote drifts into summary, blunting the flaw’s edge.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the revised harness holds the dummy, covenant renewed at visible cost of sleepless labor. Causal chain—buckle crack → pattern revision → forest stillness—holds under Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is swift; moonlight and resin cue place/time by line 3. No teleporting props or retro-patching.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The living arbor is no backdrop; its flexing planks and whispering leaves dictate torque and rope choice. Micro-setting of cracked buckle and lavender-gray webbing constrains the final weave. Sensory hierarchy—resin scent, cooled oil, moonlit metal—filters through Zev’s professional eye. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from branch to pulley to dummy.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—trust under pressure—tightens when the flawed buckle forecloses complacency. One decisive deepening: Zev rewrites the entire release sequence, trading rest for certainty. Cost is the extra shift and the hush that follows. No coincidence resolves; the forest merely witnesses.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of silent covenant emerges from knots and resin, never sermonized. The final bow to the dummy reweights “trust” from abstract ideal to embodied rope-feel. Subtext hums in the cracked metal and lavender webbing. Only the boot-camp aphorism edges toward label-speak.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is spare, tactile, and rhythmically alive: “midnight pattern seeker,” “living-wood platform flexing with his breath.” Perceptual signature—soundless echo, half-note engine—remains consistent. No POV leakage; every image is filtered through Zev’s vigilance. Compression and elision are taught early and paid off in the final hush.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet lyrical; each sentence advances action or atmosphere. No loops, no mixed metaphors. Density is high—“buckle tongues glinting whenever moonlight threaded the needles”—without clutter. Minor scaffold in “since then the silent covenant” could trim two words, but it does not dull the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The aerial arbor and webbing-revision premise feels fresh, not recycled military SF. Transformation test: swap setting or gear and the emotional arc collapses. Risky lyric compression pays off in the final stillness. Only the rookie anecdote flirts with trope familiarity.</comment>
