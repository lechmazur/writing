<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“palms already slick with the fear of heights”), but the twin-reveal is delivered via filmic exposition rather than a present-tense choice; the final rooftop confrontation crystallizes the arc with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each beat (shell → cast → reel → roof) tightens options because/therefore. Closure lands as Earned Stasis—burning contracts forecloses the stunt life—cost legible in the shared silence after the fire.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Library’s rusted girders and salt-iron smell are tactile and selective; the roof wind “tasted of ocean” reweights the inland setting into memory-space, constraining the final choice to step toward flight rather than fall.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—owning the truth about the stolen life—escalates through each object; the rooftop standoff forces a decisive trade-off (burn the contracts) with visible price (loss of the only identity he knew).</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of “vulnerability as power” emerges organically from the stunt body’s history; the burning contracts enact a non-moralizing repricing of what courage means, resonant in the final image of ground as place to land.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and film-noir lyrical yet grounded in stunt-perception (“motion-trained eyes”); compression and elision taught early (“rusted library under stars”) pay off in rhythmic closure without head-hop.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; mixed metaphors (“moonlight dripping like molten silver”) stay legible under pressure. No loops or scaffold; final paragraph cadence mirrors the protagonist’s new stance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of stunt-double myth and stolen-twin noir; the rusted library as memory vault and the seashell as audio evidence feel inevitable yet non-generic. Risky rooftop reunion lands without gimmickry.</comment>
