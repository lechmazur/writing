<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her throat tightening at “thirty-three stones” crystallizes the cost. The contradiction between her desire to curate memory and her fear of betrayal is dramatized through the act of measuring shadows. The final renunciation—writing what chose her—earns its charge because the obelisk’s void has already forced her hand. Only a slight reserve keeps it from 9+: the micro-choice hierarchy could be even sharper under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the obelisk becomes a page, reweighting the premise that identity is sculpted rather than received. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of remembered fragments increases until the single clear note releases pressure. Causality is intact: each measurement and inscription tightens the stakes until the fog fractures. Cost is legible in the bruised ink and the names she never knew but now must carry.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The stormlit observatory, crystal forecourt, and black obelisk are not backdrop but instruments: the crystal translates thunder, the obelisk drinks ink. Spatial choreography is precise—shadows counted stone by stone—so the setting constrains tactics. Sensory selection narrows under urgency: rain-softened ink, copper wind. Only the city below remains slightly generic, preventing a 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—how to remember without betrayal—tightens when the obelisk’s impossible shadow forces Lira to abandon curation for listening. Agency drives escalation: each measurement is a choice that forecloses omission. The cost is visceral when the ink bruises into the obelisk. A hair more external pressure would push it to 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the tension between curation and surrender: identity is not sculpted but received through the ache of unwanted memory. The obelisk’s transformation into a page of names offers a resonant, non-moral answer. Subtext operates in the silence after bells, the antiseptic taste—never explained, only felt. No thematic drift; every image reweights the central question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise: “droplet clung…like a memory refusing to fall” teaches the pattern early and pays off when rain softens ink into bruises. Perceptual signature is consistent—Lira’s noticing is archivist-slow, tactile, numerate. No POV leakage; crystal murmurs and obelisk reflections remain filtered through her senses. Rhythm modulates with pressure, accelerating during measurement, exhaling at the final note.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence layers memory, action, and atmosphere. Figurative language is patterned and purposeful—shadows as ledgers, ink as bruises—never ornamental. No loops or scaffold; even the numerate precision (“seven paving-stones”) advances stakes. A single mixed metaphor (“ink bleeding into the monument until the obelisk itself became a page”) is earned by context.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of archive-as-memory, shadow-as-weight, and plague-as-void feels inevitable yet fresh. The obelisk returning the excised memory transforms a familiar trope into specific, irreversible consequence. Risky lyric compression is sustained without clarity loss. The final image—obelisk as page—could not be transplanted to another setting without collapse.</comment>
