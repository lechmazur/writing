<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lila’s interiority is precise and embodied—her boots stick, her palm tingles, her whispered line carries the weight of ten years. The haunted ambitions are shown thinning “like morning fog,” a concrete micro-choice that reweights her motive. The final refusal to pick the fruit is earned by the seed’s root asking permission, crystallizing her arc with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the seed seals, the arbor exhales, and Lila’s stance toward knowledge is reconfigured without sentimental payoff. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each branch is a sentence, each leaf a determinative—culminating in a final image that reweights the premise. The cost is the spiral scar she carries back to the observatory.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The magnetic arbor is not backdrop but active text: branches form DINGIR, bark glows cerulean, fields fold inward to teach the seed. Micro-setting (the seed’s hollow wedge) constrains the climactic placement. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—copper and ozone on her lips, silence as dialect—anchoring who/where/when within the first 120 words.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“to understand how consciousness survives translation across death”—is signaled early and tightened by the seed’s request for permission. One meaningful deepening: the root loosens, retreating, redefining transition as conversation, not escape. Cost is the spiral scar and the refusal to harvest knowledge, foreclosing tenure-driven ambition.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: cuneiform as living text, translation as mutual consent. The final line “May the word return to the mouth that shaped it” offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in the seed’s silent question and Lila’s bow—gesture over declaration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet disciplined, syntax mirroring the “kindly methodical” trait. Distinct perceptual signature: Lila tastes copper and ozone, hears silence as dialect. No head-hopping; POV distance stable. Compression in “the tree inhaled” is taught by prior magnetic vocabulary and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances story or atmosphere. High density: “iron-barked branches humming with the memory of departed spirits” fuses setting, tone, and theme. Rhythm modulates—long climbs vs. the single-word “The tree inhaled.” Metaphors are coherent and grounded in the arbor’s physics.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise—magnetic arbor as cuneiform text—feels inevitable in hindsight, synthesizing linguistics, physics, and grief. Risky lyric compression is taught early and paid off. No close echoes; the golden fruit is not Eden-redux but a reweighted epistemic gift. Transformation test: story fails if any element is swapped.</comment>
