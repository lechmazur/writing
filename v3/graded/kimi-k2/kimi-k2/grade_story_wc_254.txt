<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Luminous interiority and embodied contradiction (“ink bled upward from the stone”) tether motive to micro-choice; the poet’s shift from trespasser to translator is felt, costly, specific.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Chooses Accumulative/Textural lens; final image of the mirrored silhouette filled with migrating constellations reconfigures meaning and symmetry with undeniable conceptual cost, all causal threads snapping shut.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Atrium, quartz, and lake mirror precisely constrain tactics and image; the lake’s flip from frozen to drum-skin underfoot is felt and functional, charging closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“borders are only weather in slow motion”—tightens once through the keystone inscription and the lake’s refusal to keep above and below from trading places, price paid.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</question><comment>Theme emerges from concrete inversion of symmetry and echo-location rather than statement; final line reweights the premise non-literal, resonance intact, no moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice distinct—compressed, image-stacked, rhythmically controlled; free indirect and lyric syntax stay consistent and purposeful under pressure, teaching pattern early.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dense sensory layering never swamps clarity; each sentence advances image or choice; occasional elevated diction remains within lyric license, no artifact at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Inverts “ban on speech” into spatial symmetry collapse inside an architected dreamscape; premise fresh, integration airtight, no cribbed templates.</comment>
