<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“shared exhale that fogged her helmet”); the final realization that she is the child who sent the bottle is earned through the city’s memory and the feather’s flare. Motivation (“learn the rhythm of belonging”) drives every beat, culminating in resonance rather than possession. No contradictory impulses are dramatized mid-scene, so the 9+ quick test is not fully met.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the city’s lullaby and her ascent crystallize belonging as internal resonance. Causality is Accumulative/Textural—each sensory layer (fireflies, consoles, birth chart) deepens the pattern until the child-memory folds into her chest. Cost is visible in the feather’s final flare and the city’s sigh that lifts her. Orientation is clear within 120 words; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The underwater observatory is not backdrop; its cracked dome and bioluminescent algae actively refract starlight into memory maps that guide her choices. The burnt feather’s socket and the firefly orrery are micro-settings that constrain her final stance. Sensory specificity (“molten pearl” corridors, “silver beads” of joy) is selective and purposeful. Environment directly charges the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—belonging—is signaled in line 1 and tightens through each refracted constellation until the city’s memory reveals her own past. Agency is her decision to step into the firefly spiral and accept the city’s rhythm; cost is the irreversible crumbling of the feather and the knowledge she can never truly leave. One meaningful deepening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: belonging is resonance, not ownership. The child’s bottle-message reweights every prior image without moralizing. Subtext operates in the city’s silent charts and the feather’s final flare. Final image—her laughter as silver beads—offers non-literal, resonant answer to the thematic question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with rhythmic control (“slow galaxies,” “luminous respite”). POV remains tightly focalized; no head-hopping. Distinct perceptual signature: she reads starlight as heartbeat maps. Patterned elision (time thinned to a single chord) is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and motion. No loops or scaffold; metaphors are coherent (“veins of molten pearl”). Occasional elevated diction (“resonance—two rhythms finding the same pulse”) is earned by voice. Final third remains artifact-free.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—underwater city that maps futures via starlight—feels inevitable in hindsight. Transformation test: swapping names or places would collapse the emotional logic. Fresh inflection: the city’s horoscope as lure for its own completion. Risk-taking (lyric accumulative structure) heightens stakes without obscuring closure.</comment>
