<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The vendor’s interiority is vivid and embodied—counting absences, feeling the bottle tug—but the motivation to “serve stories” is stated rather than dramatized; the final renunciation of the vendor role earns a credible stasis yet lacks prior stakes to make the cost sting.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the library reconfigures into fractal aisles of FORGIVE, the seed planted inside the bottle reweights the premise. Causality is lyric-accumulative; each counted absence tightens the pattern until the orchard blooms. One felt cost—the vendor cedes agency to become listener—though the parole sentence itself stays abstract.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The glass orchard, moon-metal shelves, and mist pool are rendered with tactile specificity; the setting actively reconfigures to constrain choice when the aisles multiply. The floating library and lantern orbits charge the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“find where stories begin”—is signaled early; pressure tightens as each counted absence reshapes the bottle into a keyhole. The final crystallization of FORGIVE narrows options and carries conceptual cost, though the escalation is more accumulative than causal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of forgiveness as narrative origin emerges through image and reconfiguration rather than statement; the final word FORGIVE reweights prior absences. Subtext operates in the bottle’s molten seed and the compass needle’s borrowed light, avoiding moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is lyric, compressed, and consistent; perceptual signature is distinct (“moon-metal shelves,” “cursive smoke”). Patterned elision is taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; register remains elevated yet coherent with the mythic frame.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; metaphors cohere within the moon-glass lexicon. Occasional stacked images risk overwriting (“lantern ten bumps lantern three”) yet never obscure causality. Rhythm modulates with pressure; no loops or scaffold in the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The premise—a parole sentence served by quantifying narrative absence inside a floating glass library—feels fresh and inevitable. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry; the transformation of absence into lantern-light is non-obvious yet earned.</comment>
