<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority is vivid—threads loosened by memory, body tracing paths while mind hovers—yet the shift from passive sleepwalker to decisive weaver is slightly under-cooked; the cost of her final stance (keeping both eyes open) is implied rather than embodied on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the stone boat and orchid seed crystallize the re-weaving of ruin into reverence under an Accumulative/Textural lens; the final image reweights earlier motifs with felt cost, though the causality of the canyon’s “gentle sealing” could be one shade more legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The red canyon, tide-pools, and sandstone corridors are not backdrop but loom—walls narrow to a heartbeat, moonlight bruises stone, orchid scent thickens air—each detail constrains Lira’s sleepwalking path and charges the final locket-seal of the labyrinth.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“mend the ruin of a drowned city”—is signaled early; pressure escalates via nightly returns and the spiral’s narrowing, culminating in the irrevocable trade of illustration plate for living stone boat; cost is visible in the vanished plate and sealed labyrinth.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of re-weaving broken precedents emerges through concrete acts: footsteps as shuttle, canyon as loom, illustration transmuted to vessel; the final orchid seed offers a resonant, non-moral answer to how ruin becomes reverence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise—“bruised velvet,” “orchid solace,” “salt cracks”—with rhythmic control that mirrors the weaving motion; no head-hopping, and the perceptual signature remains Lira’s throughout, tightening under dream-pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; occasional stacked metaphors (“lantern” mind, “nautilus” corridor) flirt with overwriting yet serve the accumulative design; no loops or scaffold, and the final cadence breathes cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The conceit of a canyon-labyrinth as living loom, and footsteps as weft, is fresh and inevitable in hindsight; risk-taking (sleepwalking as sewing, illustration transmuted to stone) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
