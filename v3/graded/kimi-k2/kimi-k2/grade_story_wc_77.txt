<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Protagonist’s contradictory impulses—hunger to outwit fear vs. dread of the cursed photo—are embodied in micro-choices (hand on Polaroid, lunging for the black mirror). The final renunciation of the frame is earned by prior causal chain; cost is the eternal advisor trapped in the clasp. Interiority is specific, never diagnostic. Only the advisor’s motives remain slightly abstract, preventing 9.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the protagonist refuses the looping exhibit, trapping the advisor instead. Causal lens holds: each beat (unbosoming, photo reversal, wolf swallowing dictionary) tightens options until the black mirror becomes the only exit. Cost is legible—“the wolf head once again biting its own tail, satisfied.” No orientation drift; disorientation is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Funhouse, mirrors, and the wolf clasp are not backdrop but active constraints: mirrors birth reflections that must be escaped; clasp devours the dictionary and later the advisor. Sensory detail is selective—emergency-strobe afterglow, cotton-candy rot—filtered through POV urgency. Spatial choreography is clean; the black mirror’s location is set up and paid off. Meets 9+ gate: setting charges final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—trick fear into revealing its weakness—is signaled in paragraph three and tightened when the protagonist must choose which reflection never dies. Escalation is causal: unbosoming → photo reversal → multiplying selves → black mirror exit. Visible cost: the advisor’s eternal imprisonment and the cracked mirrors that “fold like a mouth finally closing.” Agency drives every turn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the paradoxical notes rewritten into “Fear’s weakness is the witness who refuses the frame.” No moralizing; the final image of the funhouse sagging shut reweights the entire premise. Subtext lives in gesture—the wolf clasp’s satisfied bite, the Polaroid tucked between pages—rather than statement. Complexity lingers: fear is not vanquished but left to haunt itself.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is baroque yet controlled, modulating from velvet menace (“repulsive allure shimmering off him like heat above asphalt”) to crystalline finality. Perceptual signature is distinct: the narrator notices “bruise colors” and “cotton-candy rot.” No POV leakage; even the advisor’s speech is filtered through the protagonist’s dread. Rhythm accelerates under pressure without syntactic monotony.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence advances story or atmosphere. Figurative language is patterned and paid off—“lingering luminance” threads from first to last line. No loops or scaffold; no mixed metaphors. Minor register drift in “conceptual repricing” note is voice-motivated. Final image lands clean: “the lingering luminance of sunrise on broken bulbs.”</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—photo that shows a death not yet taken—feels inevitable in hindsight yet non-obvious. Tropes (cursed carnival, doppelgängers) are transformed through the dictionary’s paradoxical notes and the wolf-clasp devouring text. Risk-taking (recursive fear, meta-photography) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specificity anchors universals; story could not survive relocation.</comment>
