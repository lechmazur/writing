<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—guilt vs. the need to transform it—are embodied in every micro-choice (mercury into the crack, coin alignment). The final act of sealing the drop beside her heart earns the shift from burden to ballast with visible cost. Interiority stays concrete; no therapy-speak. One slip: “factually mystical” is a label, not lived experience.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the crucible seals, the name is spoken, the inheritance reweighted. Causal chain—Libra→Scorpio→Leo→Virgo—tracks the negotiation with limits under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is immediate; no teleporting props. Cost is legible in the single drop of alloyed regret.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Foundry’s cracked crucible, cooling anvil, and mercury puddles constrain every action; the furnace reignites only after the seam is gilded. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—Elara notices what matters to repair. Weather and architecture mirror internal fracture without overt symbolism. Micro-setting (crucible as locus) charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—redeem the name—tightens when each zodiac shift forecloses an easier absolution. Escalation is Accumulative: density of regret increases until the crucible becomes the only path. One credible loss: the mother’s absence is irreversible. No coincidence resolves; agency drives the final sealing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through kintsugi logic: fracture honored, not erased. The drop of gold-regret offers a non-literal answer to inherited guilt. Subtext in coin flips and constellation seams avoids moralizing. Final image reframes “redeem” as transformation, not erasure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise; syntax mirrors alchemist’s meticulous care. “Rain-washed,” “molten brass,” “luminous regret” are character-bound perceptions, not decorative. No POV drift. Compression (“silver puddles,” “teal glow”) teaches the pattern early and pays off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; every sentence layers action, image, and emotion. No loops or scaffold. Metaphors (mercury as “luminous regret”) stay coherent. Rhythm accelerates with furnace reignition. Minor register lift in “constellation bridge” but fits lyric mode.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: kintsugi alchemy + zodiac fate-coin + inherited guilt. Premise is specific; removing any element collapses the arc. Risk in lyric density pays off—closure remains legible. No derivative templates.</comment>
