<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Miren’s interior contradiction—ritual precision versus emotional need—drives every micro-choice; the filed key tag embodies her vow and forces tactile decisions. The final renunciation (letting the tag sink) costs her the tool that defined her nights, earned by the library’s revelation. No second character on page, so relationship crucible waived. Reflection stays within BRR limits and alters present tactics.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the unnamed color reweights all prior sound-hunting, and the cost is the surrendered key tag and her public unmasking. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each resonance adds density until the phonograph cylinder releases the final hue. Orientation anchored by line 3; no causality breaks. One transition (pier → library → pier) within contiguous window.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rotting planks, drowned hotel, breached dome, jellyfish light—every detail filters through Miren’s synesthetic quest and constrains movement (low tide grants access). The library’s phosphorescent shelves literally glow in the discovered color, charging the final image. Sensory economy favors touch and sound over visual catalog. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly down the barnacled staircase and back.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—discover the color of sound before last lantern dies—tightens when the lowest tide in years grants one-time access to the library. Agency: Miren cracks the phonograph case, releasing the hue that completes her vow at the cost of secrecy. No external antagonist; pressure is temporal and existential. One deepening beat suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from synesthetic grief: the drowned persist as audible color. No moralizing; the final sky painted with her mother’s lullaby reweights the premise without statement. Subtext in the filed key’s brass teeth and the sinking lantern. Complexity lingers—townsfolk may still call her mad, but the cost is now borne openly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise—“meteor hush,” “bruise-purple,” “silver so bright it left afterimages.” Compression taught early (“paper bloom drifting upward like a slow meteor hush”) and paid off in closure. No dialogue; internal monologue stays character-bound. Syntax mirrors synesthesia: color verbs for sound. No POV drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative language is patterned and purposeful—“sound the color of dawn seen through closed eyelids.” Rhythm modulates with pressure: longer clauses in discovery, clipped fragments at climax. No mixed metaphors. Clean grammar; pronouns anchored.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: synesthetic grief ritualized through lamplighting and drowned libraries. Key tag as tuning fork, phonograph cylinder as final hue—details irreplaceable. Risk in lyric non-linear structure pays off with coherent closure. No derivative echoes; the meteor hush motif is transformed from celebration to elegy.</comment>
