<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ivy’s contradictory impulses—skepticism vs. yearning to believe—are dramatized in the garden when she presses the tooth into the skeleton’s hand; the embodied cost is the widening “cleft in certainty.” Micro-choices (pocketing the tooth, humming the lullaby) reveal her hierarchy of values under pressure. The final renunciation—handing the opalescent tooth back—earns its poignancy through prior causal beats. Only a slight over-articulation of “turning mistakes into constellations” keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the skeleton dissolves into a new star-map, reweighting the premise with conceptual cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each image (tooth, garden, lullaby) layers density until the final shimmer. The Orientation Test is satisfied by line 3. One causal micro-turn—the tooth’s pulse—tightens stakes without breaking pattern.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The yew roots, surgical tweezers, and marble bench are not backdrop but tools that constrain choice. The garden’s dusk-lit roses and muffled maze acoustics charge the final image when vines uncoil in response to song. Spatial choreography is clean; the topiary griffin’s placement is precise. Only the “colors no nursery had ever catalogued” flirts with excess.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether guilt can be transmuted into guidance—tightens when Ivy must decide to return the tooth or keep it. The girl’s revelation escalates pressure under the Accumulative lens; the cost is the visible dissolution of the skeleton into light. No external antagonist is needed; internal stakes suffice. Slight deduction for off-stage origin of the “mistake.”</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the concrete act of bone-setting-as-forgiveness; no moral is stated. The final constellation reweights every prior misalignment without sermon. Subtext in the girl’s “shrewdly innocent” smile reframes borrowed existence as gift, not theft. The lullaby motif returns charged with new meaning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is Ivy’s perceptual signature—precise veterinary diction (“metatarsals,” “surgical steel”) braided with lyric compression. Syntax modulates under stress: short clauses during discovery, longer breaths in the garden. No head-hopping; free indirect style stays clean. Dialogue is sparse but carries subtext (“I left the body as a message”).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and stakes. No loops or scaffold; “the nostalgic scent of bruised roses” is earned. Metaphors are coherent—light knitting bone, star-map as forgiveness. Minor register drift in “conceptual repricing” phrase, but it lands within Ivy’s reflective beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The changeling premise is inverted: the replacement was meant to heal, not steal. Specificity of veterinary bone-setting as redemptive act feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk in blending forensic detail with fairy lore pays off without gimmickry. No close echoes; the star-map language is fresh.</comment>
