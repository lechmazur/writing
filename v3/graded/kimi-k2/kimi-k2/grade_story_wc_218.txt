<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is embodied in every gesture—fingers tracing wire, synchronizing heartbeat with sap—while her contradictory calm under mortality pressure is dramatized through micro-choices that rewire the living temple. The final renunciation (ashes into the circuitry) is earned and costly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the temple becomes her posthumous nervous system, the cost unmistakable in the moonflower tremor keyed to her last breath. Causal chain—diary → secrets → copper grafts → island sanctuary—holds without gaps.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Living stone pillars, copper-warmed stones, and the fossilized heartwood core are not backdrop but active constraints that shape every tactical decision; the final image of moonflowers as seismograph petals fuses setting and theme.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—transmit respect beyond her lifespan—tightens each month; the six-month clock converts abstract mortality into tangible urgency, culminating in the irreversible act of wiring her remains into the orchard’s circuitry.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through living architecture as covenant: “Respect is not taught but transmitted, like sap, like calcium, like song.” No moralizing; the blank diary page left for the next caretaker reweights the premise with quiet conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Lyric third-person limited sustains a hushed, tactile register—“gently systematic,” “brazen calm”—without head-hopping. Compression and patterned elision (“six months ago…”) are taught early and paid off in the final moonflower hush.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid: “calcium into load-bearing ribs until stone and tree became one breathing vault.” No loops, no mixed metaphors; rhythm modulates with sap-slow systole then final breath.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Transforms the eco-fantasy caretaker trope into a posthumous symbiosis; grafting copper to oak for seismic moonflowers is specific, non-obvious, and inevitable in hindsight. Risky quiet ending lands cleanly.</comment>
