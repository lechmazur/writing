<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Pilgrim’s interiority is embodied (boots humming, pulse doubling) and her micro-choice to press the pearl to the wall is causally rooted in her stated motive. Clairvoyant’s tear-fractured violet moment crystallizes his flaw and cost. Relationship crucible is minimal—only a sleeve-grab that fails—so relationship bullet not fully met. Earned stasis: both accept an open future, cost visible in the seer’s cracked voice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the cave exhales, ribs relax, and “ordinary and blunt” light returns—felt cost in the seer’s admission “I didn’t see this.” Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of song → heartbeat → plea tightens stakes without causal reversals. Orientation anchored by dusk arrival and cave entry within 120 words. No lens ambiguity at end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Musical crystal cave constrains every move—footsteps chime, walls become ribs, final chord lingers. Pearl and newborn crystal act as micro-setting objects that gate the transformation. Sensory hierarchy favors sound over sight, matching POV bias. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly: pearl rolls uphill, corridor of fire elongates. Environment directly shapes tactics and final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“magnify everyday magic”—is tested when darkness balances light. One decisive tightening: pearl sinks, void sings, futures collapse. Cost is felt in seer’s tears and pilgrim’s acceptance of unpredictable dawn. Agency lies in their joint song that re-opens futures. No external coincidence resolves conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete reversal: magic requires acknowledging darkness. Subtext in the pearl’s color shift and the seer’s cracked voice. Final image of dew reflecting both sunrise and violet reweights premise without moralizing. Resonant ambiguity: “promise to remain steadily unpredictable.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct lyric texture—chiming glass, bruised rainbows, grocery-list lullaby—remains consistent. POV distance stable; no head-hopping. Compression taught early (“boots still humming”) and paid off. Dialogue minimal but subtextual: nod that says “I already know.” Rhythm modulates with pressure—short clauses under stress, elongated flame image at climax.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density—“sound became mirror, mirror became gate.” Metaphors precise and consistent (cave as throat). Sentence rhythm mirrors heartbeat escalation. No register drift. Final line lingers with promise, not explanation. Only hairline slip: “bruised rainbows” edges purple, but context saves it.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: clairvoyant undone by an unforeseen pearl, magic redefined as balance with darkness. Cave song evolving into heartbeat feels inevitable yet new. Risk in lyric abstraction pays off through embodied stakes. No close echoes; transformation test passed—plot fails if names or setting swapped.</comment>
