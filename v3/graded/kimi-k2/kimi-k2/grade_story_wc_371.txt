<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical and specific; the noticer’s catalogue of vanishings grounds her vigilance. Emotional cost is embodied—“her spine rigid”—while contradiction surfaces in her wish to uncloak. Renunciation is enacted through planting; the cost of letting memory dilute into seed is palpable. Dialogue convergences are minimal and voice stays coherent; no label-speak intrudes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens teaches pattern early (small disappearances) and crystallizes into a final image (shoot pushing frost). Causal links are muted—absolution grown like mint—but a Resonant Reconfiguration lands when bread becomes soil and memory migrates to green. Cost is felt through relinquishing vigilance. One transition (bread to planting) is cleanly managed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Broken palace, moss swallows marble, lantern-lit wisteria doorway—details filter through the noticer’s eye and guide movement. The courtyard rectangle of darker stone is used as actual planting bed, not postcard. Spatial choreography—silence on moss, kneeling—remains coherent. Minor late appearance (-0.1) but element shapes final act.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can relinquish vigilant remembrance without betraying loss—is signaled within 150 words. Pressure deepens once when bread becomes sacrament and seed replaces guard. No antagonist needed; “time” is coherent pressure. Tightening forecloses perpetual surveillance with visible cost—knees in dirt, dirt under nails. Closure drives the choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>“Ordinary things made sacred by loss” emerges from seeds, dirt, and steam rather than statement. Repricing occurs when the holy is relocated to “hands that passed bread” and to the pale shoot itself. Final image—the green spear in stone—answers unvoiced question about absolution. Ambiguity is purposeful and resonant.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature—“creeping normality noticer” reads unique and apt. Syntax modulates for mood—long lyrical catalogues collapse into terse commands “Plant.” Free-indirect stance is coherent; no head-hop. Filter verbs low; diction consistent. Minor elevated phrase (-0.1) “heuristically gentle” slightly above POV register but single instance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Rhythmic control—sentence lengths breathe with emotional need. Dense metaphor is selective—wisteria, frost, teeth—never stacked at high-intensity beats. Near-duplicate phrase “absolution tenuous as steam / absolution risen from soil”—0.2 paraphrase loop. Elsewhere, information is lean and propulsive: “baptizing the ground with what was left.”</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: a post-apocalyptic restorationist whose weapon is horticultural mercy. Not a trope list but organic arc. Final image (mint-line requote) feels inevitable yet specific. Minor derivative whiff (-0.2) of eco-healing genre, but treatment is singular and grounded.</comment>
