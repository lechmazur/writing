<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her boots soft on planks, the dial burning into skin—yet her contradictory impulses (clinging to certainty vs. embracing deception) crystallize only in the final mirror scene. The paper-rope micro-choice and the cutting of the tether earn the renunciation with felt cost. Earlier beats lean on evocative summary rather than dramatized struggle, keeping the score shy of 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the canal folds, mirrors collapse, and forward-pointing shadow reweights every prior lie. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of spirals, maps, and reflections tightening until the hatch opens. One causal link is soft: how the dial’s heat brands understanding is asserted rather than shown, a hairline slip.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The twilight canal, lantern flame, and paper maps function as micro-settings that constrain movement and meaning; the water’s skin tension literally supports Elara’s final steps. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered (“moonlight lick the gnomon”). A single spatial hiccup: the hatch of black glass appears with no prior cue, slightly undercutting coherence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—map lies to find the cartographer—tightens through spiral alignment and paper-rope tether; each beat raises the cost of self-deception. The decisive turn (cutting the rope) narrows options irrevocably. Pressure is mostly internal; external stakes remain abstract, capping the score below 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: false coastlines, mirrored ages, and the final forward shadow reweight the premise without sermon. The cartographer’s silent dictum is subtext delivered through image, not lecture. One near-theme echo—“every map is a promise waiting to be broken”—lands in the final clause but feels earned by prior pattern.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with rhythmic control (“serene upheaval of half-light and half-truth”). Perceptual signature is consistent: Elara notices absence (no birds), texture (salt-smell of paper), and temperature (dial burning). No POV leakage or register drift. Compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; figurative language is selective and purposeful (“moonlight fractured beneath her”). No loops or scaffold. One mixed metaphor—“architecture of lies she could almost sketch”—is minor and does not cloud the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The premise—mapping lies as cartography—feels fresh and inevitable. Transformation test: names and places could not be swapped without breaking the spiral logic. Risky lyric structure is fully integrated; no gimmickry. A faint echo of Borges’ cartographers is transmuted through embodied cost.</comment>
