<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elowen’s interior contradiction—archiving emotion while deaf to the living city—is embodied in her micro-choice to whisper a new oath; the cost is the cracked cylinder and her renunciation of passive listening. The flaw (antiquarian deafness) compounds until it forces the climactic reciprocity. One slip: the “velvet disquiet” label edges toward diagnostic speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the orchard’s Charged Poise after Elowen’s spoken oath reweights the premise—listening must be reciprocal. Causal linkage holds: broken promise → horns stop → Elowen’s choice → horns will resume. Cost is legible in the cracked cylinder and her renunciation of archival distance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The rooftop orchard, brass ear-trumpet, and wax shavings constrain every move; the miniature skyline formed from wax recharges the final image. Spatial anchors arrive by line 3; no orientation debt. Sensory hierarchy is POV-bound and purposeful.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore the city’s pulse by reviving forgotten reciprocity—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening: the accidental prophecy forces Elowen from passive archiving to active oath. Cost is the irreversible crack of the cylinder and her relinquished detachment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: memory and listening are mutual obligations. The final image of blossoms rising against gravity offers a non-literal, resonant answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in the orchard’s dictation and the wax skyline.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct lyric texture—wind-stunted apple trees, “pale lanterns,” “velvet disquiet”—remains consistent under pressure. POV is stable single-camera; no head-hop. Compression and elision are taught early and paid off in the reversed-gravity closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image, action, and theme. No loops or scaffold. One mixed metaphor risk—“scrap of dried blood” for wax—passes because it’s filtered through Elowen’s antiquarian sensibility.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses skyscraper orchard, oath-keeping trees, and phonograph necromancy into an inevitable whole. The reversal—archivist must speak, not just record—feels fresh and earned. Risky lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
