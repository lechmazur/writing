<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara’s contradictory impulses—seeking death yet staying to listen—are embodied in micro-choices (offering the parasol, trawling darkness). The final renunciation to “stay and listen” is earned by prior causal chain and carries visible cost: she shoulders the labor of endless storms. Interiority is concrete, e.g., “fold in patience…inside her ribs.”</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Mara’s stance crystallizes into endurance, cost paid by accepting perpetual disaster relief. Causal lens holds: each beat (storm, refugee arrival, parasol exchange) tightens her options toward this renunciation. Orientation is anchored by ~120 words; no teleporting props.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Drift-ice marina is not backdrop but active pressure: floes batter pilings, dictate labor, and shape the final image of “temporary continents.” Micro-setting of the parasol tip constrains choice—used as net and compass. Sensory selection (salt, diesel, hush of glaciers) is filtered through Mara’s slowed pulse and grief.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to meet endings—is signaled early and tightened once: from seeking her own death to accepting the labor of witnessing others’. The storm’s arrival and the old woman’s directive force a single decisive stance crystallization. Cost is visible: perpetual, unchosen service.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of endings as companions, not destinations, emerges through concrete events (trawling droplets that sing of deaths) rather than statement. Final image of lace shadows across snow offers non-literal, resonant answer. Subtext in silence and gesture (parasol as baton) avoids moralizing.</comment>

<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise: “drift-ice marina creaked like an old accordion” marries sound and setting. Perceptual signature—Mara’s slowed pulse, glacier hush—remains consistent. No head-hopping; free indirect style is clean. Compression (“folded her patience once more”) is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and propulsive: “droplets sang—tiny, perfect notes of hulls cracking.” No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances stakes or atmosphere. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent. Strong verbs and sensory nouns replace modifiers.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: euthanasia tourism meets disaster relief as apprenticeship in listening to endings. Parasol tip as net for sonic death-drops is non-obvious yet inevitable. Risky lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Transformation test fails if names/places swapped—details are irreducibly specific.</comment>
