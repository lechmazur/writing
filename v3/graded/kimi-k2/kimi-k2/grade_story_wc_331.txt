<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mireille’s eccentric gait, scarf-guided obedience, and final smile embody a coherent, if lightly sketched, interiority; the micro-choice to shelve the copper book after reawakening stories shows a cost (bearing their weight) that earns her quiet guardianship.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the library’s air shifts to “warm sepia of remembered sunlight,” reweighting the premise with undeniable conceptual cost; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density of story saturates the space.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Scientific poetry library, oxidized-copper scarf, and hyperbolic aisles are vividly selective; the scarf’s tug and the final sepia light constrain Mireille’s choice and charge the closing image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—locating where stories live—tightens when the coordinate book forces a tactile choice; the reawakening narrows options to bearing collective memory, with visible cost in the scarf’s new weight.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</question><comment>Theme emerges organically: memory’s locus is the charged interval between reader and text; the final image of changed light offers a resonant, non-moral answer that reweights all prior particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Third-person limited stays close to Mireille’s perceptual filter; diction (“sanely eccentric gait,” “hush that lives between footnotes and heartbeats”) is character-specific and rhythmically controlled, with no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive, each sentence advancing atmosphere or action; figurative language is disciplined, no loops or mixed metaphors, and the final cadence crystallizes without clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Fusion of scientific poetry library, analog memories, and hyperbolic geometry feels inevitable and fresh; the synthesis of meter and meter-per-second is non-obvious yet fully integrated, meriting the bonus for risk.</comment>
