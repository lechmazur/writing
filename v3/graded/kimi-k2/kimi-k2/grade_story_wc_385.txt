<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is richly textured and embodied; the grief-tuned “antenna” conceit is character-specific. The final choice—to preserve rather than silence the echoes—carries visible cost in the stranger’s dissolution and the singer’s solitude. Motivation remains consistent yet deepens through progressive disclosure. Only the stranger’s late arrival keeps it from 9+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the shell fused into stone becomes the earth’s new mouth, reweighting the premise with undeniable conceptual cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each sung layer thickens pattern until the final cadence crystallizes meaning. No causality breaks; orientation is immediate.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The serpentine nexus and starlight are not backdrop but active constraint: the fossilized river’s spiral literally channels sound into the planet’s core, shaping the singer’s tactics. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered; the shell’s warmth against the collarbone functions as micro-setting that charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“why do some echo?”—is signaled early and tightened through each sung disclosure. The final choice to perpetuate the echoes forecloses the option of silence, exacting the stranger’s dissolution as visible price. Escalation is one sustained crescendo under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the singer’s embodied grief and cosmic listening; no moralizing. The closing image—“memory, once spoken, refuses to be still”—offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights every prior echo. Complexity is honored; ambiguity lingers without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with a perceptual signature tuned to sonic texture and cosmic scale. Syntax modulates with emotional intensity; patterned elision (“webs of intrigue,” “fossilized riverbeds”) is taught early and paid off. No head-hopping; POV remains tightly anchored.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is disciplined, never overwrought. Each sentence layers image and idea without redundancy. Minor filter-verb clusters (“she felt”) appear but do not stall momentum or cloud closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The grief-as-antenna conceit feels inevitable and fresh; cosmic lullabies and cartographers of sorrow transform familiar tropes. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The synthesis is singular and memorable.</comment>
