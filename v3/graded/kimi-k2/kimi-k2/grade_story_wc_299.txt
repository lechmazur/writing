<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elliot’s interiority is textured and embodied—gut twisting, cloth pressed to chest—but “confidently uncertain” is declared rather than dramatized. The final micro-choice (cloth in pocket, search for singer’s sister) is earned, carries visible cost, and grows from prior grief.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the cloth’s reweighted meaning is the closure unit: “question, not relic.” Because/therefore chain runs from Omaha show tear → grief storage → plan to return the cloth. Causality holds without leaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The quarry, trailer, and cloth function as micro-setting that narrows choice. Smells of “diesel and old coffee” anchor place and mood; the cloth’s rough texture at the climax charges the final choice. Setting subtly constrains and costs—cold night air prompts exit.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—what to do with silence—is signaled early. Rising pressure occurs via pattern breaks: facts insulating grief falter against sensory memory, narrowing options to the final decision. Cost is concrete—giving away the last fragment of the tour.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: a shred of grille cloth becomes the locus of refusal to keep grieving alone. Final image reframes silence not as absence but as “waiting,” a resonant non-literary answer that avoids summary moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is rich, road-seasoned, and rhythmically controlled. Free-indirect lyric and roadie argot remain consistent; sensory selectivity (“smell of sweat and smoke still trapped”) is POV-specific. The pattern of musical metaphors (bassline, feedback) is taught early and repurposed in closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Line craft is dense yet clear without scaffolding. Occasional mild overwrought imagery (“yawned like a wound”) is earned by context; no synonym loops or clarity breaks near the final beat. Rhythm breathes appropriately.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The “what to do with silence after the song ends” angle feels fresh and specific; the ex-roadie holding a scrap of speaker cloth never tilts into tour-recipe clichés. The risk in quiet ending lands without gimmickry.</comment>
