<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mirror maker’s interiority is vivid—her deliberate breaths, the warmth of brass on her lips—but the “why dreams flee” question is stated more than dramatized; the final renunciation feels earned yet slightly abstract, lacking a concrete cost on her body or craft.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the sextant’s transformation into a soul-compass and the orchard’s shift from ruin to living grove create a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost—she must abandon trapping mirrors. Accumulative/Textural lens holds; each breath adds density until the final cadence shift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Glass mountains, fog, and crystalline leaves are not backdrop; they chime in sync with breath, constrain movement, and finally melt into starlight that recharges the sextant. Micro-setting (the velvet bundle, the brass arc) functions as tactile anchor and catalyst.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“recreate the boundary without cages”—tightens through each synchronized breath; the moth’s descent marks the decisive micro-turn. Cost is visible: she forfeits her prior craft identity when the orchard re-blooms and the sextant re-measures souls.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of boundaries as bridges emerges from the sextant’s re-constellation and the moth’s voluntary return; no moralizing, only the final image of “doors that welcomed them” reweights the premise with quiet conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Lyric third-person limited stays close to the mirror maker’s perceptual rhythm; breath-linked imagery and glass-chime acoustics create a distinct texture. No head-hopping; diction remains within her craft lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid—“petrified into glass mountains that chimed,” “fracture flowering into new measurements.” No loops or mixed metaphors; sentence rhythm modulates with inhalations/exhalations, accelerating toward the zero-distance reading.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Familiar quest for a runaway dream is re-visioned through mirror-craft cosmology and breathing-as-geometry; the sextant’s shift from star-measurer to soul-compass feels inevitable yet fresh. Risky lyric compression pays off in the final zero-distance image.</comment>
