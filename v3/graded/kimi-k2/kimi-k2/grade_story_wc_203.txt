<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mara’s interior contradiction—skepticism vs. compulsion—plays out in embodied micro-choices (tracing dust, pressing warm ceiling). Her final renunciation of the elevator trade is earned by the grandfather-haunted stakes and the visible cost of leaving the mainspring behind.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the ceiling reveals time compressed, the barrel is locked in place, and Mara steps into a new life. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each dust pattern and mirror reflection layers density until the final image reweights everything with felt lightness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The abandoned ticket office is more than backdrop; its warped counter, frost-writing, and mirror-shaft actively constrain Mara’s movements and supply the tools (plaster crack, mainspring cavity) that enable the climax. The setting’s sensory decay mirrors her internal thaw.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“what ceilings hide”—tightens when the ghosts’ pointing forces Mara to choose between safe ignorance and irreversible knowledge. The cost is legible: she forfeits her trade and identity, walking out under a sky that is now her next shaft.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the tension between surfaces and what they conceal; cracks become doorways, façades become thresholds. The final calliope note—grandfather’s laugh—offers a non-moral, resonant answer: revelation is both loss and liberation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is tactile, precise, and haunted: “dust obeyed gravity but remembered every disturbance.” Syntax tightens under pressure, and perceptual signature remains consistent—no head-hopping, no register drift. The lyric compression is taught early and paid off in the charged poise of the ending.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is propulsive and dense: every image does double duty (“applause still suspended”). No loops, no scaffold, no mixed metaphors. Rhythm accelerates with the mirrors’ ripple and exhales with the single calliope note.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The elevator-ghost-seer conceit is transformed through occupational specificity and the circus mirror-shaft of time. The mainspring-as-heartbeat is a fresh synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
