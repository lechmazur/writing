<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael’s permeability arc is embodied in the heart-sync moment; the final vow carries earned cost. Interiority is vivid, but the “second sun” cliché and one stock phrase (“quietly explosive”) keep it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Kael’s stance crystallizes in the spoken vow with visible cost—he now bears every borrowed story. Accumulative/Textural lens holds; each hue beat tightens the pattern toward the final lattice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Floating rock, wing-glass, and valley mist constrain every move; the tea-house lanterns and condensed-memory staircase charge the final image. One spatial hiccup—“valley mist wonder thickened” reads as filler—prevents 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—how to magnetize stories—tightens through each sun-trail hue; the spiral descent forces stance crystallization. Cost is legible when the wing crumbles and Kael accepts perpetual permeability.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme of resonance-over-attraction emerges organically from Lira’s hues and Kael’s final vow. No moralizing; the closing sentence reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Distinct lyric texture sustained; perceptual signature filters every image through Kael’s chromatic lens. One register drift—“bruised indigo that tasted of regret”—is earned by synesthetic POV.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; no loops or scaffold. Metaphors are precise except for the lone “second sun.” Rhythm modulates with pressure; final cadence crystallizes without clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: dye craft + donor heart + butterfly wing as story-compass. Risky lyric structure pays off in closure; premise would collapse if any element swapped.</comment>
