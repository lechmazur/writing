<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lin’s interior contradictions—the professional linguist versus the guilty sister—are embodied through tactile ritual (coral pressed to cast) and her micro-choice to offer the fragment to the doctor; the moment stakes “I’m translating you back to the tide” as earned renunciation with visible cost in her open palm.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>A strict situational lens holds: coherent hospital pressure forces stance crystallization; no coincidences resolve but they complicate. Closure lands in the doctor’s “but the arm will remember the break” and Lin’s acceptance, a resonant reconfiguration that reweights the coral ritual with a felt, bodily cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>“Iodine and orchids” anchors hospital-tropic twilight immediately; the chalky dead coral and the gecko-breath hush act as micro-setting tools that constrain choice when she uses them to graft meaning onto the cast and later the ward garden.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—sisterly guilt fused with linguistic duty—tightens once: decoding the pulse-cipher forces her to confront shared war fear and hand the coral future to children; the spiral of words raises the cost of retreat exactly under the situational lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without labels: fragments (reef, cast, words) signal that salvaged ruins can still house life; the non-literal final image of “palimpsest coral garden” reweights trauma into salvage rather than redemption, leaving charged ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is sensory-acrid, orchid-iodine, clipped and tidal; Lin’s perceptual signature filters everything through translation (“grammar of pleas”) without once slipping out of her cognition. Rhythmic control under stress: short surgical hush, then long salt tide exhalation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Zero loops; metaphors specific and physical—“stomach fold like wet paper,” “ghost reef on plaster.” Information dense: one sentence carries smell, temperature, memory. Rhythm varies from urgent triads to the final slow tidal cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Transformative use of reef-bleaching as memory prosthesis feels inevitable; neither hospital vigil nor cipher-on-cast appears in standard templates, and the coral’s final non-coral fate offers a fresh reanimation rather than eco-parable.</comment>
