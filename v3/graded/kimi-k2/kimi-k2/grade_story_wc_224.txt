<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical and embodied, but the seer's contradictory impulses (to forget vs to speak) are asserted rather than dramatized in real time; the final choice to speak the language feels inevitable yet the cost is more stated than felt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the mountain re-shapes into her childhood home when she speaks the first word, with visible conceptual cost (resurrecting the forgotten). Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern is taught early and held.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mountain-bookstore is vividly textured and spatially coherent; the petrified-tongue tree and mercury skin act as micro-settings that constrain her final choice. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recovering the lost language—tightens once when the stone pulses harder and she chooses to speak. Agency is clear, cost is legible, but escalation is more atmospheric than causal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: home as language, memory as architecture. Subtext operates through image (feather, mercury, tree) rather than statement; final reconfiguration carries conceptual weight without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is lush, rhythmic, and consistent; perceptual signature is strong (mercury skin, crystallized ink). No head-hopping; lyric compression is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; occasional stacked metaphors verge on overwriting yet serve the accumulative design. No loops or scaffolds; minor register drift in “substitutes reality nightly” line.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fantasy premise is familiar (lost language, living library) but transformed through specific sensory logic and the mercury-glass seer’s embodied gift. Synthesis feels inevitable; risk-taking (mountain as memory) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
