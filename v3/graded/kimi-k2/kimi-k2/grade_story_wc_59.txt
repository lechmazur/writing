<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Halric’s contradictory impulses—clinging to the egg yet choosing to leap—are embodied in tactile micro-choices (pressing the shell to his ribs, stepping to the window). The final renunciation is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: the palace falls, his wings burn. Interiority is specific and character-bound; no stock phrasing. Flaws (naïve faith in artificers, grief paralysis) complicate the climax without tidy redemption.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Halric’s leap reweights the premise—beauty must be chosen, not commanded—at undeniable cost (palace destroyed, body transformed). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each object (music box, rain, feather) layers density until the final cadence shift. Orientation is anchored by line 2; no causality breaks. Persistent constraint: the failing stalactites shape every tactic.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The suspended palace and its moaning stalactites constrain every choice; their collapse forces the decisive leap. Micro-setting (mirrored brass table, frost-rimed window) is filtered through Halric’s grief and guides assembly of the relics. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—copper vines, oil perfume—mirroring inner desolation. Final image of waterfall singing laughter recharges the setting with earned resonance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reawaken beauty or perish with the palace—is signaled early and tightens as each stalactite cracks. One meaningful deepening: Halric realizes preservation kills choice, forcing the leap. Escalation is accumulative: each relic added raises emotional cost until the final transformation. Agency drives every turn; coincidence only complicates (anchors fail), never resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically from Halric’s choices: beauty dies when trapped by function. Subtext lives in gesture—pressing the glowing bird to his heart speaks louder than any thesis. Final image (waterfall of laughter) offers non-literal, resonant answer without moralizing. No thematic drift; every object reweights the central question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; perceptual signature filters every detail through Halric’s grief-struck wonder. Syntax modulates with pressure—long, breath-held sentences collapse into the leap’s short sparks. No head-hopping; POV distance remains intimate. Compression (“quaking reverie”) is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence advances image or stakes. Metaphors are fresh and coherent—“crystal spires anchored to three black stalactites that moaned”—no mixed vehicles. Zero loops or scaffold; no filter-verb stacks. Final cadence shift is clean and earned.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise of a palace hanging from grieving stalactites is non-obvious and fully committed. Tropes (lost prince, last egg) are transformed through specific emotional stakes and tactile detail. Risky lyric structure heightens resonance without obscuring causality. Transformation test: story fails if relocated; specificity is irreplicable.</comment>
