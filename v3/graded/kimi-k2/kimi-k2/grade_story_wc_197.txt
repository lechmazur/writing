<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her stillness under drones, the warmth of the key, the ember-banked fire—but the boy with pamphlets remains a missed crucible; no relationship pressure alters her stance. Motivation is clear and consistent, yet the final renunciation (letting the boy go) is under-dramatized, softening the cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each salvaged fragment layers density until the broadcast reweights memory itself. Closure is a Charged Poise—the lagoon erases footprints but not ripples—cost is felt in the lone vigil she embraces. Orientation is swift; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The auric lagoon’s mineral current literally carries the broadcast, making setting an active agent. Micro-details—starred glass, gravel remembering rails—are selective and POV-filtered, charging the final image of reflected muted voices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—holding the line against forgetting—is signaled early and tightened by each salvaged relic. The broadcast is the decisive act that forecloses stealth; cost is the perpetual return alone. Pressure escalates via accumulative texture rather than causal turns, fitting the lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of memory vs. erasure emerges organically from salvaged bus tickets and redacted cafés; no explicit moralizing. The final image of the lagoon reflecting “every voice they tried to mute” offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights all prior fragments.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded: “molten gold,” “drunk sentinel,” “slow famine of memory” all arise from Lira’s perceptual bias. Syntax modulates with tension—long cadences in reflection, clipped beats under drones. No head-hopping; compression is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; each sentence layers texture without redundancy. Metaphors are precise and internally consistent. No loops or scaffold; rhythm breathes with scene needs. Only hairline slip: “ledger of permitted stars” edges toward poetic excess yet fits voice.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Familiar dystopia is re-visioned through tactile salvage and mineral-rich water as clandestine medium. The phone-booth key, tramline ghosts, and lagoon broadcast synthesize into a singular, inevitable system. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
