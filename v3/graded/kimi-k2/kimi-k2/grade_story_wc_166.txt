<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lysandra’s interior contradiction—yearning to dance against the law yet feeling the garden’s root in her heart—is embodied in every arabesque and palm-to-marble beat; the moonstone’s dissolution into bloodstream constellations dramatizes the cost of claiming memory. Her final “Remember” carved in starlight seals an earned stasis: exile becomes studio, with visible forfeiture of anonymity. No secondary character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A; single-POV interiority stays specific and sensorily grounded.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the garden’s fountains spill liquid starlight, reconfiguring exile into creative agency. Causality is Accumulative/Textural—each dance beat folds memory into stone until the verse stitches flesh to marble. The moonstone’s dissolution supplies felt cost. Orientation is clear by line 3; no lens ambiguity at end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The twilight garden’s obsidian benches, cracked pool, and black roses constrain Lysandra’s choices—she teaches the garden to remember by tracing its fractures. Micro-setting (her skin as scroll) charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and urgent; scent of “forgotten lullaby” and starlight pooling at ankles guide the climactic motion.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—reclaim memory under ban—tightens through each forbidden arabesque; the spontaneous anchor (garden’s root) raises cost. Escalation is Accumulative: tide swell, rune fledge, starlight release. No coincidence resolves; final choice forecloses return to city anonymity.</comment>

<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of memory’s survival through embodied art emerges from Lysandra’s dance and the garden’s reciprocal awakening. Subtext in “obsidian grace” and “quiet choreography” reframes law vs. art without moralizing. Final image of skin as cosmic scroll offers non-literal answer: memory migrates from forbidden song to inscribed body.</comment>

<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise—“tide inside her rise and fall with remembered surf”—maintaining perceptual signature of a dancer who reads soil like braille. Syntax modulates with emotional swell; no head-hopping. Experimental compression (“she began to fledge / Not with feathers, but with lines”) is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; each sentence layers image and motion. Metaphors stay coherent—tide, stone, starlight form a single texture. No loops or scaffold; occasional elevated diction (“cabochon”) is POV-justified. Final third remains artifact-free.</comment>

<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Familiar dystopia of memory-ban is transformed through dancer’s corporeal inscription and garden’s mineral memory. Fresh synthesis: exile as studio, nostalgia metabolized into starlight verse. Risky lyric mode heightens stakes without clarity loss.</comment>
