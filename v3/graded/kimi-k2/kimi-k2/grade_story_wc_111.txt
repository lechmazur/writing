<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority is concrete—scars, chlorophyll stains, the feel of each marble—and her choices (left fork, circle of marbles, burying the split one) all trace back to her memories and vocation. The queen’s presence supplies external pressure that forces Lira to act, and the final renunciation (leaving the split marble) carries visible cost. Only the queen’s shift from scoff to tears feels slightly compressed, keeping this just under 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the garden’s spontaneous bloom reweights the premise that “gardens know their gardeners,” and the cracked device screen mirrors the marble’s fracture—felt cost on the page. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each marble’s story layers density until the final cadence shift. Orientation is clear by line 3; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The garden maze is tactile—dew on iron, bindweed swallowing a sundial—and every detail (wisteria petals, probability glyphs) constrains choice or charges the final image. The bench, the split marble buried in soil, and the vine that later grows into a woman cradling a child all function as micro-settings that crystallize the ending. Only the off-stage “years later” vignette slightly dilutes immediacy.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—prove the garden is not “statistically indifferent”—tightens when the queen’s device falls silent and the wisteria stirs. Lira’s agency (storytelling, burying the marble) drives the decisive intensification; coincidence (petal falling) complicates but does not resolve. Cost is legible: the split marble remains buried, a permanent deception.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the tension between measurable luck and lived memory; the garden’s “accounts” reprice the queen’s faith in numbers without a sermon. The final image of the vine-woman and fresh marbles offers a resonant, non-literal answer: “everything remembers.” No thematic drift or meta-commentary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise—“blooming withering,” “petals falling like purple snow”—and stays rooted in Lira’s perceptual bias. Syntax modulates with emotional pressure; no head-hopping or register drift. Dialogue is sparse but subtextual (“I walk at the speed of remembering”).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; every sentence advances image or stakes. Metaphors are fresh (“dew like hesitant stars”) and internally coherent. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors in peak beats. Minor flourish (“pale regrets”) stays within voice.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The fusion of probability glyphs with memory-laden marbles feels genuinely new; the vine-woman statue grows organically from the split marble’s lie. Risky lyric compression pays off in the final cadence. No close echoes of familiar scenes.</comment>
