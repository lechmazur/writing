<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s interior contradiction—sealer of vaults vs. dissolver of walls—is embodied in the warming pearl and etched confessions; the final abdication carries visible cost as she steps barefoot into grass, crownless. Interiority stays concrete, but the “reluctant monarch of silence” phrase edges toward label-speak, blunting the peak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the luminous lattice dissolves bunkers and crowns alike, cost paid in the relinquished armor of forgetting. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each confession layers density until the cavern becomes a shared ventricle—without causal gaps. Orientation is swift and functional.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Crystal caves constrain the ritual (shell placement, pearl activation) and charge the final image as translucent walls reveal distant silhouettes. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered; “quartz veins pulsing blue” mirrors internal stakes. Micro-setting (seashell, pearl) doubles as setting-object, meeting 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—dissolve walls between hearts—tightens via each etched confession that raises the pearl’s glow and forecloses the option of continued forgetting. Agency is Mara’s; cost is the abdication of her bunker-inspector identity. One meaningful intensification suffices under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the accretion of confessed regrets into shared radiance; no explicit moralizing. Final image of stars spilling through dissolved ceilings reweights the premise with conceptual cost: survival now requires remembering how to love. Subtext operates in shells’ whispers and pearl’s glow.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet controlled; perceptual signature distinct in “heartbeat of a hesitation between war and surrender.” Patterned elision (no Geiger wand, unseen tides) is taught early and paid off. Rhythm modulates with pressure—short etched confessions against longer luminous crescendo—without head-hop.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language serves pattern, not excess. Minor scaffold in “crystal caves sang with resonant hush” / “resonant hush now inside her chest” recurs with reweighted meaning, forgiven as closure linkage. No mixed metaphors or loops in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: bunker inspector as reluctant monarch of silence, confessions etched in seashells, pearl grown from abandoned hopes. Risky lyric structure pays off in luminous closure. Specificity anchors universals; no template echo. Transformation test passes—plot fails if any element swapped.</comment>
