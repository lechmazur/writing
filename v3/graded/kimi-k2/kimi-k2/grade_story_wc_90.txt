<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lin’s pacifism is embodied in every micro-choice—peeling photos gently, stitching with salvaged thread—yet the interior contradiction between mercy and necessary sacrifice is dramatized only once, when she offers the tear. The final renunciation is earned and costly, but the emotional layering could be sharper under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the corridor seals behind her, gravity returns, and the lanterns settle into the walls—an earned stasis that reweights the ship’s future. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout; each photograph added to the tapestry increases density until the tear dissolves and the garden blooms.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The recycled hull, chapel of aluminum, and bioluminescent garden are vivid, selective, and purposeful; the ship’s decay constrains every action and the final garden recharges the stakes. Spatial choreography is clean, and the micro-setting of the airlock sigil directly shapes the decisive beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—unlocking the dimension sealed by unacknowledged grief—is signaled early and tightened through each stitched photograph. The final choice to dissolve the tear forecloses any return to the old silence; the cost is the irreversible loss of the relic and the irrevocable opening of the ship to unknown growth.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically from Lin’s pacifist ethic and the ship’s recycled grief; the garden grown on weapon-bones offers a non-literal answer to the cost of mercy. No moralizing statement intrudes—the final image of seeds drifting across the threshold reweights the premise without exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The lyric, compressed voice is consistent and character-specific; sensory detail is filtered through Lin’s reverent attention. Echo’s whispered lines carry subtext, and the rhythmic control under pressure is evident in the accelerating cadence as the tear flares and the door opens.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet clear; figurative language is purposeful and never muddles causality. No loops or scaffold sentences appear, and the final image—“a garden of bioluminescent moss growing on the bones of old weapons”—lands with crystalline precision.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of Buddhist pacifism, recycled-generation starship, and grief-as-gravity feels inevitable and fresh. The transformation of weapon bones into a living garden is a specific, non-obvious payoff that could not be transplanted to another setting without collapse.</comment>
