<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The net-mender philosopher’s quiet rebellion against decay is compelling, but her interior monologue drifts from concrete action into lyric abstraction in key beats; a sharper micro-choice under pressure would lock her arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>A coherent causal chain links each beat—whisk setup, firefly pull, firefly payoff—yet the rhythm of escalation plateaus for two long paragraphs before tightening again; one tightening rhythm shift is enough. Closure is an earned stasis that carries cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Black-water harbor mist, teal-glint whisk shadow, firefly constellations become tactile constraints of care; each object constrains motion and refines next action, culminating in moon path reprise that articulates cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—proving that maintenance defies decay—tightens as the final firefly constellation renders visible the trade-off: lose the bubble of private vigil or gamble public re-weaving of nets. Agency is crystallized through whistle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme crystallizes through iterative mending gestures reframed by moon paths; the ending image of a gift whisk repays earlier quiet rebellion with sober acknowledgment of collective labor and future storms.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Demure audacity modulates from soft footfall to firefly constellation conducting; third-person lyric voice never head-hops, tone escalates with each whistled note, diction stays realistically within her lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Rhythmic compression lends propulsion—“lattice shadow crossing moonlit moss” compresses image and stakes in one stroke; minimal jargon, no repetition loops, clear momentum under lyric pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Accumulative lyric structure reframes familiar repair + maritime + philosophical tropes; return of dolphin whistle—now teaching guides—feels inevitable and fresh.</comment>
