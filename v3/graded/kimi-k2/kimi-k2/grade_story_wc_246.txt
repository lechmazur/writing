<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The interpreter’s contempt for certainty and reflexive edits reveal charged contradiction in scene; her renunciation of the pen and the act of witness anchor a credible endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Pattern-taught elisions save word-count; cause-and-effect chaining of edits tightens stakes toward the gravitational heartbeat; final “They remembered… as witness” lands decisive change with resonant reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Planet-skin, anomaly, and drifting pen act as body-as-setting; spatial choreography tracks cleanly; the anomaly constrains edits and supplies inverted water physics for the closure beat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Each revision tightens timelines under causal lens; mercy collapses into justice, death counts fall, and grief widens—cost is legible; no coincidence in resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>“Meaning is watered” and the fossilized pen refute absolutes; complexity insists mercy may be prettier cruelty while withholding tidy moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature of cosmic bureaucracy in clipped lyric fragments; confidently uncertain voice persists; no head-hop even during anomaly lullaby.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Sentence-level propulsion accelerates through pressure; negligible loops; metaphors feel inevitable and paid off in the closing spiral.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>“History as a garden of cautious seedlings” and “gravity remembering her weight” offer fresh synthesis; risk of negative gravity shows controlled risk.</question>
