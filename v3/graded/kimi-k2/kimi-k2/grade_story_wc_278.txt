<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The tattooist’s guilt is embodied in the looping cry and the amber pulse; her choice to tattoo her throat is a credible, costly renunciation. Interiority is concrete (“guilt shrink to the size of a freckle”), though a touch of diagnostic self-awareness creeps in. Motivation stays consistent, and the final quieting of the cry feels earned by prior causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the cry is bound, guilt reduced, and the insect’s wingbeat becomes a harmless lullaby. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each beat layers density until the meteor hush lifts. Orientation is clear by 120 words; no teleporting props or causal breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The laboratory’s phonograph-bats and meteor hush are vivid, selective, and thematically charged. The amber and console function as micro-settings that constrain the final binding act. Spatial choreography is clean; no white-room syndrome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—silencing the cry—is signaled early. Escalation is a single deepening: each artifact (letters, amber, firmware) tightens the noose of memory until the tattooed throat uploads the sound. Cost is visible in the needle and the shrunken guilt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of maternal guilt and sonic haunting emerges organically from action and image. The insect’s wingbeat reframed as lullaby offers a resonant, non-moralizing answer. No late thematic exposition; ambiguity lingers without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with rhythmic control (“meteor hush,” “folding of time”). Perceptual signature is distinct—sound as texture, time as fabric. No POV drift or register mismatch; compression is purposeful and legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence advances image or stakes. No loops, mixed metaphors, or filler. Meteorite ink and amber pulse are fresh, specific details. Minor elevated diction (“escritoire”) fits the antique frame.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The fusion of constellation tattoos, fossilized insect metronome, and haunted firmware feels inevitable and fresh. Risky lyric structure pays off in the final image. No derivative echoes; the premise is transformed through lived grief.</comment>
