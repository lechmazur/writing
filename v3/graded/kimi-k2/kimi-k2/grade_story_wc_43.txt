<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is embodied in tactile choices—pressing vinyl to wrist, fitting shards—showing decisive kindness under pressure. The contradiction between clinical detachment and emotional investment is dramatized through micro-choices, culminating in the costly act of completing the circle with her own pulse. No stock phrasing; every beat advances motive. The final renunciation (letting the record rest in dawn) is earned and felt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each object-sound layers density until the groove itself becomes the closure image. Orientation is immediate; causality is present-tense accumulation rather than chain-link. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—the incomplete circle made whole by pulse—whose cost is the literal loss of Mrs. Eland and the figurative loss of the missing shard. No teleporting props; every shard is tracked.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The radiant haven above clouds is sketched with selective sensory detail—skylight, slate-rain scent—that constrains Mara’s toolkit (smuggled turntable, forbidden shards). The micro-setting of the bedside tray becomes the crucible where shards are reassembled; the missing center literally shapes the final action. Spatial choreography is flawless; no white-room drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—deliver a flawless goodbye—tightens as the blood-work clock runs. Escalation is accumulative: each mundane object adds sonic pressure until the reconstructed vinyl becomes the only path left. The final hiss of the record equals Mrs. Eland’s last breath; cost is audible and irreversible. Agency remains with Mara throughout.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: the substrate of memory is not the song but the life that once surrounded it. The vinyl’s incompleteness reframed as wholeness offers a non-literal answer—acceptance of loss as completion. No moralizing; the scent of hope shifts from metallic to clean sheets, reweighting the premise without exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with rhythmic control that accelerates during shard-fitting and exhales at the end. Perceptual signature is Mara’s synesthetic bias—scent as hope, static as memory. No POV leakage; every metaphor is filtered through her sensorium. Compression is taught early (“tasted like copper and silence”) and paid off in the final hiss.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or choice. Density is high—objects double as instruments and symbols—yet clarity never wavers. Metaphors are consistent (vinyl as wing, scent as weather) and physically coherent. Final paragraph is a controlled decrescendo, no overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—reunifying a life through its ambient soundtrack—is fresh and specific. The mundane-as-music method transforms a familiar hospice scene into a resonant ritual. Risk in form (accumulative lyric) heightens stakes without obscuring closure. The missing shard returned as pulse feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
