<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's interiority and embodied choices (pressing palms to stone, uncorking the vial, the final scream) are consistently vivid and specific; her contradiction between wanting to whisper and needing to scream plays out under pressure. The vial cork's dissolution into salt and her collapse against the railing supply a visible cost linked to her motive.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative-textural design: each scent-memory layer and the rising vibration tighten stakes until the final image reconfigures the lighthouse’s purpose with felt cost. The lighthouse’s song settles into a frequency that makes village panes sing—an earned Resonant Reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The cobalt tower, scorched glass, dawn light, and jasmine-salt air form a claustrophobic vertical micro-setting that constrains Mara’s every move and charges the final beam. Space is tracked cleanly from lantern room to village three miles inland through that very beam.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>One dominant stake—purify intentions by proving whispers travel farther—runs unwaveringly. The vibration’s demand escalates to a single decisive turn: tenderness must scream to be heard, foreclosing the gentler option with unmistakable physical cost.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from specific scents, actions, and the final beam that re-configures the world’s moral circuitry; no direct statement of thesis mars the closing note. The ambiguity between welcome and warning lingers unsettled in the best way.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The prose carries Mara’s sensory-biased perception with distinct texture—ozone and copper that “tasted like screaming tenderness.” Free-indirect style remains consistent; no unmotivated register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Precise sensory nouns and verbs drive momentum; rhythm intensifies with the tower’s hum. No scaffold sentences, metaphor muddle, or synonym loops in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The lighthouse-as-intent-amplifier is a fresher twist; heat-wave logic and scent-magic are not stock tropes. The ending’s quiet ripple of weeping captains and singing glass feels inevitable yet surprising.</comment>
