<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority is embodied and specific—ash on fingers, porcelain cutting cheeks—yet the contradictory impulses (guilt vs. unfinished love) remain mostly atmospheric rather than forcing a visible micro-choice until the final mask-removal. The renunciation is earned and costly, but earlier beats lean on lyric summary more than pressured action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of ash, porcelain, and vanishing lines reweights the stake until the mask’s removal crystallizes a Charged Poise. Orientation is taught early through sensory anchors; closure lands with unmistakable cost—the name swallowed by the vanishing point.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The gallery’s collapsing perspective and the porcelain mask as micro-setting actively constrain movement and sightlines; the final spotlight through shattered shards charges the closure image. Selective sensory detail (charcoal dust, throbbing temples) keeps the space tactile and urgent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—crystallizing the emotion while safety dissolves—is signaled early and tightened by each ash-filled crack. One decisive turn: peeling the mask away forecloses the mirage. Cost is visible in bloodied cheeks and the swallowed name.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of safety as mirage emerges organically from ash, porcelain, and vanishing lines; no moralizing. The final image—mask glowing like mercy through stained glass—reweights all prior concealment without stating a thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with rhythmic control that accelerates under pressure (“geometry elongating until corridors became perspective”). Perceptual signature is consistent: ash as constellation, porcelain as smile of incomplete information. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; each sentence layers image and stakes. Occasional elevated diction (“lucid grief”) fits the lyric mode and is pattern-taught. No loops or mixed metaphors; momentum never stalls.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Familiar grief ritual is transformed through the porcelain-mask conceit and vanishing-point gallery; the synthesis feels inevitable. Risky lyric compression pays off in the final spotlight image. No derivative echoes.</comment>
