<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is embodied and specific—“taste emotions the way others tasted salt”—and her micro-choices (angling mirrors, tilting fragment) visibly reweave relations. The final acceptance carries cost: the fragment dulls, treaty germinates in winter soil. Minor slip: “calmly intuitive” flirts with label-speak but is immediately dramatized through action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the single lantern-lit tideline image reweights every shard of pain into shared repair. Causal chain—fragment → mirrors → treaty—holds without gaps; floes slow because Mara’s empathic cartography is enacted, not declared. Cost is legible in the dulled fragment and the orchard’s rattled approval.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Basalt cliffs, rime-glazed trees, and scavenged vintage mirrors are selective, tactile, and constrain tactics: the orchard’s roots grip stone as Mara’s choices grip living relations. Frost retreating from warming mirrors is a micro-setting shift that charges the final image. One hairline slip: “black basalt cliffs” could feel catalogued, but the next clause grounds it in action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—treaty collapse—is signaled in line 3 and tightened through each mirror glimpse; the final harmonic reply forecloses vengeance. Escalation is accumulative/textural: each reflection adds density until the single lantern image crystallizes cost. No off-stage rescue; every beat is filtered through Mara’s empathic agency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of empathy-as-action emerges from the orchard’s roots gripping stone and Mara’s refusal of retribution; no moralizing statement intrudes. The closing image of lanterns made from hollowed fruit reweights the premise: shared light across species. Complexity is preserved—guilt and fear remain—but reconfigured toward repair.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise—“weighted breath before reply,” “hope thin as blown glass”—with rhythmic control that accelerates under pressure. POV stays locked to Mara; no filter-verb clusters. The orchard’s rattled branches and merfolk harmonics are perceived, not ventriloquized.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and function. No loops, no mixed metaphors. “Light pooling on the ice like melted stars” is earned by prior stellar imagery. One minor scaffold: “she began to reconstitute” could tighten, but momentum recovers instantly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: empathic cartography via antique mirrors and a dulled crystal shard transforms a familiar “prevent war” arc into tactile lyric negotiation. Risk—non-linear mirror montage—pays off in the lantern image. Specificity of hollowed-fruit lanterns feels inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
