<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“voice roughened by sleepless nights and ether”), motives clear and intensify to the climactic choice; the apology is credibly rooted in prior guilt. The ghost’s pressure forces her to translate metaphor into action, showing contradictory impulses under stress. Cost is felt when she folds the requiem into the ghost’s pocket and walks away without looking back. Minor: archivist’s interiority is absent, but he is a witness, not crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the apple-seed rest reweights the entire orchard’s fate, cost legible in the falling branches that “sing the newly written rest.” Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of scent, music, and memory tightens until the final image crystallizes meaning. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no causality breaks. One micro-turn suffices.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Archive dust, copper pipe, and orchard stumps are tactile and selective; each constrains action (pipe conducts scent, stumps receive apology). Final image of stumps “like open mouths mid-phrase” charges closure. Weather and spatial choreography remain coherent throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—deliver apology before bulldozers—tightens with the live clock of chainsaws. Agency drives every beat: uncorking perfume, guiding the drop, folding requiem. Cost is visible in the severed roots and her refusal to look back. Escalation is a single deepening under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of forgiveness as unfinished music emerges from concrete choices; the apple-seed rest is a non-literal answer to “how does the orchard remember?” No moralizing; resonance lingers in the gossip columns’ lie versus the witnessed truth.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with controlled compression (“hush inside the crash”). Distinct perceptual signature—scent, sound, and regret filtered through exorcist’s synesthetic attention. No POV drift; archivist’s dialogue minimal but tonally distinct.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; every sentence advances image or stakes. No loops, no mixed metaphors. Rhythm modulates from hush to crash without monotony. Final line “tasting bergamot and closure on her tongue” crystallizes cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: exorcist as gossip-column celebrity, apology via perfumed ionic induction, orchard as requiem. Risky lyric structure pays off in closure. Specificity prevents cliché; “apple-seed rest” is unforeseeable yet inevitable.</comment>
