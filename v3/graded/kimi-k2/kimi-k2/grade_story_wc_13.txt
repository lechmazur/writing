<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Lira’s need to finish her bestiary is clear and embodied throughout; each action draws from that motive, and the final stasis (carrying the birthplace in ink) is a costly renunciation of certainty when she listens for the giant’s next skipped beat. Interiority is consistent, concrete, and avoids therapy-speak. However, her secondary values or contradictions gain less visible exploration under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise on the line “the place where echoes are born would travel with her”; the protagonist has foreclosed returning to a stable present moment yet we legibly feel the cost of the borrowed second. Causation is lyric but coherent: each borrowing of time spirals from prior act, and the lens is Accumulative/Textural—density increase reweights the central stake of capturing living sound.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Micro-setting excels: the pendant, sketchbook, and canal water physically constrain every move—no action occurs without tactile contact with these objects. Spatial anchors are rock-solid. The rooftop canal and giant’s breath act as dual environmental clocks that charge the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation is a single decisive deepening rather than reversal: each borrowing of a second tightens the giant’s remaining nap, compounding cost until time snaps back at the climax. Agency is fully Lira’s; luck never rescues her.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges quietly from particular action—infinity, echoes, and dreams rewire into the single act of carrying an unfinished world in portable ink. No explicit moralizing. The final image evokes resonant non-literal question without tidy thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is rich, rhythmic, and particular to Lira’s perceptual signature—phrases like “lungs made of unresolved music” are hers and no other. Syntactic control under pressure is immaculate; purposeful compression of the canal system into liquid light staircase is legible without exposition.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Line-level craft is lyrical yet dense; sentences braid multiple tasks while maintaining clarity. No filter-verb clusters or overwriting in peak moments. Read-aloud rhythm modulates with tension.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>The inversion of sleeping-giant-as-city-foundation and echoes crystallized into living glass birds is a fresh synthesis without precedent. Concept commits fully, following each implication to conclusion.</comment>
