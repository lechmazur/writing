<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Thimble’s interiority is vivid and embodied—his “amber eyes” and “calloused feet” anchor centuries of burden—but the final smile reads slightly abstract, softening the felt cost of justice served.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the rune’s darkness becomes testament, the library re-orders itself, and the pretender’s defeat is legible in the rustle of self-correcting pages. Causal chain holds under Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The temple library is not backdrop but agent: marble grooves, whispering scrolls, and starlight through the cracked dome all constrain Thimble’s ascent and charge the final image of pages turning toward truth.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—unmasking the pretender—tightens through the discovery of the crown defacement; the rune’s activation is the decisive escalation that forecloses the pretender’s narrative and costs Thimble his last ink pellet.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of truth’s inevitable reclamation emerges organically from marginalia, ink, and starlight; the final image of the pellet left as “testament” reweights the premise without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is lapidary and controlled—“regally unpretentious” is itself a stylistic signature—compressing centuries into sensory immediacy; no POV drift, no filler, rhythm modulates with pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language (“dust motes drifted like miniature galaxies”) is selective and purposeful. One minor loop—“the same elegant loops that had spelled doom”—is forgiven under lyric compression.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The conceit of history rewritten via marginalia feels fresh; the diminutive titan, ink pellet, and rune of drift synthesize into a singular mythic logic that could not survive transplantation.</comment>
