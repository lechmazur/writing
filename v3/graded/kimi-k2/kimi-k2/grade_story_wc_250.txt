<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The guardian’s silent vow and ritual precision create a credible, embodied interiority; the mirrored child scene crystallizes his cost. No contradictory impulses are dramatized on-page, yet the final renunciation of speech and mirror feels earned. The flaw—absolute muteness—limits relational crucible but heightens mythic solitude.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the pearl-image reweights the premise—darkness learns kinship, stars learn grief. Causal chain (mirror→shutters→vortex→child) holds without gaps; cost is the guardian’s abandonment of his only tool. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; density and cadence tighten toward the final stillness.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Cobalt dock, mist-heavy coat, and dental mirror function as micro-setting that constrains every gesture. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: guardian notices plank gleam, star-blades, frog hush. Final mirror left reflecting dawn star charges the closing image; environment actively shapes tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—retrieve the child’s reflection—signaled by noon drowning and spiraling water. Escalation is one deepening: still water → vortex → pearl lift, each stage narrowing ritual options. Cost is the guardian’s permanent silence and surrendered mirror. Agency is ritual endurance that forecloses retreat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: empathy as reciprocal recognition between darkness and light. Subtext lives in gesture—mirror angled, shutters braided—never stated. Final pearl-burst reweights the half-spoken secret without moralizing; ambiguity lingers, charged.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is hushed, tidal, precise: “stillwater tension binding his movements to the hush.” Syntax lengthens and contracts with ritual tempo. No dialogue; silence is the voice. Perceptual signature is guardian-centric, selective, mythic.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is lean yet luminous: “starlight slid through in blades, cutting the darkness into strips that fluttered like torn silk.” No loops, no mixed metaphors. Information density high; every image advances ritual or stakes. Final line anchors closure without scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fusion of cosmic myth and intimate grief feels inevitable yet fresh. Dental mirror as star-catcher, shutters as star-map—specific, irreplaceable. Risk: silent protagonist in lyric mode pays off through charged image. No derivative echoes.</comment>
