<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority—trembling certainty while the volcano "inhales"—gives subtle, embodied contradiction; choices align with her invented craft and mentor-haunted ethics. The late, unearned "harmony of stone and water" abstracts motive a hair; otherwise the arc carries the cost of silence bought with chain tension.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: decrypted coordinates → amphitheater → lever pull redirects the river under strict millimetric tension. Closure with felt cost—the volcano’s re-regulated heart-beat exchanged for the terraces’ slow greening—earns the stance crystallization.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Stage “breathes,” pumice motes, basalt textures all serve micro-choice—tension of chain against throat of stone constrains final setting. Only brief travelogue “overhead sky through caldera’s rim” risks postcard lift.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—balanced flow versus eruption—is signaled inside first 60 words and escalates through millimetric tension and haptic risk. Cost embodied in soft volcano pulse rather than magma threat lands directly on page.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>“Encrypted compassion” reweighs itself from mentor cipher to enacted balance without didacticism; final image of quieter music reframes theme organically. Abstract risk appears only in “harmonize conflicting values” line—mild thematic echo but contained.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Free-indirect craft voice tightens in the lever-pull—“chain tightens…singing against ancient stone”—without slip-ups or filter clutter. Diction stays credible for lone technician’s POV; lyric compression taught early.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Strong rhythm, vivid sensory compression; occasional modifier stacking (“gentle pulse of a heart learning a new rhythm”) bumps density yet never muddles meaning. No loop or redundancy appears within the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: hydrological lullaby instead of heroics inside dormant volcano venue. The conceit commits fully; removing the cipher-based compassion frame would erode the moral physics driving Lira’s choice.</comment>
