<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Leif’s contradictory impulses—yearning for truth while fearing its weight—are embodied in micro-choices (balancing on the railing, threading mirrors). The final stance crystallizes with felt cost: he “wears the hush like armor,” foreclosing escape. Interiority is specific, never diagnostic. Only the father remains off-page, limiting relationship crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the fused ring reconfigures meaning and stakes without resolving the villagers’ judgment. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of mirrors, salt wind, copperlight reweights the premise. Cost is legible in the final whispered story. Orientation is anchored early; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The lighthouse, reef, and descending stair constrain every move; the fused ring becomes micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective (salt wind, lantern oil) and filtered through Leif’s bias. Spatial choreography is coherent; no floating rooms. Environment actively shapes tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—gathering the hush to redeem his father’s legacy—is signaled early and tightened when mirrors collapse into the ring. Escalation is driven by Leif’s agency under Accumulative lens; cost is the irreversible fusion. One decisive intensification suffices. No coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: truth and lie share breath, silence is not absence but accumulated unheard cries. Final image reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture (lattice pressed to wood) and silence. Resonance lingers in the copperlight armor.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; perceptual signature filters every detail through Leif’s haunted curiosity. Syntax modulates with pressure—long spirals down the stair, clipped final whisper. No head-hopping; POV distance remains stable. Patterned elision (mirrors folding) is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is purposeful, never purple. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances. Rhythm mirrors descent and collapse. Metaphors (hush as velvet, mirrors as brine) cohere. Final cadence crystallizes stakes without clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fairy-tale premise is inverted: the wolf-boy’s son reclaims the lie as living truth. Specificity of copperlight, reef, and lattice transforms trope. Risky downward labyrinth pays off in earned resonance. Synthesis feels inevitable; no close echoes.</comment>
