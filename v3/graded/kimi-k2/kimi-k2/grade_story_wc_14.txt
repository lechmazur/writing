<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Liang’s studious compulsion to “measure silence” and “collect textures” is embodied in tactile micro-choices—palming the lamp, annotating pitch, speaking textures aloud. The interior contradiction (panic vs. discipline) is dramatized, not labeled, and the final renunciation—accepting that invented histories are “lanterns”—carries visible cost as the lamp dies and silence thickens. No second character on page, so relationship crucible N/A. Trait-driven mistakes (abandoning the shop) compound and are not tidily resolved.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of texture-gathering intensifies until the final cadence shift reweights the stake. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the notepad pressed to his ear crystallizes that the silence is “no longer empty.” Cost is legible in the lamp’s dimming and the thicker silence. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The bonsai labyrinth, moss-glow, and lamp’s “trapped moon” are filtered through Liang’s synesthetic priorities; setting constrains movement and supplies the hum that drives the plot. Micro-setting (lamp casing, cedar-scented paper) functions as tool and threshold. Final image of glowing moss charges the closure. No spatial drift; sensory hierarchy is POV-true.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserve vanishing textures—signaled in paragraph 2. Escalation is textural: hum thins, lamp forgets, urgency rises. One decisive tightening: Liang speaks the market-day textures aloud, deepening the lamp’s resonance. Cost is the lamp’s death and the thickened silence; agency is renunciation/acceptance rather than victory.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: memory as active, fragile craft; invented histories as ethical resistance to erasure. Subtext in the lamp’s gratitude and the notepad’s “luminous restraint” avoids moralizing. Final image reweights premise—silence now “incandescent”—without explicit statement. Complexity preserved: invention is both lie and lantern.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is synesthetic, precise, and studious—syntax mirrors Liang’s metronomic attention (“annotating the pitch at three-second intervals”). No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent. Compression taught early (“measured silence the way others measured rain”) and paid off in closure. No dialogue, so dialogue bullets N/A.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers texture without redundancy. Figurative language is selective and pattern-taught (“texture of the time just before the silence”). No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Rhythm modulates with urgency—long lyrical lines contract to “the lamp dimmed to a coal-colored filament.”</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise—stationer charting a dying lamp’s hum to salvage lost textures—is fresh, non-obvious, and fully committed. Tropes of post-apocalyptic silence and memory-keeper are transformed through tactile specificity and synesthetic method. Risk in lyric accumulation pays off: final image of “incandescent restraint” feels inevitable yet unforeseeable.</comment>
