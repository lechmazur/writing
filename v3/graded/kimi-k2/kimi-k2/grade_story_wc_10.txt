<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rowan’s interiority is embodied and specific—frost-numb palms, salt-blistered tongue—yet the final choice to bow and leave the forks feels slightly under-motivated; the cost is present but not fully dramatized in body or micro-choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each fork placement intensifies the color-heat pattern until the final chord liquefies frost; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where silence itself becomes audible skin-vibration, cost paid in Rowan’s relinquishment of the forks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Winterglass conservatory is not backdrop but instrument: glass panes, lemon skeleton, and frozen bird all constrain and then enable the color-music; the final droplets glinting like notes could not occur in any other space.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—translate silence into living warmth—tightens through each fork’s color-pulse; the escalation is one sustained crescendo rather than multiple reversals, but the final chord visibly forecloses the option to keep the forks, paying with their dimming.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of ruin cradling life emerges through the lemon tree’s sap remembering thaw and the bird’s unopened eye; no moral is stated, yet the final image of horizon lights “looking like a song” reweights the entire premise without didacticism.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise—“heat-caterpillars of emotion wriggle across glass walls”—with controlled psychic distance; no head-hop, and the patterned elision (color for sound) is taught early and paid off in the final hummed vibration.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; each sentence layers sensory and emotional data without redundancy. Metaphors (“frozen dolphinsong”) are exact, and rhythm modulates with pressure—no loops or scaffold detected in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The fusion of synesthesia, post-cataclysm silence, and tuning-fork alchemy feels inevitable yet wholly fresh; the risk of wordless color-music pays off in a closure that could not be achieved any other way.</comment>
