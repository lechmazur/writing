<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Vivid embodied interiority ("feral nostalgia clawed at her ribs") sharpens the chronicler's central split; micro-choice—burning the chronicle—earns final cohesion at a tangible cost of lost control and singular identity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Closure (Earned Stasis) lands under Accumulative lens: burning the scroll crystallizes time while leaving the narrative unfinished, a resonant reconfiguration with the cabin floor becoming cloud and the cabin sigh settling the after-cost. Orientation is swift, causality threads cleanly through dream-logic.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Mountain-cabin micro-setting anchors spatial cues—moth wings, tin roof sound map—then the literal planks transmute into cloud under character pressure, constraining and enabling the flight beat; sensory density tightens stakes without over-furnishing distance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake is distilled clarity vs. living chaos; pressure tightens from grave-foreknowledge to the refusal to keep chronicling, forcing a renunciation that pays visible cost (scroll ash, single face). Single deepening is coherent but lacks secondary reversal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme—chaos as truer narrative—emerges organically through the burning scroll and solitary unmarked bark; final image earns resonance without sermon, leaving ambivalent acceptance of incompleteness felt rather than stated.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Strong rhythmic modulation ("yesterday tasted like childhood") mirrors shifting perceptual time; lyric compression and intentional POV fracturing are taught early and paid off in the mirrored face; no head-hop, voice remains singular and charged.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Lines pulse with varied structure and economy—only two minor figurative overlaps (“bark from a birch” / “bark burn”); no scaffolding, propulsion maintained; high-level craft with no artifacts muddling closure.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Transfigures the familiar portal-fantasy “journey through self-versions” into a viscerable chronicle-on-fire ritual; unique synthesis of lucid-dream mechanics with literary metanarrative feels inevitable, the burning scroll as fresh inflection.</comment>
