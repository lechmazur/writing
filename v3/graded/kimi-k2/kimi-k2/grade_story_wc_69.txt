<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ms. Vale’s interior contradiction—teaching harmony while nursing a barbed slur—is embodied in her tactile handling of the rosette; the micro-choice to press it to her sternum seals an earned renunciation with visible cost. The child’s silent acceptance extends the crucible, but the girl’s agency is off-page until the coda, capping relationship pressure at 8.7.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each named noise subtracted tightens the stillness until the final chord reweights the premise—the hollow rosette becomes an ear. Closure lands as Charged Poise with felt cost (“the next subtraction…would not be hers”). No orientation drift; pattern taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The velvet library’s amber light and drifting leaves filter through Ms. Vale’s bias, guiding her toward silence; the rosette’s carved mouth against her heartbeat in the final image constrains the vow she carries forward. Selective sensory economy supports the theme without clutter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—unlearning hatred—tightens via each subtracted noise; the Syrian/Yoruba braid is the decisive intensification that forecloses the old reflexive discord. Cost is audible in the “flakes of rust falling away,” legible under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the rosette’s hollow becoming an ear: subtraction as making space for difference. No moralizing; the final image of two teachers passing the listening void offers resonant, non-literal reweighting of the premise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyrical, controlled free-indirect style stays within Ms. Vale’s perceptual signature; patterned elision (“traveled stillness”) is taught early and paid off. No dialogue, so voice coherence rests on rhythmic modulation under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High information density with zero loops; figurative language is selective and purposeful. Occasional elevated diction (“expectantly resigned”) is voice-motivated and consistent. No artifacts in closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: a choir teacher unlearning hatred through literal subtraction of sound, embodied in a wooden rosette that becomes a portable silence. Risky lyric structure holds coherence; transformation test fails if names or places change, confirming originality.</comment>
