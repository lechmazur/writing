<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is rich—survivor guilt, need to shed masks, and resolve to archive “small gestures” all concrete and embodied. Contradiction surfaces in real time: nostalgia vs ruthless excision of same. Final choice to enact STAY inside the improvised parliament earns its cost: “she no longer knew where she ended and the interregnum began.” Some over-tidy articulation (“theme of smallness”) drags it from 8+. No secondary character on page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure is Accumulative/Textural: pattern-cipher walks culminating in silent “Begin” → STAY forms Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights meaning. Cost is felt—the self dissolves into penumbra. Drive lens is taught early and maintained; momentum escalates by density increase rather than causal reversal. Orientation early is strong: clocks stop → gallery beneath throne. Penumbra concept slightly wobbles on first appearance but recovers.</comment>

<comment>Gallery as “micro-setting” is vivid: cracked marble, alabaster squares glowing, whispering stone walls. Chessboard doubles as tactile prop and conceptual constraint—its missing pawns spur every action. Stones learn to “see”; light responds to cipher steps. No environment beyond gallery acts, but that is scope-appropriate. Sensory hierarchy under crisis (smoke, sweat, soot) is perfect.</comment>

<grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake is legible—preserve vanished stories—but stakes escalate tangibly only in last quarter. Each spelled word tightens task from REMEMBER to FORGIVE to OBSERVE to STAY, showing progression. Tension arises from internal compulsion rather than external opposition. Agency is active; cost is felt. Could use sharper earlier external pressure to reach 8+.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of history’s indebtedness to the forgotten pawns emerges entirely through image and gesture, never asserted. Final circle of fallen pieces becomes Conceptual Repricing of monarchy itself—rule without the ruled collapses. Absence gains luminous weight; refusal to tidy into moral avoids sentimentality.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Lyrical yet precise: “nomadic penumbra of the interregnum drifted,” “footprints—ghost-pawns returned through narrative.” Syntax pulses with breath units fitting meditative traversal. Distinct perceptual signature shows in details selected (silk scarf, cage of finches). No dialogue; voice coherence under stress is exemplary. Overoccasional elevated diction ("archivist of half-finished sentences") slightly leaks POV register.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and musical: “stone lips murmuring… multiplying into a choir of luminous absence.” Few metaphors strain; mixed metaphors largely controlled. Recurrent filter-verb “began” and slight scaffold near “She resolved to become...” cost minor momentum, but artifacts stay away from final 20%. Sentence variation and onomatopoeic clacks of ivory keep flow alive.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of crisis-actor-as-survivor-archivist, cipher-foot-walking, and empty-chessboard parliament. Trope transformation feels inevitable. Risk-taking in non-linear, lyric structure pays off; closure image could not belong to any other premise. Lingers in memory with earned resonance.</question>
