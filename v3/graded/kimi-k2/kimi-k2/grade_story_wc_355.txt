<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mira’s pacifist identity drives every significant micro-choice and the final renunciation of violence is embodied in her literal touch on the blank page—earned and costed by prior causality. Internal contradiction (near-strike memory) is dramatized in real time, not summarized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the clasp sings open via empathic vibration, crystallizing the “before” refusal to fight into an “after” willingness to recover silence. Cause-effect linkage holds under causal lens; time, place and stakes are anchored within first 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Workshop micro-setting pressures choice via proximity of tools and resonant acoustics; starlight acts as both staging light and metaphorical spotlight on mercy. Object-state changes (lock clicks) alter final possibilities, reaching 9-band involvement without full novelty.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—empathically opening guilt without violence—escalates once via the tightening of frequencies; visible cost is the unplayed thumbprint absorbing her present grief. No reversals required; a single deepening that reweights options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Theme of empathy-as-frequency emerges from concrete tuning acts rather than assertion; final image of clasp humming against heartbeat reweights earlier silences as active love-shaped space, escaping tidy moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Distinct lyric-voice with controlled rhythm under emotional swell; elision of explicit lock mechanics is taught early through pattern of crystalline notes. No head-hopping; interiority remains character-bound and specific.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Sentence-level propulsion supported by rhythmic cadence shifts; some stacked metaphors near climax risk decorative density but redeemed when acoustics charge closure. High information density with zero loops or scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Fresh angle on pacifism refracted through sound-healing; transformation of a conventional diary lock into empathic conduit feels inevitable, not gimmick. Specific tonal synthesis outweighs familiar frame.</comment>
