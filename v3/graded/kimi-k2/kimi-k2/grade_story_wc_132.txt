<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the contradiction between her need for control and the storm’s refusal to obey is dramatized in every tactile beat. The final renunciation—setting the leaf down and naming vines aloud—earns its cost through prior micro-choices and accumulated grief. One minor slip: “reluctant metamorphosis” is named rather than fully dramatized in her body, keeping it just under 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the leaf becomes a compass, the storm rewrites her life, and the cost is the relinquishing of fifteen years of vigilance. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each image layers density until the final cadence shift. No orientation debt; anchors are clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The mossy trellis, rain-soaked cedar rail, and translucent leaf all constrain or charge the final image; the greenhouse lights flickering off is a micro-setting beat that forces her to stay outside. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered. Meets 9+ gate but a hair less specificity in spatial choreography keeps it at 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will she keep clinging to control or let the storm rewrite her—tightens once when she releases the grafting impulse and stays in the rain. Cost is visible: the notebook abandoned, the timer surrendered, the footprints erased. One tightening is sufficient under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of reluctant transformation emerges organically from every concrete action; no moralizing. The final image of the leaf as “map of everywhere she still needed to go” reweights prior material with conceptual cost. Subtext in the jasmine’s rebellion and moss’s breath is sustained and resonant.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; perceptual signature is botanist-poet, noticing veins silvering and soil remembering. Rhythm modulates with storm intensity. No head-hopping; POV modesty maintained. Compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence layers image and stakes. No loops, no mixed metaphors. Minor scaffold in “studied the way rain rewrote the posture of every vine, every leaf, every regret” could trim one “every,” but it does not dull closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Familiar grief-recovery arc is transformed through horticultural specificity and storm-as-metaphor handled with fresh tactility. The leaf-compass and jasmine spiral feel inevitable in hindsight. Risk in lyric accumulation pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
