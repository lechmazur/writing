<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lark’s molting trait and Mira’s counter-gift of “Anchor” create a credible interior struggle that charges the final renunciation; the wrist inscription crystallizes the cost of remaining Lark. Relationship pressure is intimate and stakes are scaled to the word count. Minor slip: the molting is told more than dramatized in body.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Lark walks away, leaving the planted insurgency and the name “Anchor” behind—cost is the forfeiture of self and proximity to Mira. Causal chain (rescue books → hide map → bury tin → vow return) holds under a lyrical-accumulative lens. One transition (library → yard) is clean.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The rusted library’s bullet-starred skylight and mildewed paper are vivid micro-settings that constrain tactics—false panels, spiral tower, sapling burial all arise from the decayed space. Sensory hierarchy stays POV-tight. Final image of paper birds drifting over walls recharges the setting as charged poise.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“can beauty survive surrender?”—tightens when the warden’s torch deadline forces the clandestine archive and the molting clock. Agency is renunciation: Lark sacrifices continuity of self to seed future resistance. Cost is explicit in the cracked voice and empty pockets.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of beauty as “quiet riot” emerges through concrete acts—folding poems into birds, burying tin—never sermonized. Final bus-ticket line reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext in Mira’s kiss of the inked wrist seals the thematic contract.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded: “moth wings,” “luminous fracture,” “ink never shrapnel” are character-bound perceptions. Syntax modulates with emotional crests; no head-hopping. Dialogue sparse but subtextual (“Tell me your next name”). Distinct perceptual signature sustained under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is patterned early and paid off (paper birds return). No loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated diction (“incandescence”) fits the poet POV. Final paragraph cadence mirrors moon descent and emotional ebb.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: vagrant poet with monthly molting + prison library insurgency feels inevitable, not gimmick. Transformation test passes—swap names or setting and the arc collapses. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without clarity loss.</comment>
