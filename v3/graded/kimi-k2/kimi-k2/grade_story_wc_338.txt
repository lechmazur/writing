<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—her “shielded openness” and tactile curiosity drive every beat. The moment she presses the torn map to the wall is a micro-choice that crystallizes her arc and costs her certainty. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, so the 9+ gate stays closed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the wall’s reverse-drawing reweights the premise that absence can be mapped. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each sensory layer (rain, shadow, ink) tightens until the final image reconfigures meaning with undeniable cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The rain-scoured chapel vault and the shadow’s cold breath constrain Elara’s every move; the fresco pigments literally become the missing henge. Micro-setting (the altar stone as projector mount) and macro-setting interlock to charge the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—interpreting cartographic silence—escalates as the shadow’s fingers lengthen across fifty years. One decisive tightening: the overlay of stills forces Elara to trade empirical certainty for empathic witness. Cost is felt in the visible chill of her breath.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of “wounds as windows” emerges through concrete particulars: torn parchment, stone exhaling ink, ridge shimmering with erased stones. Final image of silver-stitched seam offers non-literal resonance without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise—“rain hissed against the vaulted ceiling,” “stone exhaled and drew it in.” Perceptual signature remains consistent; no head-hop or register drift. Compression and elision are taught early and paid off in the silent footage montage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful—“saints and sinners blurred into pale ghosts” mirrors Elara’s own fading certainties. Rhythm modulates with pressure, climaxing in the single-sentence revelation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise—maps that tear themselves to erase a henge—feels inevitable yet wholly fresh. Risky lyric structure pays off: the chapel as palimpsest, frescoes as ground-up stones. Specificity of 1973 vs 2023 reels grounds the speculative in tactile reality.</comment>
