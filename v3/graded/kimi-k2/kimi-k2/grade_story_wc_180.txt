<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The mender’s interiority is vivid—her traded eye, the ribbon’s scent, the grandmother’s face in leaves—but the daughter’s feistiness is asserted rather than embodied in on-page choices, and the final reconciliation feels slightly under-motivated by prior friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the graft metaphor crystallizes generational repair, the ribbon reweights memory, and the orchard’s forgiveness is earned through refracted light and shared lullabies. One seamless scene, causal lens holds, cost visible in the split bark and returned song.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The cathedral-orchard is not backdrop but crucible: branches become scaffolding, fruit are mute bells, sap teaches refraction. Every sensory detail constrains movement or charges the final image; the setting actively grafts past to present.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—mending the generational breach—is signaled early and tightened by each graft, prism flash, and lullaby note. Pressure grows through embodied choices; the final binding of wrists forecloses estrangement with felt cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through living metaphor: promises as grafts, memory as sap, wisdom as sweet rot feeding bloom. The ending’s “accidental forgiveness” reweights the breach without moralizing; ambiguity lingers in the taste of secrets.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise—“green embroidery,” “deciduous vows”—and stays within the mender’s perceptual limits. Compression and elision are pattern-taught early; rhythm modulates with ascent and descent. No head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences are dense, propulsive, and varied; figurative language is selective and purposeful. No loops, no scaffold, no mixed metaphors. The final cadence—“soft amendments to every broken promise”—lands with earned resonance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The cathedral-orchard graft, memory-fruit, and quartz-eye mender synthesize into a singular vision. Risky lyric compression pays off; the premise feels inevitable yet fresh. No close echoes, no template plotting.</comment>
