<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Liora’s interior contradiction—protective secrecy vs. honest disclosure—drives every beat; the micro-choice to bury the tube enacts her renunciation with visible cost. Embodied emotion (“tasting iron silence”) grounds her solitude without therapy-speak. Motivation remains consistent: integrity through deferred disclosure. The final image of “wings not bound to pigeons” crystallizes her earned stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: burying the tube reweights the premise—truth migrates laterally, not instantly. Causal lens holds: each beat (losing the tail, hiding the tube, leaving the watcher) follows because/therefore logic. Orientation is anchored by dusk, courtyard, dry fountain. Cost is legible in the relinquished tube and the deliberate darkness left for the watcher.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The brass tube, dry fountain cavity, and ivy-reflected lamplight are tactile constraints that shape Liora’s lateral moves. Sensory hierarchy (graphite-sweet wind) mirrors internal stakes. Micro-setting—the fountain’s hidden cavity—directly enables the decisive concealment. Environment charges the final image of moonlit steps carrying “slow, lateral migration of truth.”</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—share or hoard knowledge—tightens when the follower appears; each lateral move narrows options until the tube is buried. Escalation is causal: dusk absorption → fountain cavity → delayed disclosure. Cost is the relinquished tube and the risk of unknown retrieval. No coincidence resolves; the watcher’s half-presence complicates without solving.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from action: integrity as weather-like patience, not proclamation. Subtext in the watcher’s hesitation and the zone’s “vast patient heart” reframes secrecy as stewardship. Final image of moonlit wings reweights earlier solitude without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers—truth may aid or harm—yet the stance is crystallized.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is precise, meteorological, and inward: “barometric pearls,” “graphite-sweet wind.” Syntax mirrors lateral motion—long, winding sentences that breathe then compress under pressure. No head-hopping; focalization stays locked to Liora’s trained perception. The carrier-pigeon metaphor returns transformed in the final line, proving rhythmic control.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet limpid: “stone cherubs kept their ears open and their mouths politely shut” does triple duty. No loops, no scaffold; every image advances stakes or atmosphere. Metaphors (ouroboros tongues, wine-dark archway) are exact and purposeful. Rhythm modulates with scene tension; final paragraph slows to crystalline closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: meteorological ethics meets quarantine noir. The rogue zone as “patient heart learning human rhythm” reconfigures contagion tropes. Lateral motion as both physical tactic and epistemic stance feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric density pays off in the charged final image without gimmickry.</comment>
