<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mara’s interior contradiction—guilt vs. the need to forgive herself—is embodied in the ash moth on her scar and the prism of pain; every micro-choice (opening the box, speaking the childhood line, pressing the scar) is rooted in prior causality and carries visible cost. The scar itself shifts from shame to text, a credible renunciation with felt price.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the bargain reverses on the page (“innocence was not lost but lent”) and the aurora word “forgive” drifts toward the town—cost is legible, lens is Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is immediate; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The moonlit ridge, frost-silvered gravel, and wind-sculpted pines anchor place and mood; the porcelain box and scarred cheek act as micro-settings that constrain ritual action. Final aurora recharges the ridge light, tying setting to closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Dominant stake—translate pain into universal language—tightens through the ritual; the ash moth’s dissolution and the word “forgive” constitute a deepening that forecloses guilt’s hold. Cost is visible in the sparks that spell the word and the scar’s redefinition.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>Theme of guilt, forgiveness, and the alchemy of pain emerges through embodied ritual rather than statement; the final image reweights the childhood promise without moralizing. Subtext resides in the moth, the colors, and the planets’ indifference.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</question><comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded in tactile detail; perceptual signature is Mara’s—selective, scar-filtered, fire-wise. Rhythm modulates with pressure; no head-hopping. Compression (“hinge sighed like a sleeping child”) is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; figurative language is patterned and recharged at closure. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Occasional elevated diction (“eloquent in their motion”) is voice-motivated and consistent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</question>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: wildfire trauma translated into auroral ritual, porcelain box as reliquary of innocence, scar as text. Risky lyric mode is fully committed and coherent; no derivative templates.</comment>
