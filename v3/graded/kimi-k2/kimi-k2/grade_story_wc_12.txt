<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The priest’s interiority is embodied in tactile ritual—palette, pedal, lattice—yet the contradiction between vow and demon remains abstract; final bow is earned but cost is more conceptual than visceral.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the demon’s dissolution into letters reweights the premise that assumptions are constructs. Accumulative/Textural lens holds; layered silences tighten stakes until the anchor’s heartbeat reconfigures meaning with felt cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dimensional anchor and palette-as-micro-setting constrain every tactic; the lattice’s Morse tremor and frost-window refraction charge the final image, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prevent possession by exposing assumptions—tightens through each looped reversal; cost is the priest’s emptied palette and plain gray cassock, visible on page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the ritual itself: silence structured as argument against dogma. Final bow offers resonant, non-literal answer—assumptions admitted as constructs—without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet disciplined; perceptual signature filters every detail through priestly vocation. Patterned elision (e.g., “muffled clarity”) is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; each sentence layers sensory and conceptual work. No loops or scaffold; figurative language serves pattern taught in first paragraph.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ritual technology and metaphysical debate; loop pedal as confessional device feels inevitable. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes without obscuring closure.</comment>
