<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Cass’s resilient positivity is embodied in micro-choices (polishing rail, steady radio voice) and charged by the cost of eternal guardianship; the hourglass’s sideways sand literalizes her internal contradiction. Motivation to merge timelines is declared early and paid for in the final image of the ghost timetable only she sees. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible waived.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the ferry re-enters ordinary water but Cass retains memory and the 7:15½ ghost run, a felt cost under Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality holds—hourglass, radio, grotto patterns braid into the final sideways-ticking image. Orientation anchored by line 3; no drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Spectral grotto’s starlight and sideways clocks are vivid, selective, and directly constrain Cass’s radio choreography; the hourglass becomes micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy skews to visual/auditory, justified by the POV’s task-focus. Spatial choreography clean across beats.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—merge every commuter timeline—signaled early; pressure tightens when radio patterns must braid futures into one present. Cost crystallizes in Cass’s eternal vigil and the ghost timetable. Escalation is one deepening under Accumulative lens; no reversals needed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of mercy across fractured time emerges from Cass’s embodied labor and the hourglass’s sideways flow; no explicit moralizing. Final image of the unseen 7:15½ run reweights premise with conceptual cost. Subtext carried by silence of passengers and Cass’s permanent transient smile.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct lyric texture—compressed, patterned, yet legible; “stars looked sideways,” “sand slid sideways” teach the tilted-clock motif early. POV remains tight to Cass; no head-hop. Rhythm modulates with pressure, accelerating during radio braiding, then settling into the lullaby chord.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density; each sentence layers image, action, and concept without scaffold. Metaphors are coherent within the tilted-time conceit. No loops or register drift; occasional elevated diction (“spectral grotto”) is voice-motivated. Final image crystallizes without figurative muddle.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ferry-as-time-loom; sideways hourglass and ghost timetable feel inevitable yet non-obvious. Risky lyric compression pays off in closure clarity. Transformation test: story collapses if any element swapped. Bold, fully committed.</comment>
