<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid, particularly around the locket’s borrowed pulse; the transfer of heartbeat at climax registers as Earned Stasis with palpable cost. However, her backstory twin-sister beat is delivered in one expository line that summarizes without on-page cues, diluting motive clarity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise: she dances the locket’s rhythm into the mirrors, then absorbs the pulse into her own heart, reconfiguring what’s possible. Causal lattice holds under Accumulative/Textural lens—each mirror softens because she invites rather than commands. The expository twin detail is the only lapse but doesn’t disturb the final beat of legible cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The terrace’s wet marble, refracted twilight, and jasmine scent ground every movement; the locket-as-micro-setting constrains the climactic dance. No orientation drift. Density is lavish yet selective, never obstructing the closing cadence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“to persuade mirrors to show possibilities”—steadily intensifies from first line to last dance until the cost is the loss of external metronome. Only one turn, but it reweights options and registers the cost in her own chest. Escalation coheres under Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</question>
<comment>Theme quietly reframes death as possibility, sung through lullabies and mirrored futures without didactic tilt. Final image recharges all prior reflections, achieving Conceptual Repricing without overt nudging.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</question>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet grounded—tactile marble, salt-thunder jasmine, prism light all filtered through the painter’s perceptual signature. No head-hops; compression and patterned diction are taught early and paid off melodically at close.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.8</question>
<comment>Rhythm is supple, sentences breathe alongside the heartbeat cadence; occasional “wet marble” echo and “mirrors softened like frost” feel recycled, but clarity never falters under peak pressure. Filter-verb count remains low; no loops touch the climax.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.7</question>
<comment>Mirrors-as-future-lenses fused with a living heartbeat is fresh; neither trope overshadows the other. Risk pays off in the lyrical structure, but twin exposition is a small missed opportunity to further originalize.</comment>
