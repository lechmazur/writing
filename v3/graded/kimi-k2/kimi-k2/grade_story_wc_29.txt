<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyra’s interior contradiction—fear vs. hope—drives every micro-choice; the trembling finger on the chart, the sweat-slick fader, the marker equations all embody stakes. Mentor’s last words anchor motive without backstory bloat. Final renunciation (leaving transmitter running) costs her vulnerability to future retaliation—earned, visible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each beat links because/therefore from signal detection → interference → mirrored retaliation → softening comet. Closure is a decisive conceptual repricing: the sky’s “apologetic” light reweights the entire premise of cosmic manipulation. Cost is the white-flare tubes—overheated circuitry foreshadowing future price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Basement studio’s solder stench and glowing tubes constrain tactics—heat limits amplitude, proximity to transmitter demands quick equations. Charts taped to walls become tactile tools, not décor; their tremor then steadying mirrors Lyra’s success. Final image of lullaby drifting through vents ties setting to town-scale change.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preventing manufactured civil war—tightens when tricksters answer with colder counter-song, forcing Lyra’s phase-shift gambit. Escalation is causal and legible: each signal layer raises stakes until mirrored inversion collapses the weapon. Town’s drift from rage to curiosity is on-page proof of cost and change.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of vigilance vs. weaponized fear emerges through signal metaphor; no explicit moralizing. Final comet image reweights earlier dread into cautious possibility without tidy resolution. Subtext resides in subsonic layers—what humans almost hear but cannot name.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is precise, sensory, and technically literate—ozone, 17.3 hertz, Möbius strip—yet emotionally taut. Compression (“ghost sliding into a possessed body”) teaches pattern early; payoff is mirrored signal folding back on itself. No head-hop; POV stays locked in Lyra’s perceptual bias.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every clause advances signal, stakes, or atmosphere. Metaphors are controlled—no mixed vehicles. Rhythm accelerates with fader pushes and marker scrawl, then exhales in final lullaby. Zero loops or scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: SETI trope inverted—humanity hacks alien manipulation using lullabies and heartbeats. Specificity of 17.3 Hz, electromagnetic breath of Earth, and mirrored phase shift makes premise irreplaceable. Risky subsonic warfare pays off with coherent closure.</comment>
