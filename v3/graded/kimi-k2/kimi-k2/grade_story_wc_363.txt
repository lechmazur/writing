<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority is embodied and specific—her tactile grief, the swallowed thorn, the pulse of the bead against her breast. Motivation remains consistent and intensifies through micro-choices (selling the loom, kneeling at the basin, pressing the bead into the puzzle). The final renunciation—accepting one-way hope—earns its cost through prior causality. Minor slip: “stoically sparkling tears” edges toward label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the puzzle’s collapse and the bead’s liquefaction fling “return” along silence itself, reweighting the premise. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of hush, threads, sap, and loom accrues until the final cadence shift. Cost is legible in the dust and her empty hands. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The orchard’s moss, dew, cracked basin, and twisted apple boughs are filtered through Lira’s grief-narrowed perception. Micro-setting (the stump as workbench, the bead as lens) constrains her choices and charges the final image. Sensory economy favors touch and temperature over visual catalog. One minor spatial drift: monks’ rummage sale location relative to orchard remains vague.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—delivering the word “return”—is signaled early and tightens through each failed courier, each puzzle piece, until the final irrevocable fling. Escalation is Accumulative: silence thickens, fruit falls unheard, despair pricks, bead pulses. The price—one-way hope—lands on the page. No external antagonist needed; pressure is situational and internal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of silence as bridge emerges from the loom/puzzle/sap pattern without authorial statement. Final image reweights the premise: silence itself becomes carrier, not barrier. Subtext operates in gesture—pressing bead into gap, dust on empty hands. Resists moralizing; ambiguity lingers in the unheard reply.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with rhythmic control that mirrors the loom’s cadence (“warp threads stretched into a map”). Perceptual signature is consistent—Lira notices dew like glassy tears, sap like heartbeat. No POV leakage; interior texture coherent under stress. Compression (“hours slid into days”) is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and motion. Metaphors (tapestry, bones, harp strings) interlock without muddle. Minor loop: “stoically sparkling” appears twice; second instance edges toward cliché. No scaffolding or filter-verb stacks. Final line crystallizes without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: loom-as-map, sap-as-message, puzzle-as-silence. Risky lyric structure pays off in closure. Specificity of craft (shuttle-shaped pieces, warp threads) grounds the fantastical. Transformation test fails—story collapses if any element swapped. No derivative echoes.</comment>
