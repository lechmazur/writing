<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira’s contradictory impulses—duty to erase vs. self-preservation—are embodied in the micro-choice to keep cranking the gramophone; the final renunciation carries visible cost as she presses the handle into earth. Interiority is specific, never diagnostic. The only cap is that the “dynasty ender” label is stated more than dramatized until late.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Lira’s decision to end the dynasty by naming herself reweights all prior beats under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality holds—each beat deepens pattern until the final image. Cost is legible in the whispered name and surrendered crank.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The sepia reading room, gramophone, and crank form a micro-setting that constrains every choice; the golden shadows literally thicken around the decision point. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered. Only the palace foundation stone across the river is sketched more generically, keeping it just under 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—erase the bloodline—tightens when the confession reveals Lira is the heir. One decisive deepening under Accumulative lens: knowledge reweights the mission irrevocably. Cost is felt in the whispered name and relinquished crank.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of self-erasure vs. reclamation emerges organically from the dynastic plot; the final whispered name offers a non-literal answer that reweights every prior image. No moralizing—ambiguity lingers in the night wind.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is lush yet disciplined, with sepia-tinted diction and rhythmic control that modulates under pressure. POV remains tightly anchored to Lira; no head-hop. Distinct perceptual signature—“golden shadows pooling like spilled cognac”—carries through to closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; every sentence layers atmosphere or stakes. Occasional lyrical excess (“standing wave braid past and future”) flirts with overwriting yet serves the Accumulative lens. No loops or scaffold; final cadence lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The sound-as-memory device and self-destroying heir premise synthesize familiar tropes into a fresh, inevitable arc. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Transformation test passes: story collapses if any core element is swapped.</comment>
