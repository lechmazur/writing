<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied; the inspector’s grief and curiosity collide in the micro-choice to embed the grain in the capsule. The final endurance—whispering a promise to the orchid—earns the Earned Stasis closure with visible cost. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in scene, so the 9+ quick test is narrowly missed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the violet flash and shutter click crystallize the moment, reweighting the inspector’s lifelong cataloguing into active preservation. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each beat layers density until the final image. Cost is legible in the vaporized grain and draining battery.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The moonlit summit, the frost-rimed crater, and the potassium capsule all constrain tactics and charge the final image. Micro-setting (the capsule’s warmth beneath frost) functions as setting-as-pressure. No orientation drift; spatial choreography is exact.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—photograph the ghost orchid—tightens via the live countdown and battery drain. One meaningful deepening: the crater shifts from scar to cradle, forcing a stance crystallization. Cost is visible in the vaporized relic and the irreversible seven-minute bloom.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of preservation versus cataloguing emerges through the orchid’s bloom and the inspector’s promise. Final image (violet flash matching the orchid) offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. No thematic drift; ambiguity lingers in the ghost-white light.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with a perceptual signature that notices “fractures in a crater wall as if they were a love letter.” Compression and elision are taught early and paid off in the final cadence. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Rhythm modulates with pressure—short clauses under countdown, longer breaths during reflection.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise synthesizes orbital decay, lunar botany, and chemical timers into a fresh, inevitable whole. The ghost orchid’s seven-minute bloom under vacuum is a non-obvious stake that feels predestined. Risk-taking (lyric countdown, vaporized relic) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
