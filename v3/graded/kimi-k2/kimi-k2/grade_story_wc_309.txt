<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elian’s interiority is vivid—his contradictory impulses (yearning vs. failure) are embodied in the keystone and the act of unstrapping crampons. The final renunciation is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: the keystone becomes “nothing more than stone.”</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the luminous drop pressed into soil reconfigures meaning (“the moment he stopped trying to be extraordinary”). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density and cadence shift tighten the stake without causal reversals—and the cost is felt in the keystone’s nullification.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is selective and purposeful: the icebound spire and the kitchen garden act as mirrored thresholds. The keystone itself functions as micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“what do you carry that you no longer need?”—is signaled early and deepens through each impossibility offered to the keystone. The tightening occurs when Elian releases his failures; the cost is the keystone’s loss of magic.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: the sacred in the simple is not discovered but surrendered to. The final image of the garden at dawn reweights prior material without moralizing, offering resonant ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; perceptual signature is consistent (“brilliant dimness,” “lingering luminance”). Patterned elision (mist walking mechanics) is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; no loops or scaffold. Metaphors are coherent (“cold shot through him like forgotten music”). Final cadence shift is clean and unmarred by artifacts.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Familiar tropes (failed mage, magical object) are transformed through specific, grounded choices: the keystone as garden folly remnant, mist walking as belief in vapor. The synthesis feels inevitable and fresh.</comment>
