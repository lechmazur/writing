<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The carpenter’s interiority is embodied in tactile sanding, pocketing the halo, and the first sung note; his contradictory silence vs. song drives every beat. The final renunciation—stepping onto the swan while mouthing unheard words—earns the cost of permanent voicelessness. No second character on page, so relationship crucible waived. Reflection stays within BRR limits and alters present tactics.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—each lyrical beat thickens pattern until the carousel’s spin reconfigures meaning. Closure is a Charged Poise: the train lurches forward under silver rails, carrying reborn menagerie while the carpenter’s unheard smile signals irreversible cost. Orientation anchored by lantern, frost, and train within 120 words. No lens ambiguity; pattern taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Frozen circus train, velvet dust, cracked mirror, and carousel brass are vivid, selective, and bias-filtered. The halo fragment and wind bells function as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from boxcar to dining car to carousel platform. Weather (iron snow) affects mood and stakes without cliché.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: coax silence into living form. Escalation is textural—each sung note brightens halo, reanimates painted beasts, and tightens the cost of irreversible voicelessness. One decisive deepening when the carpenter presses the full halo into the carousel core. No external antagonist; pressure is internal and lyrical, sufficient for 600–800 words.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: silence as raw canvas, song as generative act. Subtext lives in gesture—mouthing unheard words, halo blooming without declaration. Final image reweights premise: silence was never absence but invitation. No moralizing; resonance arises from specific particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is hushed, lyrical, and consistent; perceptual signature notices “misting hush,” “iron snow,” “whispering gleam.” Syntax modulates with emotional rise—long breaths in calm beats, clipped fragments under halo flare. No dialogue, so dialogue bullets waived. Patterned elision (e.g., “he sang to interpret silence”) is taught early and legible at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet clear; figurative language serves pattern without clutter. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Rhythm accelerates during carousel ignition, then softens into final whisper. Occasional elevated diction (“pearlescent,” “menagerie”) fits the lyrical register and does not obscure causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Familiar circus-after-dark trope is transformed through the carpenter’s silent carpentry and sung resurrection. Halo fragment, wind bells, and carousel reanimation feel specific to this voice. Final reconfiguration—train rolling under silver dawn—grows inevitably from prior pattern. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
