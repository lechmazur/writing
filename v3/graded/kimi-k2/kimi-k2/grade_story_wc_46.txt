<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority is concrete—embodied trembling, salt taste, memory flashes that tilt her present tactics. The polishing micro-choice sequence reveals a hierarchy of values: memory vs. hope, silence vs. light. Final renunciation (leaving the pearl) carries visible cost: she forfeits sole guardianship of the sky. One slip: “weight she had carried for years” edges toward label-speak before the salt-taste grounds it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the pearl exhales light, reweighting the village’s night and Lira’s solitude. Causal chain—glass thinned by remembered patience → absorbed → pearl glow—holds without gaps. Orientation anchored by grotto lip and tide pools within 120 words. Cost is legible: the glass is gone, the pearl left behind, village wicks spared.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Serpentine grotto’s salt-slick walls and phosphorescence constrain movement and supply the basin for polishing; the pearl’s stillness is a micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy favors touch and reflected starlight, narrowing under pressure. No spatial drift; distance from cliff to village tracked cleanly. Environment actively guides her polishing rhythm and final exit path.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“share light without fire”—is signaled early and tested by the polishing sequence. One meaningful tightening: once the glass is thinned to translucence, failure means permanent darkness for the village. Cost is visible: loss of the shard and of private star-memories. Pressure escalates through tactile beats rather than external antagonist.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</question><comment>Theme of carrying sky/memory emerges from the mother’s last words and Lira’s tactile labor; no authorial thesis stated. Final image—children lit by aurora-glow, “stars learned how to stay”—offers non-literal resonance. Ambiguity lingers: whose memory is now communal? Subtext in the pearl’s silence and the sharkskin apology enriches without explaining.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise: “zephyr bloom of dawn teasing the horizon with pale roses” teaches the pattern early and pays off in the pearl’s soft exhale. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is Lira’s star-tuned attention. Compression like “memory became her method” is taught and legible. Rhythm modulates with pressure—long breaths during polishing, short pulses at the exhale.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; each sentence advances image or tactic. Figurative language is selective—no mixed metaphors. No loops or scaffold; “salt and memory on her lips” condenses three senses in five words. Minor elevation “reflectively vibrant hues” is earned by prior specificity. Final paragraph cadence mirrors the pearl’s quiet bloom.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fusion of gem-polishing ritual with starlight capture feels inevitable yet fresh; the pearl of stillness subverts typical “magic orb” trope by drinking rather than emitting. Risk in lyric compression pays off: the ending’s conceptual repricing (shared sky) could not occur without the exact polishing method. No derivative echoes; specificity of sharkskin apology and anemone silk grounds invention.</comment>
