<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is textured and embodied; the keeper’s contradictory impulses—clinging vs. letting go—are dramatized through the spiral of driftwood and the flute fracture. Motivation is rooted in past failure yet evolves in-scene toward a new stance. The final renunciation of “wall” for “song” carries visible cost: the guardianship scar and the fracture acknowledgment. Minor slip: “avalanchingly quiet” repeats without new pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the spiral reconfigures the breach from barrier to shared song, cost etched in the keeper’s scar and the widened fracture. Causal chain—markers → spiral → flute resonance—holds under Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is swift; driftwood compass and canyon hush anchor reader. One micro-turn (spiral loosening into wave) tightens stakes without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Thunder-echo range and canyon hush function as active pressure: the “moaning crack” and “bell struck once” shape the keeper’s ritual. Driftwood markers and basalt shelf constrain body placement and spiral geometry. Sensory detail is selective—wind shift, gold leaf warmth—filtered through keeper’s guilt. Final image of range exhaling recharges the quiet as shelter, not accusation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to live with the breach—escalates via spiral tightening and flute fracture widening. Agency drives every beat: arranging markers, counting heartbeats, sealing fracture with acknowledgment. Cost is visible: guardianship dissolved, sigil burned black, scar literalized. No coincidence resolves; the keeper’s stance crystallizes into tending the wound.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from action: failure as fertile ground, keeping as tending not sealing. Subtext resides in spiral geometry and flute fracture—braiding worlds gently. Final note “acknowledged the space between” offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. Complexity lingers: no tidy repair, only ongoing song across tear.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; “avalanchingly quiet” coined once, then echoed with earned variation. Syntax mirrors keeper’s ritual pacing—long breaths, then clipped clicks of driftwood. Perceptual signature filters every detail through post-failure hyper-awareness. No POV drift; interior texture stays coherent under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid; each sentence layers action, memory, and sensory cue without scaffold. Metaphors (“folded space like silk”) are fresh and integrated. Minor repetition of “avalanchingly quiet” is the only loop. Rhythm modulates from hush to spiral tightening to single resonant note.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fantasy premise is grounded in tactile ritual; driftwood compass and flute fracture feel inevitable. Transformation of guardianship from wall to song is non-obvious yet earned. Specificity—gold leaf etched with gate/eye sigil—anchors universals. Risk in lyric mode pays off; no gimmickry.</comment>
