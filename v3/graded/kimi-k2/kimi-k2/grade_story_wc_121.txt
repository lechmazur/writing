<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The gravity-defier is revealed through embodied contradictions—hovering yet weighed down by memory. Micro-choices (kneeling on cracked hospital marble, hurling the tablet) crystallize her values under pressure, earning a wrenching renunciation that forecloses returning. Interiority never drifts into therapy-speak; flaws remain credibly self-destructive.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Elegant hybrid lens: causal trunk braided with textural reconfiguration. Closure lands via a decisive act (surrender the tablet) whose felt代价 is gravity reclaimed—before/after legible, visible cost on the page. Orientation anchors in the first paragraph and never breaks; procedural generation teaches its pattern early and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Meticulous specificity: the viaduct’s mutable bricks, rain channeling into runnels, hospital marble floor—all constrain movement and amplify dread. Selection is filtered through POV fatigue and fear; weather and architecture evolve with events. Micro-setting qualifies as charged reprise (closing room reappears).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—surrender the compulsion to retrace—escalates continuously. Each beat reconfigures options: tablet rewords prophecy, procedural arch dissolves into repeating hospital tiles, timeline knitting begins after the tablet vanishes. Pressure stays coherent under the situational lens; no late resets.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from character desire to conquer the inner labyrinth; no statement ever labels it. Final image—“only the widening circle of now”—reweights prior material without moralizing. Complex ambiguity maintained; no tidy epiphany.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Distinct perceptual cadence—shifts from lyric cosmological to tactile fear. Present-tense lyric mode taught early; every deviation chosen for pressure (vaulted Gothic → brutalist slab). No head-hopping; internal stay consistent with exterior collapse.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Poise under poetic pressure: high image density but no overwriting. Syntax modulated to pace—short staccato for rupture, longer clauses for memory loop. Zero redundant scaffold; each sentence soldiers plot or theme. Filter-verb stack avoided in high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Transforms portal fantasy tropes into metaphysical self-confrontation. Periodical tablet, procedural viaduct, labyrinth-without-walls combine in a synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking never collapses clarity; closure remains legible.</comment>
