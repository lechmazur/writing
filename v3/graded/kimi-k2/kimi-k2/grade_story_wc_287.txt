<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is embodied and specific—her knees creak, her throat tightens, her palms cup a match-flame of hope. The contradictory impulses (pragmatism vs. wistful planting) are dramatized in the moment she whispers “Not yet,” choosing to shield rather than smother the green bead. The final touch of the gauge tooth against the bud crystallizes her stance with visible cost: she has foreclosed sleep and risked heartbreak to keep the rose’s song alive.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the buds are now “tight as secrets,” and the garden itself becomes “a small, defiant lantern.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each cane’s faint green pearl layers density until the final image reweights the premise. Cost is legible in the violet-bruised dawn and the creaking knees; the persistent constraint is the rose’s near-death, which shapes every tactic.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The luminous harbor, moonlit masts, and rust-flaked fire escape are filtered through Mira’s gardener’s eye—she notices sap, petal drift, and lantern sway. The setting constrains her reach (one fire escape, one rose) and supplies the moonlight she weaponizes for growth. The final image of the garden as a lantern above the city recharges every prior sensory cue.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—can the rose be coaxed back to life?—is signaled by the drifting petal and tightened each time Mira presses the gauge tooth to a cane. One meaningful deepening occurs when the first bead of green appears; options narrow from “let it die” to “shield this flame.” The cost is her vigil and vulnerability, visible in the violet dawn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the concrete act of coaxing life from decay: light can be instilled, not merely reflected. The lock-as-garden metaphor reweights itself when the buds become “tight as secrets,” offering a non-literal answer to how darkness is countered. No moral is stated; the final image of the lantern-garden suffices.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The prose carries a hushed, tidal rhythm—long sentences ebb, then short pulses like oar strokes. Perceptual signature is consistent: Mira hears sap, feels vibration, sees moonlight as workable material. No head-hopping; the lyric compression is taught early and paid off in the final cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences are dense and propulsive—“a single bead of green appeared at the cut tip—a promise.” Figurative language is selective and purposeful; no mixed metaphors or loops. The final paragraph’s cadence slows to mirror the oar rhythm, then closes with crystalline clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The fire escape gardener who tunes roses like locks is a fresh synthesis; the gauge tooth as tuning fork for plant pulse is specific and non-obvious. Risk is taken in the lyric mode, yet closure remains legible. The transformation test passes—this could not be relocated without losing its marrow.</comment>
