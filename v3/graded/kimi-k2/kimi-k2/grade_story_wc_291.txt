<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s face-blindness and methodical numbering of brushstrokes embody interior contradiction; the ribbon reunion forces a micro-choice that visibly costs him his anonymity and detachment. Interiority stays concrete, never lapsing into label-speak. The final handing-over of the canvas is an earned renunciation with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the fused ribbon-circle reconfigures meaning and stakes without tidy answers, cost visible in Elias’s tears and the woman’s vanishing. Causal chain—painting absence → ribbon reunion → canvas surrendered—holds cleanly. Orientation is anchored by word 40; no drift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Quarry’s mist, limestone tiers, and ash-colored gesso are selective, tactile, and constrain every move; the ribbon’s silver threads catch moonlight to charge the final image. Spatial choreography remains coherent across the single continuous scene.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—awakening empathy for three vanished lives—tightens through the act of painting absence; the ribbon reunion narrows options to surrender or conceal. Agency is Elias’s throughout; cost is the exposure of his private ritual to the arriving officers.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of empathy as shared absence emerges organically from the painted voids and the ribbon’s re-union; no moralizing. Final image of the fused ribbon-circle offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights all prior absences.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet disciplined, with perceptual signature rooted in Elias’s synesthetic counting and negative-space seeing. No head-hopping; diction stays within his plausible lexicon. Compression and elision are pattern-taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and propulsive; figurative language is purposeful and never muddled. No loops, scaffold, or register drift. Sentence variety supports the mounting hush and final ignition of moonlight on ribbon.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Premise—face-blind artist who paints absence to solve cold cases—is fresh and fully committed. Risky lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specificity of numbered brushstrokes and ribbon fragment makes the synthesis inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
