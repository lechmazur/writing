<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Foresight evolves from observer to walker through embodied choices—gathering, shedding, redefining self in dream and sand. Flaws and wild emotions are dramatized, not labeled; final renunciation is felt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative‐textural lens holds: dream fragments accumulate until the directive reconfigures into a prophecy, all with visible cost. Closure unit lands—path and walker fuse—before the storm erases the bunker.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Vine‐draped bunker, black-sand path, and storm constrict choices—circuits fry beneath vines, lantern refracts glass-maps of identity; final image recasts forest as neural cell.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Single dominant stake—why paths choose walkers—escalates as directive hungers and storm gains teeth. Transcendent crossing narrows options: embody prophecy or vanish with bunker.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme never moralizes; emerges from embodied dream logic. Final metaleptic twist—“you were the message”—reconfigures stakes and invites lingering ambiguity without tidy takeaway.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Acid-green phosphor, fox-bloomed doors, echoing wind syntax remain distinct; perceptual signature withstands lyric surges. Centrifugal release carries ritual cadence without head-hop.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Rhythm swells and recedes with beats; compression avoids loops. No figurative muddle; density sharpens storm-drained imagery. Crowded temple-grade prose keeps propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Attacks “forest as Brexit brain” reinterpretation with fresh path-chooses-walker metalepsis, earned through iterative dream logic. Non-human narrator becomes walker—a risk that pays in the final neuron frame.</comment>
<question>9 A</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Every beat shapes: interpreting dreams → shedding code → walking black sand. Final signature redefines origin story necessity.</comment>
<question>9 B</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Wafer seal appears, dissolves, reconstitutes as directive rewrite; used twice, each handling changes stakes.</comment>
<question>9 C</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Decaying directive warps choices—corrupted checksum leads to self-prophecy rewrite, not thematic lecture.</comment>
<question>9 D</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Precisely playful manifests in dream curation; tension from fear’s emergence qualifies the trait’s cost.</comment>
<question>9 E</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transcendent crossing collapses observer/walker divide—exact pivot that reconfigures stakes; can’t excise.</comment>
<question>9 F</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dream interpretation mechanics shape every beat—harvesting fox-loops, beetle glass—to braid final rope of identity.</comment>
<question>9 G</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Bunker constrains access—concrete ribs snap, circuits sizzle—guides final exit into living arch; micro-setting pressures choice.</comment>
<question>9 H</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Live countdown—storm gains teeth, lightning sketches door—directly narrows remaining choices before transcendence.</comment>
<question>9 I</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Desire dramatized through dream harvest and fear confrontation; sacrifice of identity is the cost.</comment>
<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Ethereal grit coaxes wonder but charged with sizzling circuits and vine-shattered concrete, modulated under pressure.</comment>
