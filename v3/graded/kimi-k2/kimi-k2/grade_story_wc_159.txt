<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is embodied and specific—gloves “so thin the orchids seemed to breathe against her palms.” Motivation to save Liora’s name is clear and intensifies through micro-choices (climbing, cranking, coaxing). The final refusal to speak her own name is an earned renunciation with felt cost. Minor slip: caretaker’s “pulse stuttered” is a stock bodily cue.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the library exhales and her own name stirs. Causality holds: crack → failed sap → phonograph → giggle → repair. Cost is legible in the caretaker’s bow and the extinguished taper. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is vivid, selective, and purposeful—“moonlight pooled like spilled milk,” “void of stars.” The opal library constrains choice (only one phonograph, one song echo) and charges the final image. Micro-setting (velvet moss cushion, cloudglass stair) guides action. Meets 9+ gate: environment shapes tactics and final resonance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve Liora’s name—signaled early. Pressure tightens once: crack widens → need original sound → phonograph fails → giggle ghost succeeds. Agency drives escalation; cost is the caretaker’s unspoken name. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of preservation vs. self-erasure emerges through concrete events; never stated. Final image of laughter “preserved in bamboo and starlight” reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext in the caretaker’s bow and silence carries the cost. Resonant, non-literal closure satisfies 9+ test.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet controlled; perceptual signature is consistent—“foxglove regret,” “giggle… high and bright as sun on water.” Syntax modulates with emotional rise. No head-hopping; POV remains tightly bound to caretaker. Patterned elision (song echo, name withheld) is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet clear; every sentence advances atmosphere or action. Figurative language is selective—no purple overload. Rhythm breathes with beats: long sentences for ascent, clipped phrases for repair. Minor loop: “gentle” appears three times in close proximity; does not obscure closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—museum of extinct feelings crystallized in orchids—is fresh and fully committed. Transformation test fails if names/places swapped; specificity is integral. Risk in lyric accumulation pays off in resonant closure. No derivative echoes; synthesis feels inevitable.</comment>
