<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction—guilt vs. longing—drives every micro-choice; the unsnapping of the puppet’s helm is an embodied renunciation that costs him his solitary exile. Memory return is earned by the tactile grafting of silver cords, not narrated. Flaw (desertion) complicates the final step into branching dawns. Voice stays singular; no second character on page, so relationship bullets N/A.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pattern density (violet light, silver sap, choreography) tightens until the greenhouse folds. Closure is Charged Poise: the corridor of branching dawns reconfigures all prior motion with undeniable cost (the cocoon self-immolates). Orientation anchored by line 3; no drift. Causality intact: puppet stirs → sap rises → knight grafted → new axis hatched.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Alchemical greenhouse is not backdrop; its phosphor-apples bleed silver sap that literally stitches possibility into flesh. Micro-setting (wooden crate, glass pane) constrains the final choice—glass melts under palm, forcing the step outward. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV: cedar, greasepaint, dusted lavender map Calen’s nostalgia. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from arch to crate to pane.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—redeem the forgotten oath—signaled in line 2. Escalation is accretive: each remembered knot tightens the cost of refusal. The unsnapping beat narrows options from exile to re-performance; the price is the dissolution of the greenhouse, his only refuge. Agency remains Calen’s; coincidence absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>Theme emerges: memory as performance that re-stitches reality. Subtext in the puppet’s mirror-face and the orchard’s bleeding sap—artifice feeding life. Final corridor of dawns offers non-literal answer: possibility is cultivated only by surrendering the shelter of forgetting. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in “branching dawns.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Voice is knightly-lyric: archaic cadence (“gauntleted fingers trembling with shivering bliss”) yet precise. Perceptual signature filters every object through loss—phosphor-apples smell of greasepaint because theater once toured the keeps. No dialogue; internal monologue stays character-bound. No POV drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; each sentence layers image and motion. Metaphors are coherent—“silver sap braiding translucent cords”—and serve the textile motif. No loops or scaffold. Rhythm modulates: longer sentences for wonder, clipped fragments at the unsnapping. No artifacts in closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</question><comment>Premise fuses puppet theater, alchemy, and knightly guilt into a fresh mythic engine. Transformation test fails if names/places swapped—cedar-greasepaint scent and plague of forgetting are irreducibly specific. Risk: greenhouse as cocoon hatching time is bold yet legible. No derivative echoes.</comment>
