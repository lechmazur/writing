<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rowan’s guilt and Elias’s refusal collide in embodied micro-choices (handing over the heart, the wrist-grab), but the chaplain’s interiority flirts with therapeutic summary (“people deserve more than wind”). The cost is felt—Rowan leaves the heart behind—yet Elias’s turn feels slightly under-motivated on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because Rowan smashed Elias’s workshop, therefore he finishes the heart; because the heart beats Elias’s hymn, therefore the apology becomes action. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Elias’s hand on Rowan’s wrist reconfigures their shared sentence. Cost is legible in Rowan’s empty pocket.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The cedar-and-brass shop, the velvet pad, the chapel’s pipe organ all constrain choices (only Vale can repair, only the chapel allows the final scene). The storm’s single silver shaft literalizes the “light through crack” motif and charges the final image without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can an apology become action?—tightens when Elias refuses words, forcing Rowan to build. The clockwork heart is the visible price; the wrist-grab crystallizes the shift. No coincidence resolves the conflict; agency drives every beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the mechanism itself: time and forgiveness are gears that must be wound by hand. The final heartbeat offers a non-literal answer—some mechanisms keep turning after the maker is gone—without moralizing. Subtext lives in the unspoken “sentence” both men now share.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is hushed yet vibrant, syntax mimicking the tick-tock cadence (“soft clink… sigh of bellows”). Rowan’s perceptual signature—smells, textures, hymns—remains consistent. Dialogue is sparse but subtext-rich: “Second opinions” carries the weight of both repair and parole.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and propulsive; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language (“storm-season slate eyes”) is sparse and purposeful. The final paragraph’s “aftersong of gears and forgiveness” lands with earned lyric force.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The clockwork heart as apology-engine feels fresh; the prison hospice toy workshop detail grounds the premise. Risk is taken in the quiet, non-confrontational climax, and it pays off. No derivative templates or stock tropes.</comment>
