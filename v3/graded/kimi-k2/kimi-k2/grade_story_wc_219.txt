<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s interior contradiction—skepticism vs. longing—drives every beat; the amber choice at the summit is earned by prior refusals and embodied cost. Micro-choices (tracing “Converge,” kneeling to the orchid) reveal hierarchy of values. Only the grandmother backstory drifts into summary, not scene, keeping it just below 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the bronze woman dissolves into light that embraces Mara, reweighting “chemistry of homecoming” with visible ancestral cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each sensory layer distills departure into recognition. No orientation debt; causality intact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The tower’s rainwashed stone, bronze statues, and bioluminescent pollen constrain movement and charge the final ascent. Micro-setting (fly amber, blue orchid) doubles as tool and mirror. Sensory selection tightens under pressure; no static cataloging.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“understand the chemistry of homecoming”—tightens once when Mara realizes it is fermentation, not formula. Cost is felt in the embrace that floods her with ancestral miles. Agency drives every escalation; coincidence complicates but does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the contradiction of departure/return catalyzed in one molecule; no moralizing. Final image of bronze becoming wings reweights prior statues without statement. Subtext lives in gesture and silence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct lyric texture—phosphorescent skin, “bronze quiet,” “liquid narrative”—remains coherent under pressure. POV modesty maintained; no head-hopping. Compression and elision taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High density, zero loops; figurative language disciplined to pattern. Rhythm accelerates with ascent. Only minor register drift (“conceptual repricing” moment risks abstraction) keeps it from 9+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of archival sci-fi and pilgrimage myth; bronze statues that liquefy into ancestral wings feels inevitable yet new. Risky lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specificity anchors universals.</comment>
