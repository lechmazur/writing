<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The locksmith’s interiority is vivid and embodied—his ribs fluttering with trapped melody, the scent of cedar and thunderstorm on the ribbon—but the final exchange with Aelira is slightly too tidy, muting the cost of his seven-year quest. His contradictory impulse (to free the idea yet fear its release) is dramatized in the disorientation beat, earning the closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the melody’s release reconfigures the plaza and the sky itself, with the ribbon tied around the locksmith’s wrist as visible cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—the story’s density and cadence shift at the gate-dissolve beat—without causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The shadowed nexus, cobblestones drinking dusk, and the first star’s pulse are selective, purposeful, and constrain the locksmith’s ritual. The ribbon functions as micro-setting, threading through the keyhole and charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—freeing the melody trapped behind fear—is signaled early and tightened when the locksmith disorients himself to melt the bars forged from ridicule. The cost is visible: the brass key rendered useless, the ribbon transferred to his wrist as reminder.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: ideas imprisoned by fear long to be sung. The final image of clocks striking nonexistent hours and streetlamps waking reweights the premise without moralizing. The ribbon’s reprise crystallizes the thematic cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with rhythmic control under pressure (“shadows lengthening like curious fingers”). Compression and elision are taught early and paid off in the spinning-darkness beat. No head-hopping; POV remains locked to the locksmith.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; every sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. No loops or scaffold. Metaphors (“storm of luminous notes”) are coherent and earned. Final line’s echo is crisp and resonant.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The premise—melody as imprisoned idea freed by ritualized disorientation—feels fresh and inevitable. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The transformation test passes: story would collapse if any core image were swapped.</comment>
