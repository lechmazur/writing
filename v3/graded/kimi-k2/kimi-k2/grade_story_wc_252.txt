<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira’s contradictory impulses—grace as camouflage vs. grace as weapon—are embodied in every micro-choice; the final dance detaches her from fear with coral anklets as visible cost. Interiority stays concrete, never lapses into label-speak. One slip: the ex-pirates’ offer is voiced rather than tested, slightly blunting relationship-as-crucible pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Lira’s dance re-weights the island’s grief into home, cost paid in permanent exile. Causal chain holds—scrimshaw summons → dive → acceptance → island solidifies—under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is swift; no teleporting props.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sublittoral fringe, whalebone, and coral foundations are not backdrop but active constraints: kelp cathedral guides her descent, coral roots moor her choice. Sensory hierarchy narrows under pressure; starlight through bladder wrack charges the final image. One minor drift: “impossible air” could be sharper.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—trade silence for authentic fierceness—tightens once when the island’s dawn deadline forces the dance. Cost is visible: she forfeits the pier forever. Pressure escalates via pattern intensification rather than causal reversals, fitting the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of freedom-as-alignment emerges from concrete particulars: crates waltzed, coral anklets, laughter braided with whale song. Final image reweights earlier grace-as-camouflage into grace-as-cutlass without moralizing. Subtext in gesture and silence sustains complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; perceptual signature filters every detail through Lira’s dancer’s kinesthetic bias. Rhythm modulates with pressure—long cadences in reflection, staccato in dive. No head-hopping; scrimshaw’s warmth and whale’s chorus stay within her sensorium.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence layers image and motion. No loops or scaffold; metaphors (kelp cathedral, coral anklets) are coherent and purposeful. One near-muddle: “combative tenderness” risks abstraction but is earned by context.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise—post-treaty harbor where violence is impossible—flips pirate tropes into a quiet exodus. Disappearing island as refuge from shame is fresh, inevitable in hindsight. Risk in lyric compression pays off; no derivative echoes.</comment>
