<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied; the dice as scar anchors motive. The final reach through the boundary crystallizes a credible renunciation with felt cost. Minor drift into abstract self-diagnosis (“regret is simply the integral…”) slightly dilutes immediacy.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the staircase re-forms gentler, inscribed with the limit of regret. Causal chain—dice roll → crack → proof → dissolution—holds under Accumulative/Textural lens. Cost is legible in the vanished step and the single die left behind.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The staircase’s texture (cold marble, chalk dust, amber fissure) constrains every choice and charges the final image. Micro-setting of the risers as blackboard for proofs integrates setting with action. No orientation debt; spatial anchors are immediate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—balancing regret via perpetual motion—tightens when the crack offers reunion yet demands proof. Escalation is one deepening: the staircase rearranges into the slope of her shoulder, forcing stance crystallization. Cost is the lost second die and the suspended instant.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of regret as convergent series emerges through concrete particulars (dice, equations, perfume) without statement. Final image reweights the premise: the limit is the texture before the dice settle. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers cleanly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct—mathematical yet tactile, grim yet hopeful. Syntax mirrors obsessive recursion (“perpetual motion requires an observer…”). No head-hopping; POV stays locked and perceptual signature consistent under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and propulsive; each line advances image or equation. One mixed metaphor (“heartbeat of the proof”) is minor. No loops or scaffold; information density is high without clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Transforms the trope of endless stairs into a recursive proof-space; dice as memory-token feels inevitable. Synthesizes math grief and love-loss in a way that would collapse if any element were swapped. Risky lyric structure pays off in closure.</comment>
