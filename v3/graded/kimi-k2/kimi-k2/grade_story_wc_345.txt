<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Luma’s altruism is embodied in every spectral gesture; Kiran’s arc from machine-raised orphan to orchard-keeper is dramatized through micro-choices (tracing chalk, lifting the bell). Interiority is sparse but character-specific, and the final renunciation—Luma dissolving into perpetual dew—carries visible cost. Minor: the mechanic, twins, and archivist are sketched more as functions than individuals.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Luma’s dissolution re-weights the nebula’s anchoring from ghost to community. Causal chain holds—chalk messages → Kiran’s reexamination → collective weaving → nebula descent. One transition (dawn-to-dawn montage) is legible. No orientation debt; stakes and lens remain coherent.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Orchard planet, floating arches, and butterfly gardens are rendered through purposeful sensory selection (lavender cloud, midnight-blue blossoms). The watering bell and chalked sidewalks act as micro-settings that constrain choices. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions. The final image—bell at the heart, arches singing—charges the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake: nebula collapse vs. collective healing. Escalation tightens once: chalk plea → irrigation net → nebula descent. Agency is communal but driven by Luma’s orchestration and Kiran’s first reexamination. Cost is felt—fatigue, fear of slipping knots—and crystallized in Luma’s permanent dissolution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</question><comment>Theme of chosen family emerges from concrete acts (watering, knot-tying) rather than assertion. Final chalk line offers resonant, non-literal answer: “Family is the orchard we choose to tend together.” Subtext operates in the bell’s hum and the arches’ song. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in “brambled hope.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person omniscient drifts close to Luma’s spectral perception and Kiran’s wonder without head-hopping. Diction is lyrical yet controlled (“translucent hands brushing petals”). Rhythm modulates with pressure—short beats during weaving, expansive cadence at nebula descent. No dialogue, so voice distinction is carried by focalization.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; each sentence advances image or causality. Figurative language is selective (“miniature galaxies that hummed with brambled hope”). No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Minor elevated diction (“nebular dew”) remains consistent with fairy-tale register.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Refugee ghost sustaining a planet through chalk and communal ritual is a fresh synthesis. Tropes (ghost mentor, chosen family) are transformed through the watering bell’s dew-anchored physics and the orchard’s floating arches. Specificity of “constellation-enameled monarch-wing bell” anchors the fantastical. Risk-taking in lyric structure pays off at closure.</comment>
