<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Neris’s obsession with mapping and her quiet drive are embodied in tactile micro-choices—climbing the ridge, pressing the whistle to the crack—each action tightening the stakes. The interior contradiction between curiosity and dread is dramatized when her lips bleed into the reed, a visceral cost that forecloses retreat. The lost explorers serve as pressure rather than relationship, so relationship crucible is waived. Final renunciation—walking through the gate—earns its cost by the prior bodily toll and the city’s tremor.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the gate opens, watchers dissolve, and the city’s dream is prolonged—cost paid in Neris’s bloodied lips and the turtles’ sigh. Causal chain holds: crack-song summons staircase, glyph-melody revives explorers, mirrored chord dissolves watchers. Orientation is anchored by coral-white balconies and fused shells within 120 words. No lens ambiguity; causal logic drives every beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The fused-turtle metropolis is not backdrop; its shell fractures guide Neris’s mapping and the final chord. Micro-setting of the glowing nacre staircase constrains descent and discovery. Sensory hierarchy—salt air, warm exhalation—filters through Neris’s cartographer bias. Final image of the gate’s sliver of daylight recharges the horizon watchers’ silhouettes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—escape or acceptance—tightens when the crack widens and the lost expedition warns of inheritance. Escalation is causal: each whistle sequence narrows options until the mirrored chord forces the decisive release. Cost is visible—blood, trembling city, dissolving watchers. No coincidence resolves; agency remains Neris’s.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of mapping as both liberation and doom emerges from Neris’s embodied choices, never stated. The watcher-glyph’s recurrence reweights from omen to key, culminating in the mirrored chord that reconfigures meaning. Final image—gate closing behind the freed—offers non-literal meditation on waking dreams. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is Neris’s perceptual signature: cartographer’s precision fused with salt-tinged awe. Syntax tightens under pressure—“played until her lips bled”—mirroring urgency. No head-hopping; focalization stays locked. Dialogue from explorers is spare, rusted, goal-driven.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers map, sound, and shell. No loops or scaffold; “coral-white balconies” and “tide-worn glass” are specific and earned. Rhythm accelerates with the fractal cracks, then exhales at the gate. Metaphors stay coherent—shell as continent, watchers as ink.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fused-turtle city, cartographer-musician, watcher-glyphs: synthesis feels inevitable yet fresh. Premise commits fully; no retreat to allegory. Risk in merging sound-mapping with bodily cost pays off in the bloodied whistle climax. Transformation test fails if relocated—specificity anchors invention.</comment>
