<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is sensorily embodied ("salt-stained palm," "rasp of conscience"); micro-choices under pressure (paddling toward fog, surrendering compass) reveal a lucid value hierarchy. The final hand-in-hand image renounces but keeps the ache, meeting the 9+ quick test yet capped at 8.7 because the “backlash = love” line skirts diagnostic label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elegant Causal arc: cracked compass → utility-pole rosary → regret-ridden passage → compass surrendered in kayak cradle; each beat narrows options toward earned stasis. Closure lands on page with visible price (compass stays behind) and reorients life to “forward.” Minor late arrival of hidden lagoon slightly softens anchoring.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fog, black chop, barnacle scrape, bioluminescent water, utility-pole constellation—all filter through POV bias and physically constrain paddle strokes or perception. The kayak itself becomes micro-setting steering toward lagoon. One slight white-room risk as shoreline lights evaporate but coherence restored by glowing plankton.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Central stake—“align heart and action” despite the daughter’s loss—escalates as each paddle stroke costs breath and regret compounds direction. Tightening choice: exit passage into ghost lagoon where options narrow to reunion or final letting go. Regret as magnetic force borders externalization but agency remains internal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Regret and love intertwine through concrete particulars (kayak paddle scraping barnacles = rasp of conscience). Final lagoon image of single buoy replaces abstract lament with charged poise. Avoid overt thesis except for daughter’s gentle aphorism—nudges without capsizing resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical second-person-cum-close-third, rhythmic tide of clauses matching stroke cadence. Vocabulary (merrily melancholic, backlash, cradle) both precise and thematically tuned; purposeful patterned repetition (“merrily melancholic”) teaches mood modulation. No POV slippage or register drift under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sentence variety swells and contracts like breathing; metaphor vehicles (utility lights as rosary beads, compass glass cracked) cohere without clutter. Occasional near-repetition of “merry melancholy” barely grazes loop threshold. Final image kayak rocking as cradle is crystalline and information-dense.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of search-and-grief narrative through nautical metaphysical compass; no stock rescue ending but a private mythos that feels inevitable. Risk choice: utility poles as navigational star map—outlandish yet earned by early setup and payoff.</comment>
