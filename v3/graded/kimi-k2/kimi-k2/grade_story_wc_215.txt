<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The recluse carries clear motivation—fleeing a broken covenant and seeking truth in ruin—yet interior contradiction remains muted; his final act of reading is less a choice than an inevitable reflex. Emotional cost registers on the woman’s propolis tears and the box’s tangible weight, implying character debt rather than dramatizing it on page. Still, actions and memories align with the revealed vocation and guilt, satisfying coherence under the situational lens.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>A Resonant Reconfiguration lands as each ghost adds weight to the box and then dissipates into the hive-spiral, reconfiguring the ruin into living memory. Tight linkage holds: “the covenant etched into the ruin itself” crystallizes meaning and cost without exposition. The final image of luminous ghost-bees refracting covenant light tightens stakes cleanly; no causality break.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The abandoned oasis enacts pressure: scorched wax rivulets, charcoal stilted stands, spirals of hive rows—each constrains movement and translates confession. Micro-setting doubles as oracle; the reader learns covenant rules through tactile attention to hive remnants. Environment constrains tactics in the recluse’s tracing of runic melts and dictates the closing light show.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Central stake—the need to name silence—escalates as each withheld promise adds mass to the stained glass box; pressure coheres under Accumulative/Textural lens without external coincidences. Tightening arrives when the box grows “heavier with every syllable”; a felt price scales to the length. Closure reconfigures options rather than resolving external conflict, satisfying escalation test for lyric short work.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: broken covenant between humans and bees is confessed, not moralized, through refracted amber light and spectral smoke wisp. Particulars—the forget-me-not veil, propolis tears—lend tactile charge without overt symbolism. Final refracted light operates as conceptual repricing, reweighting the premise that silence becomes audible through communal inscription.</comment>

<comment>Third-limited holds steady; descriptive compression and sensory hierarchy reflect the scribe’s archival mind. Rhythm accelerates and breathes with box-counting litany. Non-standard cadence taught early and closed on the final wingbeat lock—no leakage. Perceptual signature—“color of propolis”—anchors POV specificity.</comment>

<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences layer high-density imagery without clogging: “charcoal stilts,” “amber rivulets like runes.” Loop-free, no tautology, precision in sensory hierarchy. Small repetition “the covenant” (four uses) tightens concept without drift; prose remains limpid and propels to closure.</comment>

<comment>The spectral beekeeper archive recasts post-apocalyptic quiet into ecological confession, an inversion rarely seen. Hive-rastered spiral functioning as covenant parchment is a fresh image, earned by earlier pattern. Ghosts coalescing into luminous swarms offers earned transcendence, not quirkiness.</comment>
