<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lyra's embodied choreography, bodily micro-choices, and encrypted motivation hold across every beat; cost is felt in the bite of shard on sternum. Her contradiction—stealing to liberate—stays etched in silence rather than explained.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Tidal-cipher causality tightens each dance-step; spider clock pays off in safe click. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: shard against heart re-weights “vulnerability as architecture” with lived price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Glass corridor's chill, strut-spinning spider, cube of finger-bone dice — each object constrains stance or clocks time. Over-description of flood-city atmosphere risks postcard drift once.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—liberate confessional shard—drives every sway; spider-thread countdown ratchets pressure to final pivot. No false intensification after first click.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through “pain rewritten as architecture” without a single overt lecture. Final image of city skylights blinking out re-weights prior secrecy into public consequence.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Visceral percussive syntax; each step lands as diction. POV remains single, deep interior; “breath as metronome” stays character-bound.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Compression and textured syntax succeed, but occasional stacked imagery (“bone-white ivorite…blood-red pigment…obsolete syllabary”) nudges toward overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Encrypted choreography and finger-bone dice merge lyric code & heist in a way that feels inevitable, not gimmick.</comment>
