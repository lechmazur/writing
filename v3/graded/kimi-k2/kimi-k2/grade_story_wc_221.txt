<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“confusion pooling like ink”), motives (refusal to abandon refugees) drive every beat, and the final renunciation—sketching instead of stepping across—carries visible cost. The compass rose as inherited talisman threads memory and choice, grounding the arc. Minor slip: “blessed pariah” label feels slightly external rather than self-earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the dilation field folds into the compass, Captain Lys breathes free, and the narrator reclaims navigator identity. Causal chain—sketching compresses time, reawakens engines—holds under Accumulative/Textural lens. Cost is legible in the deck’s darkening silence and the warm second heart of the compass.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Frost that never melted, spiraling stars, and the chronometer frozen at 03:17 anchor who/where/when within 120 words. The observation deck’s relativistic gradients physically tilt the floor, constraining every step. Micro-setting (compass rose) charges the final image by containing reclaimed time.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to join the refugees or restore time—tightens when the compass needle steadies on “vector of will.” One decisive intensification: sketching accelerates into engine-reviving compression. Cost is the exile’s identity shift from pariah to navigator, paid on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of time-as-wound versus time-as-map emerges through concrete acts: sketching spirals, aligning the compass, folding dilation into brass. Final image of “true north beating like a second heart” reweights the premise without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers—was the shutdown failure or doorway—yet feels earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with rhythmic control under pressure (“echoed silence settle over me like a shroud”). Perceptual signature filters cosmic scale through intimate tools—vellum, frost, brass. No POV drift; even Captain Lys’s gesture is mediated through the narrator’s sketching lens.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers sensory and temporal texture without redundancy. Metaphors (“slow lightning,” “time splintered”) are fresh and coherent. Zero loops or scaffold; the final cadence slows into the soft hum of engines, mirroring dilation’s release.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Transforms familiar time-dilation trope into intimate cartography of grief and reclamation. Specificity—grandmother’s sextant, 03:17 chronometer, star-chart vellum—anchors universals. Risky lyric compression pays off in the compass-as-heart image that reconfigures meaning.</comment>
