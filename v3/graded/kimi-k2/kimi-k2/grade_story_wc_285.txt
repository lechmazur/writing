<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Coachman's grief is embodied in every oar-stroke; the palimpsest promise is a lived contradiction that forces the final surrender of memory. Interiority stays concrete—no therapy-speak—and the micro-choice to hand over the smile is earned by prior causality with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the bead crystallizes the distilled grief and the crossing is rewritten. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each beat layers density until the final image reweights all prior crossings. Cost is legible in the warm, weightless bead slipped beside the candle stub.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fog, river, and lantern are not backdrop but active constraints: the mist summons the needle, the black water erases wake, the lantern’s pupil-like flame studies the coachman. The micro-setting of the skiff itself becomes the crucible where memory is traded.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—ferrying distilled grief—is signaled in line 3 and tightens with each tick of the gutters. The coachman’s agency narrows to a single irrevocable trade; the felt cost is the loss of the last intact memory of his daughter’s smile.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory as palimpsest emerges from the coachman’s embodied choices, not assertion. The final bead is a non-literal answer that reweights every prior crossing; no moral is stated, only the hush that follows distilled sorrow.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is weathered, salt-bitter, and rhythmically controlled: “the river hisses, the fog percolates.” Perceptual signature is consistent—every observation filtered through the coachman’s occupational fatigue and grief. No head-hopping; compression and elision are taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet limpid: “palimpsest promises—each crossing writes over the last, yet the earlier vow bleeds through.” Zero loops, high information density, figurative language serves pressure not ornament. Final image is unmarred by artifact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Ferryman trading distilled memory via blackened yarn needle is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of mythic and mundane. The conceit commits fully; removing any element would collapse the logic. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
