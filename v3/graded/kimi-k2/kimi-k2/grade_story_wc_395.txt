<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her heartbeat syncing to “117” crystallizes her stakes. The choice to lie and smuggle the patch is earned by prior grief and the discovered betrayal. The only drag is a touch of diagnostic self-awareness (“she understood then…”) that slightly blunts the moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Mara’s lullaby-song becomes the archive’s final harmonic, the crew’s silhouettes flicker goodbye, and the patch is now a locket of memory. Causal chain holds—every breadcrumb of 117 tightens toward the 0117-hour deadline. Cost is palpable: she forfeits her job and safety to keep the song alive.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The archive’s “chilled silence” and humming towers are not backdrop but pressure—temperature readouts and server racks literally guide her to rack 117. The patch’s metallic threads, warmed by data, become the final storage medium, charging the last image. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered; no white-room drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—recovering the erased crew—escalates through each 117 recurrence until the 0117-hour demolition clock. One decisive tightening: the lie that hides the drive. Cost is explicit—loss of employment and exposure to corporate retaliation—felt in the final walk-out at sunrise.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of memory vs. corporate erasure emerges organically from plot; no moralizing. The lullaby mutates from personal grief to collective anthem without a thesis statement. Final image—wind carrying a lullaby across an empty playground—reweights the premise with quiet, undeniable cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct: corporate-cool diction (“corporate memory keeper,” “protocol demanded”) melts into lyric ache. Compression and patterned elision (“the silence that tasted of sensed absence”) are taught early and paid off. No POV drift; perceptual signature stays consistent under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence layers sensory, emotional, and plot data. Metaphors are precise—“numbers 117 cascading like snow” is fresh and functional. No loops, no scaffold, no mixed metaphors. Rhythm accelerates into the final harmonic without clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses digital ghost story with elegiac space myth; the erased colony ship re-emerges inside a social-network archive. The 117 motif is not gimmick but heartbeat. Risky lyric structure pays off in the charged final image. Feels inevitable, not contrived.</comment>
