<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aurelia’s contradictory impulses—negotiator’s cunning vs. penitent’s surrender—are embodied in the ritual pacing and the silent kiss to the clipboard; Kelis’s presence forces a micro-choice that alters their shared status. Interiority is specific, never diagnostic. The final renunciation (leaving the terrace lighter) is earned and carries visible cost. Only the “operative gentleness” label risks a hairline slip.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the absorbed tokens and Kelis’s gesture reweight the meaning of redemption without a spoken word. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each loop around the ecliptic deepens density until the clipboard’s shimmer crystallizes the cost. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no causality breaks. One tightening suffices.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The terrace’s grooves, pollen, and jasmine constrain the ritual choreography; the clipboard itself becomes micro-setting that absorbs history and releases weight. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered. The final footprint glowing then folding into night charges the closure image. No orientation debt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—redemption through ritual presence—is signaled early and tightened when Kelis completes the circle; the cost is the literal weight surrendered. Agency remains with Aurelia’s silent pacing and final kiss. One meaningful deepening under Accumulative lens; no false escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of redemption as ongoing tending rather than signed treaty emerges through concrete objects and silence. Subtext operates in the harmonica’s placement and the kiss. Final image of seeds needing tending offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. No thematic drift.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet disciplined, with rhythmic control matching ritual pacing. POV stays locked in Aurelia’s selective perception; Kelis’s interiority is never ventriloquized. Compression and elision (“tasted sawdust from trees felled in a war”) are taught early and paid off. No head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and motion. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Figurative language peaks at the kiss without clutter. Micro-variations in sentence length mirror breath control required by ritual.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of peace-negotiator turned ritual penitent feels inevitable yet fresh; the clipboard as memory reliquary is a non-obvious device. Specificity of refugee-glass marble and olive leaf grounds universals. Risk in silent ritual pays off with crystallized closure.</comment>
