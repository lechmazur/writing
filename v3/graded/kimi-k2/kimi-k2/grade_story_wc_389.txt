<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Cassia’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her solder-burned sleeves, her ear pressed to ozone—but the shift from lone visionary to communal prophet happens off-stage; the congregation’s arrival dilutes the cost of her final choice, keeping her just shy of a fully earned renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the silhouette dissolves into the crowd, “Remember” spoken aloud reweights the premise. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—storm, numbers, chord, silhouette—each layer tightening until the final image reconfigures the world’s color. Cost is felt in the cracked pane and the iron-lilac taste.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The observatory above clouds, cobalt portico, and stormlit static are rendered with tactile specificity; the portico constrains Cassia’s movements and ultimately folds open to birth the silhouette, charging the final image. Spatial choreography remains coherent across the single scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—shape a new dawn—escalates via static harvest, numeric chord, and communal utterance. One clear tightening: the first word hatches and forecloses the option of solitary prophecy. Cost is visible in the cracked glass and the townspeople’s cobalt tears.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of memory as resurrection emerges from storm, shadow, and silhouette without moralizing. The final image—earth turning lighter—reweights the premise: remembering is an active, painful recoloring. Subtext resides in the taste of iron and lilac, not exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded in tactile detail; perceptual signature is Cassia’s synesthetic hearing of static as berries and prophecy. Syntax modulates with pressure—short clauses during lightning strikes, longer cadences during reflection—without head-hopping. Compression and elision are taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and propulsive; figurative language is purposeful, never ornamental. No loops or scaffold; every line advances image or stakes. Minor register drift (“bruised beacon”) is voice-motivated and consistent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Premise—prophet who births the world’s forgotten shadow via storm and radio static—is fresh, synthesized from familiar elements through Cassia’s specific embodied labor. The silhouette as “second spine of morning” feels inevitable yet non-obvious, transforming the trope of apocalypse into collective remembrance.</comment>
