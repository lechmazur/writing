<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulse—measuring grief while seeking living witness—drives every beat; her tactile handling of the sextant and the oak root anchors interiority. The final reassembly is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: she forfeits the original instrument for a new tool of witness. No stock interiority; each micro-choice (tracing fracture lines, pressing the wall) reveals hierarchy of values. Character remains flawed and specific throughout.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of fracture → mapping → healing seams tightens meaning rather than plot. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the transformed sextant projects an oak-leaf shadow, reweighting the premise with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation is immediate; causality is lyrical but legible. No lens ambiguity; final image crystallizes options and stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stormlit tower, moonlight, and oak roots are vivid, selective, and purposeful; each constrains choice (roots break through wall, moonlight heals brass). Micro-setting (sextant shards on windowsill) functions as charged object. Sensory hierarchy reflects Elara’s caretaker priorities. Spatial choreography is coherent; no white-room syndrome. Setting evolves with events; moss spirals mirror stairs and theme.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake: learn what trees witness and transmute grief into measurable healing. Pressure deepens via accumulative pattern: each mapped dream narrows the final choice to reassemble or not. One meaningful tightening—cracks become golden seams—forces trade-off between original function and new purpose. Cost is legible: the sextant is forever altered, its original calibration lost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Theme emerges organically: grief is not erased but re-seamed into usable knowledge. Subtext operates through image (oak-leaf shadow in projected circle) rather than statement. Final image offers resonant non-literal answer—healing is a visible scar that still points. No moralizing; complexity lingers. Conceptual repricing reweights “quantified sorrow” from measurement to living record.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with controlled compression (“moonlight pooled like spilled mercury”). Perceptual signature is caretaker-biased: notices moss spirals, dust motes, sap pulse. No head-hopping; POV stays tight. Syntax modulates with emotional rise; no register drift. Dialogue absent, so no penalty. Final cadence crystallizes without exposition.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative language is selective and patterned (light, seams, roots) without clutter. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn. Strong verbs (“pressed,” “traced,” “recharged”) carry load. Rhythm breathes with ascent and descent. No artifacts in closure beat. Clean mechanics.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</question><comment>Fresh synthesis: sextant as grief-thermometer and tree as active mourner. Transformation test fails if names/places swapped—oak specificity and quantified sorrow are irreplaceable. Risk-taking in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. No close echoes; voice and concept cohere singularly. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
