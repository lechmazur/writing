<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Liora’s interiority is vivid—embodied in the warm sovereign case, the creaking knees, the tug of threads on her sleeve. Her contradictory impulses (join the forgiving morning vs. tend the graves) collide in the final beat, and the choice to name “Tomorrow” costs her the immediate reunion. The single on-page character is fully individuated; no relationship crucible is required. One minor slip: “blithe” is asserted rather than dramatized until late.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Liora renounces the door, re-weights her duty, and the tapestry dissolves—cost is the lost vision of her young mother. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (rust-lilac air, cello chord, indigo silk) intensifies until the final cadence shift. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no causality breaks. The coin’s echo trapped in the empty case crystallizes the price on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Selective, urgent detail—yew hush, marble angel’s hand, dew on every blade—grounds every beat. The cobalt silo’s curved wall and the tapestry’s whispering threads constrain movement and choice. Micro-setting (sovereign case, lantern, spade) functions as extension of body. One hairline slip: “velveteen gloom” repeats enough to edge toward motif checklist, but it modulates with pressure and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Dominant stake—whether to step through the door or remain guardian—is signaled early and tightened by the chess-clock echo. The single deepening occurs when the blank name becomes “Tomorrow,” foreclosing reunion. Cost is the relinquished vision of her mother at dawn. Pressure is coherent under Accumulative lens; no external reversals needed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of custodial duty versus personal longing emerges through concrete particulars: the lily planted for tomorrow, the empty case in the angel’s palm. No moralizing; the final lullaby threaded with cello chords offers resonant, non-literal answer. Ambiguity lingers—will the dead rise or the living forget?—without confusion. The tapestry’s dissolution reweights every prior echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with rhythmic control that accelerates under the tapestry’s tremor and breathes at the dawn hush. Perceptual signature is consistent—Liora notices through gardener’s bias (seed weight, yews at midnight). No dialogue, so no register clash. Purposeful elision (how the coin activates the door) is taught by pattern and paid off in the final image.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers scent, texture, and motion. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is selective. Minor register elevation (“tenderly organized”) is voice-motivated. One mixed metaphor—“stars stitched into velveteen gloom”—barely grazes clarity but occurs early and does not taint closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The cemetery-as-memory-archive premise feels fresh, synthesized through Liora’s specific vocation and the tapestry’s living threads. Risky lyric compression pays off: the uncharted echoes become navigable geography. Transformation test fails if names are swapped, proving specificity. No derivative echoes; the final constellation-garden is unforeseeable yet inevitable.</comment>
