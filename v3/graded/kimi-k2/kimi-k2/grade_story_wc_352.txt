<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira’s singular, prism-minded drive is embodied in every micro-choice; the moment she presses the seed into mercury and accepts the dragon into her own thoughts crystallizes an earned cost. Interior contradiction is implied but not fully dramatized in scene, keeping her just shy of the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final image of Lira walking toward the child’s first lie reconfigures vigilance from abstract quest to embodied duty. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each luminous detail and gravity shift tightens the pattern until the violet corridor lingers one heartbeat longer, the felt cost visible in her pulse.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The serpentine grotto’s mist, mercury pool, and clandestinely luminous veins actively constrain tactics—sideways gravity forces wall-walking, the mercury refuses to fall. Specificity is selective and purposeful; the final eye-shaped ripple charges the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—planting vigilance before the hour ends—tightens once when Lira kneels to sink the seed; the visible cost is the dragon’s weight of memory now hers to bear. Escalation is coherent under the Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves the tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the particulars: crystallized intentions of vigilance born from un-fired arrows and blinked apologies. The ending’s non-literal answer—vigilance rooted in her pulse, ready to reenter any moment—reweights the premise without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is prism-minded: fracturing light into spectral corridors, tasting iron and ozone. Syntax and diction remain consistent under pressure; no head-hopping. The final “latent blaze” modulates tone with earned intensity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is disciplined. The mercury-dragon mirror and violet corridor are vivid without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The inversion of gravity for one secret hour, the doodle-dragon as living cipher, and vigilance as crystallized intention synthesize into a fresh, inevitable whole. Risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
