<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara’s contradictory impulses—guard vs. evolve—are embodied in micro-choices (locking the seed, nightly vigils, whispering “Grow”). Her final surrender of proprietorship is earned by the corpse-flower’s living blueprint and her felt fear-to-tenderness shift. Interiority is concrete, but a touch of diagnostic self-awareness (“understand then that…”) keeps it from 8.8.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the house becomes an autonomous organism and Mara its caretaker, cost paid by dissolved master key and relinquished certainty. Causal linkage holds—seed test → nightly tending → architectural metamorphosis—under an Accumulative/Textural lens. One minor ellipsis: how the guests exit is elided, but the final image reweights everything.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The lodge, brook, courtyard, and corpse-flower are vivid, selective, and constrain choices (planting site, mirrored walls, floating rivers). Spatial choreography is clean; the brook’s upward flow and bioluminescent cavern charge the final image. Slight excess of dream-catalogue slows mid-section.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—safeguard vs. release innovation—tightens when the flower projects blueprints that demand surrender. Escalation is Accumulative: each solved puzzle thickens the pattern until the floor cracks. Cost is visible (key dissolves, role lost). Agency drives the climax; coincidence only complicates.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of surrendering control to keep creativity alive emerges organically from Mara’s choices and the house’s transformation. Subtext in mirrors reflecting intentions and the flower’s stench of endings/beginnings deepens resonance. Final image reweights premise without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical, controlled, and consistent; perceptual signature (storm-born silence, orthogonal corridors) is distinct. Compression and patterned elision (“Years later, travelers speak…”) are taught early and paid off. No dialogue, so no voice contamination.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language serves atmosphere without clutter. Occasional stacked modifiers (“black-purple and already taller than a man”) flirt with overwriting but remain tethered to sensory stakes. No loops or scaffold; rhythm modulates with tension.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of escape-room metafiction and botanical body-horror; the corpse-flower as living puzzle-master is non-obvious yet inevitable. Risky architectural surrealism heightens stakes without gimmickry. Minor echo of “rooms rearrange nightly” trope is transformed by the caretaker shift.</comment>
