<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her loneliness, compulsion, and fear are felt in micro-choices like pressing the tapestry to the wall and reading aloud. The final renunciation (letting the tapestry dissolve) is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: she ends “empty-handed.” Flaws (obsessive collecting) complicate choices and are confronted by the wall’s forgiveness. No secondary character on page, so relationship bullets waived.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the wall’s whisper reweights memory from chain to wing, and Elara’s courier role crystallizes with felt cost (loss of the tapestry). Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of diaries and tapestry reprise tightens stakes. Orientation anchored within 120 words. No lens ambiguity at end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The reclaimed silo library is not mere backdrop; its bronze quiet and sensitively perceptive walls constrain every probe and absorb the final tapestry threads. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—warm ashes, cracked spine, concrete tasting silk. Micro-setting (wall as braille) charges the final image. No spatial drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—collect vs. return stories—signaled early. One meaningful deepening: realization that stories must be returned, not curated. Cost is visible when tapestry dissolves and Elara leaves empty-handed. Pressure grows under Accumulative lens as diaries layer memory. No coincidence resolves conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: memory as burden vs. liberation. Subtext in dragons’ listening posture and wall’s heartbeat. Final image (“Stories are not chains but wings”) offers non-literal, resonant answer without moralizing. No thematic drift or late thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>Voice is distinct—tarnished brass, bronze quiet, sensitively perceptive fibers—consistent with Elara’s historian precision. Syntax modulates with emotional intensity. No head-hopping or register drift. Free indirect style is clean. Dialogue minimal and not required.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Prose is dense yet clear; every sentence advances story or atmosphere. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Rhythm breathes with pressure. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful. Final line crystallizes without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</question><comment>Premise—post-dream world where walls remember—feels fresh and fully committed. Tapestry dragons as prophetic listeners transforms medieval trope. Specific synthesis of memory, architecture, and apocalypse. Risk-taking (lyric accumulation) heightens stakes without gimmickry. No derivative echoes.</comment>
