<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s claustrophobia is embodied in metallic groans and pulse-counting; her micro-choice to sing the binary lullaby crystallizes her shift from escape to stewardship. The gold fleck’s warmth in her palm at the end shows earned cost. Interiority stays specific, though “fierce tenderness” edges toward label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Mara’s stance crystallizes from fleeing the facility to returning each tide as keeper. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each restored cable memory layers density until the final image reweights the premise. Cost is legible in her transformed claustrophobia and the fleck’s lighthouse pulse.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The breathing corridors and dripping Morse-code pipes anchor place early; the gold fleck and cables function as micro-settings that constrain phase transitions. Final translucent walls reveal ocean beauty, charging the keeper image. Spatial choreography is clean; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—restoring severed human connection—tightens when Mara chooses to sing instead of flee. Each repaired cable releases a memory, escalating pressure under Accumulative lens. Cost is visible: her body phases, claustrophobia transmutes, and she accepts perpetual return.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of bearing witness to forgotten labor emerges through concrete particulars—copper veins, birthday calls drowned in static—never asserted. Final image of the fleck as “tiny lighthouse” reweights prior motifs without moralizing. Complexity lingers: no tidy redemption, only ongoing stewardship.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise: “thunder wrapped in velvet,” “binary lullabies.” Perceptual signature filters every detail through Mara’s synesthetic gift. Compression and elision are taught early (“phase transitions”) and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates with pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is selective and purposeful. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances. Rhythm breathes with scene—short pulses during claustrophobic beats, longer cadences during restoration. Minor register drift in “conceptual repricing” phrase, but does not obscure closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fusion of medieval manuscript gold with undersea cable ghosts feels inevitable and fresh. Risky lyric structure holds; phase-transition body-shift pays off the speculative premise. Specificity—“grain of sand” fleck, “Morse code drips”—anchors universals. No derivative echoes.</comment>
