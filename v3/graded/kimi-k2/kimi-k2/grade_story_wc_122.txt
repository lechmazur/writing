<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s embodied deafness and tactile pedagogy are vivid; her arc from numbness to renewed feeling is earned through the drum ritual. The interior contradiction—yearning for sound yet teaching through vibration—drives every micro-choice. Cost is palpable when tears absorb without echo. Only the brief Garrick interaction lacks full crucible pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each sensory layer thickens until the final image reweights silence as fertile space. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Mara’s stance toward her students crystallizes with felt cost (needle left behind). Causality is lyric rather than linear, taught early and paid off. No orientation drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The cavern’s resin breath and cedar curves act as resonant chamber, literally shaping how hush is harvested. Drum, needle, and skin function as micro-setting that constrain ritual steps. Final moonlit drum image recharges the opening cathedral metaphor. Environment is inseparable from stakes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Dominant stake—defeat emotional numbness—is signaled in paragraph three and tightened through each ritual beat. Agency is renunciation/acceptance: Mara yields to the hush and regains feeling. Cost is the spent needle and absorbed tears. One clear deepening suffices; no false escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of silence as generative medium emerges from tactile particulars, never stated. Subtext lives in gestures—needle as scalpel, drum as womb. Final backward moonlight reprises the reversed-song motif, reweighting grief into gratitude without moralizing. Complexity lingers: joy stings.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person limited stays inside Mara’s tactile perception; syntax mirrors her pulse (“threading the needle…coaxing it to listen”). No head-hop; Garrick’s signs are filtered through her soles. Compression and elision are pattern-taught early and paid off in the moonlit coda.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Prose is dense yet breathable; figurative language serves pressure, never purple. Rhythm accelerates during drum-birth, then exhales into hush. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Minor filter verbs (“she felt”) are voice-motivated and sparse.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: deaf music teacher + reversed phonograph ritual + filament of hush = non-obvious emotional alchemy. Tropes of magical healing are subverted by tactile specificity and earned cost. Risky lyric structure heightens resonance without obscuring clarity. Transformation test passed.</comment>
