<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Liora’s interiority and embodied emotion are strong (the “knowledge network” murmurs in her ears, the daydream folding like warm cloth), yet her final renunciation—walking away from the mural—reads as lightly cost. Lacks a visceral contradiction between joy and risk; the orchard’s warning is voiced by setting, not via an internal fracture.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens cleanly held: each luminous layer thins real fog until the final image crystallizes. Closure is Charged Poise—the canvas glows, orchard re-blossoms, and Liora’s departure reweights everything. Cost (joy remembered “with the ache of how easily it was mislaid”) is stated rather than dramatized on the page, damping the 9-band entry.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Orchard, fog, and the cherub’s pigment are sharply specific and re-weighted in the closing glow; the broken apple press becomes a silent altar, the mural wall serviceable. Fog first conceals, then recedes—environment is used to both constrain and enable, meeting the 9-band quick test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stake is the recovery of lost communal joy. Orchard’s creaked caution constitutes single escalation; cost (risk of remembering too brightly) is articulated verbally rather than embodied through lost tool, stamina, or social price, so the tightening lands slightly soft-edged.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of retrieved joy laced with inevitable erosion emerges organically from specific actions (light pressed into canvas, giggles grafted onto ghost halftones) rather than assertion. Final image of travelers drawn to laughter “that grew on trees” offers resonant, non-literal resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Vocabulary is luminous, sensory, and syntactically varied without purple drift; “light folded around her like warm cloth” is purposeful compression. Voice remains Liora’s singular perceptual filter throughout. No unmotivated shifts; prose is textured yet clear.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>No paraphrase loops; every sentence advances fog, pigment, or memory. Rhythm modulates—“time loosened; the fog brightened”—to mimic the daydream fold. Diction stays character-bound; metaphors (canvas as “portable sunrise”) are precise and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The combination of fresco-reminisced cherub + latent-exposed cinema + painting-with-light syntheses feels fresh because each layer grows from tactile handling rather than concept-speak. Transformative turn is the graft of ghost picnic onto luminous pigment. No close mimic of prior orchard-as-ghost stories.</comment>
