<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira’s interior contradiction—logic vs. heart—drives every beat; the key hand-off and final “Rest” crystallize her arc with felt cost. Motivation stays rooted in protecting the artifact and is tested by the sonic ritual. Minor: the crypt keeper remains more emblem than pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: grief-density rises through resonant imagery until the transformed lullaby reconfigures meaning. Closure is a Charged Poise—the beacon relights in hush—cost paid by the melted key and Lira’s numb knees. Orientation is swift; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Drift-ice marina is not backdrop but instrument: its acoustic properties force the ritual and glow with the final chord. Every sensory choice (shattered-glass floes, ringing hum) tightens the scene’s stakes. The lighthouse beam at the end recharges the setting as resonant chamber.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prevent the sea’s grief from drowning the mainland—escalates via sonic density rather than external reversals. The single deepening (ice becomes throat) narrows options and exacts the price of the key’s dissolution. Agency remains Lira’s throughout.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of translation vs. silencing emerges through action: grief is not erased but reshaped into bearable song. Final image of “seeds of quiet joy” offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. Subtext in the key’s melted tongue speaks to release as protection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Lira’s perceptual signature; prose modulates from crystalline description to hushed cadence that mirrors the lullaby. No head-hopping; diction remains within her lexicon. Distinct rhythmic control under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Line-level craft is near-flawless: vivid specificity (“bruised peach” colors), zero loops, high density. Occasional elevated lyricism is earned by voice and theme. No artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Sonic absolution via ice-acoustics is a fresh synthesis; the living-sound artifact and key-melting payoff feel inevitable yet unforeseen. Risky lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specificity anchors the ethereal.</comment>
