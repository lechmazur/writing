<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority is embodied and specific; the antique hairpin anchors her contradictory impulses (guilt vs. caretaker oath). The final choice to guide her sister home is earned by the ghost-mother beat and costs her the heirloom. Minor slip: “kindly decisive” is asserted more than dramatized in dialogue.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Lira plants the hairpin, accepts perpetual tending, and the vineyard’s rebirth is felt cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each mist-scallop and petal reweights the stake. One smooth transition (tree-top to ground) keeps scope tight.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Umbral grotto, cloud-oak, and scalloped mist are vivid and selective; the tree’s warm bark and final petal-rain constrain Lira’s choices and charge the ending. Spatial choreography is clean; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore the grove and her own contentment—tightens when the ghost demands she tend her sister too. The single deepening (planting the hairpin) forecloses keeping it and visibly costs her. Pressure stays coherent under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of cyclical rebirth emerges through concrete tending actions; no moralizing. Final image of hairpin scattering “a thousand tiny suns” reweights prior betrayal without stating a lesson. Subtext in the sister’s silent tasting of the petal is sharp.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyric, sensory voice is consistent and character-bound; “silence tasted of crushed grapes” teaches the pattern early. No head-hopping; free-indirect style stays clean. Dialogue is minimal but subtextual when it appears.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is patterned and paid off (“scalloped” motif). No loops or scaffold. Rhythm modulates with ascent and descent. One mixed metaphor—“dark grape suspended in sky-wine”—is minor and doesn’t cloud closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: caretaker mythos + vineyard rebirth in a cloud grove. Hairpin-as-trellis is an unexpected yet inevitable payoff. Risky lyric compression succeeds; no derivative echoes.</comment>
