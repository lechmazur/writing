<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“quiet heat became a tranquil blaze inside her chest”), but the summoner’s contradictory impulses—silence the world vs. listen to it—are stated more than dramatized until the final beat. The earned shift from silencer to listener is credible and carries felt cost, yet the micro-choices leading up to it are generalized rather than specific to her.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the prophecy is not erased but transformed into “the space between heartbeats,” with the cost legible in her release of the wing. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of hush increases until the final cadence shift. Orientation is clear by line 3; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The brook, moonlight, and paper wing function as micro-setting that actively constrains tactics: the water’s ripples are the enemy code, the wing becomes a canopy and then a bridge. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered (“moonlight silvering the water into a mirror of smoothed hush”).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—hush the prophecy before dawn—tightens through escalating pattern: ripples sharpen, glyphs threaten, voice speaks of floods. The summoner’s agency drives the turn from silencing to listening, with the visible cost of releasing the wing. One meaningful intensification suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: the ethics of silence versus attentive listening. The final image of the wing drifting upward reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture and silence; no thematic echo in the final paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with rhythmic control under pressure (“mapping silence, tracing the negative spaces between cricket chirps”). POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Distinct perceptual signature throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; no loops or scaffold. Metaphors are coherent (“terrestrially cosmic,” “paper span”). Sentence variety supports momentum. One minor register drift—“conceptual repricing” risk in “the cool fire of understanding”—but it passes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of origami magic and ecological prophecy; the crane wing as both tool and ethical question feels inevitable. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. No derivative echoes.</comment>
