<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her tasting of stories, the pollen on her lips—but the “empirically whimsical” trait is asserted more than dramatized; the final smile with “luminous doubt” is earned yet the cost feels slightly under-registered on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the seed becomes a rooted sapling, memories anchor, and the monsoon arrives—an Earned Stasis with felt cost in the rain on her skin. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds; each blossom’s forgetting tightens the pattern until the communal dream re-stitches it.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The ridge, orchid, and rain are not backdrop but agents: the orchid’s dream reveals the fracture, the ridge’s soil depth measures a lullaby, the monsoon’s first drop seals the cost. Micro-setting (pollen, moss, black composted song) constrains planting depth and anchors memory.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—protect cultural memory before the monsoon—is signaled early and escalates as petals forget lines. The dream-library summoning of witnesses is a decisive tightening that forecloses failure; the price is the lingering doubt she must keep alive.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of memory-as-belonging emerges through specific particulars: translucent library leaves, whale-rise tune, shadow-canopy. Final image of rain tasting “true” reweights the premise without moralizing, leaving ambiguity intact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise—“moss that hummed like a sleeping lute,” “raindrops the size of lullabies”—with a perceptual signature that stays grounded in Mira’s sensory empiricism. No head-hopping; compression and elision are taught early and paid off in the dream logic.</comment>

<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is patterned and purposeful. Minor loop risk in “petals were beginning to forget their lines” / “the petals were beginning to forget” but quickly varied. No artifacts near closure; final rain image lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fantasy reality-checker who tastes pH of stories, memory fruit grown from communal dream-witnessing—fresh synthesis that feels inevitable. Risky lyric structure holds coherence; no derivative echoes.</comment>
