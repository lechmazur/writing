<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The novelist’s contradictory impulses—using beauty to evade truth—are dramatized through tactile micro-choices (pressing the shell, speaking names) that culminate in a costly renunciation. Each ghost’s gift forces a visible shift in stance, and the final release of characters is earned by prior confessions. Interiority stays embodied and specific; no diagnostic label-speak intrudes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the shell’s erasure and the corridor of pages crystallize the cost of authorship. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each cameo adds density until the final hush reweights the premise. Causality is intact: naming the characters dissolves the shell, sealing the before/after change.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The feral nexus is evoked through selective sensory detail (ink-scented mud, unlit lantern) that constrains movement and mirrors the novelist’s inner swamp. The spiral seashell functions as micro-setting, its warmth and erosion guiding her choices. Spatial anchors are clear early; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—collecting hopes while facing self-betrayal—tightens with each spectral accusation. Escalation is driven by the protagonist’s agency: every spoken name forecloses a narrative path, paying the cost of relinquishment. Pressure deepens rather than reverses, fitting the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: the moral cost of aesthetic exploitation is embodied in salt-stained pages and orphaned characters. The final image of translucent birds offers a non-literal answer—hope as released burden—without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers but is coherent.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with rhythmic control that modulates from misty expansiveness to the hush of closure. Perceptual signature is consistent: the novelist notices through a writer’s lexicon (ink, drafts, pages) without POV drift. No dialogue, so no voice contamination.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; figurative language serves pattern (mist as living reader) without overwriting. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Minor register elevation (“lucidly watchful”) is voice-motivated and consistent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The metafictional conceit—characters returning as witnesses—is transformed through specific, tactile detail (violin-calloused fingers, seaweed beard). The spiral seashell’s evolution from memory to possibility feels inevitable. Risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
