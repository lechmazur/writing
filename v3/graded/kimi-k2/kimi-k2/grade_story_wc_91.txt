<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s interior contradiction—wanting to give yet being emptied by it—drives every micro-choice; the final release of the last bug crystallizes her earned renunciation with visible cost (the glass handprint). Reflection stays anchored in present action and alters her stance, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the glass handprint reweights “giving” from subtraction to translation. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each freed bug thickens the pattern until the final image reconfigures meaning with undeniable conceptual cost. No orientation debt; causality of coincidence is legible under situational pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Black sand, volcano glow, and glass-forming heat are not backdrop but active constraints: the warm glass receives Mara’s handprint, sealing the final gift. Sensory selection narrows to heat, grit, and shimmer that mirror her internal shift. Environment charges the closure image directly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“understand the texture of transformation”—tightens through each jar opened; the final bug’s flight into the volcano forces the crystallizing choice. Agency remains hers; coincidence complicates but does not resolve. Cost is the irreversible emptying of the jars and the permanent handprint in glass.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the concrete act of releasing light: giving as translation, not depletion. Final image of the trapped green star in volcanic glass offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in the hush and the glowing footprints left behind.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; perceptual signature filters every detail through Mara’s exhausted generosity. Syntax modulates with emotional intensity—long, breath-held sentences give way to the stark final line. No head-hopping; POV distance stays intimate and consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is patterned early (stars, galaxies, hush) and paid off in the final image. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. Rhythm mirrors the slow celestial dance, accelerating only at the bug’s final ascent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms the familiar trope of the ruined philanthropist into a mythic, volcanic ritual of accidental prophecy. Specificity of bottled lightning bugs and glass-forming sand makes the premise unforgettable. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
