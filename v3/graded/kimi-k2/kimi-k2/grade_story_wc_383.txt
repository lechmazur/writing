<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses—clinging to memory while fearing its loss—drive every beat. The final gesture of cupping the shell mirrors her mother’s and crystallizes her earned independence with visible cost. Minor slip: “charmed skeptic” is asserted rather than dramatized early on.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the garden’s dissolution and the shell’s silence reweight Mara’s solitude into self-possession. Causal chain holds under Accumulative/Textural lens—each petal loosened by heartbeat resonance tightens the pattern until the garden folds. Cost is legible in the vacant lot and the single wink-out petal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The velvet garden’s neural blooms and marble lectern are rendered with selective sensory density that constrains Mara’s path. Micro-setting—the shell’s spiral matching the lectern—directly enables the archive act. Final image of vacant lot reconfigures the prior lushness with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—translate isolation into independence—tightens via the dawn deadline and the shell’s plea. Escalation is one deepening: each heartbeat loosens a petal, foreclosing retreat. Price is the garden’s extinction and the mother’s voice gone silent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of memory as inheritance emerges through the shell’s translation, never stated. Final image of Mara hearing her own older voice inside the shell reframes forgetting as creative act. Subtext in the mother’s “archive me before I burn” carries moral weight without sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; perceptual signature filters every detail through Mara’s sensory bias. Rhythm modulates with urgency—short clauses under pressure, longer lulls amid petals. No head-hopping; compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language serves pattern rather than ornament. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Minor register drift—“resonance structures” edges technical—but fits the speculative frame.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise of neural-garden memory archive feels fresh, synthesized through intimate stakes rather than exposition. Risky lyric structure holds coherence; the shell’s translation of mother into daughter is non-obvious yet inevitable. Specificity of “moonlit petals” and “bruised sky” anchors universals.</comment>
