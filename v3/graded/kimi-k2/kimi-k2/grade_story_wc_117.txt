<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lila’s contradictory impulses—clinging to the curl yet offering it—are dramatized in the eclipse beat; Rowan’s first words crystallize a credible change with visible cost. Interiority is embodied and specific, avoiding therapy-speak. Only minor drift: Rowan’s interiority is ventriloquized once.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the curl-whistle exchange reweights both characters’ futures with felt cost. Causal chain (tuning → answering → trade) holds under Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is anchored by 120 words; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sage Ridge’s dreaming roots and thinning light constrain the musical choices and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective, filtered through Lila’s musician’s ear. One micro-slip: “beneath the hush of dreaming roots” is slightly abstract.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restoring wonder without pain—tightens once when Rowan speaks. Agency is Lila’s offer of the curl; cost is irreversible loss of keepsake. Pressure grows via musical dialogue; no coincidence resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of wonder as renewable, not extractive, emerges from the curl-whistle exchange without moralizing. Final image of copper light reframes earlier lullaby memory. Subtext in Rowan’s tear and whispered “It didn’t hurt” carries the resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct lyric-musical texture sustained; diction (“crushed pine and old stories”) is character-specific. No head-hopping; Rowan’s silence is respected until earned. Rhythm modulates with eclipse dimming.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and propulsive; no loops or scaffold. One strained metaphor—“dreaming roots murmured”—but does not cloud closure. High information density without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Familiar grief-healing arc is refreshed by musical eclipse ritual and keepsake exchange. Specificity of music-therapy practice and copper-lit curl feels inevitable. Risk in quiet closure pays off.</comment>
