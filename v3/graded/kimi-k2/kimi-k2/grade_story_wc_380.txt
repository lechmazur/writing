<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mara’s longing for erased memories is embodied—knees buckling under heavier gravity—yet her interiority drifts into “a blade behind her ribs,” edging on stock. The final gesture of tasting lemon-memory feels earned because it literalizes the mother-presence and costs her the comfort of forgetting.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: every intensification of gravity mirrors memory’s weight until Mara’s retrieval act tightens pattern into stance—no new rule, only a crystallized reading of what was always true. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost: the salt columns hum and her mother-memories surge, trading forgetting for raw presence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Gravity itself functions as setting; ceiling pulls feet off the ground while waist-level pressure kneecaps—literal constraints on how Mara can move. Salt columns and luminous memory-pool anchor spatial choreography; the final descent beneath the tiles is spatially tracked. Dock and chamber feel singular enough that relocating the tale would break its physics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Single dominant stake—recover forgotten—signaled on page one and pressured by escalating gravitational pockets at each waypoint. Choice to exhume via coffee-ground augury is Mara’s, not coincidental; tasting the memory reweights stakes with price (loss of safe forgetting). No off-page resolution; the tension coils tighter toward crystalline stillness.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of memory’s materiality and inescapable inheritance emerges from concrete acts—not declared. The wildflowers first as bookmark, last as reconstituted blooms. No moral offered; tasting lemon memory answers the central question experientially. Subtext resides in the silence of salt chiming, gravity equalizing, mother returned.</question>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Distinct perceptual signature: salt air clings, gravity tugs, petals “rustle like pages turning themselves.” Syntax modulates under pressure—short clauses for heaviness, longer lilting lines for lift. No head-hop; interior stays tightly filtered through Mara’s sensual recall while maintaining lyrical coherence.</question>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</question>
<comment>Density high; each sentence doubles duty (setting + memory = metaphor). No scaffold loops beyond one soft “gleaming silence” repetition late. Tense stable, rhythm controlled; imagery precise—salt columns “imprisoning a single frozen image.” Final beat image crystallizes without overwriting.</question>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</question>
<comment>Taking gravity as memory-weight is fresh; linking whale collapse to memory-architecture beneath a customs house is unexpected and coherent. Synthesizes existing images (pressed flowers, coffee-ground divination) into new lattice. Feels inevitable only at landing, which is acceptable.</question>
