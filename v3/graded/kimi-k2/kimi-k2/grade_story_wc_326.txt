<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied—heartbeat counting, ink on skin—but the “ghost in the wires” premise is asserted more than dramatized; the final fusion with the dome earns the change yet the cost feels slightly abstract rather than visceral.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the ink mandala rewrites identity and the dome pulses with shared heartbeat. Causal chain from shard-drop to fusion is legible; cost is the slowing heartbeat count and the relinquishing of the shard.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Observatory, snow, ink, and shard form a micro-setting that constrains every move; the dome’s opal glass becomes the final lantern. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered, charging the ending image without clutter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reclaiming mis-assigned identity—tightens through each heartbeat-count drop and ink-stroke. One decisive turn: stepping into the vortex costs remaining heartbeats and forecloses ghosthood.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of identity-as-pattern emerges organically from the ink mandala and heartbeat count; no moralizing. Final image of the dark star fuses personal and systemic error into quiet forgiveness.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with rhythmic control matching pulse-count urgency. Compression and elision (“Porcelain kissed porcelain”) are taught early and paid off; no POV drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; figurative language serves pattern-building without clutter. Minor risk of overwriting in “liquid night” but cadence supports pressure; no loops or scaffold in final third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of cyber-ghost myth with tactile ink-astronomy; the shard-as-stylus and dome-as-lantern feel inevitable yet non-obvious. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes without obscuring closure.</comment>
