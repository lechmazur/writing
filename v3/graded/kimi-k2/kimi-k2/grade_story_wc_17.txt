<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mara's echo-mapping talent is vivid, but interiority drifts into thematic exposition; the diary revelation justifies her return yet feels summarised rather than lived. Sensory perception repeatedly enables action, satisfying the attribute, but one late epiphany is telegraphed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page: Mara presses the film strip into the star-wall and accepts remembering duty—earned stasis with felt cost. Causality links each diary fragment to her deepening choice under Accumulative lens. Orientation is clear within 120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>The ivy passage’s fossilised starlight bricks and draft-whispers actively pressure choices; micro-setting alters tactics when the hearth slot reveals coordinates. Specificity is high, but some descriptive passages dilute immediacy.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Diary fragments escalate stakes: each charred page tightens Mara’s path and reweights the sky-forgotten legacy. One distinct beat of cost—she forfeits silence by recording echoes—grounds the conflict under Accumulative pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of remembering versus burial emerges through concrete escalation: each burned page costs denial and forces Mara to shoulder legacy. Final image of fused star-brick offers non-literal answer without moralising.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Distinct lyric voice modulates with corridor acoustics; perceptual signature of “sensitively perceptive” filtering remains consistent. Rhythm accelerates at the star-brick chord, then breathes into quiet acceptance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, occasionally purple (“bricks mourning constellations”) yet rhythm serves scene. One filter-verb cluster dulls a high-tension beat; elsewhere, syntax propels action and avoids loops.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>The star-brick dream synthesis feels fresh: echo cartography + climate grief. Physical constraint (negative light lock) and earned stasis charge the final image. Some late lore dumps border derivative patterns.</comment>
