<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elian’s interiority is vivid—his “mossy delight” and walnut-stained fingers ground him—but the final transformation is more mythic inevitability than earned choice; the cost is felt yet not fully dramatized through contradictory impulses in-scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elian’s dissolution into seed-light reweights the premise under an Accumulative/Textural lens; the arbor’s sigh and silver ash make the cost legible on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The ashen arbor and miniature seed-shrines are tactile micro-settings that constrain Elian’s choices and charge the final image; selective sensory detail (moonstone warmth, walnut stain) is filtered through POV urgency.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decode the leaves before the arbor forgets—tightens once when the last leaf trembles; escalation is driven by Elian’s agency (building monuments, climbing) with visible cost in his bodily dissolution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of cyclical memory and guardianship emerges through concrete particulars (shrines, moonstone dust) without moralizing; the final leaf’s new folklore line offers a resonant, non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct lyric texture—compressed syntax, patterned diction (“hush where past meets prophecy”)—remains controlled under pressure; perceptual signature is consistent, no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; occasional stacked metaphors (“storm of silver ash that spiraled”) flirt with overwriting but never stall momentum; zero loops or scaffold in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Folklore of a moon-climbing tree transformed into a living cosmology; the seed-sorter-becomes-arbor-heartbeat synthesis feels inevitable and fresh, with risk-taking that heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
