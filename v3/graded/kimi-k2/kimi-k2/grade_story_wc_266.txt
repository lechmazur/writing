<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s embodied authority and the boy’s trembling “Stay” crystallize contradictory impulses; the leash and star stamp anchor interior stakes. Yet the guides remain collective archetypes rather than distinct individuals, blurring micro-choices under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the boy’s wrist bears the star-mark and the silver seam opens, reconfiguring options with felt cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of lullaby, lantern circle, and stone bell tightens until the word “Stay” releases the thread of light.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fog, shale switchbacks, and the unstruck bell stone constrain the boy’s spiral traverse; the leash and star stamp function as micro-settings that charge the final image. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered, though “veiled ridgeway” remains slightly abstract.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—unused courage—tightens when Mara demands the feared name; the stone’s warming and the silk thread visibly foreclose retreat. Pressure escalates via accretion of story fragments that reweight the boy’s stance, not external threat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of reclaimed courage emerges through concrete objects (leash, star, bell stone) and the boy’s whispered “Stay,” never moralized. Final image reweights prior motifs without statement, achieving resonant ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Lyric third-person limited stays close to the boy’s trembling perception; rhythmic lullaby cadence modulates with fog and lantern light. Distinct perceptual signature—“eyes wide as harbor mouths”—anchors voice under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language (“lanterns swaying like slow metronomes”) is selective and purposeful. No loops or scaffold; occasional elevated diction (“crystallized final moment”) remains within mythic register.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Ferry guides as tide-keeping crones, star-stamped ticket punch, and courage summoned by naming one’s own fear synthesize mythic and psychological registers into a fresh, inevitable whole. Risky lyric compression pays off in the charged final image.</comment>
