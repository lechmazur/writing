<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lin’s contradictory impulses—complicity in espionage vs. desire for agency—are dramatized in the moment he burns the film and proposes public broadcast; Mara’s tears and lowered gun embody the same conflict. Interiority is concrete (“the words chilled Lin, for they were identical…”) and choices carry visible cost (the agency’s wrath, the blank fortune). Only the final beat of handing Mara a blank slip feels slightly under-motivated, keeping it shy of 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: microdot arrival triggers recognition of self-fulfilling prophecy → choice to broadcast → immediate mainland reconfiguration. Closure is a decisive change (lighthouse becomes public conductor) with felt cost (loss of secrecy, potential agency retaliation). The beam-spelled Morse and echoed phrase crystallize the new state on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The lighthouse’s lamp room, Fresnel lens, kerosene lantern, and marine radio frequencies are not backdrop but tools that enable the final broadcast; the sea wind and foghorn supply the “familiar enigma” that charges the ending. Spatial choreography is clean; no white-room drift. Only the mainland’s “new constellation” is slightly abstract, preventing 9.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—control over the flow of secrets—tightens when Lin realizes his fortunes have been steering lives. The single escalation beat (burning the film, turning the lighthouse into a radio station) narrows options irrevocably and extracts a visible price: the agency’s future hostility and the irreversible public confession.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: secrecy as control vs. transparency as liberation. The final image—sea echoing the broadcast until the phrase becomes “simply music”—offers a resonant, non-moralizing answer. No thematic statements intrude; meaning is carried by action and image alone.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with salt-stained trench coats, “black snowflakes” of burning film, and gulls “like notes seeking harmony.” POV remains locked to Lin; perceptual signature is consistent. Compression (“Lin smiled, feeling the old blues resolve…”) is purposeful and paid off in closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; each sentence advances plot or atmosphere. Figurative language is selective (“twin moons” for Mara’s eyes) and never muddles causality. Minor filter-verb clusters (“Lin felt…”) appear but do not stall momentum or touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The fortune-cookie-as-dead-drop conceit is fresh, and the transformation of the lighthouse into a midnight radio station feels inevitable yet surprising. The synthesis of espionage, prophecy, and music is specific to this voice and setting; removing any layer collapses the story.</comment>
