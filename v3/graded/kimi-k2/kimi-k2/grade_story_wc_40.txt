<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The scholar’s interiority is textured—his shift from decoding to surrender is embodied in the tactile handling of crystals and the single spoken word “Mother.” Yet the arc is more revelation than choice; the decisive renunciation (leaving the library) feels lightly motivated, reducing the felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the library’s “become” chord reconfigures meaning and the scholar’s stance crystallizes in Earned Stasis. Causality is Accumulative/Textural—each absorbed syllable layers pressure until the final resonance. The pattern is taught early and paid off, though the external stakes remain abstract.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The shadowed library is rendered with selective sensory detail (dust, broken chandelier, uncut dictionary) that constrains movement and choice. The crystals act as micro-setting, their sonic properties directly shaping the climax. Spatial anchors are clear; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether to decode or surrender to the library’s living memory—tightens through each crystal-activated testimony. Pressure escalates as the scholar’s agency narrows to listening; the cost is the abandonment of lifelong scholarly purpose. The shift is felt but not viscerally priced.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: language as living, recursive growth versus archival stasis. The final chord “become” reweights every prior whispered syllable without moralizing. Subtext in the lullaby and the hollowed dictionary deepens resonance; ambiguity is purposeful and charged.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with rhythmic control that modulates from hush to ringing clarity. Perceptual signature is consistent—the scholar’s reticence filters every image. No head-hopping; compression and elision are pattern-taught and legible at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and musical, each sentence advancing atmosphere or character. Metaphors (crystal facets “ringing,” “shawl of cobwebs”) are purposeful and coherent. Minor loop risk in repeated “hush” variants, but cadence supports pressure. No artifacts touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The premise—library as living acoustic archive—is fresh yet inevitable, synthesized through specific sensory logic. The recursive growth pattern and sonic testimony transform familiar tropes of memory and loss. Risk-taking (lyric accumulation, non-linear closure) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
