<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is precise and embodied—her reflex to “preprocess reality” is dramatized through sweeping, kneeling, pinning plastic—but the final communal turn diffuses the single-POV crucible and softens the personal cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Mara accepts gradual recovery, foreclosing spectacle; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds as dust patterns reweight meaning. Cost is legible in the slide of butterfly dust resettling—quiet, exact, irreversible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The greenhouse’s broken panes, algae, and compost barrels constrain every action; the punctured roof framing clouds like “incomplete equations” charges the final image of controlled experiment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—strip needless drama from flood damage—tightens once when Mara chooses slow observation over spectacle; the cost is the surrender of heroic narrative, felt but understated.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of gradualism emerges through dust spirals, pulsar timings, and shared sweeping; the final image of “patient fractures meeting patient repairs” offers resonant, non-moralizing closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is neutron-star precise yet tactile—“flamboyant fireworks at data,” “earthy arithmetic of survival”—with rhythmic control that modulates from elegiac to measured without head-hop.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; no loops or scaffold, only purposeful compression. Metaphors stay coherent—“star coming to terms with friction the way a town does”—and the final sentence lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fusion of astrophysics and flood-recovery gardening feels inevitable; the butterfly-dust calibration device is fresh, specific, and irreplicable. Risky lyric accumulation pays off in the closing image.</comment>
