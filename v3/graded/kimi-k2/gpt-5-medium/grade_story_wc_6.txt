<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is embodied and specific; the contradiction between inherited fire-skill and chosen compassion is dramatized in the coin-swing and grafting beats. Micro-choice to share the coin with the boy crystallizes her stance. Cost is felt when she gives away the red thread—an irreversible act of binding. Slight reserve: the boy’s interiority is only implied, not fully on-stage.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the coin pinned above the door and sand beside the hose rack reconfigure her daily vocation under the new vow. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of weighted objects and songs tightens to final image. Causality intact: every beat flows from “because she listens” to “therefore she grafts hope.” No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Obsidian lagoon, sea lettuce mats, and gulls as “pale runes” are vivid, selective, and filtered through her fire-trained attention to wind and glass. Micro-setting of the coin touching water constrains the next choice—sound teaches calm. Final image of coin above station door re-uses setting object as charged constraint. One minor drift: “kelp-drift peace” is named more than enacted.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove scars can sing—escalates through listening test with boy and grafting act; each step narrows her path from firefighter to keeper of songs. Cost is the red thread relinquished and the public vow made. Pressure coherent under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves. Slight softening: boy’s bandaged hand is more emblem than active threat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of unyielding compassion emerges through the grafting of hope onto burned wood, never sermonized. Final image of coin above the station door reweights the premise: she now answers both alarms and water. Subtext in the boy’s matched breathing and the sand riding the surface deepens resonance. No thematic echo in final paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded in firefighter’s sensory lexicon—“matches rattling,” “patient mouth of wood.” Rhythm modulates with pressure: long cadence for dunes, clipped for coin swing. No head-hopping; POV remains tightly anchored. Distinct perceptual signature—wind read as lung, glass as throat—sustained to last line.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; every sentence layers image, action, and metaphor without clutter. No loops or scaffold; “black sand from volcanic beach” is the only near-repeat and serves as ballast motif. Metaphors are coherent—“obsidian folded tight as night”—and never muddle causality. Final line crystallizes without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses arsonist’s daughter turned firefighter with singing obsidian lagoon—fresh synthesis. Grafting hope onto a burned stump literalizes theme in a way that feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risk in lyric compression pays off: the story earns its mythic tone without breaking plausibility. No derivative echoes.</comment>
