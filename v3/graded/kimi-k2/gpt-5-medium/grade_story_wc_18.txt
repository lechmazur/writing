<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ilen’s interiority is embodied and specific—his carpenter’s mind, the weight of ladders, the hazard of glory—yet the final choice to “teach holding” rather than trap feels slightly under-motivated by prior beats. Noor’s grounded stance and shared breathing create credible relationship pressure. Flaws and contradictions are present but not fully compounded into visible cost at the close.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens is taught early and held: each mirrored corridor, frost shimmer, and synchronized breath layers density until the orchard re-recognizes itself. Closure lands as Charged Poise—the dream settles, boundaries soften, city touches orchard—with the cost legible in the relinquished fences and the broken sextant now accepted as instruction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The ruined orchard, thick fog, and frostlight function as micro-setting that constrains every move; the mirrors and sextant act as portable rooms. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, guiding the breathing choreography. Spatial anchors are clear from the first paragraph.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—prevent the dream from severing district from city—is signaled early and tightened through each mirrored corridor and breath count. Escalation is accumulative: the dream’s feral brightness versus the orchard’s exhalation. The final softening of cruel edges shows visible cost without tidy resolution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: the ethics of holding versus trapping, the geometry of care. The final image of “a city touching its orchard again” offers a resonant, non-moral answer. No abstract statement intrudes; complexity lingers in the retained brokenness of the sextant.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with a perceptual signature rooted in craft and orchard memory. Patterned elision—breath as punctuation, frost as metronome—is taught early and paid off. No head-hopping; POV remains tightly anchored to Ilen’s sensory carpenter’s lens.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence advances image or pressure. Metaphors (“lenses like sleeping birds,” “glass mountains hush”) are specific and coherent. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; rhythm modulates with the breathing cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The premise—using broken instruments and mirrored frost to coax a feral dream—feels fresh and inevitable. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Specificity of orchard craft and astronomical residue transforms familiar motifs into singular texture.</comment>
