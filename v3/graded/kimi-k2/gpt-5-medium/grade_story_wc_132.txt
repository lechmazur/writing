<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s interior contradiction—command vs. release—is embodied in micro-choices (tying knots that sigh loose, stepping aside for jasmine). The final renunciation carries visible cost: she forfeits the old identity of arranger and accepts slower, uncertain tending. One slip: “circuitously sincere” is asserted more than dramatized in dialogue.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of failed control accumulates until the final image reweights the premise. Closure—“she would keep listening until the garden could hear itself through her”—is a Charged Poise that crystallizes the new stance with felt cost (loss of certainty). Orientation is immediate; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The mossy trellis after rain functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: it is both shelter and witness to her vow. Sensory detail is selective (droplets like second thoughts, silver sky) and filtered through Mara’s plant-tuned perception. One minor drift: “tin” smell of runoff is vivid but not re-anchored.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will she cling to control or learn release—tightens through each failed reconstruction. The decisive deepening occurs when she signs the “treaty” by stepping aside; the cost is the surrender of her authority. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: every forced knot loosens, every allowed braid holds. Final image of listening until the garden hears itself offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. Subtext in gestures (pressing the crisped leaf to the post) carries the weight of the lesson.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Distinct lyric texture—rain-told truth, roots thinking—remains consistent and character-bound. Compression and patterned elision (“the storms had already pruned the town’s certainties”) are taught early and paid off in closure. No POV leakage; dialogue sparse but natural when present.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is purposeful. One mixed metaphor—“inventory of compromises” vs. ceiling drip—barely grazes clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Familiar gardener-learns-to-let-go arc is transformed through specific plant calculus and the linden-leaf motif. The synthesis of meteorology, botany, and interiority feels inevitable. Risk in lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring closure.</comment>
