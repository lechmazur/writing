<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The poet’s interiority is vivid and embodied; his contradictory impulse—seeking beauty in incompleteness while actively mending—drives every beat. The boy’s grief is rendered through micro-choices (empty spool, chest evens) rather than labels. Final renunciation (letting the kite go) is earned and carries felt cost, though the boy’s arc is slightly less textured.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of “tending” tightens through density and cadence shift. Closure is a Charged Poise—the raft drifts, kite becomes cloud—reconfiguring loss into listening. Cost is legible in the boy’s ribbonless spool and the poet’s relinquishing of the last line of ink.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cobalt lagoon, reeds, puddled sand, and the drake-feather tool all constrain choices and charge the final image. Weather and micro-objects (bottlecap, torn lily pad) are filtered through the poet’s biased perception, guiding action rather than decorating.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to hold loss without erasing it—tightens when the kite string snaps. Escalation is textural: each loop drawn in sand deepens the boy’s breathing and reweights the silence. Cost is visible in the relinquished kite and the poet’s spent ink.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of “beauty in the torn” emerges organically from the boy’s snapped kite and the poet’s woven dawns. Final image (kite as cloud with invisible handle) offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. Subtext in gesture—tying ribbon to feather—carries more weight than any statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct lyric texture: controlled syntax, patterned elision (“tide math,” “wicker lid from a sleeping basket of song”) taught early and paid off. POV remains tightly anchored to the poet; perceptual signature is selective and biased. Dialogue is spare, subtextual, and advances the joint ritual.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet clear; figurative language is selective and purposeful. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Rhythm modulates with emotional pressure, culminating in the quiet final line that “lets the ink say less than silence can.”</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise—poet teaches grief as collaborative art—feels fresh and inevitable. Transformation of a kite loss into a lesson in listening is specific and grounded. Risky lyric compression succeeds because pattern is taught early and closure remains legible.</comment>
