<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Arin’s interiority is embodied and specific—signing to water, sketching tide marks—yet the advisor’s whispered counsel remains too abstract to register as active pressure; the final renunciation (empty camera as vow) is earned and costly, but the advisor’s role never crystallizes into a crucible relationship.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the map is given to the tide, the song becomes coordinates of silence, and the cost is the unrecordable memory; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each beat layers density until the final cadence shift reweights the stake without causal contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The luminous harbor is not backdrop but instrument: moonlight grants permission, boards tremble into cadence, the bell’s rust answers in orange light; environment constrains every choice and charges the final image of the empty camera as “bell of unstruck light.”</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—translate silence into music—tightens through each mapping act; the single soft bell-stroke is the decisive escalation that bends rather than breaks quiet, and the cost is the irreversible dispersal of the map into tide.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: memory as the loudest instrument that must be tuned by forgetting; the final image of the empty camera carried like a bell of unstruck light reweights the entire premise without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet disciplined, each sentence doing double duty; sign-language gestures and salt-bloom sketches create a perceptual signature that never drifts into abstraction; rhythm modulates with pressure, climaxing in the hushed bell-stroke.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is taut, metaphorically precise—“sound traveled outward like a ring through milk”—with zero loops or scaffold; every image advances atmosphere or stakes, and the final cadence breathes exactly where needed.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The conceit of mapping silence into music via sign language and an empty camera feels inevitable yet wholly fresh; risk-taking in form (lyric accumulative) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the synthesis is inseparable from this voice and place.</comment>
