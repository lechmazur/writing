<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“spongey dread clinging to every map”), motives rooted in honoring ancestor drive every micro-choice; the copper-nail insertion is a credible, costly act that forecloses passivity. Minor drift: Liza’s reappearance feels slightly convenient rather than earned by prior causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Decisive Change: the boundary mists reverse, exiles return, director’s control ruptures. Causal chain (coded stanzas → nail → panel → mists) holds cleanly; cost is felt in the director’s fury and the soaked, coughing returnees. Lens is Causal throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Weather station oozes tactile decay—“corridors bleed humidity,” “instruments whisper forecasts that smell of mold.” The copper nail and rusted panel function as micro-setting that literally unlocks the world rule; environment constrains the final choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—restore reversibility of exile—tightens once when the nail turns the panel; director’s attempted shutdown raises cost. Agency is clear: protagonist’s deliberate act rewrites the exile rule with visible price (director’s rage, returned bodies).</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of honoring erased labor emerges through concrete objects (nail, journals) and action rather than statement. Final image—“mists now braided both directions”—reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext in director’s “dry as paperwork” versus soaked returnees is sharp.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct, lyrical yet precise—“librarianship, which is simply stewardship with better indexes.” Syntax mirrors the humid, sagging world; no head-hopping. Compression and patterned elision (“rickety priest”) are taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence layers map, body, and machine. Occasional stacked metaphors (“storms stagger like wounded cattle”) risk overwriting but serve the pressure beat. No loops or scaffold; rhythm accelerates toward the clunk and mist bloom.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of maritime history, bureaucratic dystopia, and librarian heroics. Reversible exile as fog-hallway is non-obvious yet inevitable once revealed. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without gimmickry; transformation test passes—story collapses if elements swapped.</comment>
