<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is textured and embodied; the narrator’s “serenely radical correction” stance is dramatized through micro-choices (hooking the box, packing the papers). The final renunciation—quiet collaboration with the engineer—earns its cost via prior family complicity. Minor: the aunt and father remain off-page, so relationship crucible is muted.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the canal “unfolded a truer city” reweights all prior lies. Causal chain (rumor → box → ledger → engineer) holds; the sundial’s stillness crystallizes the moment. No orientation drift; anchors clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Canal, lock stairs, and slime-green seal are vivid and selective; the sundial and box function as micro-settings that constrain choices. Final image of ripples “like new lines on a map” recharges the setting with conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“understand the architecture of lies”—tightens when the ledger proves family complicity. One decisive turn: salvage shifts to collaboration. Cost is felt in the quiet “why he had chosen sleep over signal.”</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of civic deception emerges organically from concrete artifacts (floodgate angles, nightly interlude). Final image offers non-literal answer: the city’s reflection carried by water. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, lyrical, and POV-locked; perceptual signature in “lantern glass polished by rain.” Compression and elision taught early (“by the silence of morning radio”) and paid off in closure. No head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language disciplined to pattern (“parchment ribbon,” “slime-green seal”). No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances. Minor elevated diction fits the reflective narrator.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Familiar “hidden history” trope is transformed through canal specificity and family complicity. Fresh inflection: the box’s seal and ledger reweight the city’s birth myth. Risky lyric mode succeeds without obscuring clarity.</comment>
