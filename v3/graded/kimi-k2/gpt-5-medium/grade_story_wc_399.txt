<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The keeper’s interiority is embodied and specific—“echo of wisdom settle against my ribs”—but the walker’s motivation remains largely atmospheric; his final gesture earns the widening yet lacks prior contradiction to make the cost personal.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the clearing widens through peripheral trust, sealing the day’s record with felt restraint. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds; each beat layers hush and parapet motion until the final breath reweights the valley’s silence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Whisperfield, pavilion, and kinetic parapet are vivid, selective, and constrain every tactical choice; the sand’s pulse literally steadies the words. The final image of tracks filling anchors the cost in the mutable terrain.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“preserve the echo of wisdom”—is signaled early and tightened once when wind threatens to scatter vowels; the walker’s stitch-line and the keeper’s anchor pay a visible price in fatigue and restraint.</comment>

<comment>Theme of quiet endurance versus blaring certainty emerges through concrete ritual; the closing image of the prophet sealing the cup with cloth-breath reweights the entire premise without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Distinct lyric texture—“sand’s underbody,” “glass ribs of the tent”—maintains perceptual signature under pressure; no head-hopping, and the hushed consonants cadence mirrors the valley’s breath.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; only minor loop risk in “hush” repetitions, but each instance recharges atmosphere. No mixed metaphors or register drift; final line lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The conceit of memory as skittish deer and language as birds folding talons feels fresh and inevitable; the peripheral-vision method transforms a familiar meditation trope into lived ritual.</comment>
