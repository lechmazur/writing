<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The skeptic’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“disbelief is not an exit but a question with chairs”), and the micro-choice to sit in the “quiet room” with Lio crystallizes her arc. Yet the shift from skeptic to disciplined listener is slightly under-motivated; the tile’s arithmetic never visibly tests her doubt, so the renunciation feels more lyrical than earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the “room” reconfigures meaning and forecloses the path of pure skepticism. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—patterns accumulate until the final image reweights them. Cost is felt in the narrator’s rare admission of loss, though the causal trigger (tile + shell + whale arcs) is more poetic than mechanical.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The tower, tile, and whale road are tactile and selective; the tile’s “sums steadying my pen” constrains the act of transcription. Spatial choreography is clean, and weather (cold front, gulls) alters mood without cliché. The final image of two chairs under starlight charges the setting with conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can disciplined attention create space for reflection without mysticism?—is signaled early and tightened when Lio’s shell becomes the test object. The midnight pod breach aligns with tile columns, deepening pressure. Cost is visible in the narrator’s spoken losses, though external stakes remain abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: grief as shared pattern rather than erased sorrow. The final image of two chairs offers a non-literal answer—listening as architecture—without moralizing. Subtext in Lio’s whispered name and the ink “like her ship’s wake” carries emotional weight without exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, lyrical yet precise: “numbers breathed,” “gulls like torn letters.” Compression and elision are taught early (“I did not believe, yet I remained”) and paid off in the charged final cadence. No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains consistent under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and function. No loops or scaffold, though occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing”) momentarily lifts above the narrator’s lexicon. Metaphors cohere and serve closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of magic square, whale migration, and archival grief feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The premise is transformed through specific, lived detail rather than trope reuse.</comment>
