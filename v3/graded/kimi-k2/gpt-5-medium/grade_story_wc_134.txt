<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clairvoyant’s interiority is vivid (“I did not see it coming” refrains) and her micro-choice to reach for the pearl then hesitate shows contradictory impulses. Motivation (guide vs. witness) intensifies, but the final renunciation is slightly under-costed—no bodily or social price is dramatized on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: musical density increases until the pearl’s tone reconfigures meaning. Closure is a Charged Poise—pilgrim offers the pearl back, cave re-sounds with village life; cost is felt in the guide’s displaced role. Orientation is clear by line 3; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Crystal ribs, salt-tasting scales, and the bell of silence are selective, sensory, and purposeful. Environment constrains choice: the cave’s acoustics force the pilgrim’s offering and the guide’s hesitation. Final image of “woven dusk” recharges earlier “bright darkness.”</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—magnify everyday magic without conquest—is signaled early. Escalation is textural: music thickens, pearl glows, village sounds manifest. One tightening beat: guide’s attempt to stop the pearl fails, foreclosing her authority. Cost is conceptual (loss of predictive power) but not viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the tension between prophecy and humble ritual; no explicit moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture—kneeling to ask, not to take. Final tone reweights “bright darkness” from mystery to communal listening; ambiguity lingers without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet anchored in bodily perception (“tastes of salt,” “chalk from forgotten names”). Syntax modulates with pressure; patterned elision (“choir of rock inhales”) is taught early and paid off. No head-hopping; POV remains tightly clairvoyant.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with scene needs; no loops or scaffold. Metaphors are precise (“loaves proofing like metronomes”). Information density is high—each line advances atmosphere or stakes. No overwriting; final cadence slows to crystallize the image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: crystal cave as sourdough starter for communal memory. Risky lyric compression succeeds; pilgrim-baker and singing geology feel inevitable. No stock tropes; transformation test fails if names are swapped, confirming originality.</comment>
