<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Contradictory interior emotions simmer (anger / tenderness), embodied in “humming leaves”, pendant heat, soil scent. Micro-choice to proffer necklace shows hierarchical values in cost: public confession is acknowledged but the cost is burial not broadcast. Relationship pressure forces a stance crystallization: “We practice being two again” is earned stasis, not tidy pardon. The drive to graft meaning onto old wounds is consistent and visible in every soil pat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens. Closure by Resonant Reconfiguration: final image of exposed chain tugged by “future hand” crystallizes the stance shift without solving it; cost is the burial of shared fossil. Escalation via constellation—icicle drip tracked → soil pocket dug—tightens meaning, not action options, in one quiet intensification. Pattern-teaches the drip path early; no orientation debt. Causality intact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The data-centre turned moss garden is palpably present: “vines tether racks,” loam smells of rain and former silicon. Icicle drip pattern literally records time and path for characters to trace, constraining movement and meaning. Pendant acts as micro-setting under skin; moss bowl replaces servers. Spatial anchors sharp early—gate, fern bowl, roof gap—track cleanly across the scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Central stake: public betrayal vs private reconciliation. Escalation is soft but present: viral confession → meeting → burial of token → mutual renunciation of art/silence practices. Agency exercised in soil burial and explicit pact rather than spectacle response. Cost is visible: sacrificed artifact and future ambiguity “not nothing, but not forgiveness.”</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: staged vs lived intimacy, damage as growth medium, silence as art refusal. Subtext carried in gesture: burial instead of proclamation. Returns to moss metaphor without sermonizing. Final image “honeyed hush of protected vulnerability” answers the theme non-literally, reweighting the premise of what can be preserved untouched.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice distinct, tactile, lyric yet grounded (“tasted silicon once and tastes rain now”). Metaphor density serves character perception, not ornament; rhythm modulates under hush. Internal monologue never over-explains emotional states, relies on sensory grounding. Dialogue spare, clipped, carries subtext well.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rhythm natural, high information density. No loops: “moss swallows cable trays / fans rustle honeyed hush” packs both action and atmosphere. Figurative language precise and internally coherent. Minor phrase echo—twice “honeyed hush”—reads intentional and earned, not repetitive. Closure lines carry weight without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</question><comment>Post-confession moss burial as reconciliation site is fresh; digital ruin garden avoids cliché. Yet the viral-documentary betrayal beats echo familiar celebrity-scandal territory. Specificity of abandoned server moss garden rescues it from template. Burial as non-gesture gesture transforms trope enough to be remembered.</comment>
