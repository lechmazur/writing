<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The embroiderer’s interiority is vivid and embodied—“I pricked my finger, dabbed the thread with red”—but the keeper remains a cipher; no status shift or crucible moment occurs between them. The final acceptance of blame is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the embroidered cloth now holds the coup’s blueprint and the fool accepts blame. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each stitch adds density until the pattern “opens a throat”—and the candle’s ash marks the cost on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The cobalt observatory’s brass rails, domes, and eternal candle are tactile and selective; the candle’s ash later reweights the final image. Spatial choreography is clean—“the keeper set down his cloth”—and the setting constrains the quiet, conspiratorial mood.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—will the embroidered map expose the falsified star routes—tightens when the whisper confirms the conspiracy and the fool accepts blame. Pressure escalates through pattern density rather than causal turns, fitting the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: knowledge disguised as folly, silence as complicity. The final image of the candle watching while the fool sleeps crystallizes the cost without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct—“rumor is a wandering star”—with controlled lyric compression. POV remains stable; no head-hopping. The prose’s rhythmic rise and fall mirrors the embroiderer’s listening stance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences are dense yet clear—“dust made constellations over the unused charts.” No loops or mixed metaphors. Figurative language is purposeful and pattern-taught early.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The galaxy-chart embroiderer who listens instead of speaks, stitching conspiracies into silk, is a fresh synthesis. The coup rehearsing in dust feels inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
