<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority is textured and consistent—"creeping normality noticer" is embodied through tactile micro-choices (pressing orris, listening to spoons). Motive remains steady, but the arc is more witness than transformation; the final renunciation is gentle rather than costly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Track B mosaic structure (three shards) is taught early and lands a Resonant Reconfiguration: the narrator’s understanding that houses live through our pauses. Each shard tightens the pattern; closure crystallizes with felt conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Bay, salt lane, and beetle tin function as micro-settings that constrain ritual placement and attention. The orris shard itself becomes a charged object-environment; its warmth and seam directly shape the final breath-image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—why some houses feel alive—escalates via each cottage’s test. Agency is observational rather than interventionist; pressure deepens through pattern recognition, not reversal. Cost is conceptual (knowledge of absence) rather than tangible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges from ritual attention: aliveness is lent, not innate. Subtext lives in displaced objects and hush; the final line reframes the premise without moralizing. Complexity is honored—houses remain ambivalent vessels.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with a perceptual signature attuned to minute drift. Syntax modulates with hush and tide; no head-hopping. Purposeful compression ("shard of hush") teaches its pattern and pays off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense and musical—"tide slurred the pebbles like patient breathing"—yet every image advances atmosphere or stakes. No loops or mixed metaphors. Rhythm breathes with scene pressure; final ear-of-lavender gesture lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Premise fuses animism with forensic attention; the orris-as-detector device feels freshly specific. Risky lyric accumulation succeeds because pattern is taught early and closure reconfigures meaning. Avoids familiar hauntology tropes through tactile ritual.</comment>
