<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Interiority is sharp and embodied: “breath plumes like banners,” “eyes wider than comfort.” Vigilance is more posture than flaw; the arc leans toward disciplined endurance without contradiction, yet the cost (abandoning ropes for salt) feels slight for the length.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Causality hinges on listening for unheard hoofbeats—motivated ellipsis that reconfigures the closing hush. Closure lands when patience itself becomes the messenger; the inferred lens (Accumulative/Textural) is held. No orientation drift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Basalt, iron rails, swallows—the environment guides choice and resurfaces in the final rail-horizon image with charged specificity; moon-path mechanics stay consistent. Ice hush and reed song anchor mood without ornamental drift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Patience as revolution shapes stakes—ropes laid down, salt laid in—but pressure never cracks. One decisive intensification suffices under Accumulative lens; visible trade-offs milk-smooth rather than spine-shaking.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Winter learns its own pace: stillness as usable stance, not thesis. Quiet image finalizes the question without moral; subtext lies in waiting cattle and magnetic rails. Complexity intact, no tidy moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is tactile and rhythmically honed—“magnetic viaduct after rain” carries thrum under soles. No head hops; interior and exterior speech remain distinct. Compression heightens pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is lyric yet propulsive: “rooks like flint,” “the world unlatching.” No loops or scaffold; sentence rhythm modulates with pressure. Figurative language earns its keep.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Patient revolution as quiet school, horizon reconfigured into action—specific synthesis of stillness and labor. Risk-taking is lyrical restraint; resonance lands without gimmickry.</comment>
