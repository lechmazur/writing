<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is precise and embodied; the translator’s tactile trust in grooves over ink, the seed’s warming in the pouch, and the final quieting of “haunted ambitions” all reveal contradictory impulses under pressure. Motivation—meeting the edge where bonds loosen—remains consistent and drives every micro-choice. The only cap is the absence of a second on-page character, so relationship crucible is N/A; otherwise characterization is near flawless.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the arbor’s soft chime crystallizes the new stance—“not to own transition, but to keep company.” Cost is palpable in the vacuum that remains after the whispered name. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of analogical thinking, rail-hum returning, seed splitting. Orientation is clear by line 4; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Magnetic arbor above clouds is never backdrop; its filings, rails, and trunks constrain every adjustment the translator makes. The seed’s cradle of filings and the barky pulses encode memory, charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and urgent; no white-room syndrome. World rules stay consistent without exposition.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reestablish harmonic guidance before trunks spark—is signaled early and tightened through each node adjustment. Escalation is Accumulative: each tablet pressed, each vowel tuned increases density until the rails answer. Cost is felt in the “pressure that tries to be a passage” and the final acceptance of distance. No coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of transition as companionship rather than ownership emerges from concrete acts—translating grooves, planting seed, steadying rails—never from assertion. Final image of the arbor’s chime finding the ribs offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. Subtext in the seed’s “lost chords” and the vacuum after the name deepen complexity. No thematic drift.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct, tactile, and rhythmic: “my hands trust grooves more than ink,” “the arbor is a sentence.” Syntax mirrors the translator’s methodical kindness and analogical leaps. No head-hopping; POV stays tightly interior. Compression like “weight is rumor” is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid; each sentence advances story or atmosphere. Metaphors are precise and consistent—rails as reeds, voice as water. No loops, scaffold, or register drift. Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; paragraph cuts are purposeful. Final line resolves by image that recharges earlier motifs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses cuneiform translation, magnetic arbor, and post-spirit physics into a fresh, non-obvious whole. Tropes of grief and orchard are transformed through tactile specificity and scientific metaphor. Risky lyric structure pays off: the arbor as grammar, the seed as clause. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
