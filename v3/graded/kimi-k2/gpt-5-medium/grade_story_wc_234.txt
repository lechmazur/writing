<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied (“ash-petaled crownlets settle on our hair like moths that have learned metallurgy”), but the protagonist’s contradictory impulses are more stated than dramatized; the final choice to “return differently” is credible yet feels lightly earned because the cost is more conceptual than visceral.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each return to the spiral moment deepens texture and reweights the stake of “presence.” Closure is a Charged Poise—the thimble of light that reconfigures how the friends will move through time—delivered with felt cost: “presence is a metal that refuses to alloy with hurry.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>“Ember nexus at twilight” and the forge trees’ sparks are vivid, selective, and thematically charged; the nautilus curl functions as micro-setting that constrains the experiment and anchors the final image. Environment and object together shape tactics without clutter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“to capture the density of presence”—is signaled early and tightened through iterative returns; each pass loosens a knot and rewinds it into structure, showing escalating pressure under the Accumulative lens. Cost is legible: the surrender of hurry and the open-ended commitment to “return differently.”</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of presence-as-attention emerges from concrete ritual rather than statement; the final thimble of light offers a non-literal answer to the whispered doubt. Subtext in gesture and silence (“we do not kiss; we calibrate”) deepens resonance without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet disciplined, with a perceptual signature that fuses scientific diction (“capillary time,” “natural logarithm”) and sensory precision. Rhythm modulates with pressure; no head-hopping or register drift. Distinctive and sustained.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; figurative language is patterned and paid off (“ember nexus,” “bottled noon”). Minor risk of overwriting in “moths that have learned metallurgy,” yet the line serves the final crownlet image. No loops or scaffold; momentum holds.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Transforms the familiar “friends sharing a secret” into a non-obvious alchemical rite; the pocket-sun-as-presence device feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without gimmickry; synthesis is fresh and fully committed.</comment>
