<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and character-specific (“shadowed rapture”), micro-choice to let the instrument rest signals earned exhaustion; cost is felt, though backstory blocks (study of star-charts) exceed the BRR cap slightly, shaving 0.4.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands on the page via Earned Stasis—the walk back toward the arch and the city’s newly voiced silence is reconfiguration with persistent cost; inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds through repeating circuits and crescendo of windows opening.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sensory economy delivers shimmering cold and granite-scented pages that tighten choice; archway constrains entry, and the instrument’s weight is physical anchor; one object does double duty as hinge and tool, charging final image.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—liberate trapped creativity—tightens via each meteor traced; agency is clear, but escalation is more pattern-accumulation than single pivot, cap holding because final silence carries cost.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of listening as resurrection threads organically through images; final reprise of windows flinging open reweights earlier silence without sermon; slight drift into stated vocation near start deducts −0.2.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Lyric control and perceptual signature are impeccable—brass chilled, “lungs of marble”—compression taught early by the whispering sky and paid off in final sculptor’s laugh. No POV leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Rhythm accelerates with meteoric descent and sculptor’s laugh; vivid figurative density is patterned and compressed, not overblown; one scaffold line “I rest too” is negligible.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Marrying astronomy, aurora archaeology of lost art feels inevitable yet fresh; risk lies in sustained lyric surrealism that never cheats its physics; transformation test confirms this only works on this page.</question>
