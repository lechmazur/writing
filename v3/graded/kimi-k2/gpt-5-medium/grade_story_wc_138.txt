<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The immortal’s contradictory impulses—boredom vs. hunger for meaning—are dramatized in micro-choices (coaxing space, leaking the rumor, pocketing the fragment). Lio’s presence forces a status shift and a credible softening of refusal, paid for with memories and withheld forgiveness. Interiority is specific, embodied, and consistent; the final stance crystallizes with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the corridor reveals that farewell becomes infrastructure, and the immortal accepts a new purpose—feeding the fragment stories. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens; the storm, prisms, and fragment tighten into a single cadence shift. Cost is legible in the spent seed and the “edges now sharpened into tools.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The prismatic escondite, obsidian mirrors, and storm-veined sky are vivid, selective, and integrated into action; they constrain choices (mirrors hum, storm feeds the fragment). Spatial choreography is coherent; the corridor of farewells functions as micro-setting that charges the final image. No orientation debt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“what happens after goodbye”—is signaled early and escalates through spatial mutiny and the corridor walk. One meaningful tightening occurs when the corridor demands payment in memories and withheld forgiveness, narrowing future options. Cost is visible and felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: farewell is not an ending but an ongoing architecture the heart keeps mending. Subtext operates in gesture (Lio’s laugh in the key of hushed thunder) and image (spent seed). The final image reweights the premise without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, lyric, and consistent; perceptual signature (“angles whisper,” “spectrum like carefully polished knives”) remains coherent under pressure. Compression and elision are taught early and paid off. No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates purposefully.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is patterned and purposeful. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Rhythm accelerates with the storm and breathes in the corridor. Final line crystallizes without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Premise synthesizes immortal boredom, cursed artifact, and spatial mutiny into a fresh angle on farewell. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes without obscuring closure. Specificity throughout prevents generic drift; the ending feels inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
