<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s embodied code-dance and the narrator’s micro-choices under pressure are vivid; the shared scar/promise motive is dramatized through each dice-roll hesitation. Interior contradiction surfaces when the narrator’s fear is “cataloged” yet still acted upon. The final breath-almost-laugh shows earned release with visible cost. No slips touch closure, but the relationship crucible is lightly sketched.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (rust, fish, dice, silt) tightens the pattern until the liberated voices cross the web. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—water withdrawing, cabinets opening, names returning—felt as release rather than triumph. Causality is lyric but legible; no orientation debt. Cost is palpable in the shared breath and the dice’s final click.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The sunken lab is not backdrop; its flooded tiles, rusted pillars, and archival lungs constrain every step and cipher. Micro-setting (floor as page, cabinets as lungs) directly shapes tactics. Sensory hierarchy is POV-bound and urgent. The final image of humming strands recharges the drowned space with undeniable consequence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—free the drowned names—is signaled early and tightened through each dice-dictated hesitation. Agency is exercised in every encoded line and dance pivot; the Warden’s blue pulse raises coherent pressure. One meaningful deepening occurs when doubt (the curved question) opens the vent. Cost is visible in the shared breath and the silt-haloed release.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: vulnerability encrypted as strength, memory refusing to become stone. Subtext lives in gesture—heel-crescent, shoulder-touch—never in exposition. The final image of voices crossing the web offers a resonant, non-moral answer. No thematic drift or sermonizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; perceptual signature is consistent—tide remembering shore, rust sighing, dice clicking like bones. Patterned elision (dance as syntax) is taught early and paid off at closure. No POV leakage or register drift. Rhythm modulates with pressure, accelerating through dice rolls and slowing into the final breath.</comment>

<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every image performs double duty. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Sensory specificity (“pages puckered like fingertips, ink standing up like hair”) is vivid without purple overload. Final cadence shift into the humming strands lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—underwater code heist via dance and corrosion-etched journals—is fresh and fully committed. Tropes (dystopian archive, resistance cipher) are transformed through embodied poetics and the hangman’s dice. The synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight; risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
