<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Rowen’s interiority is lyric rather than embodied; his motives are archetypal (“restore sacred practices”) rather than conflicted. The narrator’s shift from observer to participant is credible but sketched in summary. No contradictory impulses are dramatized on the page; the cost is collective, not personal.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the grove’s “new calm” and the villagers’ shared humming reweight the premise. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each added note thickens the pattern until the final chord resolves it. Orientation is immediate; no causality breaks. Cost is felt in the moon’s “humble astonishment” and the villagers’ open-handed vigilance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The arbor, driftwood frame, and vine tendril function as micro-setting that constrains the ritual and charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful; dew, needles, and moonlight guide attention rather than catalog. Spatial choreography is coherent; no floating props.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“restore sacred practices”—is signaled early and tightened through the countdown to the harvest moon. Escalation is Accumulative: each practiced note increases density until the final alignment. Cost is collective and conceptual rather than individual, but legible in the moon’s lowered chin and the villagers’ careful carrying of calm.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the ritual repair: memory, consent, and collective stewardship. Subtext lives in gesture—Rowen’s laughter at the roots, the owl’s daylight blink. Final image reframes earlier motifs without moralizing. No thematic drift or echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is lyric, consistent, and perceptually specific—“the arbor bent closer, shy as a child.” Syntax modulates with emotional intensity; no head-hopping. Compression and patterned elision are taught early and paid off at closure. Dialogue is minimal but natural when present.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is disciplined and purposeful. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Rhythm breathes with scene needs; final paragraph crystallizes without overwriting. Minor elevation in diction is voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Premise—ritual repair through communal song—is familiar, but the execution is specific and fresh: the vine-tendril instrument, the moon as listener, the jars of warmed notes. Transformation test passes; the story would collapse if transplanted wholesale. Risk is lyrical rather than structural, but it heightens coherence.</comment>
