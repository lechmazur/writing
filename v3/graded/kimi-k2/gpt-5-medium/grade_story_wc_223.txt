<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is embodied and specific (“the real blast braided my lungs with phrases no director could erase”), but the shift from victim to archivist is more asserted than dramatized; the final renunciation (“I will travel with the nomadic penumbra”) is earned yet slightly abstract, keeping it just below the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the gallery’s legible silence reweights the premise, and the cost—abandoning the board and lantern—feels real. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds; each spelled word thickens the pattern until the final hush crystallizes the stance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The whispering gallery’s marble acoustics and drifting lantern-shadow constrain every footstep; the chessboard’s scuffed squares and the widow’s button charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, anchoring the scene without excess.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—archiving small gestures against erasure—is signaled early and tightened by each spelled word; the final refusal to await “kings” forecloses spectacle in favor of witness. Cost is visible in the relinquished board and the dispersal of the gathered strangers.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the act of walking words into stone: memory as communal, tactile resistance to official narrative. The ending’s “legible silence” offers a resonant, non-moral answer to how small kindnesses endure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with a perceptual signature attuned to echo and shadow. Patterned elision (“nomadic penumbra,” “luminous absence”) is taught early and paid off in the final drift of light. No head-hopping; POV remains steady.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; figurative language serves pattern rather than ornament. Minor scaffold (“I told them… I told him”) nudges it below 9.0, yet the rhythm accelerates through the spelling sequence and lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The conceit of walking words into marble to archive kindness is fresh, and the transformation of crisis-actor guilt into communal witness feels inevitable. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
