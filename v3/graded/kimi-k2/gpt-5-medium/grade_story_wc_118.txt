<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The historian’s porous listening is embodied in tactile micro-choices—touching the tapestry, kneeling to the axis—each action aligning with his stated wish and visibly costing him blood from the dragon’s edge. Interior contradiction surfaces only glancingly; the piece leans accumulative rather than causal, so the final renunciation (returning the disk) reads as earned stasis rather than a new decision. No second character on page, so relationship crucible waived.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the historian shelves stories along the new gravity, a charged poise that reweights the premise without tidy resolution. Accumulative lens holds—pattern of listening intensifies until the silo “almost pulses.” Cost is legible in the palm-bite and the whispered “steady now,” foreclosing any return to pre-axis stillness. Orientation anchors early; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The silo’s tilted floor literally dictates where tragedies and hope are shelved, while the brass disk and tapestry shards function as micro-settings that constrain placement and orientation. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—dust “like moths,” ash “spent feathers”—and every detail feeds the bronze quiet. No credibility slips; spatial choreography clean.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve stories before silence erases them—tightens once when the historian realizes the axis displaced dreams themselves. Escalation is accretive: each diary fragment raises the cost of forgetting. The final shelving act crystallizes stance with visible price (blood, exhaustion). No external antagonist needed; pressure coherent under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of listening as survival emerges through concrete particulars—walls “shy gossip,” prairie “shifts like an animal”—never stated. The tapestry’s spindle reappears reweighted from mythic warning to literal map, a conceptual repricing that reorients the entire frame. Final image of stitched echoes offers non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric-accumulative, taught early by the bronze quiet and sustained through rhythmic control (“dust flurries like moths, each wing a different year”). Perceptual signature is distinct—historian hears “brick tone” and “welded rings sigh.” No dialogue, so no register drift; POV stable, no head-hopping.</comment>

<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence layers image and motion. Occasional lyric compression (“grain spine,” “compass needle”) risks overwriting but pattern is taught and paid off. No loops, no filter-verb stacks, no mixed metaphors. Final third remains clean; closure image sharp.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise—post-dream world where buildings wake in terror—is non-obvious and fully committed. Dragons, axis, and historian cohere into singular vision; removing any element collapses the logic. Fresh inflection: displaced axis as literal gravity shift rather than metaphor. Risky lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
