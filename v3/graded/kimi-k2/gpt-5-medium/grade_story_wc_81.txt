<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Ossa’s calm perceptiveness is more narrated than dramatized until the blackout stakes freeze her template decisions; nonetheless her inheritance of method and her single-handed pursuit give the story its sole engine.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>A clear start-to-finish causal arc: blackout silences kinesthetic, lack of power becomes invitation to undo official chronicle, stamp confirmation and registrar marginalia deliver decisive causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The sunken-library salt-threaded brine and drawers warped by brine channel every motion—swollen seams, silt-spiral breath—while the stamp mattress under registrar journals becomes the final image anchor.</comment>

<comment>Theme of stolen origin coheres through violet oval stamp pressing, the registrar’s marginal doubt, and gorge of lowered city; no moralizing, only footprinting truth at image cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>

<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Concise amulet sentences (“like ink from water”) tighten toward final violet oval; no loops; each sentence pushed stakes with sensory precision and rhythmic surge.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: a blackout-weaponized stillness that literally flips settled history; stamp as forensic seismograph is both tool and truth detector.</comment>
