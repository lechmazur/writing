<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The apprentice’s curiosity is embodied in tactile learning and ledger-keeping; the cartomancer’s motives remain slightly abstract but her measured actions (ribbon to the boy’s wrist, elbow-choice test) reveal a coherent ethic. Interior contradiction surfaces when the apprentice must decide whether to treat the overlay as language or omen. The final image—tape as ribbon festival—earns a quiet renunciation of certainty, paid for by the night’s accumulated fatigue and the woman’s chipped buttons.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the tape becomes a “ribbon festival,” crystallizing the shift from prediction to communal mapping. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each vignette layers pattern until the final cadence reweights the premise. Cost is visible in the woman’s “two buttons” and the cartomancer’s acceptance of every currency. No orientation debt; anchors (loft, rain, skylight) are clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The rain-beaded skylight, butcher paper, and chipped mugs ground every measurement; the alley’s “wet cardboard and basil” scent tightens the discovery beat. The measuring tape itself functions as micro-setting, constraining routes and later reappearing as festival ribbon. Weather and spatial choreography remain coherent across the walk from loft to mural.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Dominant stake—mapping survivable paths after economic collapse—is signaled in paragraph 4 and tightened when the tape becomes both tool and gift. Escalation is accumulative: each client’s fragment raises the cost of refusal. The final client’s “chipped buttons” force a trade-off between precision and generosity, paid for by the cartomancer’s stamina and the apprentice’s new literacy.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the tension between prediction and navigation; the inherited mystery resists solution yet demands stewardship. Subtext lives in gestures—elbows choosing cards, ribbon tied to a wrist—rather than exposition. The final image reweights the premise: mapping is not fortune-telling but mutual survival. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in the rain’s untranslatable patience.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</question>
<comment>Voice is tactile, compressed, and rain-soaked; syntax mirrors the apprentice’s steady curiosity (“learns by touch as much as by reading”). Perceptual signature is consistent—rainlight absorbed by onyx ink, tape hissing along floorboards. No head-hopping; cartomancer’s speech is spare and oracular, distinct from the apprentice’s observational cadence.</comment>

<grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and function (“Rain stitched the glass…”). Metaphors are coherent—ink absorbing rainlight, coins washing in a sink. No loops or scaffold; occasional elevated diction (“cartomancer,” “conceptual”) is justified by the narrator’s apprenticeship lexicon. Final line crystallizes without clutter.</comment>

<grade>9.2</question>
<comment>The synthesis of cartomancy, urban archaeology, and post-crash barter feels inevitable and fresh. Reverse-engineering a carnival from a receipt is a non-obvious angle that deepens on reflection. Risky compression—mosaic vignettes—heightens stakes without obscuring closure. No derivative echoes; the inherited-mystery frame is specific to this voice.</comment>
