<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied; the narrator’s contradictory impulses—scientific precision vs. ritual hope—play out in micro-choices (spiral placement, bladder release). The final stance crystallizes with felt cost: “our days tipping toward repair” acknowledges risk. Minor slip: “logical dreamer” is asserted more than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the gauge’s new angle reweights the village’s future. Causal chain—pattern → needle shift → tide response → shared diagram—holds under Accumulative/Textural lens. Cost is legible in the relinquished balloons and the held-breath needle.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Grotto, gauge, and tide are tactile constraints; the skylit cleft limits balloon paths, the rising tide brushes the spiral without wrecking it. Sensory hierarchy (salt, torchlight, obsidian water) filters through the narrator’s weather-reading lineage. Final image of “scattered tin” on the path charges the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore village wakefulness—tightens when the gauge locks at an unseen angle, foreclosing further trial-and-error. Escalation is pattern-density driven: each tessellation increases pressure until the tide’s “careful idea” confirms success. Cost is the shared labor and the risk of communal belief.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of hope as learnable choreography emerges from concrete acts (braiding ribbons, pacing breath) rather than statement. Final image reweights earlier motifs: the spiral becomes a lesson plan, the gauge a metronome. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in “serene upheaval.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with rhythmic control (“sea inhaled and exhaled with steady, cathedral calm”). Perceptual signature—weather-reader’s synesthesia of pressure and emotion—remains consistent. Compression and elision (“siblings not by blood but by the echoed math”) are taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and function (“gut-sealed pig bladders dyed with seaweed ink” does world, tool, and ritual work). No loops or scaffold; metaphors stay coherent. Minor elevated diction (“conceptual,” “calibration”) fits the narrator’s frame.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: meteorological divination meets inter-world collaboration via folk craft. The balloon-gauge as multiversal semaphore feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric structure holds; no derivative echoes.</comment>
