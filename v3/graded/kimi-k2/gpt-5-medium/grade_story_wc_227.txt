<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The interiority is rich and embodied—hands trembling, the metallic weight of promise, kintsugi as action. One friction point: Mira’s death is relayed in summary instead of reactivated choice, so the grief reads as recalled rather than urgent pressure now.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout; pressure grows not through reversals but by density of sensation and the tightening precision of measurement. Closure meets CR: the engine’s final naming reweights the premise with unavoidable cost—he is left with the pattern of her choosing, not Mira herself, and the gold seams flicker “small exclamations the sea cannot dissolve”—visible price on page.</comment>

<comment>The floating workshop supplies active leverage—each creak, hiss, and drip coerces the alchemist’s micro-movements. By the end, the steadying pontoons mirror internal stabilization, fully earning micro-setting as force, not backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</question>
<comment>Dominant stake—finish the memory engine to confront absence—remains coherent. One decisive intensification: fitting the moon charm triggers the first voice of the engine, narrowing the alchemist’s path from hoping-for-return to accepting-pattern-with-cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Theme emerges through texture: gilded seams, bell grammar, acid endurance—“mend what broke” becomes a living principle rather than a slogan. Final image reframes the story’s core question without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</question>
<comment>Fever-dream diction (“rusted with green fumes,” “brine edits what the fumes exaggerate”) remains precise; perceptual signature (briny lungs, calipers kissing craters) never drifts. Compression and elision are taught early and paid off with clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</question>
<comment>Prose is propulsive—no loops, no register drift. One near-redundancy breath/breathless cluster (“I hold my breath without water...the workshop forgets to sink”) earns its echo at peak moment and is therefore waived.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</question>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: acid-sea alchemy meets kintsugi grief-engine; the moon-charm reprise feels inevitable yet wholly unexpected. Risky accumulation pays off in a closure that could not exist without this exact constellation.</comment>
