<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The ego-death survivor’s interiority is embodied through tactile detail (“taste of river stones”) and contradictory impulses (recorder vs blade). The final choice to award joint custody is earned by prior micro-choices—nightly dialogues with the jar, witnessing the sparring—yet the cost (draining inner frost) is stated more than dramatized, keeping it just shy of 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the joint-custody verdict crystallizes a new circuit of care, foreclosing sole guardianship. Causality under Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each training bout and cloud-edit tightens the pattern until the jar’s vibration consents. Orientation is taught early (“floating rock dojo”), waiving any penalty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The floating dojo and its cloud-rivers are not postcard backdrop; altitude and shifting tiles constrain movement choices and mirror internal altitude shifts. The jar’s static gusts act as micro-setting that literally alters tactics (timing the role-swap). Spatial choreography stays clean across the final carry.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—who will vivify the dormant mind—tightens through each sparring exchange and historical rewrite. Agency rests in the narrator’s final shout that swaps Neri/Rae roles, forcing the jar’s consent. Cost is felt (frost draining), though slightly abstract; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of complementary opposites as life-giving circuit emerges from concrete events, never sermon. The ending image—joint custody as alternating current—reweights prior training imagery without moralizing. Subtext hums in the jar’s static consent and the statues’ silent rearrangement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with rhythmic control (“slow rivers of breath,” “threads in seawater”). POV remains stable first-person; perceptual signature is selective (taste, scent, static on teeth). No head-hopping; compression and elision are pattern-taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, musical, and propulsive; every sentence advances image or pressure. Occasional stacked metaphors (“key fits a wound”) flirt with excess but stay legible. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; final cadence lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The clone-custody battle framed through martial philosophy and living history edits is a fresh synthesis. Risky lyric compression and floating-dojo conceit heighten stakes without gimmickry. The joint-custody circuit feels inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
