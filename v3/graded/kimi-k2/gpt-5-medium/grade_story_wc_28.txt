<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The gentle radical’s interior contradiction—steel arms cradling empathy—remains vivid and embodied; every micro-choice (kneeling, arranging tesserae, renaming) flows from that tension. The boy’s arrival and the four renamed men create immediate pressure that alters relationships and stakes. Cost is felt when the plaza “tightens” and the past “loosens” inside the narrator. Only the retrocognitive trait stays more label than lived constraint, keeping the score just shy of 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the tessera and bottle caps crystallize a new social contract—renaming as repair, not erasure—with the plaza’s silence as felt cost. Causal chain holds: boy brings caps → pattern reading → Sila → men renamed → work begins. Orientation is swift; mosaic, ash, and shattered sky anchor time/place by line 3. One shard transition (memory flash) is legible and brief.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The plaza’s broken columns, drifting ash, and chipped tessera are not backdrop but instruments: the stepping stone literally speaks the new names. Micro-setting (steel arms, tessera, bottle caps) constrains every choice. Sensory detail is selective—wind “like a careful surgeon,” shadows “climb my wrists”—and filtered through the POV’s tactile bias. Final image of the tessera returned to ground recharges the opening wound.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to honor grief without re-arming harm—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightened twice: first when the boy asks for a non-burning name, then when the plaza demands a “difficult naming” for the arsonists. Agency remains with the protagonist; coincidence plays no role. The cost is the moral labor of refusing easy condemnation, made visible when the crowd exhales “a warm coat of frost.”</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the concrete act of renaming: mercy that neither forgets nor forgives cheaply. Subtext lives in gestures—steel hands cradling shards, men kneeling to bottle caps—never in exposition. The final image of the tessera returned to ground offers a non-literal answer: memory held, not clutched. No moral is stated; the plaza’s silence suffices.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct, lyric, and internally coherent: “warm coldness, a brazier hidden inside armor.” Syntax mirrors the POV’s measured gentleness—long breaths, careful commas—then tightens under pressure. No head-hopping; even the boy’s speech is filtered through the narrator’s ear. Compression (“the burned lean toward rain”) teaches the pattern early and pays it off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet clear; every sentence advances image or stakes. Metaphors are precise and mutually reinforcing (ash halos, stone grammar). No loops or scaffold; rhythm modulates with emotional beats. Only a single mixed metaphor—“warm coat of frost”—momentarily jars, but it is immediately re-anchored by context.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of post-apocalyptic plaza, mosaic divination, and restorative justice feels inevitable yet fresh. Tropes (post-fire wasteland, scarred child, penitent arsonists) are transformed through the tactile ritual of pattern-reading and the refusal of vengeance. Specificity—bottle caps as oracle, tessera as syllable—anchors universals. Risky structural compression (single scene, lyric mode) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
