<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lark’s contradictory impulses—desire to confess yet fear of certainty—are dramatized in the wind-chime scene; the narrator’s micro-choice to accept the shard crystallizes the cost of renouncing easy absolution. Interiority is embodied in the “cloak of doubt” and the hollow mirror, avoiding label-speak. Final stance is earned: she will confess and re-fund the boats, foreclosing political safety.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the third chime pattern (“speak and set terms”) reweights the premise, forcing Lark to trade electoral purity for moral clarity. Causal chain holds—chime reading → decision → public confession—with felt cost framed by the shard’s emptiness. No orientation drift; lighthouse and dawn anchors are clear by line 6.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The lighthouse gallery, wind chimes, and shifting dawn light constrain the choice: the chimes’ metal timbres literally dictate the decision path. Sensory detail is selective—salt wind, banner cloth, gull timekeeping—filtered through the narrator’s perceptual bias. Setting charges the final image: the town waking below becomes the audience Lark must face.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—confess port bribes or hide them—tightens when the third chime pattern offers a hybrid path that costs both secrecy and tax-cut promise. Escalation is one deepening, not multiple reversals; the wind’s argument narrows options to a single, costly stance. Cost is visible: political suicide framed as moral necessity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: the morality of rescue funded by rot. Subtext lives in the shard’s emptiness and the cloak’s recycled banners—objects that silently question purity. Final image of gulls as “impartial jurors” offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. No thematic drift; every motif reweights at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise—“weight of hesitation,” “conscience for hire”—with rhythmic control that accelerates under wind pressure. POV remains first-person singular, no leakage. Distinct perceptual signature: the narrator hears chimes as “etymologies of risk.” Dialogue is sparse, subtextual, and goal-driven.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence advances stakes or atmosphere. No loops, no mixed metaphors. Figurative language is earned: “the sea arranged choices” fits the keeper’s worldview. Final cadence slows to crystallize the cost—“a conscience for hire who will always choose wind over thunder”—without slack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise—moral consultant paid in emptiness—feels inevitable yet fresh. Wind chimes as decision engine transforms a familiar lighthouse into a moral crucible. Risky lyric compression pays off: the hollow shard’s reprise reconfigures meaning. No derivative echoes; the synthesis is singular.</comment>
