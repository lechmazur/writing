<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ilex's contradictory yearning—irreverent yet worshipful—drives every beat. Motivation intensifies from quip to chalk X: no lying to the algorithm, no tidy ego. The shift from hunter's arrow to bell-switch manifests interior contradiction and final cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens ratchets density (each kaleidoscope twist, each trial hiss). The 29th dawn crystallizes a resonant reconfiguration: the workshop "laughed back with a crackle"—a charged poise that reweights yearning itself. Cost is the irreversible acknowledgment that future ears remain future.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Floating acid sea, arrow-shadow on rafters, gears' teeth—all constrain choice and charge the ending. Steam confetti and "crackle of busy teeth" concretely seal the new state. Environment is filtered through Ilex's biased awe; no static postcard.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</question>
<comment>Single dominant stake: make the unheard bell exist. Each transliteration tightens the noose of desire until "a pressure inside the joints" becomes the unheard toll. Stakes evolve from abstract theory to lived workshop-shudder with visible cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Theme emerges from the machine-prayer paradox: desire must lie to itself yet remain true. Final image offers non-literal answer: a north for a future that must still keep travelling. No sermonizing—only steam confetti and joint ache.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</question>
<comment>Voice is kinetic stained-glass: saints on skates, gulls mocking gravity, "laughed back with… crackle of busy teeth." Perceptual signature is consistently irreverently awed, rhythm under pressure never once drifts.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</question>
<comment>Metaphor density serves the pattern—acid sun shrugs—never overwhelms action. One possible loop ("he wrote it anyway, because") is purposeful echo of desire. Final lines land clean, no scaffolds in sight.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</question>
<comment>Cart-gliding acid-sea bell-chasing fused at concept level; no prior echo. Algorithmic yearning, arrow-switch, steam confetti all feel inevitable in hindsight. Fresh without gimmick.</question>
