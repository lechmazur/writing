<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied; the intern’s “stubborn and simple” motive drives every micro-choice. The janitor’s brief appearance adds relational pressure that shifts the maze. Cost is felt in fatigue and the bench-sleep ending. Minor: the “functionally creative” label is repeated rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the terminal breathes, the intern sleeps, and tomorrow’s buses arrive—cost is the unpaid labor and the bench as bed. Causal chain (redirect flows → sinks wake → mother enters) holds cleanly. Mosaic shards are legible and cohere under an Accumulative/Textural lens. No orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Terminal is tactile and lived-in: rainwater ballroom, dust-skipped archives, skylight surgery. Brass sextant fragment constrains the final image, catching “starless light.” Spatial choreography is flawless; no impossible moves. Environment actively guides every rerouting choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore hope via engineered mercy—tightens as each rerouting forecloses prior dysfunction. Visible cost: unpaid labor, physical fatigue, social precarity. One meaningful deepening when janitor’s wish joins the intern’s, unlocking a new corridor. No coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: hope as system, not slogan. Final image of the terminal “breathing like a rehabilitated lung” reweights all prior equations without moralizing. Subtext in the janitor’s single laugh and wet boots carries more than exposition could. Complexity lingers—no tidy moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, lyrical yet precise: “arteries leading nowhere but memory,” “budgets of mercy.” Perceptual signature stays consistent; no head-hopping. Compression taught early (“I used it as habit and promise”) pays off in the sextant’s final gleam. Dialogue sparse but subtext-rich.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances story, character, or atmosphere. Metaphors are controlled and purposeful; no mixed vehicles. Rhythm modulates with pressure—long sentences for wonder, clipped for action. Final paragraph’s cadence crystallizes the earned stasis.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise—abandoned spaceport as shelter after carnival—feels inevitable yet fresh. Sextant fragment repurposed from navigation to moral bearing is a non-obvious synthesis. Risky lyric accumulation pays off in the rehabilitated-lung image. No derivative echoes; specificity anchors universals.</comment>
