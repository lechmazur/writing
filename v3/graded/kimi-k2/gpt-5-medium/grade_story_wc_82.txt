<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The lantern maker’s grief is embodied in tactile craft and breath-counting; his renunciation of the shadow’s return is earned through the origami-crane ritual. Interiority is specific—"thin as a thread of smoke"—and the final laugh carries cost. Minor slip: the abbess’s dialogue drifts toward thematic exposition.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the shadow’s loosening reweights the premise without literal reunion. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each polished facet and folded crane layers density until the final glow releases ache. Cost is legible in the “knotted-rope laugh.” Orientation is taught early via the spiral map.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The basilica’s irised panes and pendant canopy constrain the maker’s workspace and refract memory; the floating island’s tethered drift mirrors the shadow’s loosening. Sensory hierarchy favors light and vapor, guiding choice. One minor spatial blur: the nave’s exact relation to the altar of sky.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—fold grief into cranes to guide the shadow—tightens through each polishing and steaming beat. Agency is crystallized when he sets the lanterns in triangle and bows. Cost is felt in the “absent weight” loosening, not returning. No reversal, but deepening suffices under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of grief’s transmutation emerges from craft and vapor; no moralizing. The cranes’ glow reweights the orchard memory without stating loss. Final image of lanterns drifting over softening guests offers non-literal resonance. Subtext in the abbess’s smile and the shadow’s hand of mist.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise—“catches sky like a spoon catches sugar”—with perceptual signature rooted in gem-craft. Compression and elision are taught early (“pilgrim descends while ascending”) and paid off. No head-hopping; POV stays anchored in the maker’s breath and sting.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and musical—“seeding his lungs with color”—yet propulsive. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances craft or memory. Metaphors are coherent under light-and-glass motif. Minor elevated diction in “luminous torment” but fits the basilica’s register.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise of grief-folded glass cranes guiding a detached shadow is fresh; dream-recording lanterns transform familiar mourning ritual. Specificity of gem-polishing and ribbon-leaf steam anchors the fantastical. Risk in lyric compression pays off in the final reconfiguration.</comment>
