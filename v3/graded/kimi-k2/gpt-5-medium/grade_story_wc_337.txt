<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is embodied and specific; the restorer’s tactile micro-choices with the needle reveal a hierarchy of values. The caretaker’s single line of dialogue and winter-remembering grip add relational pressure. The final renunciation—grounding rather than banishing—earns its cost through prior embodied labor with the net and masks.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density of silence and prismatic refraction tightens until the hush “changed weight.” Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Earned Stasis—where the sanctuary’s hush becomes chosen stillness. Cost is legible in the emptied room and the caretaker’s palm on the floor accepting perpetual guardianship.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prism sanctuary, whalebone needle, and centuries-old net are not backdrop; they constrain every move—light refracts through cracks, knots withhold breath, needle drinks silence. Spatial choreography is exact: climbing iron stair, reaching the net, setting the locket as hearth. Final image of ladders folding back into night recharges the opening cathedral metaphor.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—ground the spirits—signaled in paragraph three. Escalation is the progressive unweaving of knots, each releasing memory that must be re-weighted with stones or braids. One decisive tightening: the worst-broken mask sealed with starlight-braid, after which the tide itself pauses. Cost is the restorer’s acceptance of perpetual tending.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of stewardship versus possession emerges through action: exhuming memories not to own but to anchor. Subtext lives in gestures—kissing salt-white hair, touching brows with needle—never in exposition. Final image of sanctuary folding ladders offers a non-literal answer: what the sea would take is kept, but only by unending vigilance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; perceptual signature filters every image through hush and refraction. Syntax modulates with pressure—short clauses during snapped line, longer breaths during knot-work. No head-hopping; caretaker’s interiority surfaces only through gesture and single murmured line. Patterned elision (“time moved strangely”) is taught early and paid off in closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and action without redundancy. Metaphors are coherent—hush as lung, starlight as braid—and never muddle causality. Minor loop risk in “hush” repetitions is offset by functional reweighting. Final paragraph achieves crystalline clarity without scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise fuses mask restoration, net-unraveling, and spirit grounding into a fresh synthesis. Risky lyric compression succeeds because every image is tethered to tactile stakes. Transformation test: swapping any element—needle for chisel, net for rope—would collapse the logic of silence-accumulation and prismatic sealing.</comment>
