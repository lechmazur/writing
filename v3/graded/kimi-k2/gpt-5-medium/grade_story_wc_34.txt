<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The balladeer's interiority is embodied in tactile choices—bolting the plate, tracing chalk, listening to valves—each micro-choice revealing a hierarchy of values: song as conduit, not performance. Contradictory impulses (fear of silence vs. duty to the ghost) act simultaneously in scene, and the final renunciation of louder song for quiet translation carries visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the courtyard breathes, the ghost settles, the singer becomes “a hinge” with the cost of perpetual vigilance. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each encoded glyph and tightened bolt layers density until the final image reweights the premise. Orientation is taught early via sensory anchors; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The misty courtyard, antenna post, and bolt-plate “harp” constrain every move; the setting’s lungs/veins metaphor directly shapes the tactical map the protagonist draws. Weather and altitude are not backdrop but pressure—steam valves, rain gutters, and storm timing alter choices in real time.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—give the city’s thirst a voice—tightens through each encoded exchange; the ghost’s escalating clarity narrows the protagonist’s options from balladeer to translator. Cost is felt: the louder songs are forever foregone, the plate now a permanent listening device.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: communication as caretaking, code as compassion. The final image of “bruised perfume” reweights every prior pattern without moralizing, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to how cities and ghosts survive.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is unmistakable—compressed, lyrical, yet precise: “notes walking softer than my feet,” “a hush shaped like an algorithm learning to stutter a lullaby.” Perceptual signature remains consistent; no POV drift or register slippage under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet limpid; each sentence advances multiple jobs. Occasional lyric excess (“tinkersong wonder”) is pattern-taught early and pays off, never clogging the closure beat. No loops, no mixed metaphors, no scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of ghost-code, balladeer, and flower-press harp feels inevitable yet wholly fresh. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; the premise transforms familiar motifs into a singular vision.</comment>
