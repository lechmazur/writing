<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied; the contradiction between emotional insulation and the houndstooth scrap is dramatized in the moment of pricing. The final micro-choice—assigning the scrap museum value—earns a credible renunciation of pure detachment with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the scrap’s revaluation reweights the entire premise of “facts as armor.” Causal linkage holds under Accumulative/Textural lens; the pattern of echo and memory tightens to a single charged image with felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Quarry office and scrap function as micro-settings that constrain appraisal tactics; the houndstooth’s singe and glue odor charge the final image. Sensory selection is POV-filtered and purposeful, never ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Dominant stake—whether to insulate or re-engage—is signaled early and tightens once when the scrap forces a pricing decision. The tightening forecloses the purely mercenary path with visible cost (museum placement over cash).</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of memory versus market value emerges organically from the appraisal act; the final reweighting of the scrap offers a resonant, non-moralizing answer. No thematic exposition intrudes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct—roadie diction fused with catalog precision; perceptual signature is consistent under pressure. Compression and elision are taught early and paid off in the final cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is selective and pattern-taught. No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances story, character, or atmosphere.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Premise—appraising one’s own past in a quarry—feels fresh and inevitable. The synthesis of roadie nostalgia with antiques expertise is specific and non-obvious.</comment>
