<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is vivid—her “cautious exuberance” is embodied in micro-choices like forgiving demurrage and pressing the ledger key into Jun’s palm. The contradiction between risk and secrecy is dramatized, not labeled. Yet the dockworker Hideo remains off-stage; his granddaughter’s summary dilutes the relational crucible, capping the score below 8.8.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the ledger open to signatures reweights the town’s social contract under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The cost—Mara’s shared custodianship and public exposure of her crusade—is legible in the final exchange of keys. One transition (library → roof) is clean; orientation is anchored early.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The colonnaded, starlit library with swaying lamps and gossiping gulls is tactile and selective; it constrains the scene’s hush and later hosts the ledger ritual. The locket moon functions as micro-setting that charges the final image. A hairline slip: “harbor music” leans symbolic rather than environmental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—uplifting silent contributors—is signaled early and tightens when Mara must publicly name Hideo. The meaningful deepening occurs when she trades secrecy for communal gratitude, paying with reputational risk. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; coincidence (misaddressed envelope) complicates but does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of cyclical compassion emerges organically through favors waived, resin repairs, and ledger signatures. The final image of alphabetized darkness offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. One soft echo: “cycles of compassion” is articulated by Jun mid-story, slightly over-guiding the reader.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise—“pages breathe calmer when trumpets are sleeping.” Perceptual signature is consistent; Jun’s tide-smile and Mara’s salt-breeze thoughts remain distinct. Compression and patterned elision (“after the symphony ends” refrain) are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; sentences layer cargo, music, and tide without redundancy. Occasional elevated diction (“demurrage,” “conceptual repricing”) fits Mara’s broker lexicon. One mixed metaphor—“sky holds its breath while brass and surf exchange compliments”—momentarily muddles physical logic.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The mistaken-envelope catalyst and ledger-of-gratitude payoff transform a familiar “unsung labor” trope into a fresh, harbor-specific ritual. Risk is taken in the lyrical accumulative structure; it coheres without gimmickry. Dockworker-violinist synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
