<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“ache that arrives when something nearby wants to metamorphose”), but the final acceptance of keeper role feels slightly under-motivated; no prior contradiction is dramatized in-scene to make the “yes” cost legible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the garden’s metamorphosis reweights the stake of bitterness, and the cost—“we let the garden metamorphose our bitterness”—is on-page. Accumulative/Textural lens holds; pattern of breathing floor and swinging bulbs taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The underground garden is not backdrop; its breathing floor and swinging bulbs physically constrain movement and charge the final descent. Micro-setting (drain staircase of vertebrae) directly enables the decisive change.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—turn bitterness into cosmic joke—tightens once when the protagonist chooses to become keeper; cost is the irreversible bodily alteration implied by “we let the garden metamorphose our bitterness.” One clear escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of bitterness transmuted into generative laughter emerges through concrete events (arrowhead sprouting names) rather than statement. Final image reweights prior motifs without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Distinct lyric texture—“soil had edited their spines,” “gravel weep backward into mountains”—remains consistent under pressure. No POV drift; compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is patterned and purposeful. Minor risk of overwriting in “drunk on auroras,” but clarity at closure is intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of janitor-cryptid mythos and vegetal body-horror; the cosmic-joke angle on bitterness feels non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking (sentient garden, arrowhead-tooth) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
