<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid & embodied (“the rope smelled of rust and rain”); contradictory impulses visible in desire to examine time yet “without breaking anything that could feel.” The renunciation—braiding past guilt into present strength—lands with palpable cost when the rope warms under consent in the mirror-chamber, meeting the 9+ test despite a stray phrase of therapy-speak earlier (“forgave the version of me”).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Inferred Accumulative/Textural lens held: progressive layering of footprints, tales, and silt culminates in an Earned Stasis closure—accepting past knots rather than escaping them. High-band escalation comes via density increase and pattern break (time-textured dust) rather than causal turns, and the final “warmth of consent” is the visible cost under the chosen lens; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Starlit terra-cotta grotto, rope as micro-setting, and the cave’s breathing walls all constrain choices (handing rope, patterning footprints). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: “chill of last storms” steers the poet’s physical contact with the floor, meeting the 9+ gate for environment charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“discover texture of time without harm”—is clear early; pressure ratchets through each revealed layer of dust tales. One decisive tightening: the mirror-chamber forces either dissolve into perfect past or braid guilt into strength; braided choice visibly costs the comfort of heroic myth. No coincidence resolution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme of ethically playful engagement with time surfaces implicitly via the rope’s recycled prison meaning, handled choices, and final vow: “hold my metaphors accountable.” The closing image of the road as letters reorganizes prior motifs into a non-literal, thematic answer without moralizing. Ambiguity and complexity linger, yet resonance is earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Lyric voice is singular (“ghafla of violet arithmetic”); perceptual signature consistent and textured. Purposeful compression taught early—mile markers as rhymes—and recompensed in final constellation reprise. No head-hop; psychic distance modulates with emotional intensity; rhythm accelerates at the mirror beat and widens at stasis.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, propulsive, and artifact-free. Sentence-level loops absent; metaphors precise (“a loom might weave a childhood”). No filler verbs or template cadences. One possible compression grant near “align my breathing” line, traded for lyrical payoff; closure image crisp.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses slipstream exobiology with lyric memoir; freshness in using an energy being as co-listener rather than oracle. Transformation test passes: swap rope or grotto and the ethical frame collapses. One clear, specific inflection—a prison rope reused as ethical tether that cannot be cut—anchors risk without gimmickry.</comment>
