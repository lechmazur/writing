<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The librarian’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“I tie…twice for luck”), but choices remain observational; no decisive micro-choice alters the outcome. The scarf’s maternal backstory tilts present stance, yet the final renunciation (“I file my card under Promise, Noted”) feels lightly earned rather than compelled by prior contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the map folds, the room resumes angles, but the librarian pockets the tide—cost is felt. Accumulative/Textural lens holds; density of images (salt snow, tide charts) reweights the stake without causal reversals. Orientation is clear by line 4; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The library breathes like filament bulbs; negative-curvature shelving constrains navigation and charges the final image. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered (“smells faintly of ozone”). Environment actively guides choice; no spatial drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“to find the place where stories live”—is signaled early. Pressure deepens through pattern accumulation (saltier air, unbuilt mornings) rather than causal reversals; cost is the unclosed search. One meaningful tightening: the librarian accepts the tide instead of arrival.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: memory’s weight, curvature as refusal of straightness. Final image of snow-into-letters reweights prior motifs without moralizing. Subtext operates in silence and salt; ambiguity lingers credibly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct lyric texture—“shoes whispering proofs,” “grammar at last”—remains consistent under pressure. POV is stable; no head-hopping. Compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density; each sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. No loops or scaffold; metaphors cohere. Rhythm modulates naturally; no overwriting in peak beats. Clean mechanics.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of hyperbolic shelving and analog memory; premise commits fully. Risky lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry. Transformation test: story would collapse if relocated. Specificity anchors universals.</comment>
