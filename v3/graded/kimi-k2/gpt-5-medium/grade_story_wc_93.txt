<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Protagonist’s vow and renunciation are embodied through tactile micro-choices (bracing the door, gathering the pouch); eel herder’s precognitive curse manifests as embodied ache, not label. Brother’s displacement and her sacrifice create credible cost. Minor: her interiority is slightly generalized in “resigned grace.”</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the spiral-door snaps shut, trading her for brother, cost paid on-page. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of stones and dust tightens into final image. Orientation anchored early; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Tidal bluff, aurora, and frictionless ground constrain every gesture; the painted rocks and star-dust pouch function as micro-setting that literally shapes the doorway. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered (“sea sang like wire drawn through sky”).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—rescue brother—signaled in third paragraph. Escalation is one deepening: each stone laid tightens the spiral until the trade becomes inevitable. Cost (her loss) is visible and felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of pattern, listening, and sacrifice emerges through concrete acts (stones, dust, eels) rather than statement. Final image of “quiet engine that turned grief into careful craft” reweights the promise without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct lyric texture sustained: “velvet gravity,” “sibilant grammar of tide.” POV remains stable; no head-hop. Compression and elision taught early (“boots forgot to bite stone”) and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>High density, zero loops; figurative language is selective and purposeful. Rhythm modulates with pressure. One mixed metaphor (“crown lowered onto water”) is minor and does not cloud closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: eel-herding + mathematical ritual + collapsed star dust + frictionless physics. Premise commits fully; no retreat to safe middle. Risky lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
