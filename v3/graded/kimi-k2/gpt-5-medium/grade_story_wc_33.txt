<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“my arm hairs rise as if saluting thunder”), but the final choice to stay and then deliver the letter feels slightly under-motivated—more thematic than personal. The contradictory impulses (duty vs. rebellion) are present but not pressed to a painful cost on the page. Still, the voice is singular and the micro-choices (thumbprint signature, sealing the lid) read as character-specific.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the protagonist walks the cobalt arcade “lighter for knowing where to go,” reconfiguring his route and purpose. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—patterned imagery and cadence tighten until the final image reweights the stake. Cost is felt in the boy’s posture change and the narrator’s “heart ungoverned.” One minor drift: the drone border is introduced late without earlier cue.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The cobalt arcade at twilight is not just backdrop; it constrains movement and supplies the final charged image. Micro-settings—jar, coal-lit doorway, checkpoint fence—are tactile and POV-filtered. Sensory hierarchy narrows under pressure (“air folds into a brittle hush”). No orientation debt; geography and time remain coherent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—deliver the storm and heal broken promises—is signaled early and tightened when Mina demands the letter for the boy. Agency is present (he stays, he delivers), but the cost is more conceptual than visceral. Escalation is textural: the storm’s scent and the mirror’s faces deepen the pressure rather than narrow options causally.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: promises break when wrapped around the wrong emptiness; healing comes from linking absences. The final image of the boy’s posture change offers a non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture (thumbprint signature, nod). No thematic echo in the closing lines.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent: “maps hold their breath,” “cobalt arcade at twilight.” Compression and elision are taught early and paid off (“broken promises are our currency”). No head-hopping; POV remains tightly bound to the courier’s perception. Dialogue is sparse but subtextual (“you foster futures, boy”).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and stakes. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is selective and purposeful. Rhythm modulates with pressure—longer cadence for twilight, clipped for drone crossings. One mixed metaphor (“coins rolling after closing”) barely grazes clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The premise—disputed-territory mailman carrying bottled weather—feels inevitable yet fresh. Tropes (border, drones, healing charm) are transformed through sensory specificity and moral complexity. The final reconfiguration (storm as catalog of absence) is unforeseeable yet earned. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes without obscuring closure.</comment>
