<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single POV stays consistent; interiority is embodied through the fisher’s “patience in my mouth” and grip cues. No relationship crucible present. Renunciation choice– to spill the map back without keeping it – is earned by the walk itself and the goddess-negotiated terms. Cost is felt: the coastline only remains whole if the fisher continues to be merely a listener. Emotions are sensory, salty, never labeled. A hairline slip: the reader never sees the goddess in conflict with personal history, only ritual negotiation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration – the spike deposits the newly mapped coast back into wave-garden brine; Charged Poise holds the fisher now permanently tasked as listener. Because->therefore holds throughout: the goddess’ dream requires constellation-footed listeners → fisher agrees → spike becomes tuning rod → constellation elders test → fisher proves capacity → map must be returned, not hoarded. Cost is visible on the last beat when possibilities spill away with the tide.</comment>

<comment>The sound-wave garden is never static; every detail is kinetic – “corridors as if in a cathedral of thunder.” Body and tool act as micro-setting: iron spike inserted into dune physically ties the rail’s memory back to shore. This environmental constraint – the garden demands a specific way of listening or the coast unravels – drives the closing choice to surrender the map.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: coast disintegrating into devouring silence. The tightening is monotonic but potent; each test widens the personal price of guardianship, culminating in the demand to become permanent listener. No reversal; instead the cost steadily intensifies until giving back the map is the only live option. Luck never resolves.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the negotiation between cartography and listening: maps must be embodied and released, or silence devours the world. No moralizing; the final gesture of returning the coastline is non-literal, embodied, weighted by salt and brine. All imagery recurs in charged forms – brine, tuning, silence – and the reprise reweights the earlier lyric into obligation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The voice is lyric yet concrete: “patience in my mouth” renders interior state as tasted object. Rhythm modulates, breathless when the hedges close, expansive when the spike transliterates into coastal coves. No dialogue, but the fisher-voice has an idiosyncratic sensory signature: salt, iron, wind. Purposeful ellipses are taught by early lines and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dense compression: “the spike traced a coastline inside me, cove by cove.” Occasional micro-overwriting – antlers breaking into petals – but within lyric pattern-taught limits; clarity never collapses. No loops or synonym churn. Final image crystallizes with clean, weighted verbs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh fusion: fishing with silence instead of nets, using abandoned rail as tuning fork, mapping internal coastline within the ribs of the sea. All novelty binds to emotional core – the necessity of relinquishing ownership to hold the world together. No familiar trope survives uncorroded.</comment>
