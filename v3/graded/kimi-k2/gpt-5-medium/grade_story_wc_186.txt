<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“felt the pavilion remember her laughter”), but the custodian’s contradictory impulses are more summarized than dramatized in scene; the final renunciation of isolation is earned yet lightly costed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the beam’s soft exhale rekindles community. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each shard alignment and star-track echo layers density until the final image reweights belonging. Minor drift: the prism’s initial shatter is off-stage.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The pavilion’s glass ribs and salt-lake horizon constrain every adjustment of mirrors and angles; the shard of hush literally shapes how light travels, charging the final beam. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—proving coincidences carry meaning—tightens when the star map and etched paths converge; the tightening forces the irreversible act of inserting the shard. Cost is visible: the custodian forfeits solitary certainty for communal risk.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of “coincidence as stitch” emerges through the interleaving of ancestral star paths and present dreams; the final image of dunes “shaking with feet” offers non-literal resonance without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with rhythmic control (“moths, and stories snipped by winds that sounded like scissors”). Distinct perceptual signature—sound compressed into mineral—remains consistent; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High information density; metaphors are fresh and coherent (“dew suspended on spider silk”). One paraphrase loop (“by night… by day”) is minor and does not dull momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Post-apocalyptic beacon tropes are transformed through the shard of hush and retrocognitive diary-glass; the synthesis feels inevitable and heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
