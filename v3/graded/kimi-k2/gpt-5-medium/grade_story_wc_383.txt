<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The “charmed skeptic” stance is embodied through embodied micro-choices—pressing shell to stone, naming self, accepting winter—yet interiority occasionally drifts into lyrical abstraction (“library of frost”) that blurs contradictory impulses. The final renunciation carries visible cost: the child disperses and the garden’s weather is silenced, sealing the protagonist as archive. Flawed doubt remains consistent, but a few stock phrases (“ghostly resolve,” “tragic radiance”) dilute specificity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the memory is archived, the garden’s echo ceases, and the protagonist becomes “a quiet archive.” Causality is Accumulative/Textural—each sensory layer tightens until the final cadence shift reweights the stake. Cost is legible in the “precise cold” now housed in the chest. Orientation is taught early; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The velvet garden, fountain, and bruised sky are filtered through the POV’s selective attention; the shell and winter memory function as micro-settings that constrain the final transfer. Sensory economy is high—moths, gull cries, salt—yet a few atmospheric clichés (“bruise of cobalt”) slightly blunt specificity. The garden’s silence after the archive charges the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—translate isolation into independence—is signaled early and tightened through the resonance transfer; the child’s offer forces a trade-off with visible cost (winter internalized). Escalation is Accumulative: each sensory beat deepens the pressure until the garden’s echo is foreclosed. No coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the act of archiving: memory as burden and lantern. Subtext lives in gesture—hand to stone, syllables moving one way—avoiding overt statement. The final image of “weather that can finally pass through me cleanly” offers non-literal resonance without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet disciplined; perceptual signature is consistent—“velvet garden,” “rusted gull cries”—and rhythm modulates with pressure. No head-hopping; POV modesty holds. Occasional elevated diction (“tragically radiant”) is voice-motivated and taught early.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; figurative language is patterned and paid off (“winter in my chest” returns as “library of frost”). No loops or scaffold. One mixed metaphor—“bruise of cobalt being peeled back”—barely grazes clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses lyric memoir with speculative resonance mechanics; the quarantined memory and resonance transfer feel inevitable yet fresh. Specificity of the shell-child negotiation transforms familiar grief-archive tropes. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring closure.</comment>
