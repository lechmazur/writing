<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied; the survivor’s IOU scars and tactile handling of the bolt anchor motive. The final choice—signing the console and opening the feed—earns its cost through prior causality and visible ledger dissolution. One slip: the “virtuously mischievous” label is asserted rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the ledger of breath replaces the ruined ledger, cost legible in the frost-laced diamonds. Causal chain—bolt → chamber turn → feed open—holds under the Accumulative/Textural lens. No orientation drift; anchors set by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The mushroom rows and pulsing caps constrain every move; the bolt-as-micro-setting literally steers the chamber. Sensory hierarchy (glow, damp, salt) is POV-filtered and purposeful. One minor slip: “shadowseam wonder” risks label over image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—keep the quantum promise or lose crop and self—is signaled early and tightened once: the backward-text chorus forces the 90° turn and console signature. Cost crystallizes in the edible diamonds and dissolved debt. Agency drives escalation under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of redeemed trust emerges from the bolt’s journey and ledger transformation; no moralizing statement intrudes. Final image (ledger of breath) offers non-literal, resonant answer to “what survives a scam.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is textured, rhythmic, and consistent: “blue caps breathe like tidepools,” “patient lanterns counting my fright.” Compression and elision are taught early and paid off. No POV leakage or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each line advances atmosphere or choice. One mixed metaphor (“harp string of pure intention”) slightly blurs, but clarity at closure remains intact. No loops or scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fusion of bioluminescent farm, quantum promise, and pyramid-scheme redemption feels inevitable and fresh. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without gimmickry. No derivative echoes.</comment>
