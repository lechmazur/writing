<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied; the chalk artist’s micro-choices (tilting the pebble, placing the tile) reveal values under pressure. The final renunciation—carrying “nothing” yet bearing the hush—earns its cost through prior listening acts. Minor drift into lyrical self-exegesis keeps it from 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each added grain of sand and hush thickens the pattern until the final image reweights meaning. Closure is a Charged Poise—the grotto exhales, the hush rides home—felt cost legible in “carrying nothing.” Orientation anchored by word 60; no causality break.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Limestone, mist, chalk, and tile are tactile and selective; the grotto’s ribs “breathe” to mirror the emergent hush. Environment constrains acoustics and thus the listening tactic, charging the final image. One brief spatial fuzz when the child appears—no clear ingress—caps it below 9.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: discover meaning without smoothing the mess. Pressure tightens as silence accumulates; the artist’s interjection forces a confession that reshapes the circle. Cost is the surrender of tidy answers, paid on the page when patterns are deliberately smudged.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: meaning resides in sustained attention to mess. Subtext lives in gesture—the tile as “grotto’s tooth” the child hears—never sermonized. Final image reweights earlier motifs without moralizing, achieving resonant ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with a perceptual signature attuned to silence and texture. Rhythm modulates from mist-licked openings to compressed final cadence. No POV drift; diction stays within the artist’s plausible lexicon. Compression and elision are taught early and paid off.</comment>

<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each image does double duty. Occasional stacked metaphors (“echoing bowl glazed with breath and rumor”) flirt with excess but serve the accumulative design. No loops or scaffolds; final lines are clean and crystalline.</comment>

<comment>Fresh synthesis: chalk art + acoustic archaeology + unlearning ritual. Familiar motifs (grief, ritual, echo) are transformed through the tile flake and emergent hush. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry; closure feels inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
