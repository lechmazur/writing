<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is embodied and particular; the operator’s quiet craft and the mathematician’s turbulence are shown through gesture and silence. The final micro-choice—slowing the gondola—earns its cost in the shared hush. Minor slip: “I think of the singer” is summary rather than dramatized memory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each beat layers silence until the final Charged Poise reweights the premise. Orientation is swift; the single transition from city to sky is legible. Closure lands with felt cost as the gondola slows and the city’s rustle threads to her breathing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Setting is selective and purposeful: the prism terrace, velvet-lined pylons, and storm glass constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory hierarchy reflects the operator’s professional priorities. One minor drift: “logic dreaming of color” edges toward abstraction.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether silence can hold the mathematician without hands—tightens through the hush after each whistle. Escalation is textural: each zone adds a new layer of engineered quiet. Cost is felt when the operator slows the car, trading schedule for comfort.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: comfort as a practice of better absences. The final image of the cradle-cable and lullaby-night reweights prior grief without moralizing. Subtext in the shared window of silence is precise and earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent; the operator’s perceptual signature filters every detail. Syntax modulates with emotional intensity—long sentences for drift, fragments for hush. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. One near-purple line (“vaulting hush”) is forgiven for voice consistency.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise of engineered silence as comfort is fresh and fully committed to. The synthesis of gondola, storm glass, and grief equation feels inevitable. Risk in lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
