<question>1</question>

<comment>The archivist’s hunger for "impossible rooms" and the decision to endure iron crown pain root in visible motive; only slight drift into abstract interiority when the "blaze remains latent" prevents 9+.</comment>

<question>2</question>
<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/Textrual lens holds: every beat deepens the hush until the iron crown refracts vision and maps choices onto ribcage safes; Charged Poise at “let the city discover how to listen” crystallizes stake with felt civic scale.</comment>

<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The inverted-gravity grotto actively shapes tactics: crown selection hinges on spatial distortion, final image folds outward like “paper over ember,” environment directly dictating closure texture.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Singular stake—retrieve forgotten combinations—steadily tightens: crown choice locks the archivist’s body to risk, safe sequence compresses time into heartbeats; loss of open paths is visible in the iron sear and final city pause.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Memory’s architecture emerges obliquely through lock syntax and safe whispers; final “latent blaze” motif reweights silence without moral sermon, earning subtextual resonance through citywide anticipation.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Lyrid dream cadence taught early with “prism-minded” diction persists; purposeful elision like “sideways opens, smug with its hoard” carries internal state through peak crown moment; no head-hop or voice blur.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Lines braid density (“breathless safes,” “bruise smiling”) without artifact; every figurative turn pays off by charging the closure; rhythm flexes naturally with spatial inversion.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Non-linear archive raid reframes “keys and locks” trope into sensory, bodily praxis; iron crown refracting sight and memory map breaks fresh conceptual ground while honoring core mythos.</comment>
