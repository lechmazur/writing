<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied (“boots remembering former thresholds”), yet the surveyor’s choices—placing numbered notes, marking the waterline—are deliberate micro-choices that reveal a hierarchy of values. The final renunciation (“not to repair the past but to map its living gaps”) crystallizes a cost: acceptance of irretrievable loss. Minor slip: the paradox “stoically sensitive” is asserted more than dramatized in action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the surveyor’s exit after leaving the final slip reweights the entire ritual as an act of loving witness rather than restoration. Causality is accumulative/textural—each note layers absence until the pattern becomes legible. The hinge-moan crack where the last slip is placed provides a precise, felt cost. No orientation or lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The submerged pavilion is not backdrop but pressure: water depth dictates entry timing, silt slows movement, and the glass cabinet’s location forces delicate extraction. Micro-setting (inkwell, rust-sealed latch) constrains tactics. Final image of “the city breathe through its missing teeth” recharges the setting as living absence. One hairline slip: “coins” of daylight is briefly ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—mapping absence without restoring it—tightens through each inserted note; the act forecloses the fantasy of recovery. Escalation is textural: each slip increases the weight of what cannot be recovered. Cost is visible in the final ledger that “even silence has.” No reversal, but deepening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete ritual: absence is not emptiness but a pattern to be loved. Subtext lives in gesture—the inkwell’s “small lighthouse shutting its eye” signals both vigil and surrender. Final slip’s address refuses moralizing, offering only presence. The hush between inkwell clicks becomes the thematic heartbeat.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is architecturally precise yet lyrically porous: “lace of arches veiled by green water” marries surveyor diction to elegy. Rhythm modulates with task—short clauses for physical acts, longer coils for reflection. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent. Compression (“river loosens its grip”) teaches the reader to trust elision.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: each sentence layers sensory, historical, and emotional data without redundancy. Metaphors are controlled—no mixed vehicles. One minor loop: “hush that burns, a hushed blaze” edges toward repetition but serves the motif of restrained flame. Line-level artifacts do not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Premise—underwater archeology of memory via numbered notes—is fresh, synthesized from familiar elegiac tropes through the surveyor’s exacting method. Risk in lyric density pays off: the final image of the drawbridge as “a huge eyelid” feels inevitable yet unforeseen. No derivative echoes. Specificity of the program’s water-bitten names anchors universality.</comment>
