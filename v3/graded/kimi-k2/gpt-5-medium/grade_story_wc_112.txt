<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Jae’s interior contradiction—scientific rigor vs. longing for temporal grace—drives every micro-choice; the moment he inverts the fields to “refract homeward” crystallizes his cost (he sees his own delayed self). The flaw of temporal obsession is embodied, not labeled, and the final touch of the lever is a quiet renunciation that forecloses further proof. Secondary characters remain off-stage, so relationship crucible is N/A; single-POV interiority is vivid and specific.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the mantas’ return reweights the premise, and Jae’s whispered “Stay” becomes Charged Poise with felt cost—his own image slipping sideways. Causal lattice holds: each beat (probe → lever → inversion) is a because/therefore linkage under the Accumulative/Textural lens. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 4. Cost is legible in the final vault-song of “delayed selves.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Frost-smoking arrays, ozone vault, and the gantry’s wish-curve are not backdrop but tools that constrain tactics; the vault’s “delayed reflections” directly charge the closure image. Sensory hierarchy obeys Jae’s mechanic gaze—cold bolts, lever smear—while weather and magnetics steer every move. Micro-setting (lever, coils) functions as setting and stakes-shaper. No slips.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—prove sideways time to rescue mantas—tightens once: the corridor must be refracted homeward, costing Jae a glimpse of his own temporal echo. Escalation is Accumulative: density of holographic pulses and offset data sheets reweights possibility until the exit ramp is the only live option. Cost is visible in the doubled shadows crossing him “twice for every once.”</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of temporal empathy emerges from concrete action: the mantas’ “long light” and Jae’s self-witnessing invert human-centric time without a single overt statement. Final image—vault singing with “delayed selves”—offers a non-literal, conceptually costly answer. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in the affectionate forgiveness he feels toward his own displaced smile.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is a precise, frost-bitten lyricism—“breath pulled sideways through ice”—that never drifts into purple. Perceptual signature is mechanic-poetic: every noun is a tool or a weather event. Syntax modulates with pressure, compressing under surge-tide tension. No dialogue, so voice purity remains intact; free-indirect texture is consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet aerodynamic; each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and conceptual work without scaffold. Metaphors are coherent—“city mid-yawn,” “winter flags”—and never muddle causality. Zero loops or filler; even the single passive (“was written”) is voice-motivated. Final vault-song line lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: migratory mantas + sideways time + harp-shaped station feels inevitable yet wholly new. Risky lyric compression pays off; no stock tropes survive intact. The temporal rescue reframes ecological loss as mutual temporal displacement—an insight not borrowed from any template. Closure integrity proves the risk earned.</comment>
