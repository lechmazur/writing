<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied; the forger’s contradictory impulses—precision vs mercy—surface in the thorn-nib cut and the blank margin. The final renunciation (leaving the verdict unwritten) is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost. Reflection stays within BRR limits and tilts present choices. Minor slip: “wisely enduring” is asserted more than dramatized in the mentor.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the scroll settles into patience, the key returns, and the narrator exits unlinked from power. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density and cadence shift reweight the stake. Orientation is clear by line 3; no causality breaks. Cost is legible in the blank margin and the thorn’s ruby.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Marble sanctuary, aurora, and dripping stalactites are vivid yet selective; the rose thorn and bone-pale key function as micro-settings that constrain choice. Environment charges the final image when the thorn is planted and the nave exhales. Spatial choreography is coherent; no white-room syndrome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to finish or forgive the unfinished—is signaled early and tightens once when the key is lowered into “silence waiting.” Escalation is driven by the protagonist’s agency under the Accumulative lens; the cost is the blank margin and the relinquished verdict. No coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of mercy versus law emerges organically from the forger’s calibrated treason and the mentor’s abandoned scrolls. Subtext operates in the thorn’s memory and the key’s hum. Final image—the margin left blank—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Complexity is embraced; no tidy binary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet controlled; perceptual signature is distinct in “calligraphy forger who writes truths inside lies.” Syntax and rhythm modulate with emotional pressure. No head-hopping; POV remains stable. Compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. Figurative language is patterned and purposeful—no mixed metaphors. Minor scaffold in “quiet of pearl twilight” but does not dull closure. Read-aloud rhythm is varied and precise.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise of a mercy-calibrated forger in an aurora-lit sanctuary feels fresh and inevitable. Rose-thorn nib and bone key are specific, non-generic inventions. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Transformation test passes—story would collapse if elements were swapped.</comment>
