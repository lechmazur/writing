<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The scavenger’s contradictory impulses (to salvage, to ransom, to rebuild) are dramatized in on-page choices: the penny tower dissolution triggers later stance reweighting and Earned Stasis. Micro-choice when he sets the camera wheel spinning to seal the truce shows embodied cost. Ghost’s four demanded verbs crystallize the stakes and compel the final agreement in-scene. Regret hoarded and spent against memory-fouled lagoon anchors everything in tangible price.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Drive lens holds as Accumulative/Textural: every repeated knotting of overheard stories thickens the rope bridge, the churning water, and the camera clicks until final lagoon acceptance crystallizes under a Charged Poise. Closure arrives when camera wheel stops on an unexposed yet agreed frame; the stillness itself is Decisive Change. No lapses in orientation beyond first breath-holding instant; payoff justifies early ambiguity. Slight cap because closure is quiet rather than overt, but cost reads.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Kinetic lagoon above clouds is not just spectacle—its turbine sighs literally become the metronome by which “minutes” are measured in tea-time beats. Camera wheel’s click against submerged rails gives the lagoon a sonic memory bank, so environment constrains final tactics. Micro-object (hinges, bolts, pennies) reappear as vertebrae for repair, charging final image. Slight dip for abstract phrasing (“clouds thin”); clarity remains.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stake is negotiate truce with own ghost or be trapped in regret. Tightening arrives when ghost insists on verbs; each verb shrinks negotiable options until only authentic rebuilding or walking away remain. Camera wheel click halts on unexposed but agreed frame: choice is made, path closed, no reset offered. Cost is explicit—the eroded ambitions now pressed into garden soil—and measured by turbine sighs.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Theme of salvage-over-replacement and regret-as-compost emerges through image (pennies greened, bolts re-used) rather than statement. Final sentence “breath becomes a craft” reweights silence as an active trade without sermonizing. Every motif (camera wheel, lagoon, carousel) refracts through memory and repair, achieving elegant Conceptual Repricing. Avoids tidy moral and sustains layered reading.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>Interior voice is idiosyncratic yet readable: “pockets jangling with hinges and promises” and “turbine sighs teach minutes.” Patterned compression is taught early—wind-ladder, story-rope, lagoon-memory cycle—and pays off in finale without loss of clarity. Purposeful line fragmentation and enjambed metaphors (“scalpel closing a wound”) stay within POV diction. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>No paraphrase loops or redundant stems; information density is exceptional (“time smears, ambition eroded into sludge; eroded ambitions…muffled clinks”). Every image performs double work (sound, physicality, metaphor). Occasional abstractions (“fractured stillness stitched with ripples”) stay coherent. One microscopic lapse in “like careful hands,” but closure rhythm is intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</query><comment>Premise—cloud-top lagoon and turbine-metronome memory—is non-obvious yet fully realized. Risky lyric accumulation and quiet closure pay off; no echo of familiar templates. Penny skyline collapse into corrosion, regret-as-currency, and wind-ladders as literal climbable tools combine into fresh synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
