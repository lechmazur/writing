<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The stationer’s interiority is vivid and embodied—“I learned to believe only when the lamp drew breath for me”—but the absence of a second character limits relational crucible; the final renunciation of paper for silence is earned yet the cost feels slightly abstract rather than visceral.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the last line “patience answers patience” crystallizes the stance while the hum withdraws, reconfiguring the town’s silence from absence to suspended breath; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The bonsai labyrinth, glass shard, and fluorescent lamp constrain every choice; the frozen basin’s “tiny squares, like windows in stalled time” directly charges the final image, making setting indispensable to closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—crafting workable grammar for waiting—tightens when the basin freezes and the lamp’s hum weakens; the cost is the stationer’s acceptance that his pages will become “only paper,” a visible forfeiture that narrows options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: invented histories as “grammar for waiting” reweights silence from loss to possibility; the final image of leaves “quiet and shining” offers non-literal resonance without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct—“syllables clicking like beads”—with rhythmic control under pressure; purposeful elision (“I write not what happened…”) is taught early and paid off at closure; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive—“light loosens into ribbons”—with zero loops; one mixed metaphor (“dawn collects…like diluted ink”) is minor and does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of bonsai archive, gilded stationery, and invented histories feels inevitable; the risk of lyric stillness heightens stakes without gimmickry, culminating in a fresh angle on post-evacuation grief.</comment>
