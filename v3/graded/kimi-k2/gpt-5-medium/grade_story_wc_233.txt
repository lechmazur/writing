<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Queen’s hunger to unravel her dreams is embodied in every micro-choice; the stone-self touch crystallizes her refusal to remain a ghost of unasked questions. Interiority is specific, contradictory, and embodied. The final renunciation carries visible cost: she wakes and the wanderer already leaves, power foregone.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the queen unstitches from her stone double, accepting the cost of leaving the throne. Causal linkage holds—dreams drive climb, climb reveals choice, choice forecloses return. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; density and cadence shift reweight the stake at the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Environment, body, and objects (salt dish, flask, starlit pool) constrain choices and charge the final image. The cobalt grotto’s slit sky reconfigures meaning at closure. Spatial choreography is coherent; sensory detail is selective and urgent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—unravel the dreams or remain haunted—is signaled early and tightened once: the stone-self demands a choice. Escalation is driven by queen’s agency under Accumulative lens; cost is the throne and the wanderer’s departure. One meaningful deepening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of sovereignty versus self-knowledge emerges through concrete particulars—salt crown, bleeding starlight, moth at cradle—never stated. Final image of the calm eye reweights the premise without moralizing. Resonant ambiguity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; perceptual signature filters every image through the queen’s sleepless urgency. Syntax modulates with ascent and revelation. No head-hopping; POV remains locked and coherent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and propulsive; figurative language is patterned and paid off. No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances. Occasional elevated diction is voice-motivated and legible.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Familiar quest arc is transformed through specific, irreplaceable images—salt crown, moth, starlit pool—rooted in character need. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring closure. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
