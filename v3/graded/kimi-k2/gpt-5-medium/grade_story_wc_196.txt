<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The archivist’s contradictory impulses—methodical caretaking vs. aching refusal to let histories die—are embodied in tactile micro-choices (cataloging dust, photographing the shelf). The final act of writing the addendum and sealing the button is earned by the breadcrumb trail and carries visible cost: the reopened ache of an “unknown” now partially known.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each dust pattern and file detail layers density until the final envelope creates a Charged Poise that reweights the entire archive. Closure lands on-page with felt cost—time, emotional labor, and the irrevocable act of revising a closed case.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The file room’s fluorescent hush, stippled dust, and bowed cardboard boxes are not backdrop but instruments: the dust constrains how the archivist reads kindness, the shelf’s geometry dictates the discovery sequence, and the final photograph of Shelf E charges the closing image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—rescuing kindness from bureaucratic erasure—tightens when the button’s breadcrumb forces a choice: leave the file “unknown” or risk reopening emotional wounds. The escalation is one deepening, not multiple reversals, and the cost is the archivist’s composure and the reopened case.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges quietly: institutional erasure vs. micro-acts of witness. The final envelope and photograph reconfigure the archive’s purpose without moralizing; the reader feels the conceptual cost of every “closed” file now potentially reopened.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is precise, melancholic, and tactile—“talc-gray air,” “blue-black thread”—with rhythmic control that mirrors the slow accretion of dust. No head-hopping; every perception is filtered through the archivist’s trained yet aching gaze.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: each sentence layers information (dust grammar, file contents, emotional valence) without redundancy. Metaphors are spare and functional—“corridor, examined, measurable”—and the final cadence slows to an earned hush.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The premise—reading kindness through dust patterns in a foster-care archive—is fresh and specific. The button’s breadcrumb trail transforms bureaucratic detritus into an act of love; the synthesis feels inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
