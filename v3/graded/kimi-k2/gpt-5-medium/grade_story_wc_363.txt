<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kio’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her barefoot heel tapping rhythm, the loom’s answer, the thinning of self in each fiber—yet the brother remains off-page, so relationship crucible is absent. Motivation (send a wordless message) is clear and escalates to sacrifice, but the final smile feels slightly under-costed; the “debt paid in quiet” is more asserted than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the fabric sails off, the loom empties, and Kio accepts the cost of self-thinning. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each added memory layer reweights the weave until the final cadence shift. One minor ellipsis: how the fabric crosses the dead river is elided, but the lyrical contract teaches this leap early, so causality holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The orchard-bamboo micro-setting breathes through Kio’s hands: bamboo shafts notch puzzle edges, wind sounds like “cloth thinking,” the amber bead clicks the shuttle. Environment constrains choice—neglected trees supply fiber, dead river blocks travel—charging the final image. Spatial anchors are immediate; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—send message across impossible distance—tightens via each woven memory; the loom’s emptying is the visible price. One meaningful deepening: the realization she must thin herself to send the fabric. No external antagonist, but internal conflict and material constraint escalate under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of wordless communion emerges from concrete particulars: apricot dust, lantern warmth, gnat in amber. Final image of the brother “knowing he had been held” reweights all prior weaving without moralizing. Subtext of sacrifice and memory’s texture lingers in the hush.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct—lyric compression, patterned elision (“the hush of time’s unraveling tapestry”) taught early and paid off. Perceptual signature is Kio’s: she tastes wind, hears cloth think, sees maps in amber. No dialogue, so no register drift; POV remains stable and confident.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers sensory and symbolic work without loops. Metaphors are coherent—“raveling silence tugging at the hems of memory”—and serve pressure. No scaffold or synonym churn; rhythm modulates with loom beats and wind pauses.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise—sending memory as woven weather via puzzle edges and amber bead—is fresh, non-obvious, and fully committed. Risky lyric structure pays off in closure. Specificity of bamboo fiber, attic-thunder smell, and fossilized gnat prevents template drift.</comment>
