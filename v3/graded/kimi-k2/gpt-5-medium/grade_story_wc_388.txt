<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The debunker’s interiority is precise and embodied—“I intuited design”—but the final refusal of the diamond feels slightly under-motivated; the love-note keeps the arc human and earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each beat (storm, calm, shredded letters, tuning) tightens options toward the Earned Stasis of leaving the orchard its own heart; cost is legible in the retained letters.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Radioactive orchard, rusted shed, and the diamond-as-resonator are vivid and constraining; the cone of calm around the shed directly shapes tactics and closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth vs superstition—escalates through each discovery; the final calibration forecloses the caretakers’ myth and carries the social cost of disillusionment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: imperfection as utility, truth as maintenance. The ending’s refusal of the diamond reweights the “curse” into a tool without sermonizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is spare, sardonic, and technically precise—“mechanic of causes”—with rhythmic control under pressure; no POV drift or register slippage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, propulsive, and metaphor-rich without clutter; no loops, mixed metaphors, or scaffold. Each sentence advances knowledge or atmosphere.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Post-apocalyptic orchard tended by a synthetic diamond resonator feels fresh; the transformation of “curse” into engineered calm is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
