<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The editor’s dry wit and subtle confidence are embodied in micro-choices—fogging the glass, turning the valve—each carrying visible cost. Interior contradiction surfaces in the fear of taming the wild versus trust in listening. The final stance crystallizes as clerk and herald, a renunciation of map-making certainty that feels earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the rivers’ “long handshake” reweights the premise, cost felt in the editor’s relinquishing of control. Causal linkage holds—each condensation pattern, valve turn, and falcon report tightens options toward singular convergence. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern density and cadence shift drive the ending.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Outpost, lake, and frost constrain every move; the stove’s ticking and the girders’ hum charge the final image. Micro-setting (field glass, valves) functions as extension of body and choice. Sensory detail is selective, urgent, filtered through the editor’s cartographic eye.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding the rivers’ true source—tightens through each condensation oracle and valve turn. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under Accumulative lens; cost is the surrender of authoritative mapping. One deepening suffices and is felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of listening versus naming emerges from concrete acts: fog sketches, valve prayers, ledger minutes. Final image of water learning to part again offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. Complexity lingers in the tension between record and wild.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is distinct—dry, precise, quietly awestruck. Syntax mirrors the editor’s meticulous yet lyrical mind; perceptual signature is consistent. No head-hop; compression and elision taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet clear; every sentence advances image or choice. Metaphors are fresh and coherent—“girders hummed like teeth pressed tight.” No loops or scaffold; rhythm modulates with pressure. Final paragraph crystallizes without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise of mapping by breath-pattern rather than survey is fresh and fully committed. Falcon as clerk, phrasebook as oracle, valves as hearts—all transform familiar tropes. Synthesis feels inevitable; risk in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
