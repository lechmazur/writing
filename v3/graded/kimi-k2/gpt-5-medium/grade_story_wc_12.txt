<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is embodied and contradictory; the “longitude no map would claim” eyes and her micro-choice to stand and reclaim her name carry visible cost. Father Ilario’s motives—illumination not spectacle—drive every tactic. The husband’s single gesture of palm-on-shoulder is status pressure that alters the final beat. Flaws (grief’s contract) complicate choices and are confronted with earned renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Mara’s exhaled breath multiplied by the loop and handed back crystallizes the before/after shift. The causal chain—loop → silence → rhetorical inquiry → palette mirror → release—tightens options until the possession loses purchase. Cost is legible in the palette left “to keep watch like a sentry,” a persistent constraint. Lens is Causal throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Chapel-as-dimensional-anchor is introduced by line 2 and constrains the final steadying of the street. Micro-setting (palette, loop pedal) functions as setting-objects that alter tactics. Sensory selection (“muffled clarity,” “ultramarine no ocean could afford”) is vivid and POV-filtered. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly as Father Ilario moves from altar to pew to palette.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—prevent neighborhood tilt via Mara’s possession—signaled in paragraph 3. Escalation is causal: each rhetorical device narrows the voice’s options until the final exhalation forecloses the deal. Visible cost: the palette becomes a “sentry,” a lasting burden. One meaningful tightening suffices and is delivered.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of contracts versus free choice emerges from the concrete loan-of-warmth parable and the palette’s listening lake. Subtext operates in silence and ultramarine reflection. Final image reweights prior material without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers—nobody and everyone forgiven—yet the thematic question is answered through action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Distinct lyric texture sustained: “longitude no map would claim,” “absence recorded like frost.” POV modesty holds; no head-hopping. Compression and patterned elision (“the loop swallowed the movement until only meaning remained”) are taught early and paid off. Dialogue is minimal but subtextual when Mara’s husband repeats “she just needs sleep.”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High information density with zero loops or scaffold. Rhythm modulates with pressure: short declaratives under stress, longer braided sentences during inquiry. Metaphors are precise and non-contradictory. No overwriting in peak beats; ultramarine “listened, it became a lake with no exit” is exact and charged.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise—loop-pedal exorcism via rhetorical silence—is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Tropes (possession, priest) are transformed through craft tools and color-as-listener. Risk-taking (dimensional anchor, palette exorcism) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specificity anchors universals; story would collapse if elements swapped.</comment>
