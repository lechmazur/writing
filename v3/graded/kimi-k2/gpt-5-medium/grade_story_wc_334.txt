<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied; the narrator’s guilt over loving work more than the rope-holding woman is a sharp, earned flaw that drives the climactic confession. Micro-choices—chalking cracks, angling mirrors, biting the apple—reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. The final “almost honestly new” registers credible, partial repair rather than tidy redemption. Missing 9.0 only because the grandmother remains off-stage; relationship pressure is second-hand.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the ledger entry and apple-bite return memory fragments with felt cost—the narrator accepts partial recovery and late fees. Causal chain holds: confession → ring brightens → cadence returns → slate corrected. Orientation is swift; “noon slack arrived, silver and exact” anchors time and intent. One hairline slip: the hatch appears late, but its contents retroactively justify the orchard’s archive logic.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The sunken greenhouse, shipwreck ribs, and kelp-furred panes are not backdrop; they constrain movement and supply the fairy-ring map. Mirrors, slate, and apple function as micro-settings that alter tactics. Final image of houses huddling closer after the tide turns re-weights the whole island as complicit archive. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered—salt, graphite, rust blush—never touristic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover stolen memories—is signaled in paragraph four and tightened by the orchard’s tithe rule. Escalation is one deepening: confession narrows options from search to surrender of pride. Cost is visible—loss of full recovery and acknowledgment of relational betrayal. Agency drives every beat; coincidence complicates (gull smudge) but does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of memory as communal, gendered labor emerges through concrete particulars: “women make its ledger.” Subtext operates in the silence after the apple bite and the warmth in the glove. Final reconfiguration—writing her name a third time—reweights nostalgia as responsibility, not escape. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in “almost honestly new.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise: “iron ribs furred with kelp,” “silt language.” Perceptual signature is folklorist-collector: chalk, mirrors, slate, pattern hunger. Compression taught early—“stories hide in fractures”—and paid off in closure. No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates with pressure, tightening during the confession.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; every sentence advances image or stakes. Metaphors are controlled—“small moons wearing a rust blush”—and never clog action. Rhythm accelerates during ring-pulse beats, breathes during reflection. One minor loop: “decades later” appears three times without new inflection, but it does not stall momentum or touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of maritime gothic and mycological folklore; the underwater fairy ring feels inevitable yet wholly new. Transformation test fails if relocated—the orchard-sea graft is irreplaceable. Risk in lyric accumulation pays off: the final ledger reconfigures the entire premise without gimmickry. No close echoes; voice and world cohere as singular stance.</comment>
