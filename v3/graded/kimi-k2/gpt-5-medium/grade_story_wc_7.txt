<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“tongue pricked as if tasting lightning”), but the final communal act feels slightly under-motivated; the chef’s personal cost is implied rather than dramatized on the page, capping the score just below 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the soup gathering reweights the ruined city as communal body. Causal chain (seed → sprout → soup → neighbors) holds under Accumulative/Textural lens; cost is the chef’s self-offering in the first bite.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The rusted greenhouse constrains every action—soil glittering with glass, roof gap admitting alignment light—and its memory-soaked metal charges the final image. Sensory specificity is selective and purposeful, anchoring the single scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—create beauty from ruins—tightens as each pruning cut extracts bitter memory and narrows the tree’s shape to communal need. Escalation is measured, lyrical, and agency-driven; the cost is the chef’s swallowed memories.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of gentle rebellion against erasure emerges through embodied acts (pruning, tasting, ladling) rather than statement. Final image of neighbors sipping copper-colored soup offers non-literal answer: healing is collective refusal to forget.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is chef-specific—mechanic’s dress, neighborly diction, synesthetic tasting—sustained without drift. Compression and patterned elision (“tasted like…”) are taught early and paid off in closure. No head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is disciplined, never muddled. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances atmosphere or action. Rhythm modulates with emotional beats, culminating in crystalline final paragraph.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise of memory-tasting chef growing knowledge fruit during celestial alignment feels fresh and inevitable. Tropes (ruins, rebellion, soup) are transformed through synesthetic specificity and communal closure. Risky lyric structure succeeds.</comment>
