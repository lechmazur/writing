<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mercury-glass seer embodies charged poise: her quicksilver eyes refuse certainty, and her precise ritual choices (mirror placement, feather deployment) force the protagonist into the decisive change of willingly retrieving his buried accent. Stakes escalate directly by her intervention.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page: protagonist’s first true hello reconfigures lost rooms and forgives the silenced mouth; feather → stone progression reweights the premise under an accumulative lyric lens. Because/therefore linkage remains tight across shifts.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Mountain-breathing store and mercury shelves pressure navigation: constrained aisles force the path towards the seer, books smell of flint rivers, jars crack then mend exactly at the closing courtyard. Environment constrains choices without info-dump.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake is mouth-silencing origins; escalation via seer/stonework narrows options to felt cost of re-planting accent with grandmother’s light measure. Pressure finally crystallizes in the thunder-answering hello.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from silence forgiven: “rooms are the feelings you refuse to name.” Feather enumerates syllables → seed counters, culminating in non-literal answer: home-shaped mouth, no moralising.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Distinct second-person imperative (“Think first shadow”) under lyric patience; feather texture on tongue provides micro sensory kernel that returns charged in final image; no head-hopping, voice coherent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Rhythmic compression under pressure—barbs “stung a little like seed under fingernail” quickens, then the quiet “humming like throat remembering lullaby” lands; zero loops, high density, no tone drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Labyrinth-store-life mountain, mercury feather stone, and grieving mouth form non-obvious synthesis: institutional memory pulsing into personal reckoning. The stock recasts buried-talent motif with embodied specificity; risk tightens stakes to closure.</comment>
