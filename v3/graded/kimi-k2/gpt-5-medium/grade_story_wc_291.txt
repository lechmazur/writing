<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is embodied and specific to the artist’s prosopagnosia; choices (threading the ribbon, refusing to pocket evidence) reveal values. Yet the final stance—sending the painting—lacks on-page friction or cost, so the arc feels slightly under-earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the painting reconfigures meaning and invites empathy without tidy answers. Causal linkage is lyric-accumulative; each object surfaces because the artist probes, tightening stakes until the final image crystallizes cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The quarry’s mist, ribbon, and rebar function as micro-setting that constrains movement and supplies evidence. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through the POV’s methodical bias, charging the final canvas with remembered weather.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—awakening empathy for Mara—escalates as each recovered object deepens the artist’s imaginative reconstruction. One clear tightening: the blue ribbon contradicts the file, forcing a new theory and narrowing interpretive options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of empathy through disciplined attention emerges organically from the artist’s inability to trust faces. The final painting offers a non-literal answer—fox without mask, mask without face—without moralizing, letting ambiguity resonate.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is textured, rhythmic, and consistent with the POV’s perceptual limits. Compression and elision (“grief also rises when pierced”) are taught early and paid off in the final image; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; metaphors serve rather than stall. Occasional lyrical excess (“sulfurous,” “rented costume”) slightly dilutes peak beats, but no loops or artifacts obscure causality or the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prosopagnosic cold-case artist is a fresh synthesis; the ribbon’s color contradiction and the painting’s final inversion feel inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, anchoring universals in specific objects.</comment>
