<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mara’s interior contradiction—feeling-stopping numb vs. tactile hunger—is embodied in each micro-touch (needle, drum, filament) and drives every action; the stitched needle in her pocket is a credible micro-choice with seen cost that seals the arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Holds an Accumulative/Textural lens: density grows from backward pulses to dawn-bright filament, culminating in Charged Poise where Mara leaves with “balanced weight” and mended compass; the cost is the hush itself, now portable and responsible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The cavern’s velvet silence constrains how characters communicate and shapes the “not-sound” harbor; the drumhead becomes micro-setting that physically receives the mending thread, tying closure to place.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—breaking internal frost—tightens via each reversed beat that “rubbed frost from the bones”; the grinding of numbness by active un-listening is visible and irreversible, though climax is quiet.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</question><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: cyclical return (backward to move forward) shown in seasons, drum, seasons again; final image reframes hush from absence to “a way for presence to travel,” a resonant non-moral answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>Tactile, specific interior diction—“breath between notes,” “caves inside her chest”—remains distinctly Mara’s perceptual signature; syllabic rhythm mirrors her quiet felt-listening without head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Each sentence layers sensory and conceptual freight without loop; occasional elevated lyricism (“lighthouse at fog’s edge,” “bare dawn”) is pattern-taught early and paid off, keeping clarity under peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</question><comment>Transforms familiar teacher-seeks-healing arc into deaf-led tactile metaphor, using reversed sound to reverse emotional paralysis; risk to let climax be felt hush rather than audible flourish feels inevitable and fresh.</comment>
