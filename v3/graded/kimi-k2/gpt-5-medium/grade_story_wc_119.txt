<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“salted sweet shells with hints,” “sticky with sugar and salt”), but the final renunciation—“I had not changed the town with insight, only with arrangement”—is asserted more than dramatized; the cost is felt but not fully earned on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the lighthouse’s projected sentence “You already know” reweights the open-secret premise with undeniable social cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds; each beat layers pattern until the final image crystallizes meaning.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Harbor, causeway, and lighthouse are rendered with tactile specificity; the lighthouse lens itself constrains the final choice and charges the closure image. Spatial choreography is clean, and weather is integrated into mood without cliché.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to hide or broadcast the microdot truth—tightens once when the protagonist chooses projection; the cost is visible in the sticky hands and the town’s overnight re-routing. One meaningful intensification suffices under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of open secrets emerges organically from the fortune-cookie conceit; the final projection forces collective self-recognition without moralizing. Subtext operates in silences and light patterns, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct, lyric, and consistent; perceptual signature filters every detail through the fortune-writer’s idiom. Compression and patterned elision are taught early and paid off in the lighthouse sequence. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is selective and purposeful. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Rhythm modulates with pressure, and the final image lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The fortune-cookie writer orchestrating collective revelation via lighthouse projection is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; the premise feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
