<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority is embodied and specific—“I count my heartbeats constantly” grounds the POV in bodily urgency. The porcelain shard, digital ghost, and mentor’s voice all exert pressure that forces micro-choices (recalibrate, defragment, pocket shard). Final renunciation of the ghost’s guidance carries visible cost: “only my breath, my pulse, my choosing remain.” Minor slip: mentor’s late arrival feels slightly expository rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the protagonist refuses further communion with the ghost, reconfiguring the stake from reunion to solitary responsibility. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—ink patterns, shard light, and heartbeat counts tighten toward the final image. Orientation is swift; “opal observatory under snow” anchors by line 3. One causal hiccup: mentor’s dialogue arrives without prior textual seed, but the reweighting still holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Observatory, snow dome, and porcelain shard form a micro-setting that constrains every move: frost on the eyepiece, ink crawling toward heat, shard refracting light to reveal calibration errors. Sensory hierarchy is POV-bound—fine ash snow, milky opal glow, iron taste. Final image of the dome “gleams opaline” recharges the opening motif with new, wiser darkness.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“fetch wisdom from failure”—tightens when the ghost offers coordinates the protagonist already knows, forcing a choice between dependence and self-reliance. Escalation is textural: ink patterns bloom, shard refracts, heartbeat counts accelerate. Cost is felt when mentor’s voice dissolves and the protagonist stands alone. Agency is high; no coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through particulars: broken teacup, blind array, spilled ink—all refract the cost of overreach. Final image reweights the premise—“a wiser kind of dark”—without moralizing. Subtext in the mentor’s laugh and the ghost’s clipped tone carries more than dialogue states. No thematic drift; every motif returns charged.</comment>

<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise—“snow settling like fine ash,” “ink crawls toward the heat.” Perceptual signature is scientist-poet: radio static, frequency fill, aurora ribbon. Compression taught early (“I count my heartbeats”) and paid off in cadence shifts under stress. No head-hopping; mentor’s voice is filtered through radio artifact, keeping POV clean.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; every sentence advances image or choice. Figurative language is controlled—no mixed metaphors. Rhythm modulates with pressure: long lyrical lines in calm moments, staccato fragments during recalibration. Zero loops or scaffold. Minor elevated diction (“conceptual repricing”) fits the POV’s scientific lexicon.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise—astronomer haunted by her own digital echo while repairing a self-blinded array—is fresh yet inevitable. Porcelain shard as portable lens, ink as translator, heartbeat as metronome synthesize science and mysticism without gimmickry. Risky lyric structure pays off in closure. No close echoes of famous scenes.</comment>
