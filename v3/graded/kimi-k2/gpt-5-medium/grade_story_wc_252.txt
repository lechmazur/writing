<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied (“my shoulders remembering dances I had not learned”), but the final self-naming beat is slightly abstract—no contradictory impulse shown in-scene, only stated. Still, the arc from guarded to open is credibly earned through the scrimshaw’s pressure and the whale’s call.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration: the island holds because the protagonist names herself aloud, with visible cost in the crowd’s heavy silence and the ropes’ self-unknotting. Causal chain (scrimshaw → whale → naming → island stays) holds under the Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Coast, dock, sublittoral fringe, and whale-song create a tactile, salt-stung atmosphere that constrains movement and choice. The whale’s body becomes a “cathedral breathing,” charging the final image with scale and reverence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will the island stay if the protagonist names herself?—is signaled early and tightened by the whale’s rising note and the crowd’s silence. The cost (public exposure, loss of anonymity) is felt on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of non-violent self-assertion emerges through concrete particulars: the pacified pirate’s scrimshaw, the whale’s “patient violence,” the dock rebuilt with “arguments voiced like blessings.” Final image reweights the premise without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet muscular, with a dock-worker’s tactile diction (“bollard,” “cleat,” “eelgrass combed the water”). Rhythm modulates with pressure; no head-hopping or register drift. Distinct perceptual signature throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and figurative but purposeful; no loops or scaffold. Metaphors (“fog into a staircase,” “chain singing as it learns it was never a chain”) serve pressure. One mixed metaphor—“bruise remembering a fist”—is minor.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: pacified post-violence world, whale as moral compass, scrimshaw as non-violent key. The disappearing island as conditional mirror of self-naming feels inevitable yet surprising. Risky lyricism pays off.</comment>
