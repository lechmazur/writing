<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The cartographer’s vow and acute listening are dramatized through tactile micro-choices—pressing ear to lime, sketching rhythms, playing hopscotch squares—each with felt cost of self-erasure when “my name slid away.” Interiority is concrete, embodied, and contradictory; the final acceptance of legacy’s shawl is earned by prior causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the map becomes a “school for hearing,” foreclosing escape from legacy. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each echo-dense shard tightens the stake until the final image crystallizes cost. Orientation is clear by line 3; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Seaweed-braided towers, ivy-veiled passage, and hearth coals are selective, sensory, and purposeful. The film negative and ash-wet pages act as micro-settings that constrain choices and charge the final map. Spatial choreography is flawless; weather and decay evolve causally.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to shoulder legacy’s burden—tightens through each echo-drenched beat. The hopscotch-grid break narrows options and forces the choice to map future footfalls. Pressure is coherent under Accumulative lens; cost is legible in the shawl of echoes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: listening as ethical inheritance. Subtext resides in gesture—ivy “taking dictation,” lime tapping memory. Final image of the house rising on “stilts of memory” offers non-literal resonance without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise: “salt grammar of vanished tenants,” “shy pressure of stories.” Perceptual signature is consistent; no head-hopping. Syntax modulates with emotional intensity; purposeful elisions are taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers texture without redundancy. Metaphors are fresh and coherent—“lime answered in faint taps.” No loops or scaffold; high information density supports momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Premise—echo cartographer mapping walls’ dreams—feels inevitable and fresh. Tropes of post-climate ruin and haunted houses are transformed through acute listening and chalk hopscotch. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
