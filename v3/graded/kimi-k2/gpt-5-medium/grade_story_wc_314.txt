<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Iri’s interiority is concrete—her pulse-to-palm contact with the earth and the ribbon tied to the branch embody her sentimental streak. The braided motif of logic vs. intuition is dramatized through her refusal to recite formulas, a micro-choice that forecloses the path of pure reason. Cost is felt: she leaves carrying “nothing but balance,” forfeiting the crystal’s power. A hairline slip: the grandmother’s voice arrives as disembodied wisdom rather than earned memory.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the orchard’s blossoms tighten, roots remember, and Iri’s stance crystallizes into “balance.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each sensory layer (color, birds, sap) thickens until the final copper tone reweights the whole. Cost is legible: the crystal is sealed away, its cold promise renounced. Orientation is swift; kaleidoscopic waterfall and orchard anchor by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The orchard’s living equations and the waterfall’s shifting veils constrain every beat; the copper light at the end literally colors Iri’s hair and the final tone. Spatial choreography is flawless—roots, flame, reliquary positions track cleanly. Sensory hierarchy mirrors urgency: starling glyphs narrow perception at the climax. The setting is not backdrop but active collaborator.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve the orchard’s dual nature—tightens when Iri chooses not to melt the crystal. One meaningful deepening: the starlings’ frozen helix forces her to abandon her formulas. Cost is the forfeiture of alchemical certainty. Pressure escalates through accumulating textures rather than causal reversals, consistent with the lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: harmony of frost and blossom, ledger and lullaby. The final copper tone offers a non-literal answer—integration without erasure. Subtext lives in gesture: ribbon tied to branch, palm to earth. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in the “calm question” the starlings leave.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise—“sap moving, stones cooling”—with rhythmic control that accelerates under pressure. Perceptual signature is distinct: Iri reads starlings as living theorems. No head-hopping; POV remains intimate. Occasional elevated diction (“tinctured it as a vow”) is earned by alchemical vocation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; every image advances atmosphere or stakes. Metaphors are coherent—“waterfall spelling simple mercies.” One minor loop: “braided” used twice in close succession. Otherwise zero scaffold; final paragraph is crystalline.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fusion of alchemy, starling augury, and orchard memory feels inevitable yet fresh. The kaleidoscopic waterfall and copper tone transform familiar nature-magic into singular vision. Risky lyric compression pays off—closure remains legible. No derivative echoes.</comment>
