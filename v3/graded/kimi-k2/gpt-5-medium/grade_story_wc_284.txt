<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ansel’s scarred face, pillbox history, and micro-choices under pressure (kneeling to trace snow-code, weighing ring vs film) render a credible interior arc; the final ring-fit over scarred skin crystallizes earned endurance with visible cost. Minor drift: “prudently daring” is asserted more than dramatized in tactics.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: film surrendered to tide, ring accepted, exile tentatively lifted—cost legible in the seaward step and scarred finger. Causal chain holds (cyanide→morphine→ash→ring) without gaps; orientation anchored by line 3. One micro-turn suffices.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Frost-pocked grass, salt wind, and snow as recording medium are vivid and selective; the bluff’s edge literally constrains the final disposal of the microfilm. Spatial choreography clean; “silver hush” motif threads through without clutter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether Ansel can re-earn trust and a future—tightens when Len demands the pillbox decision; the price is exile continued or ended. Agency drives escalation; no coincidence resolves. Cost felt in the film’s dissolution and the ring’s acceptance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of “unused courage” emerges through tactile choices rather than statement; the ring’s worn brass and the tide’s silent swallow reweight the premise without moralizing. Final image of scarred finger inside circle offers non-literal answer to where courage waits.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is spare, weathered, and consistent with a spy’s perceptual economy; patterned elision (“silver hush,” “snow accepted the work”) is taught early and paid off. No head-hop; dialogue-free communication via boot/cane/fingertip feels lived-in.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is lean yet textured; each sentence advances image or choice. No loops, no mixed metaphors. Rhythm modulates with pressure—short clauses during pillbox click, longer breaths at sea edge. Clean mechanics.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Spy-noir tropes are refreshed through snow-code and pillbox evolution; the burned face and brass ring feel specific rather than archetypal. Risky quiet ending lands because prior pattern supports it.</comment>
