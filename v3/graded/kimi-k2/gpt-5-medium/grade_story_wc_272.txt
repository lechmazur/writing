<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Mara’s dejection and craft history are vivid, but her shift from painter to lightkeeper occurs almost entirely off-stage; the interior claim of saving her “eye” remains intellectual rather than dramatized. The thread of responsibility to the faces she once failed to paint only glints—never pressed to the skin. Earned stasis is registered, yet the cost is generalized rather than embodied in a lived flaw.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure arrives as a quiet CR: the redesigned lattice lets the flame ascend and reweights history for keeper, city strangers, and Mara herself. The plot is single-shard, lens is Accumulative/Textural, and a felt before/after is legible. Transitions between tower levels are brisk and spatially clear; only the final hand-written line feels slightly declarative rather than crystallized.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The lighthouse-library is a living constraint: rust seeping, salt scarring the walls, lens crack ticking like an anxious tongue. This micro-setting actively withholds comfort—the cold stairs, the brine-wet stones—forcing choices and pace. Specific objects (ledger diagrams, salt-damp tarot cards) are handled, not catalogued; they literally route the wick.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—whether to keep the light and its ghosts—is signaled on arrival and tightens once when the walls threaten inward collapse. Pressure escalates as Mara braids thread through gear teeth; each new loop forecloses retreat. A visible cost is paid in sweat, darkness, and the moment the flame takes—small but on-page and irrevocable.</comment>

<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through accumulation of salt, thread, lens, and memory rather than explication. The image of faces glimpsed in trembling tarot becomes the prism of communal seeing without didacticism. No overt moral is stated; the ledger addition carries charge without preaching, leaving ambiguity in the flame.</comment>

<comment>Voice is lyrical but precise: “gulls rode the wind like commas… tower anticipate collapse the way the body anticipates grief.” The syntax mirrors the spiral descent—sentences contract and elongate in tandem with breath and action. No register drift; even dense metaphor sustains clarity. Compression and elision are pattern-taught early and held through ending.</comment>

<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is textured yet propulsive; figurative language is selective and not repetitive in pressure moments. Early scaffold “pages rustle like tide-wrack” teaches reader to accept metaphor without clog. Few minor filter verbs—otherwise zero paraphrase loops. Final cadence lifts cleanly without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Core premise—threading a tarot lattice to relight an abandoned tower—feels specific and non-obvious. Fresh synthesis threads nautical navigation, tarot fate-mapping, and portrait failure through one tactile solution. Transformation is inevitable in hindsight; no generic lighthouse rescue. Small risk bonus for braided-thread method.</comment>
