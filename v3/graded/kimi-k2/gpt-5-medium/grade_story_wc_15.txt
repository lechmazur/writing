<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sera’s stubborn optimism is embodied in every micro-choice—sewing names into the tether, pressing the plate into stone—so the final “small, continual yeses” feels earned. Interiority stays concrete (“thread bites,” “air shifts”) without slipping into therapy-speak. The only gap: no contradictory impulse is dramatized mid-scene; optimism never visibly wavers, so the arc is linear rather than crucible-tense.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the harbor bell rings itself while the tethered names become a public prayer. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each sewn knot and chalk crossing layers density until the final reconfiguration. Cost is legible in the relinquished plate and the communal exposure of grief. Orientation is anchored by the second sentence; no drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The red canyon breathes rust and thyme; the tether’s hemp and metal song constrains every step. Micro-settings (mirror basins, stone altar) are navigated by touch, not catalog. The labyrinth’s sluices open only because Sera’s body and tools have physically mapped it—setting as active lever.</comment>

<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—salvage vs. ceremony—tightens when precedents break and the town’s future hinges on Sera’s act. One decisive intensification: pressing the plate into the beak-shaped socket reweights the entire endeavor from taking to tending. Cost is the surrendered artifact and the public display of private grief.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges from action: broken precedents can be re-stitched into shared ritual. The plate’s gulls migrate from forbidden page to civic prayer, reweighting ownership and memory without moralizing. Final image of the tether along the pier crystallizes the thematic shift into communal practice.</comment>

<comment>Voice is salt-rough, lyrical, and consistent—“lullaby of small persistence and shy thunder.” Syntax mirrors the weaving motion: long coils of clauses, then tight knots of verbs. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is unmistakably Sera’s.</comment>

<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every image does double duty (“nets hang like gray rain”). No loops, no mixed metaphors. Rhythm accelerates through the throat of the canyon and exhales with the sluices’ “wet exhale.”</comment>

<comment>Familiar quest scaffold is inverted: the labyrinth yields not treasure but breathing room. Sleepwalking cartography and rope-ritual feel fresh, inevitable in hindsight. Risk—banning the book, communalizing grief—pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
