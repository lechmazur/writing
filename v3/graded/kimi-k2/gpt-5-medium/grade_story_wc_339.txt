<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is precise and embodied (“Death and I were on a first-name basis”), but the protagonist’s choices remain largely observational; the final act of taking the snow globe is under-motivated relative to the stated goal of “understanding the physics of letting go.”</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the ascent re-weights the premise—letting go costs weight and breath. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds; each catalogued detail layers pressure until the final image releases the ship “like a thought relinquished.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The sunken library is not backdrop but active constraint: silted chairs block paths, swollen logbooks resist extraction, and the snow globe’s crack literalizes the theme of ruin. Micro-setting (the globe) charges the final image as “a second chance at weather.”</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“to understand the physics of letting go”—is signaled early and tightened through each artifact handled; the cost is the literal surrender of buoyancy and the emotional surrender of the keeper’s world. One clear cadence shift: the decision to ascend, forfeiting further salvage.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the cataloging act itself: preservation versus release. The final image of rising while the ship “fell away like a thought relinquished” offers a non-literal answer—letting go is not forgetting but allowing memory to precipitate elsewhere.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet disciplined, with a perceptual signature attuned to ruin and salvage (“salt had started to learn the alphabet of ruin”). Syntax modulates with pressure—long, breath-held sentences underwater, shorter pulses at ascent—without ever losing coherence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; every image performs double duty. Minor loop risk in “note every fracture / note the way water remembers” is offset by the metronomic ticking recorder that keeps rhythm. No mixed metaphors or clarity breaks at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The conceit of a cataloging diver in a drowned library is fresh; the synthesis of Earhart, Morse prayers, and snow-globe weather feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric compression pays off in the final reconfiguration without gimmickry.</comment>
