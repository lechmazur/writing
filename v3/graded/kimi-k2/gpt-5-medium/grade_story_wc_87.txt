<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The "broken navigator" interiority is sustained and embodied—his “jittery mouth” recognition in the brass compass, the compulsion to paddle edge-wise, the refusal to retreat from the boy. Flaws are active: avoidance (charts rejected), shame (friend’s death), and the micro-turn when his own brokenness becomes the very instrument he uses to fix another’s plight. The final choice to guide the stranded boat lands under Earned Stasis, the cost of lost anonymity felt in “let my heart and my actions share a shoreline.” Momentary therapy-like line “align heart and action” is the only nudge away from perfection.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens confirmed: because he ignores a prior squall (memory), therefore he refuses to ignore the now-tide’s “greedy elegance.” Closure arrives as a Decisive Change: the poles/hum become tactical tools; the astronomical compass pressed “to my sternum like a seal unbroken” reconfigures identity from self-contained penance to public, accountable guide. No artifact leaks in cause/effect; every object state (compass, red kayak, poles) remains tracked across the single scene.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The launch and salt-soaked grid are tactile, the utility poles function as numbered waypoints, the fog and eelgrass exert physical consequence on choice of curving rather than open-ocean line. Setting quietly constrains the final maneuver yet never upstages the human crisis; the “shallow cove” depth is signaled by the father engine-lifted aground.</comment>

<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—self-forgiveness through service—tightens from internal ache to external test; the tide’s slide becomes irreversible pressure. The tightening choice (take the boy in at “tide was sliding away”) narrows escape from self-penance, then delivers visible cost when the father’s glance makes shame public. No coincidence resolves; the poles, hum, and compass are all protagonist-governed aids.</comment>

<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of re-occupying imperfect navigation after moral collapse emerges from the very mechanics of finding a channel; the backlash of regret is re-priced when service—not confession—is the response to irrecoverable loss. The final shoreline image offers a Charged Poise, no moral pronounced.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Single POV sustained with perceptual signature: salt taste, rope bite, brass jitter. Compression is taught early (“worry that refused to loosen its grip”) and paid in cadence of paddling. Voice modulates from sardonic nicknames to the softened final declaration, no head-hop, no register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Strong compression—“the poles stepping north like careful giants”—every image does extra duty; no paraphrase loops. Figurative reach is precise and tied to the kayak’s line-of-travel. One minor near-loop: “tidal greed” is momentarily cliché but is immediately re-steered into lived stakes.</comment>

<grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The astronomical-compass-as-moral-weather-vane and utility-pole-as-stitched-scar network are non-obvious instrument/penance metaphors that fuse in the final beat. No stock nautical grief template; lived specificity (“red kayak,” “brass face”) reclaims an overly trodden theme.</comment>
