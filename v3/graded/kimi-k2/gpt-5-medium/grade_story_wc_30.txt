<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The librarian’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“hinge-hearted,” “clockwork shoulders click”), and the micro-choice to accept contradictions in order to help the woman reconfigures his stance with visible cost (the bells cool to frost). Yet the woman’s contradictory identities are more asserted than dramatized in scene, keeping the relationship crucible slightly abstract.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the woman leaves with a single true name and the librarian returns to “clerkship of tides,” the cost felt in the cooling bells. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density and cadence shift reweight the stake of preserving wonder. Orientation is taught early through sensory anchors; no causality break.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The tidal atrium, salt-flecked panes, and metallurgy alcove are tactile and constraining: the bells’ temperature and the tide’s siphoning of syllables directly affect the librarian’s tools and choices. Micro-setting (bamboo creel, time metal) functions as setting-objects that charge the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving wonder in routine—tightens when the librarian must decide whether to risk the bells’ integrity to stabilize the woman’s identity. The cost is legible in the bells’ cooling hush. Agency is librarian-driven; no coincidence resolves the tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: identity as migratory flux, wonder as labor. Subtext resides in the bells’ note that “captures without pinning.” Final image of rinsing the creel reweights the premise—remembering is wonder doing chores—without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent: “tides siphon syllables,” “kelp coat dries into paper.” Compression and elision are taught early and paid off. No POV leakage; perceptual signature is the librarian’s synesthetic cataloguing of lost words.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Rhythm modulates with pressure; sentences advance multiple jobs. Occasional stacked metaphors (“slackwater boat,” “chlorophyll signature”) risk density but serve the accumulative design. No loops or scaffold; clarity remains high at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise—library at low tide where days forget their names—is fresh and fully committed. The synthesis of maritime, mechanical, and archival imagery feels inevitable. Risk-taking (lyric accumulative structure) heightens stakes without obscuring closure.</comment>
