<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The glazier’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“hands know salt, gull cries”), but the decisive shift—committing to salvage the ferry boards—leans more on lyrical assertion than dramatized contradiction; the boy’s question supplies the only external pressure, so status dynamics remain thin.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the final image reweights the mundane into “we were its light first.” Accumulative lens holds; each lyrical shard layers density until the prism atrium becomes a charged poise. Cost is felt in the scars preserved and the ferry’s foreclosed future.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Pearl Bay at dawn is not backdrop but instrument: the pond’s rings literally counsel the design, the ferry ramp’s memory constrains material choice, and the salt air infiltrates every line. Micro-setting (stone, licorice, thermos) constrains the final vision.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“illuminate value in the mundane”—is signaled early and tightens through the escalating threat of erasure by development. The single deepening (salvage the ferry boards) narrows options and carries visible cultural cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: light as communal memory versus capital spectacle. The prism atrium’s final spectral glow reconfigures the town’s self-image without moralizing; ambiguity lingers in “price and freshness.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is unmistakably coastal, tactile, and rhythmically controlled (“cranes cough beyond the headland”). Patterned elision (“I listen through the patterns…”) is taught early and paid off in the closing cadence. No POV drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is disciplined, never clogging urgency. Occasional lyrical surplus (“lantern that thinks”) is earned by context. No loops or scaffold detected.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The conceit of a glazier who “mends light” refracts a familiar gentrification plot into luminous specificity. Salvaging ferry scars into benches is a fresh, inevitable synthesis; risk heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
