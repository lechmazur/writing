<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“polished calm…sheen learned from years of evasion”), but the final renunciation—lingering to chase the circle—leans more on lyric assertion than on dramatized contradiction; the cost is felt yet not fully earned by prior micro-choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each stanza-like shard layers pattern (maps, bills, ribbons) until the final image crystallizes the circular trap. Closure is a Charged Poise that reweights the premise with visible cost—“the circle is where the hunted and the hunter trade names.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The abandoned circus train is more than backdrop; its peeling lions and breathing cars constrain tactics and echo the protagonist’s own faded grandeur. The tire rut in the tiger car physically manifests the circular path, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—why paths circle back—tightens through the startup’s rise and fall; each ribbon knot and subscriber curve raises the cost of denial. One clear escalation: investors withdraw, foreclosing the exit myth.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically from the tension between mapped escape and inevitable return; the foreign bills taped above bunks silently reprice the premise. Final image—“to leave signs that try to convince tomorrow to choose us again”—offers resonant, non-moralizing closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct, compressed, and lyrically controlled; perceptual signature filters every detail through the robber’s son’s wary calm. Patterned elision (“maps nobody admits were roads”) is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive, each sentence doing multiple jobs; occasional lyric excess (“unclaimed thunderheads”) is purposeful and never muddies causality. No loops or scaffold; rhythm modulates with emotional pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The circus-train-as-startup conceit is fresh, specific, and fully committed; inherited foreign bills as “ledger of exits” transforms a familiar trope into lived metaphor. Risky structure pays off in a final reconfiguration that feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
