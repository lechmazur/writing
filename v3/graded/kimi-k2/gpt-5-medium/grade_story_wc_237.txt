<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Scholar’s earnestness and self-doubt ring true; scars thread into interior tension that pushes the memoir-scry act. Character flaws (shame, haste) compound choices and produce visible cost as ink crystallizes under panic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Single-scene rite as breath-held container works; climatic storm closes access with literal and metronomic pressure. Cause tightens when crystallizing ink narrows swath to final, visible cost on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Floating basalt platform grounded by wind, steam arcs, and ink facets; environment constrains posture and ritual timing. Storm mass overhead charges the final image and arcs meaning from heat to held breath.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—threading scars into letters—escalates under literal storm countdown. Cost manifests: breath burns, facets of fear reflect back, stance crystallizes into earned renunciation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Wound-into-word theme coheres through embodied metaphor and specific injuries; subtext lives in crystallized facets rather than statement. Final sip offers resonant reconfiguration without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Interiority rhythm varies; meditative tea teacher voice pivots to pressure-beat staccato. No head-hop; consistent sensory filter and local diction stay true to POV lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Clarity first; metaphor serves rather than obscures. Minor redrafts of over-embellishment around “steam could be a page” lines would push higher.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Lyrical memoir-rune overlay and cumulative scar-alphabet feel fresh; tea ceremony in storm heft is earned. Minor thematic echo risk knocks 0.2.</comment>
