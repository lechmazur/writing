<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is textured and embodied; the artist’s quiet obsession with night-blooming flowers is dramatized through scent, silence, and pigment. Micro-choices—climbing the scaffold, grinding pigments at dawn—reveal hierarchy of values. Final renunciation (the murals become doors) is earned by the grandmother’s last postcard, paying visible cost of inherited solitude. Still, agency is more observational than decisive until the final beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the pavilion scene crystallizes the “dawning hush” into a charged poise where past and present co-exist. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each layer of scent, glass, and postcard accrues until the amber light reweights meaning. Cost is legible in the line “my murals were doors,” foreclosing the artist’s solitary path. One scaffolded transition (studio → pavilion) is cleanly handled.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Cathedral glass, garden tobacco, and the amber pavilion are rendered with synesthetic precision; each constrains tactics (scent paths guide pigment choices, pavilion light completes the image). Micro-settings (etched vines as wind channels) function as tools that shape the final panel. Spatial choreography remains coherent; no floating rooms. Weather and season evolve causally with the mural’s progress.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—why flowers bloom at night—tightens through accumulating sensory evidence rather than external opposition. One deepening: the realization that night is “the gentlest daylight” reconfigures the artist’s task from depiction to portal-making. Cost is felt in the inherited loneliness the postcards reveal. No external antagonist; pressure is situational and internal, coherent under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: night as collaborative courtship rather than absence. Subtext operates in scent drafts and negative images; no moralizing. Grandmother’s final line reweights the premise without overt statement. Emotional aftereffect lingers as bittersweet continuity across generations.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise; perceptual signature filters every detail through painterly synesthesia (“lamps rendered as pollens”). Syntax modulates with emotional intensity—long, breath-held sentences during dusk, shorter beats at the reveal. No head-hopping; POV remains tightly anchored. Experimental compression (“a hush move under it like a cat between rails”) is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative language is selective and purposeful—no mixed metaphors. Minor scaffold in “rich and slow” could be trimmed, but it does not dull closure. Rhythm varies naturally; no template cadence. Clean grammar and punctuation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise—night-blooming as collaborative secret—feels fresh and specific. Grandmother-botanist postcards transform a familiar trope into lived inheritance. Risky lyric structure pays off in the amber pavilion reprise. Synthesis of glass, scent, and pigment is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
