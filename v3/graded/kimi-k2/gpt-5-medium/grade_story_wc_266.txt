<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority is embodied and specific (“ache points outward”), micro-choice to kneel and later to reach is credible, and the final hand-holding shows earned change with cost. Guides remain archetypal, slightly diluting individuality, but protagonist’s contradictory impulses (fear vs reach) are dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the skiff nests inside the chest, reconfiguring future choices with felt cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of star clicks, shoreline lullaby, and ridge hum tightens toward the final image. Orientation is clear by 120 words; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Veiled ridgeway and shoreline lullaby are vivid and selective; the ridge constrains the path and the lullaby threads steps, charging the final image. Sensory hierarchy is POV-biased, though “quiet linen” fog edges toward prettiness.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding unused courage—is signaled early and escalates through indirect routes and star-guided choices; the final reach forecloses retreat with visible cost. Pressure tightens once via “choose the bends that resemble old fear,” sufficient for length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of reclaimed courage emerges organically from ridge walk and star map; no moralizing. Final image reweights prior leash metaphor without literal statement. Subtext in guides’ silence and star warmth is effective.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyric, controlled voice with distinct perceptual signature (“sand clicks like a clock”). Patterned elision (oars not wet, ferry on choices) is taught early and paid off. No head-hopping; diction stays within POV lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; metaphors mostly coherent, though “moon forgot to stitch” is slightly ornamental. No loops or scaffold; rhythm modulates with scene pressure. Final paragraph crystallizes without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of mythic ferry ride and interior courage quest; transformation test passes—story would collapse without ridge, star, and skiff. Slight risk in lyric mode is justified by coherence.</comment>
