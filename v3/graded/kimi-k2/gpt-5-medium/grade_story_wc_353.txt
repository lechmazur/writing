<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The sculptor’s interiority is embodied through tactile listening and micro-choices (“thread fibers… anchor it in the grooves”), but the arc is more accumulative than causally driven; the final renunciation of “cleverness” is felt yet not sharply foreshadowed by contradictory impulses.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the grove’s shift from silence to shared pulse is legible and carries cost—the sculptor relinquishes spectacle for stewardship. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds; each beat layers texture until the final hush “no longer silent” crystallizes the change.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is micro-specific—porcelain bell, cracked sculpture, dew-lit hedgerow—each item constrains action (insulator becomes larynx, sculpture teaches cadence). Spatial anchors are immediate; the grove’s material memory actively shapes the final heartbeat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—coaxing unsung words from trees—tightens when the sculptor realizes the grove wants “a pulse, not a symphony.” The shift from performance to accompaniment narrows options and is paid for by surrendering virtuosity; cost is legible in the muted porcelain cooling.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of empathic listening emerges through action: the sculptor’s tactile attention transmutes silence into shared breath. No moralizing; the final image of rain “without sound” reweights the premise, offering quiet communion rather than conquest.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with a perceptual signature attuned to hush and fracture (“air keeps still as parchment”). Syntax modulates with pressure—short plucks, longer breaths—without head-hopping. Compression and elision are taught early and paid off in the final cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; figurative language is selective and patterned. No loops or scaffold; each image advances atmosphere or choice. Occasional elevated diction (“symphonically minded”) is justified by the sculptor’s vocation and never muddies clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</question>
<comment>The fusion of soundless music-making with arboreal empathy feels fresh; the porcelain insulator as mute larynx is a precise, non-obvious synthesis. Risk-taking in the quiet, accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
