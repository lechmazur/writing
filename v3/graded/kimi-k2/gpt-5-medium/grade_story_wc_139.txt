<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The narrator’s interior contradiction—dishonest lineage vs. honest labor—drives every micro-choice; the shoulder-squeeze and ledger-signing crystallize values under pressure. Arman’s silent agency feels slightly under-cooked, muting relationship crucible. Cost is visible in the “blue ink” that now indicts the family trade.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the narrator’s “new vowel of fairness” reweights the premise with conceptual cost. Causal chain (breach → van → ledger) is tight; the ink pot’s scarred rings echo the timeline without rupture. One minor ellipsis—how sponsors bypass security—keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prep-room specifics (citrus, ethanol, scarred glass) constrain tactics and charge the final image. Micro-setting (ink pot as lunar timeline) doubles as moral ledger. Spatial choreography is clean; camera and alarm rhythms anchor time. Slight over-reliance on scent risks mono-sensory flattening.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—fair trade vs. family con—tightens once via the breach; cost is the incriminating ledger now in official ink. Agency is active waiting, renouncing the father’s deceit. Pressure escalates under causal lens; no coincidence resolves. Stakes remain personal, scaled to length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from embodied particulars: washing the dead as ethical inversion of forgery. Final image of the ink pot’s “tides that answer to hands” reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext in silence and touch sustains ambiguity. One near-label “mathematics of a fair trade” is absorbed by context.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: clinical yet lyrical, compressed syntax under pressure (“liquefies rigid thinking”). POV stays locked; free-indirect slips are purposeful. Rhythm modulates with risk—short clauses during breach, longer cadences in reflection. Dialogue absence is a deliberate stylistic choice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High density: “calendar without numbers,” “leaf acid and patience.” Metaphors are precise; no mixed vehicles. One filter-verb cluster (“I think of my father…”) is brief and earned. Closure line is clean, no artifacts. Minor synonym echo (“ink pot…ink”) is pattern-taught.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: funeral home as site of ethical smuggling, vintage ink as moral ledger. Risk-taking in quiet procedural escape pays off. Transformation test fails—plot could transplant—but specificity of con-artist lineage and tactile ritual anchors it. No close echoes detected.</comment>
