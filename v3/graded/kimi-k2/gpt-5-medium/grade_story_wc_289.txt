<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The ghostwriter’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“keeper of secrets walking in prismatic quiet”), but the decisive act—placing the letters beneath the bowl—arrives with only light causal foreshadowing; the cost feels diffuse rather than sharply personal.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the lovers’ rejoin is crystallized by the communal reading of their letters, a visible shift in stance with felt social cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds; each paper leaf tightens the spiral toward the bowl, though the final beat could be crisper.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The lotus temple, lily pond, and rain-beaded petals are not mere backdrop; they guide movement (threads tied to willow poles) and mirror emotional states (“tiny window briefly holding the world”). The setting constrains choreography and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will the lovers rejoin?—is signaled early and escalates as each leaf adds communal pressure. The tightening is textural rather than causal, but the cost is legible when strangers read private lines aloud.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: private grief braided into public ritual, the spiral as both architecture and metaphor. The ending offers a non-literal answer—shared sentences as connective tissue—without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with a perceptual signature attuned to light, water, and hush. Compression (“stormlight as if it were a shy animal”) is taught early and paid off at closure; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and musical, but occasional stacked metaphors (“like a thin fish”) flirt with overwriting; rhythm accelerates appropriately at the climax, and no loops or artifacts obscure the final image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The premise—anonymous love-letter ghostwriter staging public art to reunite estranged lovers—feels fresh, synthesized through specific sensory choices rather than gimmickry. Risk is taken with lyric accumulation and pays off.</comment>
