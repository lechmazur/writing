<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied; the donor-heart memory is a strong micro-choice. Motivation is consistent, but the final “appointment” feels slightly abstract rather than a concrete renunciation with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final image reconfigures the narrator’s stance toward story-stewardship with felt cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds; the pattern of light, dye, and silence tightens to a single cadence shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Floating tea house, wing, and sun-beam river are tactile micro-settings that constrain choices. Spatial choreography is coherent; the wing’s tilt literally redirects narrative flow, charging the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to hold stories without theft—escalates through micro-adjustments of light and posture. Agency is present in every tilt of the wing; the cost is the discipline of restraint, visible in the slowed heartbeat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the wing’s iridescent caution and the narrator’s disciplined listening. Final image of “unspeaking mouths” offers non-literal resonance without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise; perceptual signature filters every detail through dye-master priorities. Syntax modulates with emotional pressure; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; figurative language is pattern-taught early and paid off. No loops, mixed metaphors, or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere or choice.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses organ-donor memory with story-magnetism in a fresh, non-obvious synthesis. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes without obscuring closure; transformation feels inevitable.</comment>
