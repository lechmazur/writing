<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (curiosity vs self-preservation) are embodied in micro-choices: pressing the cameo to bark, selecting the dullest fruit. The final acceptance of curatorship is earned by prior causal chain and carries visible cost—the cameo’s burn and the unfinished face left in the tree.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the curator accepts his inheritance with felt cost. Orientation is anchored early; pattern of bathroom epiphanies is taught and paid off. Final image reweights premise: “pages that keep writing us as we read them.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Astral orchard is vivid, selective, and constrains choices: fruit order matters, silver pods offer refuge, grove map is missing. Sensory hierarchy follows curator’s priorities—heartbeat in fruit, tide in tree. Setting charges final image when the unfinished face is left in the bark.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—pursue forbidden knowledge—tightens when rule “ask with your lineage” forces curator to risk identity. One meaningful deepening: choosing the dullest fruit after seeing aunt’s self-archiving. Cost is the cameo’s burn and the promise to return, foreclosing retreat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of nonlinear inheritance emerges from concrete events: fruit visions, cameo portrait, aunt’s archival escape. Final image offers resonant non-literal answer—curator becomes the “between” he sought. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in unfinished face.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: “bewildered curator,” “tiles were patient,” “pages keep writing us.” Compression and lyric elision are taught early and paid off. No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates with pressure. Rhythm tightens under stress: “cameo ticking like a tiny clock desperate to be a face.”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density: “orchard remembering futures as well as pasts.” Metaphors are precise and pattern-taught. No register drift; diction stays within curator’s lexicon. Final cadence shift—“wash his hands and think again”—earns quiet propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: astral orchard as nonlinear archive, bathroom as epiphany chamber, cameo as lineage portal. Premise commits fully; no retreat to safety. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring closure. Transformation test: story fails if any element swapped.</comment>
