<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Oris’s interior contradiction—statue stillness vs. telepathic reach—drives every beat; the micro-choice to thread the ampoule crystallizes the “incisively kind” trait with visible cost (delay, doubt). Motivation to “welcome nuance” is embodied, not stated, and the final bow from the founder shows earned change. Minor slip: the scholar’s recoil is felt but not fully embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the city’s stance toward hesitation is reweighted, the scholar sits, and the cost (time, vulnerability) is legible in the “listening wound.” Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each image layers density until the final diffusion of decision. Orientation is taught early; no causality break.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Underwater garden is not backdrop but pressure system: cracked dome, eelgrass filament, coral wrist all constrain tactics and charge the final image. Sensory hierarchy is statue-specific (stone lungs, plankton storm). Micro-setting (bronze bench, lattice) doubles as memory engine. No orientation debt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how the city will regard hesitation—tightens through each beat: reveal → doubt → diffusion of decision. One meaningful deepening: the ampoule’s true nature reframes the ethical calculus. Cost is felt in the scholar’s bone-delay and the founder’s bow. No escalation loop.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from action: hesitation as civic mercy, not cowardice. Subtext in foxglove-stained glass, anemone bubbles, tethered bell. Final image (benches arranged for argument) offers non-literal answer without moralizing. Complexity lingers—no tidy binary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Distinct lyric-statue voice: “stone knees stirring anemones,” “threaded my thoughts along with it.” Patterned compression taught early and paid off. No head-hopping; telepathy stays within POV bounds. Rhythm modulates with pressure—long tide-like sentences to short coral snaps.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High density, zero loops; figurative language is purposeful (“silt rose like breath from stone lungs”). No mixed metaphors. Sentence variety mirrors tide. Minor scaffold: “cascading revelations became the current” could trim, but does not dull closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: telepathic statue + underwater civic garden + memory-poison as civic pause. Tropes transformed through embodied stakes. Risky lyric mode commits fully and lands. No derivative echo; specificity anchors universals.</comment>
