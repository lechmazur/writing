<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“warehouse with mislabeled aisles”), but the final self-revelation arrives more as lyrical assertion than as a choice that visibly forecloses a path; the cost is felt but not dramatized in action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the new goodbye letter reweights the premise and carries conceptual cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds; the warehouse vision tightens stakes and ends with Charged Poise.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Projection booth, reels, and letters are rendered with tactile specificity; the setting constrains the psychometry ritual and charges the final image. Micro-setting (key ring) also reconfigures the personal stake.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“where unused love is stored”—is signaled early and deepens through the warehouse walk. One meaningful tightening occurs when she confronts her own shelved life; cost is legible in the apology/new letter.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete particulars; the final image of “hands learning to hold” offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. Unused love as overqualified understudy is a fresh, earned insight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet controlled; perceptual signature is consistent (“spatially imaginative” filtering every detail). Patterned elision (warehouse aisles as metaphor) is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and musical but avoids purple overload; each sentence advances image or stakes. No loops or scaffold; rhythm modulates with pressure. Minor register drift in “overqualified” line is voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses crystal gazer, projection booth, and unsent letters into a singular vision. The warehouse-of-feeling conceit feels inevitable yet non-obvious; risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
