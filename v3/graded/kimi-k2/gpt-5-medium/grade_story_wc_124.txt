<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is embodied and specific; the vial and scent memories anchor contradictory impulses. The final renunciation—offering the lantern but accepting the promise—earns a felt cost. A hairline slip: “I grieve the way one does for rain during drought on the lungs” edges toward label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the vial’s blankness becomes a compass, reweighting memory’s role. Causal chain—lantern delivery → UV reveal → scent map → promise—holds under Accumulative/Textural lens. One micro-turn suffices.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Greenhouse’s crystal shadows and extinct flora constrain every beat; the UV beam literally rewrites the vial. Sensory hierarchy (cedar, rain-on-crystal vapor) is filtered through the broker’s professional caution. Environment charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to bear the scent-memory that buckles him—is signaled early. Escalation tightens when the flower opens and the vapor redraws his grief map. Cost is the lantern he offers and the scheduled return he commits to.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: light passing through what cannot be kept. The final image of memory as “patient flame” reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext in Marla’s tear collection and the broker’s scheduled return deepens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct lyric texture—“cooled music,” “disciplined lightning”—remains consistent under pressure. POV filters every detail through the broker’s aromatic caution. No head-hopping; dialogue minimal but subtextual.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image, emotion, and world-rule. One minor loop: “quiet breath” and “quiet transformations” within four lines. Otherwise zero scaffold; figurative language disciplined to closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: extinct-plant greenhouse as grief archive, lantern broker as memory midwife. Risky lyric compression pays off in the UV-reveal of etched glass. No derivative echoes; premise commits fully.</comment>
