<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied; the lantern-lighter’s contradictory impulses—grief for his sister vs duty to the pier—drive every micro-choice. The final act of sealing the memory into the tin is earned by prior causality and carries visible emotional cost. Minor slip: the sister remains off-page, so relationship-as-crucible pressure is inferred rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the corridor opens, the memory is retrieved, and the lantern-lighter’s understanding of his work is repriced. Causality holds under Accumulative/Textural lens—each salt-glass, gravity pocket, and pressed petal accretes until the final image reweights the premise. Cost is legible in the line “I understand what my work really keeps.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is selective and sensory; the salt chamber’s frost-racks and the whale’s rib-shadow constrain movement and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; the dock, cannery, and whale form one contiguous geography. Only the chemist’s lab feels slightly sketched rather than lived-in, preventing 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recovering the sister’s deleted memory—is signaled early and tightened through each gravity pocket and salt archive. The exhuming beat narrows options and forces a trade-off: risk bureaucratic discovery to reach the memory. Cost is visible but could be sharper; the price feels more conceptual than visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: memory as salvageable cargo, light as boundary against erasure. The final lantern click reweights earlier motifs without moralizing. Subtext in the chemist’s coffee-ground constellations and the whale’s “city breathing under water” deepens resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent; perceptual signature filters every image through the lantern-lighter’s grief-tuned attention. Syntax modulates with pressure—short clauses under gravity flux, longer breaths in the salt chamber. No head-hopping; POV modesty holds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is patterned and paid off (“gravity seed bursting the page”). One minor loop—“the dark keeps stepping over, curious, barefoot, uninvited” slightly restates the prior line—keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses magical realism with maritime grief in a non-obvious synthesis. Salt crystals archiving memories and gravity pockets nesting under piers feel inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking (lyric compression, conceptual physics) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
