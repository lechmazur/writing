<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“the apple trembled as though listening for an edit”), but the vendor’s contradictory impulses remain largely abstract; the final choice to accept the comma-seed is credible yet the cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt, keeping it just below the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the comma-seed reweights the entire premise of “beginnings” and the orchard’s hush. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of absence, moonlight, and silence tightens until the hinge opens. Cost is legible in the withheld breath and the contract’s strict timing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Glass orchard, cloud-sea, and bottled moonlight are not mere scenery; the moonlight literally cuts the hinge and the orchard’s silence is the price of entry. Spatial choreography is clean, sensory hierarchy obeys POV urgency, and the setting constrains every tactical move.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“to find where stories begin”—is signaled early and tightened by the need to quantify absence. One decisive intensification: the hinge opens only after the vendor sacrifices breath and moonlight. Cost is visible, though the emotional sting could be sharper.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of beginnings as parole emerges organically from the orchard’s hush and the vendor’s ledger of regrets. Final image of the comma-seed offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in silence, moonlight, and the polite eyelid of the door.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, lyric, and internally coherent; perceptual signature filters every detail through the vendor’s vocation (“clean slate vendor,” “eraser-dust of customers”). Patterned elision (e.g., “read the nowhere”) is taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and concept without redundancy. Occasional flights (“fog had tried to learn manners”) risk overwriting but stay within the POV’s lexicon. No loops or scaffold; rhythm modulates with pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise of a floating glass library that germinates stories as fruit is fresh; transformation test passes—plot and arc collapse if relocated to mundane settings. Specific synthesis of silence, moonlight, and parole feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
