<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The conjurer’s interiority is vivid and embodied—his grief is tactile in the way he handles the glass eyes and fruit. The contradiction between his need for coherence and his refusal of spectacle is dramatized through micro-choices (tying the rope, arranging fruit). The final renunciation—carrying an unsolved theorem—earns its cost because earlier beats show how each ritual fails to deliver reunion. Only the sister remains off-page, so relationship-as-crucible is N/A.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the rope-and-eye pendulum reweights “longing” from error term to elegant variable, with the cost of permanent uncertainty made legible in the final pocketed knot. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each object and drip adds density until the mosaic theorem crystallizes. Orientation is swift; the cavern and moon arrive by line 3. No causality breaks; every beat advances pattern or stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The cavern orchard is not backdrop but instrument: dripping stalactites count time, mineral blossoms stain fruit, and the moon-fissure supplies the light that activates the mosaic. These environmental constraints shape the conjurer’s ritual pacing and the final rope placement. Sensory selection is urgent—cool tears of fruit, ticking water—filtered through his grief-narrowed perception. The setting charges the final image when moonlight knots the rope.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—how to live with ambiguous loss—is signaled in paragraph 4 and tightened when the mosaic theorem forces a trade-off between certainty and hope. Escalation is accretive: each object handled (eyes, stone, fruit) raises the emotional cost of continuing the ritual. The final choice—to leave the eyes and carry the theorem—forecloses reunion while accepting ongoing ache. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: grief as an unsolved equation where longing is a variable, not an error. The mosaic’s cracked theorem offers a resonant, non-moral answer—love equals attention×time÷courage^return—whose conceptual cost is the impossibility of zero remainder. No thematic statement intrudes; meaning accrues through image and ritual. The final image of the rope in the sleeve reweights every prior object as both memento and method.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with a conjurer’s tactile diction—“fold silence into scarves,” “fruit glistening like cooled tears.” Syntax modulates with emotional pressure: longer, mineral-laden sentences in reflection; clipped, pendulum-like fragments at closure. No head-hopping; focalization stays locked to the conjurer’s selective attention. Patterned elision (e.g., the sister’s fate) is taught early and paid off in the final rope-knot.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; every sentence layers image, emotion, and concept without redundancy. Metaphors are coherent—“angles of missing tesserae dovetail with constellations”—and serve the mathematical motif. No loops, scaffold, or register drift. Rhythm accelerates during the pendulum beat, then settles into the quiet final line. Clean mechanics; no typos or tense slips.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of taxidermy eyes, mosaic theorem, and cavern orchard feels inevitable yet wholly fresh. Ambiguous loss is explored through a non-obvious “gentler mathematics” rather than therapy-speak. Risky lyric compression pays off: the final rope-knot transforms a speculative ritual into lived emotional praxis. No derivative echoes; the voice and world cohere as singular invention.</comment>
