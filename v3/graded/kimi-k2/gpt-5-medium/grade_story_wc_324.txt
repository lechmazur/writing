<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Protagonist’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the “pocketed sparrow” image crystallizes her tenderness and risk. Motive to protect vulnerable voices drives every beat, yet the final renunciation—handing the call over—costs her the heroic role she coveted. The contradiction between curiosity and humility is dramatized, not stated. One slip: the man’s sudden exposition feels slightly serviced rather than pressured.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the child and the man are connected, the tracer steps back into fog, and the cost is the surrender of narrative centrality. Causal chain holds: because she follows the hearing-aid pulse, therefore she finds the living man, therefore she relinquishes control. Lens is Causal throughout. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mist-clad atrium, glass gallery, and the hearing aid itself function as micro-settings that constrain movement and echo grief. The fog sliding “as if the city has decided to lie down” charges the final image of withdrawal. Spatial choreography is clean; no floating rooms. One missed chance: the orange-scented street remains off-stage, blunting sensory payoff.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—protect the living from drowning in the dead’s currents—tightens when the tracer realizes the call is from the living father, not the dead mother. The reversal narrows her role from rescuer to conduit, with visible cost: she forfeits the story’s center. Pressure escalates under Causal lens; no coincidence resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of listening as architecture emerges through concrete action: logging names, cradling the aid, guiding voices. Final image of “incidental heroism” reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext in the photograph’s steam-question-mark and the guard’s open mouth deepens ambiguity. No thematic drift; complexity earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded: “wind in a bottle,” “exhausted mailmen.” Syntax modulates with emotional intensity; short clauses under pressure. POV remains tight first-person; no head-hop. Dialogue sparse but subtextual: “Help” carries entire histories. One minor register drift—“conceptual repricing” diction in narration—barely audible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and motion. No loops or scaffold; “pencil that never seems to dull” recurs with reweighted meaning. Metaphors precise, never mixed. Rhythm breathes with scene: longer sentences in gallery hush, clipped beats during aid-thrum. Clean mechanics throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise—“contact tracer for hearts”—is fresh, yet grounded in tactile detail: cabinets of ears, unclaimed photographs. Transforms ghost-story tropes into intimate logistics of grief. Risky second-person address to the child via phone pays off emotionally. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight; no derivative echoes.</comment>
