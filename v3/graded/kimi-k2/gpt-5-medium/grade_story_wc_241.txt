<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“grief smell green”), contradictions live in scene, and the final micro-choice—slipping the stub into her notebook—earns the bridge with her father. The compulsive-gambler daughter identity is specific, but the father remains off-page, so relationship-as-crucible is only implied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the lantern’s lensed rain reweights risk from theater to stewardship, cost legible in “carry them forward carefully.” Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of subway scrawls → lantern note → theorem stub tightens stakes without causal reversals. Orientation anchored by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rainwashed library and lantern constrain movement and perception; the mica pane literally reframes the rain into “discrete coins,” charging the final image. Sensory selection is POV-biased and purposeful, though exterior clover scent edges toward symbol.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to teach risk without ruin—tightens when the theorem stub forces a choice between inherited thrill and stewardship. One meaningful deepening: the lantern’s note “Check your priors” reframes prior examples into curriculum. Cost is felt in the quiet boarding of the bus.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: probability as love language, risk as inheritance. Final image of “odds change, mercifully and slowly” offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. Subtext in subway scrawls as public/private compass is deft.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature—“clover melancholy,” “numbered squares receded”—and rhythmic control under pressure. Compression taught early (“rain teaches gutters to sing”) and paid off. No head-hopping; single POV holds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>High density, zero loops; figurative language is selective and pattern-taught. Occasional elevated diction (“lucid contradictions are my compass”) is voice-motivated. Final paragraph cadence mirrors the slowing rain, earning poise.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: racetrack stub as theorem, subway graffiti as syllabus. Risk reframed as pedagogy feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Specificity of “queerly serifed A’s” anchors universals.</comment>
