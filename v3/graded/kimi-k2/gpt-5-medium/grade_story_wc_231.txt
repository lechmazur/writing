<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The keeper’s “softly persistent” trait is embodied in tactile micro-choices—fitting the flower, sweeping the notch—each carrying quiet cost. Interiority stays concrete and idiosyncratic; the borrowed memory arrives as sensory flash that tilts present tactics. The final stance crystallizes with felt renunciation: he rescues the gesture but buries its shrine. Minor slip: the girl memory is recounted more than dramatized, keeping it just shy of 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the three-swing lantern reconfigures the dock’s silence into answered light, cost visible in the folded salt-packet and swept-away notch. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each image layers density until the final cadence shift. Causality is lyric but legible: “because I aligned the stems, therefore the light answered.” No orientation drift; anchors are clear by line 4.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The opal dock, notch, and lantern glass are rendered with selective sensory pressure; the notch literally constrains the flower’s placement, charging the final image. Mist and gull silence modulate tone without cliché. Micro-setting (notch-as-lock) functions as pivot object, satisfying 9+ gate. Only hairline slip: one “color hushed to gray vows” edges purple.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—decode the stranger’s gesture—tightens when the notch reveals its history, foreclosing the option to ignore. Escalation is textural: each sensory layer (knock pattern, remembered girl, lantern swing) increases the weight of witness. Cost is felt in the salt-packet and the swept-clean shrine. Agency is observational yet decisive; coincidence complicates but does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of reciprocal witness emerges from concrete acts—flower as key, lantern as reply—never stated. Final image reweights the premise: isolation becomes shared vigil without sentimental rescue. Subtext lives in gesture and silence; ambiguity lingers (was the reply real?) yet feels inevitable. No moralizing, only earned resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct, maritime, and lyrically compressed: “opal dock in mist,” “the tide keeps its own ledger.” Rhythm modulates with pressure—short clauses under the lantern swing, longer breaths in reflection. Perceptual signature is consistent; no POV leakage. Experimental elision (borrowed memory) is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every line layers image or stakes. Metaphors are fresh and coherent (“gray vows,” “ledger of names”). Minor purple tinge in “color of old parchment yet still stubborn” but does not stall momentum. No loops or scaffold; sentence variety supports cadence shift at climax.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The Edelweiss-as-key reverses the expected floral symbol into a maritime cipher; the borrowed-memory device transforms a simple condolence into reciprocal séance. Specificity of notch-and-flower mechanics feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric compression pays off without clarity loss. No derivative echoes.</comment>
