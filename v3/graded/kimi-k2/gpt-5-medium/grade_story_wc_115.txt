<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is embodied and specific—"my breath tasted of iron," "hands tremble"—and the micro-choice of turning the valve is rooted in layered motives (recklessness, skepticism, filial reckoning). The final renunciation (forgiving the wheel, not the men) is earned and carries visible cost. Reflection stays within BRR limits and alters present stance. Minor slip: the partner’s whisper is recounted rather than dramatized, blunting the causal link.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the wheel’s quarter-turn reweights the entire premise, and the sighing pipe makes the cost audible. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of radio hush, droplets, metronome—tightening to a single cadence shift. Orientation is anchored by line 3. No causality breaks; the ghost shift remains metaphorical, not literal intrusion.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The tunnel’s cold, dripping arch and the beaded valve wheel function as micro-setting that constrains the final choice; the wheel’s grease and condensation charge the closing image. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—industrial textures, metallic taste—integrated into action. No white-room syndrome; spatial choreography is clean.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—measuring the weight of a swallowed truth—is signaled early and tightened by the valve’s resistance. Escalation is one deepening: each quarter turn increases pressure and memory until the final release. Cost is the embodied weight in the arms and the unknotted sigh. No external coincidence; agency remains with the protagonist.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the tension between skepticism and the need for ritual; the rosary of droplets reappears as a secular absolution. Subtext operates in the radio’s hush and the metronomic drip—silence as confession. Final image reweights “ghost shift” from supernatural fear to habitual cost, without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is distinct—compressed, metallic, skeptical—and sustains perceptual signature under pressure. Syntax mirrors fatigue: long clauses broken by commas, then abrupt fragments. No head-hopping; POV modesty holds. The radio host’s too-bright laugh is filtered through the narrator’s judgment, not omniscient exposition.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence advances atmosphere or motive. Figurative language is selective—“lullaby sung through teeth,” “yellow coin across the metal”—and never muddles clarity. No loops or scaffold; rhythm accelerates with the valve turns. Clean mechanics throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms the familiar “ghost factory” trope into a secular reckoning with industrial sin. The beaded valve wheel as rosary is a fresh, inevitable synthesis. Risk-taking in lyric compression pays off: the final metronome recharges every prior drip. No derivative echoes.</comment>
