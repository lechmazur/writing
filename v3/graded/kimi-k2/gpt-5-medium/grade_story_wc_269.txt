<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority is embodied and specific (“tapping rhythms…to count swells, to measure fear”). Motivation is clear and intensifies through discovery. The final renunciation—keeping the atlas page separate—carries visible cost and is earned by the preceding causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the corridor is re-mapped, the village reclaims its path, and the keeper’s role is reconfigured. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds; the ribbon of data and the tapping archive tighten stakes without causal reversals. Cost is legible in the keeper’s nightly vigil and the page’s necessary exile.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The station, tide flats, and lanterns are vivid and selective; each constrains tactics (lantern poles must be reset nightly). Micro-setting (steel key, console) functions as charged object. No orientation debt; spatial choreography is clean.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—why paths vanish—is signaled early and tightened once through the revelation that sand tongues shift cyclically. The tightening forces a communal action (lantern assembly) with visible nightly labor as cost. Escalation is coherent under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: shifting ground, living geometry, endurance as arithmetic. Final image of the page living alone offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. Subtext operates in the margin’s single word “Follow” and the keeper’s refusal to reinsert the page.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and rhythmic; the marine-biologist perceptual signature filters every detail. Compression and elision (“fossil fuel ban” in passing) are taught early and paid off. No POV drift; diction stays within keeper’s lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is purposeful (“moored migration of sand and brine”). No loops or scaffold. Rhythm modulates with scene pressure. Final sentence crystallizes without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: coral bleaching, tidal geometry, and archival tapping cohere into a non-obvious whole. Risky lyric structure is justified by pattern-teaching early and closure payoff. Premise could not be transplanted without loss.</comment>
