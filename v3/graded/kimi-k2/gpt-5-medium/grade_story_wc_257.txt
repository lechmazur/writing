<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Grief-as-metallurgist interiority is specific and embodied: “metal would not take a polish” stakes the failure. The micro-choice to solder a clasp where the client hesitates reveals character under pressure with visible cost. Final stance crystallizes: a tutor of endings who stays, renunciation earned. Secondary characters only off-stage, so status dynamics waived.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—the dome fills with curtains of intention that shift the dominant stake from private grief to public ritual. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the lily still glows, “the smallest, truest heat” acknowledged on the page, cost felt. Orientation is immediate; no lens ambiguity at end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Timeless observatory functions as micro-setting and constraint: “mechanism woke with a tremor” sets brass physics that must be calibrated. The lily projector becomes place-and-tool reconfiguring the sky for others, charging final image. Details selective, POV-filtered, never stalls.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</question><comment>Dominant stake signaled in “I came not to bury the design but to teach withering to bloom again.” Escalation is accumulative deepening: every guest’s grief tightens the room’s pressure until the woman with the child’s photo recharges the lily. Closure forecloses personal escape—renunciation held publicly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Theme coheres as grief re-forged into public witnessing; no thesis articulated. Symbol of the stencil reweights: from private tattoo to shared constellation. Final paragraph’s “second anatomy” offers quiet resonance without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Distinct voice: lyric density, controlled rhythm, no filter-verb stacks. POV compression teaches early pattern and holds—e.g., “curtains of intention” recurs with shifting resonance. Punctuation and orthography purposeful, legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</question>
<comment>Prose propels with no scaffold, every sentence performs double work: “the ceiling to answer” / “light found dust like a river finds silt.” Metaphor misfires absent. No paraphrase loops. The final image is clean and charged.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</question>
<comment>Ingenious fusion of mourning craft and planetarium as grief-workshop; not a trope inventory. Transformation through specificity: jet beads, hair-lockets, projector lily. Risk taken with lyric compression sustains coherence rather than gimmick.</comment>
