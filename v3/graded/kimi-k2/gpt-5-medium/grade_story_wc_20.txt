<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete, embodied, and contradictory—"luminous regret" lodged in the throat, the "ghost tonguing my every step." Micro-choices (etching names, tempering alloy with hair and button) reveal hierarchy of values and visible cost. Motivation to "keep the ledger honest" intensifies and culminates in Earned Stasis: carrying the scar-seamed balance rather than expecting Mara’s return. The only drag is a slight over-articulation of the alchemist identity in exposition.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the fused coin-cup alloy becomes a "tether bright enough to guide any stubborn ghost," reconfiguring loss into measured remembrance. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each weighted naming, each tempering pass layers density until the final image crystallizes cost. Causality is intact: the mistake (charge too close) → collapse → ritual reparation → acceptance. No orientation drift; anchors set within 120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Foundry steams like a "wounded animal," rain hisses, furnace door opens "as if it were a question"—selective sensory triangulation that guides choice. The cracked assay cup and zodiac coin function as micro-setting objects that literally constrain measurement and later become the fused closure image. Weather and tools evolve with events; no static wallpaper. Only a hairline slip: one slightly generic "gutters, frogs" line.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—redeem the irredeemable loss of Mara—is signaled in line 2 and escalates through each calibration. Agency drives every beat: testing names, repairing cup, alloying coin with relics. Final tightening forecloses magical resurrection; cost is the permanent scar-seam the narrator must carry. Pressure is coherent under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of measured remembrance emerges from the alchemist’s refusal to let grief "harden like slag." Kintsugi metaphor and name-weighing ritual embody the idea that repair does not erase fracture but makes it legible weight. Final image of the glowing foundry "like a memory that has learned to redeem itself" offers non-literal, resonant answer without moralizing. Complexity is preserved: redemption is not healing but honest accounting.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is lapidary, metallic, and grief-tinged: "golden soot," "stone’s black lungs," "stubborn weight of names." Syntax modulates from long alchemical cadences to clipped ritual imperatives. Perceptual signature is precise—every tool and slag fragment is weighed and named through the alchemist’s bias. No POV leakage or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative language is disciplined—no mixed metaphors, no purple overload. Rhythm breathes with furnace heat and cooling metal. Minor scaffold: one near-paraphrase pair ("measured remembrance…precisely remembered") but does not dull closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise—alchemy as literal bookkeeping of grief—feels fresh and inevitable. Kintsugi + metallurgy + name-weighing synthesizes into a singular ritual logic. Risky lyric compression pays off in the fused coin-cup image. No recognizable template or echo; specificity anchors universals.</comment>
