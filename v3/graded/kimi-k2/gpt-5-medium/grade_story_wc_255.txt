<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ivo’s interiority is vivid—his colorblind perception rendered through taste and temperature—and his micro-choice to trade brush and smoke for the reed is embodied and costly. The plant-language exchanges with Mira crystallize status and empathy without slipping into exposition. The final renunciation of color-names for rhythm earns its poise through prior causality. Only the absence of a second on-page character limits relationship-as-crucible depth.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (ash, smoke, plant grammar) thickens until the reed’s chord reweights perception. Closure is a Charged Poise—edges breathe, spaces sing—cost paid by the surrendered brush and the irreversible shift from hue to rhythm. No orientation drift; courtyard anchors by line 3. One transition (phoenix midday reprise) is seamless.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The courtyard’s heat-cool cycle, the broken goblet bell, and the slag-phoenix shadow constrain every choice; temperature itself becomes a character. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: Ivo reads cobbles by warmth, not color. Final image of thyme-basil gratitude is inseparable from furnace breath. Meets 9+ gate: setting charges closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Dominant stake—trading loss for awakened perception—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightened when Ivo offers his best brush. Escalation is accretive: each plant placement raises the ante until the reed’s single note forecloses color-vision as the only path. Cost is the brush and the permanent shift in sensory grammar. No external coincidence; pressure is situational and coherent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of imperfect beauty emerges through the cooling glass and the reed’s off-key truth; never stated, always enacted. Subtext lives in plant lexicon and the upside-down iris blessing flawed symmetry. Final reweighting—“color is just one oath among many”—is earned, not sermonized. Resonant ambiguity lingers without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is tactile, synesthetic, and consistent: “reads furnace smoke by flavor.” Compression and elision (plant grammar taught early) remain legible under lyric mode. No head-hopping; POV modesty intact. Rhythm modulates with heat—long breaths at rest, staccato when glass shivers.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every line advances image or choice. Figurative language is patterned and paid off (“broken light keeps time”). No loops, no mixed metaphors. Minor scaffold in “after the phoenix rises again” refrain is purposeful cadence, not artifact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: colorblind synesthesia + plant semaphores + bartered awakenings market. Phoenix-as-cooling-glass cycle is non-obvious yet inevitable. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes without obscuring closure. Transformation test: story collapses if any element swapped.</comment>
