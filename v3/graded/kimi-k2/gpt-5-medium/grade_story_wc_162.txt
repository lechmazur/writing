<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“featherly determined,” “pressed the seam”), but the father remains off-stage, so relationship-as-crucible is absent; the final renunciation of descent is earned by prior patterning and carries felt cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test for single-POV.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the protagonist keeps the distance, turning threshold from wall to companion. Causality is Accumulative/Textural—codes, grain, and terrace facets accrete until the seam yields a crystallized stance. Cost is legible in the ache of withheld reunion.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>The drifting prism terrace, bench grain, and orchard-shadow mazes are specific, sensory, and thematically charged; the terrace’s seam literally constrains the final choice, meeting the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is coherent; weather and light behave consistently.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Dominant stake—understanding sacred thresholds—tightens when the codes align with wood grain and the seam offers passage. The deepening is driven by the protagonist’s agency (reading, pressing, refusing descent) and carries the cost of continued exile.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</question><comment>Theme emerges organically: sacredness inheres in the interval, not the door. The final image of postponed welcome reweights all prior mazes and distances without moralizing. Subtext is carried by gesture and silence rather than statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with a perceptual signature attuned to meteorological and agricultural detail. Patterned elision (“corn maze architect’s lost child”) is taught early and paid off. Rhythm modulates with emotional pressure; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; figurative language is selective and pattern-taught. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Sentence rhythm accelerates under pressure; final cadence crystallizes without clutter. Minor elevation in diction is voice-consistent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</question><comment>The synthesis of meteorology, maze theory, and filial absence feels inevitable and fresh. The prism terrace and logbook codes transform familiar motifs of loss into a non-obvious angle on distance as devotion. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring closure.</comment>
