<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Courier’s interiority is embodied and specific—jittery pulse, dragonfly pendant tremor—yet the final stance crystallizes without overt epiphany. Mentor’s absence is felt as a prickling neck rather than exposition. Micro-choice to ask the widow to breathe into his hands reveals hierarchy of values. Cost is visible: corridor thins, mentor remains absent, ridge offers only hush.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density of aurora, ridge hum, pendant resonance accrues until the final green hush reweights the stake. Closure is Charged Poise—courier stands on the path feeling the ridgeway’s pulse, options reconfigured, cost legible in mentor’s absence. Orientation anchored by courier’s climb and lantern widow at ~120 words. No causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Ridge, aurora, bone tube, pendant, and yew seeds are not backdrop but instruments that constrain tactics and charge the final image. Micro-setting of cupped hands beneath rock anchors the ritual. Sensory hierarchy—green sap in snow, marrow-warm tube—filters through courier’s trained perception. Environment evolves: ridge hums louder as corridor forms, then subsides to hush.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: coax wonder from routine while bearing witness to grief. Escalation is accretive: each breath, tremor, and green note tightens the membrane until the corridor opens and closes. Cost is widow’s half-memory smile and courier’s solitary hush. No coincidence resolves; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from particulars: relic courier as gardener of continuance, planting memory in clefts of ordinary life. Final image—ridge’s green hush—reweights premise without moralizing. Mentor’s lesson (“listen to the listening”) is dramatized, not stated. Ambiguity lingers: courier neither courier nor gardener, yet both.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded: “green pouring into the snow like sap returning to old wood.” Perceptual signature—pendant tremor, marrow-warm tube—remains courier-bound. Compression taught early (“maps bleach into sky”) and paid off in final hush. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “the tube answers, not with words but with the way snow forgets and remembers footfalls.” No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances. Metaphors are precise and consistent. Rhythm modulates with scene needs—long breaths during corridor, clipped hush at end.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise—relic courier who extends encounters via sympathetic vibration—is fresh, non-obvious, and fully committed. Transformation test fails if names/places swapped: pendant, ridge, aurora, yew seeds are irreplaceable. Risk in lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring closure. No close echoes of famous scenes.</comment>
