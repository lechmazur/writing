<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is textured and embodied (“my borrowed heart kept quiet”), but the final renunciation—choosing to wait without numbers—leans more on lyrical assertion than on dramatized contradiction; still, the cost of that stance is felt in the closing image of the boot.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each garage-sale post thickens the pattern until the cricket-call reconfigures meaning. Closure is a Charged Poise—the silo hums with “anticipated mysteries”—and the cost is the perpetual openness of waiting.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The emerald silo is not backdrop but instrument: its glowing glass teaches the narrator’s feet to read time, and the final hum recharges the opening image. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered (“wheat ghosts,” “bottled pasture”).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to live faithfully when numbers fail—tightens through each impossible item posted; the deepening is the shift from solitary keeper to communal calendar. Cost is the unending vigilance of “waiting tasted like cedar.”</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete acts: receipts assigned to “flavors of absence,” footprints walked into loops. The final boot post offers a non-literal answer—follow the soft thunder—without moralizing, letting ambiguity linger.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and consistent: compressed lyric syntax, tactile diction (“pollen where next year tried its first word”), no head-hop. Patterned elision is taught early and paid off in the cricket’s return.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is selective and purposeful. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances texture or stakes. Rhythm modulates with pressure, culminating in the hushed final line.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The premise—time after numbers—feels inevitable yet fresh; garage-sale steganography as communal timekeeping is a non-obvious synthesis. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring closure.</comment>
