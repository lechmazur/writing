<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is embodied and specific—"pivot on wet stone makes meaning"—but the cartographer remains a cipher; their trembling shoulder is the only embodied cue. The final renunciation of exile into vocation is earned by the dance-cost paid on the shoulder-sky. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene; the dancer’s certainty flattens tension. Still, micro-choices (dot, line, press) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of images (moonstone, basin, shoulder-sky) reweights the stake until the final Charged Poise—“the law could not seize what is only visible between two people.” Orientation is swift; causality is lyric, not linear, yet coherent. Closure lands with conceptual cost: the dancer accepts perpetual fugitivity as vocation. One scaffold—“I would say gardener, and let my hands answer tide dancer”—could tighten, but it does not fracture closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Twilight garden is rendered through scent, shadow, and the basin’s moon; each constrains the choreography of secrecy. The shoulder becomes micro-setting, a sky that must bear the verse. Spatial choreography is clean—cloth unwound, dot placed, forehead pressed. One minor drift: “round basin” appears late without prior anchor, but the basin’s echo ties it to closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to preserve memory against sanctioned amnesia—tightens when the verse is etched onto skin, foreclosing the option of safe forgetting. Escalation is accretive: each dot raises the risk of discovery. Cost is visible in the cartographer’s tremble and the dancer’s acceptance of lifelong exile. No external antagonist needed; the law’s absence is pressure enough.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the act itself: memory as bodily inscription, exile as vocation. Subtext lives in gesture—the shoulder’s tremble, the basin’s withheld moon. Final image reweights the premise: what is written between two bodies cannot be policed. No moralizing; the garden’s hush is the only answer given.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is tidal, lyrical, and consistent: “spinning the moon’s pull into adagios” teaches the pattern early. Perceptual signature is dancer-specific—currents read as chords, gaps as measure. No dialogue, so no voice leakage. Compression and elision are purposeful; the reader is trusted to follow the lyric leaps.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and motion. No loops or scaffold; “obsidian grace” returns charged. One mixed metaphor—“ship unafraid to make its own weather”—barely grazes clarity. Rhythm modulates with pressure; the final paragraph slows into earned stillness.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise—memory contraband, tide-dancer exile—is fresh and fully committed. The shoulder-sky as living stanza is a non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring closure. No derivative echoes; the voice owns its myth.</comment>
