<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is embodied and specific; the contradiction between guarding songs and risking trust is dramatized in the final release of Lark. The reinvention of history is shown through micro-choices (cutting hymn slips, tying the meteorite to Lark) rather than told. Cost is visible: the attic is lost, the past remains but is “learning gentler creases.” Only the violinist remains off-page, so relationship crucible is N/A.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of paper, dust, and song accrues until the final cadence shift reweights trust. Closure is a Charged Poise—the hatch opens, the song climbs back “soft as flour, strong as rope,” and the hinge of suspicion visibly loosens. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no drift. One transition (climbing the beam) is brief and contiguous.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The attic’s dust motes, cedar scent, and failing skylight constrain every tactical choice; the meteorite and paper slips function as micro-setting that calibrate doubt. Final image of the square “blooming” while the echo climbs the drainpipes recharges the attic’s acoustic memory. Weather and light evolve with stakes. No credibility breaks.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve songs vs risk trust—is signaled early and tightened when the attic is to be cleared. One meaningful deepening: the decision to send Lark with the meteorite and hymn slips forecloses the option of keeping the songs safe in the attic. Cost is the loss of the roost and the exposure of the songs to possible theft again.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of trust as a fragile, renewable act emerges through the concrete exchange of slips and the violinist’s bow that “keeps no secrets.” No moralizing; the final image of pigeons carrying memory “toward remembering and toward mercy” reweights the premise without statement. Ambiguity lingers: the past still smiles counterfeit, yet the hinge loosens.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded in tactile detail—“glue and cedar,” “gray hush with a bright direction.” Syntax modulates with emotional pressure; short clauses under the shuddering skylight accelerate the beat. No head-hopping; POV remains tightly interior. Dialogue is minimal and subtextual (“we trade scraps, not names”).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and motion. No loops or scaffold; metaphors are precise—“dust flickers to show a corridor of gentle drift.” Rhythm breathes with scene needs. Minor elevated diction (“conceptual repricing” zone) is voice-consistent. No artifacts in closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Pigeon courier + attic archivist + Martian meteorite as trust talisman is a fresh synthesis. The dust-mote navigation method feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric compression pays off in the final auditory image. No derivative echoes; the emotional calculus is specific to this voice.</comment>
