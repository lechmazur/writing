<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied—"empty spaces remember" drives every micro-choice; the brass telescope and spare line act as tactile extensions of motive. The final re-attachment is a credible renunciation of drift, paid for by the logged blank lines. Reflection stays within BRR limits and tilts present tactics. Only the father corridor drifts toward summary, keeping it just shy of 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: drifting beats accrue emotional density until the re-joining click reweights the stake. Closure is a Charged Poise—the blank log lines memorialize absence with felt cost. Orientation is clear by line 3; no causal leaps. One hairline slip: the captain’s hail resolves coincidence rather than complicates, but the final cadence shift absorbs it.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Salt flats, gondola, and telescope form a micro-setting that constrains every move; spare line coils act as both tool and moral barometer. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—metallic dust of starlight on the chart table anchors space. Weather is not backdrop but active pressure. Meets 9+ gate: the telescope’s final cradle placement charges the closing image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—proving absence remembers—tightens once when the protagonist chooses bearings by feeling, trading certainty for connection. Cost is the logged blank space, a visible forfeiture of data. Escalation is textural: resentment→remorse→gratitude mirrors internal shift. Agency drives every beat; no off-stage rescue.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</question><comment>Theme emerges from the equation of meteorology and grief; no explicit thesis. The blank log lines reweight the premise that memory lives in what instruments miss. Subtext hums in radio static and the click of re-attachment. Final resonance is non-moral, non-literal, and lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is meteorologist-poet: “clouds by emotion, winds by scent” teaches the taxonomy early and pays it off. Syntax modulates with altitude—long sweeps in drift, clipped bearings in return. No head-hops; psychic distance tightens under pressure. Distinct perceptual signature sustained to last line.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet aerodynamic; every sentence advances image or choice. No loops, no mixed metaphors. Rhythm breathes with drift and reels with return. One minor scaffold—“quietly explosive” appears twice in close succession—costs the 9.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: meteorology as grief cartography. Brass telescope and spare line transform from props to moral instruments. The taxonomy of clouds by emotion feels inevitable yet wholly new. Risky lyric structure lands with crystalline closure.</comment>
