<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority is precise and embodied; the narrator’s contradictory impulses—grief vs. professional composure—play out in micro-choices (placing the chip, tuning the dial). The final renunciation (“we keep only enough shimmer”) is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost. Mentor’s absence is still felt as pressure, satisfying the crucible test.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the balm holds the mentor’s last words, reconfiguring the narrator’s stance with undeniable cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each sensory layer intensifies until the final image crystallizes. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Skyborne grotto and aurora are not backdrop; their pulses dictate when the chip can drink the signal, directly constraining the infusion beat. Micro-setting (emerald chip, radio static) functions as setting-as-tool. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—capture the last spark—tightens once when the static yields the mentor’s voice; the cost is the irreversible dimming of the chip and the narrator’s acceptance of permanent absence. Escalation is accretive, fitting the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of stewardship between deaths emerges through action, not statement. The mentor’s final instruction (“Let them meet themselves kindly”) reweights the entire ritual, offering a resonant, non-moral answer to grief’s silence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; perceptual signature (“radio coughed a veil of snow”) is consistent and character-bound. Patterned elision (aurora as living veil) is taught early and paid off in the final glow. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; every image advances atmosphere or stakes. No loops, mixed metaphors, or scaffold. Rhythm modulates with emotional pressure—short pulses during chip activation, longer breaths during memory.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mortuary ritual and auroral data-harvesting; the concept feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. No derivative echoes.</comment>
