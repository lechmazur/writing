<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied, but the ghost bride’s motivations are relayed more than dramatized; the keeper’s contradictory impulses (to wake the orchard vs. honor the promise) surface late and resolve quietly, so the cost feels muted rather than crucible-tested.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the orchard now “warms its own dark,” a charged poise that reweights the premise. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each lyrical shard deepens pattern until the final image crystallizes the debt paid. Cost is felt in the keeper’s enduring vigil and the bride’s vanishing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The greenhouse, vines, and frost function as micro-setting that constrains every choice; the carved bead’s warmth against soil and the “glass arterial with vines” charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective, urgent, and filtered through the keeper’s bias, anchoring time and space without exposition.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—wake the orchard without selfish grief—is signaled early and tightened through each shard. Pressure grows via pattern intensification: bead drop → saplings answer → orchard sings. The final stance crystallizes with felt cost (keeper’s perpetual night vigil), though escalation is more accretive than sharply reversive.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of debt, memory, and reciprocal caretaking emerges from concrete particulars; no moralizing. The orchard’s eventual self-warming reconfigures the meaning of “resonant awakening” without explicit statement. Subtext in the bride’s lovingly venomous humor and vanishing fingertip lingers as mournful elation.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct, lyric, and consistent; perceptual signature is the keeper’s alchemical, horticultural diction. Patterned elision (“ephemeral cameo appearances”) is taught early and paid off at closure. Syntax modulates with emotional pressure, and no head-hopping occurs.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is purposeful and rarely over-crowded. Occasional stacked metaphors (“cinders fell like confetti that remembered the burn”) flirt with excess but serve the accretive design. No loops or scaffold; rhythm breathes with scene needs.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The ghost-bride/orchard-debt synthesis feels fresh; tropes of spectral guide and magical greenhouse are transformed through tactile specificity and reciprocal caretaking. The final image of the orchard warming its own dark is an inevitable yet non-obvious payoff that heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
