<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The veiled dreamer's interiority is vivid and embodied—"cautious exuberance brightened my steps"—but the final renunciation (breathing the letter without speaking) is more asserted than dramatized; the cost is felt yet not fully earned by prior micro-choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the protagonist becomes messenger, sealing the unsounded letter by closing eyes. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of mist, watch, cipher, and breath layers until the final click reweights all prior material with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The glowing library in mist is not mere backdrop; its breathing windows and legible curls of fog actively gate entry and shape the final corridor. The watch and cipher function as micro-settings that constrain tactics, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding the library of unspoken words—tightens through propagation delays and the cipher’s demands. One meaningful deepening occurs when the protagonist must document pauses instead of ink, narrowing options with visible patience-cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the tension between speech and silence; the final image of sealing the page by closing eyes offers a non-literal answer that reweights the entire quest without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise—“time did not flow but negotiated”—with a perceptual signature that filters every detail through the dreamer’s bias. Patterned elision (cyclically reversed time) is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. Minor scaffold—“I felt again the first letter’s ash-map”—is offset by high information density and rhythmic control under pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of reversed-time watch, ciphered library, and unspoken letters feels inevitable in hindsight; the risk of lyric abstraction is fully embraced and rewarded by a closure that reconfigures meaning without gimmickry.</comment>
