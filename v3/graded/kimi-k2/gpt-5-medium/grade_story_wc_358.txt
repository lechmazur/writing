<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is precise and embodied (“the cloth oval a borrowed authority and a vow”), but the child’s arrival is too late to test status dynamics; the final renunciation of the patch is earned yet the cost feels slightly abstract.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the patch barely stirs, the corridor holds, and the air’s future danger is reweighted. Causal chain from survey → chalked vectors → uploaded offset → safe landing is tight, with the cost of permanent vigilance legible in the final inventory.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Container canyons and wind corridors are not backdrop but tactical terrain; the helipad’s dust devil is rendered with sensory economy and directly constrains the landing choice, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preventing another rotorcraft loss—tightens through each beat: chalk arrows, radio upload, offset rule-of-thumb. The final “inventory what held and what almost failed” crystallizes the price of imperfect foresight.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of foresight-as-practice emerges from concrete acts (ribbon tape, charcoal corridors) rather than statement; the ending’s quiet nod to tomorrow’s different air avoids moralizing and lets the concept resonate.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is spare, technical, yet lyric (“salt, rust, and the mothball sweetness of abandoned fruit shipments”); perceptual signature stays consistent under pressure, and the child’s dialogue carries authentic economy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; no loops or scaffold. Metaphors are disciplined (“canyons do not care about names”) and serve clarity; final paragraph’s cadence mirrors the held-breath release.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Transforms the familiar disaster-investigation frame into a meditation on predictive posture; the wind-trained dust devil feels inevitable yet fresh, and the patch’s reprise is a subtle, non-obvious synthesis.</comment>
