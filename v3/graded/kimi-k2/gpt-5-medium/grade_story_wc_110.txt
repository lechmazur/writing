<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied; the registrar’s contradictory impulses—cowardice vs. duty—drive every micro-choice. The final act of public confession carries visible social cost and is earned by prior guilt and eavesdropping. Minor slip: “coward, learning to be freed” edges toward label-speak, blunting the embodied contradiction at the climax.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the lens returned in shared light reweights communal trust. Causal chain—eavesdrop → decipher → confess → collective repair—holds without gaps. Cost is legible in the registrar’s relinquished secrecy and the curator’s bow. Orientation is taught early by sensory anchors; no drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The crystal forecourt, rain, and puddles are not backdrop; they refract light for the lens and mirror the city’s fragile trust. Micro-setting (the bandstand, tarp screen) constrains the final choice. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered. One hairline slip: “crystals have tuned us” flirts with overt symbolism, but the image still recharges the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restoration of communal trust—is signaled in the first paragraph and tightened when the registrar decides to confess publicly. Escalation is driven by each decoded doodle, narrowing options toward transparency or perpetual suspicion. The final tightening occurs on the bandstand where silence itself becomes pressure. Cost is visible in the registrar’s vulnerability.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of transparency vs. secrecy emerges organically from the registrar’s choices and the city’s broken oath. Subtext lives in doodles, shadows, and the hush itself. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: shared light dissolves blame without moralizing. No thematic drift or final-paragraph sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, lyrical yet grounded in the registrar’s perceptual bias—“puddles murmuring like glass throats.” Syntax modulates with emotional pressure; short clauses under climax mirror heartbeat. No head-hopping; POV modesty maintained. Compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every image does double duty. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Rhythm breathes with scene needs—longer cadences for reflection, clipped fragments during setup. One near-repeat: “after words become unnecessary” appears twice; the reprise is purposeful, so no penalty.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise reframes civic conflict through a quiet registrar and a chipped lens—fresh angle on restorative justice. Doodles-as-evidence and crystal acoustics feel inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric structure pays off in a communal, non-violent resolution. No derivative echoes; specificity anchors universals.</comment>
