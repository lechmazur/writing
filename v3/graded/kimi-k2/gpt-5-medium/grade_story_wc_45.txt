<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrator’s forgiving skepticism is embodied in every micro-choice—pocketing the tooth, resetting Ari’s shoulder, choosing mercy over accusation. Interior contradiction is palpable: doubt and tenderness coexist in the same breath. The final renunciation of the witch-tale in favor of “ours” is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost (Ari’s shame, the town’s looming clamor). Only the slight over-articulation of “yearn without lying” keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the tooth left under the fountain stone crystallizes mercy and reweights the entire mystery. Causal chain holds—substitute body → cleft in certainty → garden discovery → shoulder set → truth told. One transition (garden to home) is clean. Cost is unmistakable: Ari’s dislocated arm, the town’s future wrath. Minor ellipsis in how Ari evaded search is forgiven under lyric compression.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The secret garden breathes mint and iron; the fountain mutters “abandoned plans.” Micro-setting (bench, lattice, soil) constrains the discovery of the tooth and later the shoulder-setting. Spatial choreography is exact: Linnet tugs sleeve, Ari emerges from hedge, water fetched, tooth placed. Final image of stars as “bright bones” recharges the bone-setting motif. Only a hairline slip—no sensory narrowing under peak stress—keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether Ari will be condemned—tightens when the narrator chooses to heal and to tell the truth. One decisive deepening: the shoulder set becomes the crucible where blame is transmuted into mercy. Cost is visible (pain, social risk). Pressure escalates under situational lens: town’s voices, hedge maze, Ari’s injury. No reversals needed; one crystallizing choice suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: mercy as a form of truth-telling, mistakes reconfigured as constellations. Subtext lives in gesture—pocketing the tooth, wrapping the shoulder—never in sermon. Final image of stars “learning our names” offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. Complexity is honored: Ari is both protector and deceiver; the town remains dangerous. No thematic drift or echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, tactile, and compressed: “Bone setting, like truth, hurts first and then holds.” Perceptual signature is consistent—medical precision braided with folkloric diction. No head-hopping; POV stays locked to the forgiving skeptic. Rhythm modulates with pressure: longer cadences for reflection, clipped fragments during the shoulder reduction. Dialogue is sparse but subtextual (“We would tell it plain”).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet limpid: “grief is a mineral that settles everywhere.” No loops, no scaffold, no mixed metaphors. Sentences advance multiple jobs—atmosphere, character, plot—without padding. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-driven. Only a single near-repeat (“set more wrists than clocks / set the story”) grazes redundancy, but the echo is purposeful.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Familiar tropes—missing child, changeling lore, hedge maze—are transfigured through bone-setting as metaphor and vocation. The synthesis feels inevitable: orthopedic mercy reframes the entire mystery. Specificity anchors universals: the tooth wrapped in blue thread, the fountain’s dialect of abandoned plans. Risk is taken in blending lyric fabulism with medical realism, and it pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
