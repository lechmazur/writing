<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority is embodied and particular; the narrator’s pacifist restraint is dramatized through micro-choices (asking visitors to sheathe knives, threading stories into irrigation). Contradictory impulses—yearning for father vs. tending strangers—coexist in scene. The final renunciation (to keep the farm open) is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: perpetual vigilance and inherited blame. Only the father’s rumored motives remain slightly abstract, preventing a perfect 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure is a Charged Poise: the dome’s “tranquil blaze” crystallizes continuity as shared vow. Causality holds: each visitor beat accumulates toward the final letter and the narrator’s resolve. Orientation is anchored early; no teleporting props. A hairline slip: the father’s letter arrives off-stage, not strictly foreshadowed, nudging it below 9.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The glass dome, roses, and sandbag scrap function as micro-setting that constrains every choice—visitors must disarm to enter, the scrap re-roots memory. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered: “heat scorched their edges smooth.” Final image recharges the dome as hinge “turning ruin toward renewal.” No orientation drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake: keep the farm as living sanctuary. Escalation is accretive—each visitor tests the narrator’s vow until the letter forces crystallization. Cost is legible: perpetual guardianship, no reprieve. The tightening is single but sufficient; no reversals needed. Slight abstraction in “debts” keeps it from 9.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: mercy as cultivated discipline, continuity as resistance to collapse. Subtext in gestures—laying a knife on soil, tying letter to trellis—carries weight without exposition. Final image reframes prior motifs (roses, scrap, quiet) into a resonant non-moral answer. No thematic echo in final paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded; perceptual signature filters every detail through a gardener’s patience. Syntax modulates with pressure: longer cadences for reflection, clipped fragments when knives are sheathed. No head-hopping; diction stays within plausible lexicon. Compression (“hinge soundless with use”) is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and propulsive; every sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. Metaphors are precise—“thorns like tiny sundials set to mercy.” One minor loop: “engraved quiet” appears three times without new inflection. No artifact in closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise synthesizes post-collapse sanctuary, pacifist bounty-hunter’s daughter, and sentient horticulture into an inevitable whole. Risk-taking (roses taught values via irrigation stories) pays off without gimmickry. Specificity anchors universals; removing any core image would collapse the story’s logic.</comment>
