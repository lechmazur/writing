<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The sensory map-maker’s interiority is sharply embodied—smell as cartography, pulse as waypoint. The contradiction between survivor’s guilt and reluctant agency is dramatized through her cyclic hesitations at the terminal scene. Her final acceptance, folding the child version into the chart, earns a credible renunciation with visible emotional cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mosaic structure uses parallel-universe recursion to reveal the moment of sabotage; each strand tightens the because/therefore link until the withholding truth detonates. Closure lands as conceptual repricing: the shard reframes the bay, the self, and all future routes outward. No causality leaks—every loop is paid off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Ozone and rain texture the air with off-world departure; hanging chains echo in possible snakes. The bay’s broken console becomes a tactile archive, constraining the final redirect. Micro-setting works as tool and body alike.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Stakes start abstract—“weight of withheld truth”—then crystallize: her younger hand hovers, fuel is redistributed, Kestrel survivors live by accident. The tightening occurs when she recognizes her own past act, narrowing her future to perpetual atonement.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Emergent theme: memory as culpability, maps as confession. No overt moralizing—the final lanterns are smell-coded doors silently inviting others toward life she redirected away. Ambiguity lingers as earned wound.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric-technical, controlled in synesthetic bursts: “planetary aurora poured into cheap tempered glass.” Fragmented rhythms under stress echo cyclical spontaneity. Green-glass POV prism never head-hops.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Sentence music accelerates with pressure—“a hiss, a spark, a chain of exits becoming entries.” Figurative language stays selective; no metaphor muddle at climax. High information density, zero paraphrase loops.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>A fresh angle: the childhood accident at the heart of cosmic rewriting. Risk-taking—non-linear recursion and sensory cartography—heightens stakes without gimmickry. Feels singular and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
