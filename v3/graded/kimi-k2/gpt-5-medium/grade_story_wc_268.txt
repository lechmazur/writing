<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyr’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the contradiction between his regal bearing and unpretentious robe charges every micro-choice. Serane’s mask-like polish and tremor are shown through gesture, not label. The final renunciation is earned: Serane’s confession and Lyr’s sealing of the scrap visibly foreclose her claim. Only the titan’s “overlooked” trait is asserted more than dramatized, keeping it just below the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Serane’s withdrawal and the library’s “graceful collapse of accumulated lies” reconfigure both futures. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each book and drifting aisle layers pressure until the comma’s restoration forces choice. Cost is legible in the ink climbing Serane’s skin and the retinue’s silent retreat. No orientation debt; anchors are clear by line 4.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The temple library breathes, drifts, and rearranges moonlight—details are filtered through Lyr’s custodial gaze and constrain tactics via the rune of drift. The iron pellet and reliquary act as micro-setting objects that charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible moves. Only the “skylight sighed a fracture” skirts excess symbolism, barely capping it below 9.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—unmasking the pretender—is signaled in paragraph 4 and tightens with each book Serane opens. Agency remains with Lyr’s arrangement of mirrors; Serane’s pride trips her. The deepening occurs when the ink recognizes kinship, forcing confession. Cost is visible: loss of name, retinue, crown. One meaningful tightening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of truth versus performance emerges through concrete particulars: the missing comma, the ink’s climb, the library’s courteous demolition of lies. No moralizing; resonance arises from the final image of the glossary sealing the scrap. Ambiguity lingers—was justice served or merely recorded?—without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; patterned elision (“dust motes spiraled as if stars rehearsing…then forgot”) is taught early and paid off in the drifting constellations. Syntax modulates with pressure—short clauses at the climax (“Ink recognized kinship…”). No head-hopping; POV stays locked to Lyr’s selective perception. Dialogue is sparse but subtext-rich: “Follow the bookmarks” carries threat and invitation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. Metaphors are fresh and coherent—“pressed storms,” “potential thunder.” No loops, scaffold, or register drift. Rhythm breathes with scene needs; the final paragraph slows to crystalline stillness. One hairline slip: “regally unpretentious robe” repeats the adverbial pairing, but the cadence justifies it.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The premise—a titan librarian using punctuation to dethrone a pretender—feels inevitable in hindsight yet wholly fresh. Tropes of hidden heirs and dusty archives are transformed through the rune of drift and ink-kinship. Risk-taking (lyric drift, conceptual repricing) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. No close echoes; voice is singular.</comment>
