<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The skeptic’s interiority is vivid—taste as navigation, doubt as pulse—but the decisive shift from observer to “let it carry me” is compressed into a single sentence; the cost is felt yet not fully embodied in a micro-choice on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the ring’s taste modulates to “us,” reconfiguring the compass from solitary guide to shared covenant; the lens is Accumulative/Textural, the final cadence shift is legible, and the cost—ceding solitary certainty—lingers in the last line.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lavender bluff, aurora, and metallic wind are not backdrop but instruments: the violet breath exhaled at the fork literally steers the pair toward companionship, charging the final image with place-bound cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—“learn why some carry weather”—tightens when the protagonist must decide whether to walk the final count; the tightening is driven by Mirelle’s invitation and the ring’s shifting taste, with the cost of relinquishing pure skepticism legible on the tongue.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the reweighting of “weather” from mythic threat to negotiated commons; the final image of “quorum” between sky and ground offers a resonant, non-moral answer to the central question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is a sustained lyric signature—synesthetic, precise, and internally coherent; the skeptic’s perceptual bias (taste as map) never slips, and the patterned elision of exposition is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; only a single mixed metaphor (“green teeth” of aurora) momentarily jars, but the rhythm accelerates through the final count without loops or scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of synesthetic navigation, forest democracy, and weather as civic debate is non-obvious yet inevitable; the risk of lyric abstraction is fully earned by grounded sensory stakes.</comment>
