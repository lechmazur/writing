<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Oracle’s interiority is vivid—salt-stung knuckles, bleeding fingers—yet her contradictory impulses (to finish the map vs. to let the courier go) remain mostly summarized rather than dramatized in-scene. Courier’s shift from skeptic to bearer is credible but compressed; the cost (torn sleeve, lantern lowered) is visible yet light. Overall, characterization is strong but stops just short of the 9+ threshold because the final renunciation is more stated than embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the courier’s stance crystallizes into mission, the oracle’s into endurance, both with felt cost (booklet given, blood in stone). Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each silence-gap is a bead added until the final cadence reweights the night. No causality breaks; orientation is taught early via storm, ridge, single star.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Storm-ridge fort, flaking gold, salt wind, and single star are rendered with tactile economy; every detail either constrains action (wet stone, wind against lantern) or charges the final image (gold leaf bruising like fruit). Micro-setting (booklet spine as “stubborn horizon”) functions as navigational tool. One hairline slip: “towers hum with an ambered hush” edges toward overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—deliver a map that lets people “tune themselves to what refuses to vanish”—is signaled early and tightened when courier admits original intent to burn records. Escalation is accretive: each silence-gap narrows the world’s noise until only the star’s pulse remains. Cost is visible (oracle’s bleeding fingers, courier’s torn sleeve) and conceptual (oracle stays to walk “tide’s erasures”).</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: night as migratory silence, maps as breathing instructions. Subtext in courier’s lantern-bow and oracle’s storm-whitened smile carries absolution without sermon. Final image—“the sea graduates into a gentler noise”—reweights prior crashes into a hushed promise. No thematic drift or overt moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet disciplined; perceptual signature (“salt stings her knuckles,” “gold leaf bruising under rain like ripened fruit”) stays oracle-bound. Syntax modulates with pressure—long breaths in calm moments, clipped fragments when wind falters. No POV leakage; courier’s interior is inferred through gesture and silence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, musical, and propulsive; each sentence layers image and motion. Occasional elevated diction (“lacunae,” “cartography of pauses”) risks register drift but remains consistent with oracle’s vocation. One minor loop: “the fort listens… the pages tremble… the wind falters” repeats the pattern of personification; does not dull closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: a cartography of silence taught by a single star. Familiar tropes—oracle, storm, courier—are retooled through tactile specificity and accretive lyricism. Risky compression (800-word mythic arc) pays off; the ending feels inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
