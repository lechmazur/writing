<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied; the dealer’s contradictory impulses—commerce vs. caretaking—surface in micro-choices (letting Rhea keep the petal, charging little). The final renunciation of profit for witness feels earned, though the “professionally thorough” trait is asserted more than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the dealer’s stance shifts from seller to witness, cost paid in unrecorded debt. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of half-truths thickens until the petal’s shared spark crystallizes new balance. Orientation is swift; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Amber grotto’s resin breath and static act as micro-setting that literally conducts the emotional transaction; the fossils-in-glass image reweights the ending. Sensory detail is selective, filtered through the dealer’s tactile bias, and constrains the choice to release rather than retain the petal.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Rhea’s need to fuse insight with empathy—tightens once when the counterfeit is offered as bridge, not escape. Escalation is textural: static hum thickens, petal curls, spark leaps. Cost is the dealer’s forfeited fee and anonymity; pressure coherent under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of half-truths as humane scaffolding emerges through action, never sermon. Final image—petal flattened to wrist, static purring—offers non-literal answer: truth as motion, not purity. Subtext in shared spark and unspoken ledger deepens resonance without tidy moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, lyric yet grounded in sensory trade-craft; perceptual signature (“bat of skin”) is consistent. Compression and elision are taught early (“I already knew”) and paid off in the closing ledger of nothing written. No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates with emotional heat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; each sentence layers scent, static, and metaphor without redundancy. Occasional elevated diction (“humane arithmetic”) fits the dealer’s self-aware register. No loops or mixed metaphors; final image crystallizes cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise—counterfeit emotion as cartographic aid—is fresh, synthesized through specific occupational detail. Risky lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry; transformation test passes—story would collapse if “half-truths” were swapped for simple lies. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
