<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mara’s interior contradiction—yearning to help yet guarding estrangement—drives every micro-choice; the final routing of the trapped-child call crystallizes her ethos, but one beat of pure summary after the rescue weakens the cost legibility.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds: densifying looped voices tighten until the child rescue reconfigures meaning under the “teach endings how to begin” premise. Closure moment—“a resonant, non-literal answer”—lands when the child’s hush becomes a door, cost felt in Mara’s refusal to step through.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Subway tunnel ambience, flickering bulbs, damp copper—select detail anchors every beat; the glass disc charges the final image by vibrating untouched, constraining Mara’s hand on the switch.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“teach endings how to begin”—escalates via densifying loops until the elevator crisis narrows to a single switch-flip; felt cost exists for Rojo/Flora, but Mara’s stake pays off conceptually more than viscerally.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of caretaker distance emerges from loop patterns and payoff image; no didactic summary; final hush reconfigures all prior wrong-number grief without labeling it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Distinct lyrical rhythm sustains through compression—“wires answered,” “door in ash”—without voice leakage; POV modesty maintained; purposeful elision (“She recorded...naming it...”) teaches pattern and pays off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Information-dense, cadence-driven prose; one weak scaffold (“she felt... she saw...”) and an overloaded simile (“key in ash”) cause minor drag but never obscure cause or closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh twist on urban legend premise—analog switchboard as secret afterlife intake desk—made inevitable by specific tunnel tech, glass disc timbre, and accumulated wrong-number grief; high-risk voice risks paid off without gimmickry.</comment>
