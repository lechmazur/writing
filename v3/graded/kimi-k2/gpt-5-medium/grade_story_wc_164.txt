<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“heat hums in a key between sorrow and laughter”), but the recollectionist’s choices remain largely observational; the decisive act—scattering seeds to reroute travelers—feels lightly motivated rather than wrestled with. No contradictory impulse is dramatized on the page, so the final renunciation lacks visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the path’s self-erasure is reframed as caretaking, a Conceptual Repricing that reweights the premise. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—patterned imagery and cadence shift charge the final image. Cost is legible in the shepherd’s sad smile and the new footnote-path that “will fade when it must.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The geode-cave is not backdrop but instrument: crater glass, pool-coin, and migrating bird all constrain tactics and charge the final image. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered (“cheerful yet full of dignified midnight”). Spatial choreography is coherent; every object handled alters later choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—why paths vanish—tightens once when the shepherd’s courtesy reveals the land’s request for silence. Escalation is driven by protagonist attention and conjecture, narrowing options to reroute rather than reclaim. Cost is felt in the acceptance of impermanence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: disappearance as respectful revision, not loss. The final image of a path “stretching like a cat, bright with considerate caution” offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. Subtext operates in silence and seed-trails; complexity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, lyrical, and internally coherent; perceptual signature is selective and biased (“I transliterate emotions rather than translate”). Patterned elision is taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates with emotional intensity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is purposeful and patterned. Minor loop risk in “seeds…seeds…seeds” but cadence supports theme. No mixed metaphors or clarity breaks at closure. High information density with rhythmic control.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise—harvesting vanishing memories inside a geode—feels fresh and inevitable. Tropes of lost paths and caretaking are transformed through specific, grounded choices. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes without obscuring closure. Singular artistic stance.</comment>
