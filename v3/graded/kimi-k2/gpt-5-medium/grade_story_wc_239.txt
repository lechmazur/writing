<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The witness’s interiority is vivid and embodied—“dictionary cracked softly when I opened it at Listen”—but the arc leans more on lyrical accumulation than on a single, causally earned renunciation; the final hinge role feels granted by temple logic rather than by prior flaw or choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the witness rewrites the task from “unify” to “be listening,” a charged poise that reweights the entire spiral. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each lap of the spiral deepens pattern and meaning—yet the cost (giving away certainty) is more asserted than dramatized in a single beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The temple library is not backdrop but instrument: the meteor-stone lectern warms under touch, the spiral floor arbitrates every step, and the hush itself “breathed between shelves.” These constraints actively shape tactics and charge the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—binding memory without lying—tightens through each spiral circuit, but the escalation is more accretive than sharply tested; the cost is diffuse, felt as surrendered certainty rather than a single forfeiture that narrows live options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically from the spiral’s logic: memory and history are not linear but tidal, waiting for the valley to “learn the word listen again.” The final line’s inhalation offers a non-literal, resonant answer without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrically compressed yet always legible; the hush has a “body,” dates are “scratches of frightened dawn.” Patterned elision is taught early and paid off in the closing inhalation, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive—“wanderingly exact,” “resounding hush”—with zero loops or scaffold. Each image does double duty; no mixed metaphors or filter-verb stacks mar the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The cosmic-library-arbitrator premise is fresh, but the true ingenuity lies in making silence an active adjudicator and a dictionary the hinge of history. The synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight, and the risk of high lyricism pays off without clarity loss.</comment>
