<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The navigator's interiority is concrete ("I feel her voice rise through my ribs"), and embodied contradiction sits between duty and longing. Micro-choices (wrapping the censer foot, following the beacon) flow from a coherent self. Yet late backstory about Mara risks slipping into summary that dilutes the present-tense cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Inferred Accumulative lens held: every added piece of bronze, driftwood vowel, and salt-stitched silence thickens density toward closure. Each beat adds another layer of loss, culminating in the needle that "settles...in the loss itself"—a crystallized charged poise. The link between censer foot and compass is earned; no teleporting props.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Starlit station as mechanical carcass ("ribbed throat") and salt pan mirrors anchor place and scale without tourist detail. Objects as micro-setting—censer foot becomes pivot, driftwood vowels become compass marks—actively constrain choices and charge the final image under the Q3 gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</question><comment>Dominant stake: chart unchartable grief with no return ticket. Escalation proceeds by accumulation: each soldered wire, each reclaimed word widens the inland absence. Final pressure lands when the needle refuses both water and town—“the loss itself” is the only viable destination, a choice with visible forfeit.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Reverse migration emerges from action, not slogan: the bronze foot migrates backward toward the last intact memory, reconfiguring navigation from rescue to recognition. Theme crystallizes in censer foot accepting the needle’s refusal—no tidy moral, just the quiet charge that mourning is ongoing cartography.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice stays intimate technician, vocabulary of torque and tide, without ornament creep. Lyric compression ("salt mirror…forgot to burn out") taught early; payoff in final "as ash before new incense" shows earned restraint. No head-hop; interior rhythms match external meter of surf rising through stone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Sentences lean, splice-free; cadence bends with moon-pulse. One mixed-metaphor moment ("ribbed throat...wounded animal") flagged but doesn’t occlude the final image clarity. No paraphrase loops, information dense: each noun carries salt, smoke, or rust.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</question>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: maritime salvage meets liturgy meets map-making. The drowned chapel censer foot as compass hinge is unforeseen yet inevitable in this world. No template drift; risk taken with lyric non-linear structure lands under Accumulative lens with legible closure.</comment>
