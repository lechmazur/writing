<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied; the vial cork and whisper-practice anchor contradictory impulses. Mentor’s late-stage silence crystallizes the apprentice’s earned authority, but the mentor’s minimal on-page presence limits relational crucible depth.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of scent, hum, and light intensifies until the freighter’s quiet turn reweights the premise. Closure is a Charged Poise—the room “hums with screaming tenderness”—with visible cost in the mentor’s hushed capitulation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Salt, iron rails, dew-lantern glass, and night-garden perfume are selective, sensuous, and tied to action. The lighthouse itself constrains the final choice: only from its gallery can the scent-map be released to the wind.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—proving whispers outdistance shouts—tightens through escalating sensory tactics; the freighter’s low horn is the earned reversal. Cost is felt in the mentor’s wordless acknowledgment and the apprentice’s spent breath.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of tender attention versus brute force emerges organically from every beat; the final image of “a gentle map of breath” reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext in the captain’s two-finger salute and the mentor’s closed eyes is resonant.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct lyric cadence and perceptual signature—“lantern glass sweats with dew, and each drop is a small ear”—remain controlled under pressure. No head-hopping; focalization stays locked to the apprentice’s sensorium.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is patterned and paid off (“screaming tenderness” returns as earned paradox). No loops or mixed metaphors; every sentence advances atmosphere or stakes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Familiar lighthouse setting is re-envisioned through scent-based navigation and sonic intimacy; the whisper-beacon concept feels inevitable yet fresh. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
