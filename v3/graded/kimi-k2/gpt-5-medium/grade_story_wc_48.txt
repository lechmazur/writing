<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The novelist’s interiority is rich and embodied—e.g., “shell clicked like a whispered metronome”—but the refusal to “sand edges” is asserted rather than dramatized in a decisive beat; the final stance crystallizes without a visible cost that scales to the stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the pact is solemnized, the river chosen, and the closing pages acknowledged. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds; each cameo delivers an emblem that reweights the work’s purpose, and the final image reconfigures options with felt cost—“my pockets bright with offerings.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The mist, reeds, and “contrary thread” of river are not backdrop but active constraints; the nexus itself “rearranged” after the pact, charging the final image. Micro-setting (the shell in pocket, the chill water) constrains the wading choice and the closing cadence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—collecting “shapes of different hopes” before they scatter—is signaled early and tightened when each cameo offers an emblem that forecloses tidy market triumph. The cost is the renunciation of resolution itself; pressure deepens via accretion rather than reversal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: art’s duty to resist commodification and honor fragmentary lives. The final image—“within the closing pages, I wrote them as they wanted to live”—offers a resonant, non-moral answer that reweights the entire text.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Lyric compression and patterned diction are taught by the opening “swirling hush” and sustained; perceptual signature is consistent—e.g., “rust reeds scratched the air.” No head-hopping; the voice modulates with pressure, tightening in the final wade.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and propulsive; figurative language is purposeful and never muddled. Minor scaffold—e.g., “river within the river”—is pattern-taught and paid off. No loops or redundancy in peak beats; final line lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The conceit of a feral nexus where unfinished characters offer emblems is fresh; it synthesizes metafiction and myth without gimmickry. The risk—renouncing resolution—heightens stakes and feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
