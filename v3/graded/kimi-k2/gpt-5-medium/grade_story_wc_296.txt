<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The druid’s guarded calm is embodied in micro-choices—spine rising “like a mast,” treaty whispered to the seed—yet interior contradiction stays muted; the final unbending feels earned but the cost is more conceptual than visceral.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the orchard stills, the mayor breathes the truth, the crowd shifts from spectators to witnesses—cost is felt in the spent seed and the mayor’s tremor; causal chain from raft circles to thawed confession holds cleanly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Swirling orchard-lake is never backdrop; spinning apples, creaking trunks, and black mirrors actively resist or yield to the druid’s circles, constraining every tactical move and charging the final settling into “ordinary halos.”</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—retrieve the frozen confession—tightens through each expanding circle; the seed’s selective hunger forces a trade-off (lie vs. bone of truth) with visible price, though escalation is steady rather than sharply crescendoing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of truth’s refusal to stay buried emerges from the lake’s rebellion and the seed’s hunger; final image of mirrors turned face-down offers non-literal resonance without moralizing, letting ambiguity linger.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinctively textured—“warlike serenity,” “radio hush of words”—with rhythmic control that breathes with scene pressure; no head-hopping, and perceptual signature (cataloging by “ache”) stays consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; metaphors are precise (“starfish of hunger”) and no loops or scaffold intrude; sentence variety supports the escalating hush before the orchard exhales.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fantasy premise feels fresh because the magic is ecological and moral: a lake that refuses complicity, a plant that eats only lies; synthesis of stage-magic failure, arboreal vortex, and forensic druidry is non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
