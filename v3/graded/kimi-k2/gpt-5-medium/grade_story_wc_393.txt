<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Chaplain’s interiority is concrete—his wince at the “thorn” mirroring Jonah’s jaw-clench shows embodied contradiction. Motivation intensifies from listener to active mediator; the final instruction to Jonah is earned by prior causality. Micro-choice—leaving the credit card, accepting the light-debt—reveals value hierarchy with cost. Only minor: secondary characters (Jonah) remain off-page, so relationship crucible is inferred, not dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the ticking heart reconfigures Jonah’s options without guaranteeing freedom; cost is the ongoing choice to “keep time.” Causal lens holds—each beat (thorn removal, oiling, breath) links to the next under chaplain’s goal. Orientation is immediate; no teleporting props. One seamless scene, one transition (shop → prison), stakes tighten to a single decisive image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Antique shop is micro-setting as crucible: brass filings on fingertips, bench lamp sparks constrain the repair ritual. Dust motes and velvet box filter through chaplain’s pastoral gaze, guiding attention to guilt’s texture. Spatial choreography clean—box slid, chair gestured. Weather outside becomes metaphorical instruction, charging final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can apology become livable rhythm?—is signaled early and tightens when chaplain translates repair into moral pedagogy. One meaningful deepening: from fixing a machine to fixing a life. Cost is visible—chaplain’s own emotional thorn, Jonah’s deferred freedom. Agency drives escalation; no coincidence resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: a music box teaches that forgiveness is maintenance, not miracle. Subtext in silence—booth filled with ticking—carries more weight than sermon. Final image reweights premise: heart keeps time, but feet must move. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers in “deserve.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is hushed, deliberate, with ecclesiastical cadence fitting chaplain’s vocation. Perceptual signature—metaphors of storm light, mechanical weather—remains consistent. Dialogue sparse but subtextual: “I listen for lives” vs “patterns.” No head-hopping; POV distance stable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical yet precise: “dust motes swam like slow fish,” “thorn of bent metal that snagged each gear like a doubt.” No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Rhythm modulates—long breaths during repair, clipped ticks at climax. Metaphors cohere under mechanical/spiritual duality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise—clockwork heart as moral metronome—is fresh synthesis of pastoral care and horology. Risk: quiet lyric ending instead of dramatic parole hearing pays off via Charged Poise. Specificity—brass filings, bent metal thorn—prevents generic allegory. Transformation test: story collapses if heart swapped for any other token.</comment>
