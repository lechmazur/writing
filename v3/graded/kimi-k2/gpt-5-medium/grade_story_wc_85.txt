<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction—guilt vs. self-justification—drives every beat; the micro-choice to burn the archives is earned by the watch-hand reveal. Embodied emotion (“ledger aches with forgery”) grounds the POV. Minor slip: the final “almost believed” softens cost slightly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the watch hand reweights the entire past, cost is the salt-soaked surrender of lies. Causal lens holds—each beat because/therefore tightens until the beach confession. No orientation debt; driftwood archive is taught early.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cobalt terrace and Parliament of Wood are not backdrop but archive and courtroom; driftwood planks literally constrain what can be confessed. Sensory hierarchy (salt, dusk, gull-commas) filters through genealogist’s guilt. Final image of tide tearing paper to syllables charges closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth vs. safety—tightens once: the discovery of the fifth plank forces the confession and the burn. Escalation is causal, not coincidental; each forged plank now exacts a visible price. Cost is the public un-naming of the narrator’s own past.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of inherited silence emerges from the driftwood ledger, never stated. Subtext in Mara’s tempered regret and the narrator’s salt-stained vow. Final image of tide syllables offers non-literal answer: memory must be spoken or it dissolves.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature—“sea breathing like a tired archivist,” “gulls stitched small commas”—remains consistent. Compression and elision taught early (“brine and fear went to work”) pay off in the final line. No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates with guilt.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High density, zero loops; figurative language is selective and purposeful. Rhythm accelerates under pressure (“We gathered the true planks and left the forged ones to soak”). One mixed metaphor (“lantern with shutters”) is minor and does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: genealogy as forgery, driftwood as civic archive, watch hand as compass of guilt. Risky lyric compression pays off in closure. No derivative echoes; the Parliament of Wood feels inevitable and singular.</comment>
