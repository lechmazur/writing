<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is textured and embodied; the narrator’s fear of becoming “embalmer rather than nurse” crystallizes the moral tension. Micro-choices—baking initials, lifting the lens—carry visible stakes. The final acceptance of caretaker role is earned through prior causality and felt cost. Minor drift into summary near the end prevents 9.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the narrator’s vow to return seasonally forecloses the option of permanent escape and carries the cost of perpetual responsibility. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of bread → wax → memory tightens until the final image reweights all prior material. No causality breaks; waterfall bowing is earned metaphor.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Grotto city, waterfall mist, and limestone chambers are vivid and selective; each detail constrains action (damp ruins ovens, spray tests endurance). The emerald lens and drifting bread initials function as micro-settings that charge the final image. One minor spatial blur during the stranger’s arrival keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—rescuing dying arts—faces escalating tests: wax too hard, names washing away, lens selecting survivors. Each beat raises the cost of failure; the final vow is a stance crystallization under coherent pressure. Agency remains with the curator; no coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of memory-as-sustenance emerges organically from baking initials and feeding stories. Subtext in the beekeeper’s death and the lens’s selective survival avoids moralizing. Final image of “galleries breathe honeyed mist” offers non-literal resonance that reweights the premise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Distinct curator voice—measured, artifact-minded, quietly anguished—persists under pressure. Syntax modulates with emotional intensity; “salt-tongued, feeling history tug like a hive-slick rope” is character-specific. No POV drift; compression and elision are taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is purposeful and patterned. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances story or atmosphere. One mixed metaphor (“nectar armor, sweet and unbearable”) is minor enough to leave closure untouched.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of post-flood ethnography, edible archives, and opera-glass curation. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The premise would collapse if any element were swapped; specificity anchors universals.</comment>
