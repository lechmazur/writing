<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The violinist’s interiority pulses through embodied choices—bow pressure, pocketed husk, heart-tapped code—creating a credible arc from cautious stealth to open risk. Motive intensifies visibly: “I played softer… strong enough to press a heartbeat’s shape.” The final renunciation of escape for listening lands with felt cost. Minor: statues’ interiority is asserted rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single-scene causal arc holds: because statues police sound, therefore the violinist invents pulse-language; because the orchard responds, therefore statues hesitate; because the crowd hushes, therefore the bridge itself sings. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration—escape becomes attentive presence—priced by the risk of being “uprooted.” Orientation is immediate; no teleporting props.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fog-licked iron, copper-leaf halos, and sap-scent are filtered through the violinist’s tactical attention; each sensory choice constrains volume or signals safety. The locust shell and bridge cables evolve from props to active agents. Spatial choreography is clean; no white-room drift. The orchard’s shift from courtroom to shelter charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reawaken beauty without triggering statues—tightens through each softer note and heartbeat signal. One decisive deepening: the statues’ joints unclench, foreclosing the option of violent suppression. Cost is legible in the risk of being “locked” and the public exposure of the gathered crowd. Agency remains with the violinist; no deus-ex-machina.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from action: beauty is not seized but remembered into being. Subtext pulses in the locust shell—emptiness that keeps singing—and in moss bubbling along stone fingers. Final image of “stone dream[ing] in daylight” reweights the premise without moralizing. Avoids tidy binaries; ambiguity lingers in the city’s mechanical hesitation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Lyric compression is taught early—“fog licks iron like a cautious animal”—and sustained without slippage. Perceptual signature is precise: “resonantly soft,” “branches shifted like listening animals.” No head-hopping; interior access stays violinist-bound. Rhythm modulates with stakes, accelerating under statue gaze, easing into communal hush.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry dual freight—image and tactic—without clutter: “the tone turned weathered, truthful, almost human.” No loops or synonym churn; metaphors stay coherent. Minor elevated diction (“conceptual repricing”) appears only in reflective beats, not under peak pressure. Final cadence breathes cleanly into closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Familiar tropes—enchanted garden, living statues—are reforged through the violinist’s heartbeat code and the locust-shell mute, yielding a non-obvious synthesis. Risk lies in the quiet reversal: not escape but attentive restoration. Specificity of sap-scent and copper-leaf halos anchors universals. The premise commits fully; no late rule changes.</comment>
