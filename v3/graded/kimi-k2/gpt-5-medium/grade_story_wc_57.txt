<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority is textured and embodied; the seed-collector’s patience is dramatized through tactile micro-choices (e.g., “easing its kinks without breaking the tale”). Yet the single on-page character never faces a contradictory impulse strong enough to threaten the mission; the arc is more accumulation than crucible, so the change feels incremental rather than costly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure is a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration: the rope rewrapped, seeds bundled, skiff trimmed—an Earned Stasis that shows the collector’s vigil has ended and the knowledge is secured. Causality is Accumulative/Textural; each knot decoded adds density until the final image crystallizes the cost of attention. Orientation is immediate; no lens drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The golden dock, snow, fog, and fulgurite glass are not backdrop but instruments: the dock’s ticking under snow times the collector’s breath, the glass conducts the rope’s memory. Sensory hierarchy is biased to the collector’s craft—every detail either constrains the coaxing action or recharges the final tableau.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve knowledge before salt and forgetfulness—tightens through each decoded knot; the cost is the collector’s sustained attention and the fisherman’s absence. One meaningful deepening: the splice yields the amphorae method, narrowing options to patience alone. Agency is attention, not reversal, but the price is legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the tension between memory and erosion: knowledge survives only through attentive, embodied practice. The final image of the harbor “keeping us” offers a non-literal answer—stewardship is reciprocal. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in the untold future of the seeds.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with a perceptual signature tuned to granular textures and tidal cadence. Syntax modulates with pressure—long breaths during listening, clipped fragments when knots resist. No POV leakage; the prose itself performs patience.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but never purple; each image does double duty (e.g., “seed husks settle into loam” evokes both patience and burial). Rhythm varies naturally; no loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated diction (“midwife”) is earned by the mythic register.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of rope-knot mnemonics, fulgurite conduit, and seed preservation feels fresh and inevitable. Risk lies in the quiet, accumulative structure, but it pays off in the charged final tableau. No derivative echoes; the coastal guild is rendered as lived practice, not trope.</comment>
