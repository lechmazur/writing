<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The servant’s interiority is concrete and embodied; contradictory impulses—duty vs tenderness—play simultaneously in scene. Micro-choices (humming to the elevator, arranging letters) reveal hierarchy of values with visible cost. The final renunciation—leaving the diary open—earns its poignancy through prior causality. Only a slight excess of lyrical self-diagnosis keeps it from 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the servant’s stance crystallizes when he arranges the letters and answers Mirek aloud. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each floor adds density until the final image reweights the premise with felt cost. No orientation drift; anchors are clear by line 3. One causal seam—how the goggles alone decipher the wheel—remains under-motivated, a hairline slip.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The icebound spire is never mere backdrop; its frost, ladders, and elevator throat constrain movement and shape tactics. The goggles and diary function as micro-setting extensions that charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective, filtered through the servant’s urgent priorities. Only the sketch of “cathedral that forgot applause” edges toward ornament without new constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Dominant stake—retrieve vs re-home the letters—tightens once when the servant realizes the shelves hold unsent grief. Pressure grows accumulatively with each floor; the final act forecloses the option to hoard the letters. Cost is visible: the servant accepts custodianship without possession. The cipher reveal feels slightly external, blunting full agency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: joy as stewardship of pain. Subtext lives in gesture—the open diary, the shared shelf—never in exposition. The final line reframes the entire ascent without moralizing. Mirek’s last entry risks a whisper of thesis, but the servant’s spoken reply grounds it in earned experience.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct, lyric yet precise; the servant’s perceptual signature filters every image through tactile cold and borrowed breath. Syntax modulates with emotional rise; no head-hopping. Occasional compression (“notes where words and weather trade shirts”) is taught early and paid off. Only one near-cliché—“throat clearing before confession”—detracts.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image, emotion, and forward motion. Metaphors are coherent and fresh (“snow seeding from above becomes a slow confetti”). No loops or scaffold. A single mixed metaphor—“fish learning air is another kind of river”—momentarily muddies physics but recovers.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The icebound spire, encrypted diary, and servant’s gentle mission synthesize into a fresh emotional architecture. Tropes—lost logbook, haunted ascent—are transformed through specificity of voice and cost. The final image of the open diary reconfigures the reader’s understanding of joy itself. Risk is high but coherence never falters.</comment>
