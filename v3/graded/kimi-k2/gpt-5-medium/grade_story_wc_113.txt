<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is embodied and specific—shivering shins, cradling the program—yet the final choice to conduct silence feels slightly under-motivated; the baton’s significance arrives late, so the cost is legible but not fully earned by prior causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the baton raised, water lifting, portrait softening—an unmistakable reconfiguration of the drowning loop with felt cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds; each image thickens until the final silence conducts itself.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Flooded boards, swollen curtain, lantern constellations—every detail constrains movement and charges the final image; the pocket “no architect would claim” becomes the crucible where silence is staged.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—unravel the ghost’s code—tightens when the program’s stains become a score of rests; the cost is the choice to step only on glints, risking re-drowning. One decisive intensification suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: music lives in the between, and only by inhabiting silence can the loop be broken. The final image of the house “resting” reweights all prior motifs without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Voice is a hushed, lyric instrument—selective, sensory, haunted; syntactic rhythm mirrors the slow lift of water. No head-hopping; every perception is filtered through the musician’s cold awe.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet limpid: “beads throw constellations,” “paint smoothing like skin.” No loops or mixed metaphors; each sentence advances image or stakes. Final cadence breathes with earned hush.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: drowned opera house as score, water damage as notation, silence as conductor. Risky lyric structure pays off in a closure that feels inevitable yet unforeseeable.</comment>
