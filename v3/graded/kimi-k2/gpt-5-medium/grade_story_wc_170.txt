<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and embodied ("felt tremor in my ribs"; "borrowed heartbeat kept a different tempo") and choices under pressure (breathe to match drip, sing coded lullaby) align with goals. Cost visibly felt when reflection changes from defeat to open window. No stock introspection or label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is valid Resonant Reconfiguration—borrowed heartbeat and mirrors arrive at concordance, window opened, stance crystallized with cost (possibilities replace resignation). Lens is Accumulative/Textural: escalating sensory density (drip, color, song) toward charged final image. One fluid scene; orientation anchored early.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Terrace, prism parapet, mirror studio all constrain movement and choice; prism’s color paths physically guide toward door. Mirror garden reprises environment as internal map. Final window shot reweights earlier closed setting with outdoor light.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake: persuade mirrors to show possibility–intensifies each beat (rejection→instruction→image of citrus & shared hands). Micro turn at instruction moment; cost legible when hospital pallor yields, stakes deepen without external reversals. Stakes internal and driven by agency.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: borrowed heartbeat + illusions vs honest futures. Never labeled; culminates in final non-literal image “I saw my own reflection reach out and open the window”. Resonates without moral; complexity preserved.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Distinct perceptual signature: rain-damp stone vocabulary, light-breath sync metaphorics. Rhythm tightens during instruction lines: short, musically spaced clauses. Dialogue sparse yet textured—mirrors / tune / stay—each weighted under pressure. No POV drift.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose breathes with the beat: sentence length modulates through pressure pulses. Sparse redundancy; only minor filter-verb cloudings (“I sensed”) not clustering. Strong nouns (citrus, dancer’s turn) carry density. Final line crystallizes without clutter or artifact.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Synthesizes familiar heart-transplant tale with quiet magic of mirror-coaxed futures; inversion feels inevitable. Specific coastal-city dusk light and coded children’s tunes make it non-generic. Tone risk is intentional and rewarded; world logic stays consistent.</comment>
