<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is textured and embodied; the dweller’s contradictory wish to remain unseen yet serve is dramatized through micro-choices like retreating behind the stack. The final renunciation—etching an arrow instead of stepping forward—earns its cost from prior causality. Only the girl’s interiority is sketched lightly, keeping the piece within single-POV bounds.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the dweller’s invisibility is reweighted from isolation to chosen service, cost paid by permanent self-erasure. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each sensory beat tightens the sapphire hush until the tape’s stillness crystallizes meaning. No orientation drift; anchors are clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The library’s ducts, cedar cache, and failing constellation of lights constrain every move; the grate, atlas case, and tape reel act as micro-settings that shape tactics. Final image of sunrise on bindings recharges the initial “sapphire hush” with earned warmth. Spatial choreography is exact; no floating rooms.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to help without being seen—tightens when the girl’s need forces the dweller to risk exposure. One decisive turn: placing the notebook within reach then retreating. Cost is the permanent forfeiture of direct acknowledgment; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of invisible caretaking emerges through concrete acts; no moralizing. The final arrow etched in dust offers a non-literal answer: presence can travel without visibility. Subtext in the tape’s “moth-colored murmurs” and cedar breath carries the emotional aftereffect.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is distinct—velvet syntax, dustlavender diction, rhythmic hush that modulates with tension. No head-hopping; POV remains locked to the dweller’s sensorium. Compression and patterned elision (“body a letter folded to fit”) are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet limpid; every line advances atmosphere or choice. Metaphors are precise—tape “singing a faint itch,” “windows breathed a failing constellation.” No loops or scaffold; sentence rhythm mirrors the crawl’s stealth. One mixed metaphor (“heart big as a boiler”) is minor.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise of a benevolent crawl-space cartographer is fresh; tropes of invisible helper and found object are transformed through sensory specificity and ethical restraint. Risk in lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
