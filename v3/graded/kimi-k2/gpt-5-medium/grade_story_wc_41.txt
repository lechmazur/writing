<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied—salt counting him, chalk ticking like a metronome—but the final renunciation (“loved them for it”) is more stated than dramatized; the contradictory impulse to both remember and forget is present yet not fully crystallized in a single visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the prophet resets driftwood for a self who will not recognize them, a resonant reconfiguration with felt cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of fog, chalk, echo layers until the final shawl of tide reweights the premise.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fog sculpture garden is not backdrop but instrument: tide lifts the driftwood compass, salt counts the prophet, barnacled eyelids keep “the rain of years.” Environment constrains every micro-choice and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</question>
<comment>Dominant stake—capturing the sound of aging—tightens once when the prophet accepts he will forget this hour; driftwood arrows rearrange like a clock refusing backward, a visible price that forecloses retrieval.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</question>
<comment>Theme of memory-as-tide emerges through concrete particulars: chalk lines fading, videotape static, laughter wearing a limp. Final image of fog-shawl possession offers non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</question>
<comment>Voice is unmistakable—salt-thread, gull-stitch, rust-hum—compressed syntax mirrors the prophet’s porous cognition. Patterned elision (“empty year, then another”) is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; occasional stacked metaphors (“filament humming between ribs”) risk overwriting but never stall momentum. No loops or scaffold; final third remains clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</question>
<comment>Premise—precognitively forgetful prophet mapping tomorrow for a self who will not know—feels inevitable yet wholly fresh. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes without obscuring closure.</comment>
