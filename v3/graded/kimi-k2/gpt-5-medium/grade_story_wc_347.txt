<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The caretaker’s grief-rooted obligation and embodied salt-spray endurance ring true; every micro-choice (walking without touching, coaxing doorways) is tethered to the orchard’s thorned halo. The mother and boy exist mainly as catalysts, so relationship crucible is thin, yet the caretaker’s interior contradiction—yearning to leave while tightening roots—drives the final renunciation with visible cost: “the orchard loosened its hold, just a little.”</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the caretaker’s return to the rows reconfigures the endless loop with felt cost—“before the night frost forms, I will find them; afterward, the orchard will find me.” Causality under an Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each salt-salt-salt repetition and root-hum tightens the pattern until the final image crystallizes the bargain.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cliffside labyrinth, brass birds, and salt-drunk trees are never backdrop; they actively pressure tactics—paths shift, birds shear corridors, lichen maps burn. The orchard’s memory of a lost city is the literal constraint that the caretaker assembles into escape routes. Environment, body, and tool converge in the nut-lock moment, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—guiding travelers before frost—tightens once when the horn announces early frost, forcing hurried improvisation. Agency is caretaker’s endurance and renunciation; the cost is renewed captivity. Pressure escalates via Accumulative density: salt taste, ticking wings, tightening roots, until the final beat reweights the loop.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of cyclical obligation versus fleeting mercy emerges through concrete particulars—roots, salt, nut, frost—without moralizing. The orchard’s “graceless beauty” reconfigures in the last line, offering resonant ambiguity: cliffs “hold their breath.” Subtext lives in gesture and silence; the boy’s nut promise is felt, not explained.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; salt-spray diction and rhythmic control (“licked the wind,” “thorned halo”) remain consistent under pressure. Compression and elision are taught early (“impressions without touching”) and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is caretaker’s compass-body.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences do double duty—description advances stakes, metaphor carries weight (“apple turned inside out and showed its wooden bones”). No loops or scaffold; each image is new and purposeful. Occasional elevated diction (“graceless beauty”) is earned by voice context.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Familiar cursed-garden trope is transformed by salt-spray physics, mechanical birds, and caretaker’s root-bond. The nut-key and blueprint-memory feel inevitable yet fresh. Risky lyric density heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; final image of cliffs holding breath is non-obvious synthesis.</comment>
