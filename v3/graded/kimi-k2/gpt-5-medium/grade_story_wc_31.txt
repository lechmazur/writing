<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Gorgeous interiority and embodied emotion early; passivity creeps in underwater section—choices are more drift than deliberate reversal. Voice is specific, but agency thins at climax where cost is more epiphany than earned trade-off.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands: leaving a vow to keep lighting without fatigue creates an earned stasis with visible existential cost. Drive lens holds—lyric accumulative; every luminescent page turn reweights the premise until the silver hum reconfigures meaning.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Salt-furred books, kelp curtains, and sinking lantern-ash render the micro-setting tactile; the library’s breathing pressure steers the vow-making moment. Environment isn’t backdrop—it tightens the protagonist’s metronomic surrender.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Stakes—“discover sound’s color”—stay abstract until the silver thaw visibly stains heartbeat; one deepening beat suffices. Pressure coheres lyrically; absence of on-page risk beyond patience keeps score shy of peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from luminous promises and sonic silver, not assertion; final vow reconfigures lamplighter’s future without tidy moral. Lingers in quiet ache: tending brightness others see first.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Lyrical compression, rhythmic tide-like syntax, and perceptual signature (“meteor hush,” “temporary birds”) remain controlled under weightless pressure. No POV leakage; voice is singular, compressed, and ocean-dark.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Sentences breathe with dive-and-surface cadence; density is purposeful, though occasional pearl-overload (“nacre, algae remembering lightning”) skirts overwriting. Read-aloud ear test passes—momentum never stalls.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Transforms familiar “lightkeeper finds magic library” through underwater sonics and the unheard color of sound; risk is high but grounded in sensory specificity. Synthesis feels inevitable, though echoes of Calvino faintly visible.</comment>
