<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The analytical performer’s internal calibration—tuning probabilities, cataloging glances—creates consistent micro-choices that tighten the stakes; the reflexive decision to invite the girl to still her flashlight until the tide answers crystallizes agency and cost with embodying precision.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The accumulative lens holds: randomness is ordered, chaos picks from arranged options, and causality is evident in every echoing coin plink. Closure lands as a bishop balanced on a coin—a Charged Poise that legibly narrows the janitor from silence to resigned speech, closing the beat with audible cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Narrow arcade ribs act as cathedral constraints; moonlit wet shadows double as moving chess squares. The bishop’s mirrored diagonal on the water actively warps choice and supplies a spatial cue that alters the janitor’s final reach minutes later.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—serenading monotony—escalates through increasingly loaded coin setups and a single decisive reweighting when the bishop settles on the janitor’s fingertip, foreclosing his silence with visible grief cost under rising tide.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the diagonals—motion rarely straight, luck rehearsed—without exposition. The final reprise of the bishop in the moonwater performs a Conceptual Repricing that reweights the entire tide-ritual: creativity is no escape but an acceptance of consequence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature—mathematical probabilities laced with salt-rust detail—and verbally fluid compression under accordion strain. Compression is pattern-taught early; payoff arrives in the quiet bishop-to-coin skim across water without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyric density is purposeful and propulsive: each sentence layers atmosphere, choice, or sensory charge without loops. Lines like “branches that hum” and “comet algebra” advance both texture and stakes; ending line “the tide that learned restraint” crystallizes closure with rhythmic cadence and conceptual price.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis—probability magician in tidal arcade—feels singular; no template equivalent. The orbital drift of the bishop under stars and moonwater offers a fresh reconfiguration that risks sentimentality yet commits fully to its premise, compounding cost through grief-consequence.</comment>
