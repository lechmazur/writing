<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction and embodied emotion are consistently demonstrated (“hand trembles with responsibility,” “fear that hinges will be misused”). Micro-choice to choose a hinge over a wall crystallizes values at stake, though the cost is more conceptual than visceral.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands through Charged Poise: the decision to inscribe the hinge-shaped canal plan reweights the future without yet moving ink. Cause-and-effect linkage holds—predictive-model beads migrate to the canal because the narrator consciously reframes constraints under pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Obsidian spire, kingfisher over ice, prism lamp, glass beads—these are never scenery. The lake’s thaw literally steers the hinge metaphor (“reading fractures”), while the feather reappears to enforce the final choice. Setting constrains and charges until the last line.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—“I must write the future without lies”—clarifies by the second beat. Pressure tightens once: from three locked architectural futures to the canal design that invites stewardship and risk. The price is surrendering purity of control and accepting stewardship ambiguity.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The theme of sustainable innovation as care emerges from images, not assertion: bird reading fracture lines, workshops as tide schools, hinges vs. walls. Final image re-prices the premise—transformation must walk—and carries ethical weight without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Lyrical density taught in first two sentences persists. Occasional academic register (“predictive modeling”) is owned by occupation, not imposed. No head hops; perceptual signature remains precise—“glass beads of probability,” “singing shutters.”</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Metaphor is purposeful, never ornamental; “snow scratched the windows like a quill testing paper” does triple duty. Zero loops or paraphrase drag. Final paragraph’s cadence mirrors thawing ice and deliberate restraint, guiding reader breath to choice.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>“Ignorance cartographer” re-frames library design as cartography of voids; predictive-model beads become narrative devices, not tech garnish. Structural risk—narrative architecture designed like canals rather than towers—pays off in coherence. Specificity of hinge-workshops prevents template echo.</comment>
