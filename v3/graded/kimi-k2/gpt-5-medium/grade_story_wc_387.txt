<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied; the net-mender’s motive to “appreciate hidden effort” is dramatized through micro-choices (whistle, tea ritual, gifting whisk). The final renunciation—handing the whisk to the child—earns its cost by prior pattern of patience and tenderness. Minor slip: the councilor’s shift feels slightly expedient rather than fully pressured.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (rain, fireflies, froth) tightens the communal attention until the final image reweights the town’s stance. Closure is a Charged Poise—the shared silence after naming invisible labor—felt cost is the dawn’s advance and the whisk’s transfer. No causality breaks; pattern taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Whispering parapet, runoff channels, and firefly constellations are vivid, selective, and integrated into action; the wet stones literally guide the mender’s nightly route and later constrain the crowd’s footing. Final image of lichen-softened stone recharges earlier “effort’s invisibility.” Micro-setting (tea bowl as porcelain cove) functions as charged object.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Dominant stake—making the town see unseen labor—escalates through sensory accumulation and communal micro-choices (councilor drying stones, crowd squatting). One decisive tightening: the collective silence after naming ghosts of labor. Cost is the whisk’s loss and the dawn’s irrevocable arrival.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of valuing invisible effort emerges organically from concrete acts (mending nets, wiping moss, naming night sweeper). Final image of fireflies in tea foam offers non-literal, resonant answer without moralizing. Subtext in gestures (councilor’s lowered head, child’s bow) deepens the reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct lyric voice with controlled compression; perceptual signature filters every detail through the mender’s patient, tactile worldview. Rhythm modulates with pressure—long breaths during reflection, clipped beats during whistle and pour. No POV drift; diction stays within plausible lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Prose is dense yet clear; figurative language serves pattern (nets, tides, lanterns) without overwriting. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Occasional elevated diction (“scintillatingly somber”) is earned by voice consistency.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: net-mending as philosophy, tea whisk as lighthouse, fireflies as choir—each trope transformed through grounded labor. Risky quiet demonstration pays off in communal shift. Specificity (moonlit rope, lichen underfoot) anchors universals; removal of any core image would collapse the whole.</comment>
