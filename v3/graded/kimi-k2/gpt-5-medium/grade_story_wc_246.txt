<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“tastes like rusted tools and early frost”), but the final shift from guilt to acceptance leans on Del’s guidance rather than a fully earned micro-choice; the pen ritual is more symbolic than causally decisive.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the addendum retroactively seeds the farm, reweighting the premise with undeniable social cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of listening, editing, and harvest culminates in the shimmering timeline that reconfigures meaning.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The Quiet’s gravity tides warp clocks and tea, constraining the final act of writing; the station’s slow precession mirrors the narrator’s avoidance. Micro-setting (scrap paper resisting the pen) charges the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—trading guilt for knowledge—tightens when the broadcast’s apology forces the narrator to confront the bad seeds. One meaningful deepening: the pen’s amber memory becomes the lever that edits history, with visible cost in the retroactive seed shipment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of editing-as-neighborliness emerges through particulars (pen, terraces, treaty) without moralizing. Final image of “a blanket that remembers several winters” offers resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of forgiveness.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature—“confidently uncertain,” wary of declarations—threads every observation. Rhythm modulates with pressure: short, breathless clauses under gravity shifts, longer lyrical stretches during reflection. No head-hopping; voice remains coherent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language (“constellations as verbs”) is selective and purposeful. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances stakes or atmosphere. Final line “manual for ladders” crystallizes without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of gravitational anomaly as editorial workspace; the pen-as-treaty-device transforms a familiar trope. Risk-taking in retroactive causality pays off: the seed shipment already in orbit feels inevitable yet surprising.</comment>
