<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“walls between hearts,” “weight less than grief”), but the inspector’s shift from auditor to conduit is slightly under-motivated; the pearl’s warmth and the shell’s voices supply enough pressure to justify the renunciation, yet the emotional cost is more asserted than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the pearl’s placement rewrites the bunker’s purpose from isolation to communion. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each etched confession threads into the final light-web—while the cost (loss of inspector’s certifying authority) is legible in the silent signature.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The crystal caves are not backdrop but instrument: quartz spire as crowning point, shell-etched voices as spatialized memory. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (“patient lace of ghost rivers”), and the setting directly constrains the climactic choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—seal or unseal the bunker—tightens once: the directive “crown the chosen point” forces a visible trade-off. Pressure escalates via the shell’s confessions, each a filament narrowing options until the inspector’s hesitation becomes the decisive beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of communal repair emerges organically from the shell’s spiral archive; no moralizing, only the final image of “a door made of faces.” The pearl’s dimming invests the concept with felt cost, reweighting safety as shared vulnerability.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet disciplined, with a distinct perceptual signature (“stone listened harder than any living ear”). Compression and elision are taught early and paid off in the hush that travels outward. No head-hopping; POV remains anchored in the inspector’s sensorium.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; metaphors are coherent and scene-driven. Minor loop risk in “resonant hush” repetition is offset by rhythmic variation. No artifacts in the closure beat; final image crystallizes cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses post-apocalyptic audit with lyric archaeology; the seashell archive feels inevitable yet fresh. Risk-taking (bureaucratic ritual transmuted into communal rite) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
