<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is embodied and specific; the handler’s trembling hands, the chameleon’s color shift, and the micro-choice to “take only what refuses to heal” all reveal layered motives. The final renunciation—shedding ornament to keep kindness readable—earns its cost through prior causality. Minor slip: the broker’s betrayal is summarized rather than dramatized, blunting the flaw’s bite.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the tail tip and brochure become twin relics that reweight the premise, and the cost—public exposure and self-audit—is legible in the letter to donors. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density increases via the stripped terrarium and the mist’s counsel until the final stillness. No causality breaks; orientation is anchored early.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The misty workshop under stars is not backdrop; its exhalations mirror the handler’s doubt and the chameleon’s shifting hues, constraining the choice to work in hushed precision. Micro-setting—the terrarium stripped of toys—functions as crucible. One minor drift: “panels of the roof darkened and then clarified” feels ornamental rather than instrumental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—rebuilding trust after fraud—is signaled early and tightens when the handler chooses radical transparency over further spin. The meaningful turn is the decision to invite donors to witness night repairs; the cost is public shame and sleepless labor. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of integrity through vulnerability emerges from the handler’s tactile choices, never sermonized. The tail tip and brochure as “relics of belief” reprice the concept of certainty without a moral tagline. Final image—the covered terrarium in thinning mist—offers resonant, non-literal answer to how trust might regrow.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded in veterinary precision: “tongue flicked, tasting air like a prayer.” Syntax modulates with stress—short clauses during the cut, longer breaths afterward. No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains consistent. One elevated phrase—“quietly vivid”—edges toward poetic self-consciousness but is earned by pattern.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers action, tool, and emotion. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is selective. The phrase “motive is a luxury when creatures bleed” is sharp and character-bound. Minor register drift in “conceptual repricing” is offset by immediate sensory grounding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Familiar rescue-narrative tropes are transformed through the veterinary micro-gesture and the fraud aftermath. The chameleon’s tail as omened seed feels fresh; the stripped terrarium as moral stance is non-obvious. Risk in lyric compression pays off without obscuring clarity.</comment>
