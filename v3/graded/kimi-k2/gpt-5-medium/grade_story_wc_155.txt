<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied; the artist’s micro-choice to “project the damaged scenes onto fog and walls” crystallizes motive and stakes. The fresco fragment functions as a charged object that re-weights the final image, though the shift from solitary to communal creation feels slightly under-motivated in one beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the looping film wreath re-weights the orchard’s memory and the artist’s stance toward joy. Causality holds; the knowledge-network pulse and communal repaint tighten the texture toward the final charged image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fog as studio, stump as tripod, fresco shard as color key—each constrains choices and charges the ending. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through the artist’s perceptual bias; the orchard’s “citrus ghosts” and “pewter ladders” evolve with the light-painted festival.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover lost joy—tightens when damaged film forces reliance on communal memory; the cost is the artist relinquishing sole authorship. One clear deepening beat: the mirror-maker’s suggestion to reverse the last frame narrows options and re-weights the parade into an invitation loop.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: memory is collaborative, laughter needs structure. The final image of the revolving wreath offers a non-literal answer—joy is a shared ribbon in fog—without moralizing. Subtext in gestures (“turn your palms like sails”) carries the thematic weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct lyric voice, painterly perception, rhythmic control. Patterned elision (“I paint with light, bending it as if brush and breath”) is taught early and paid off. No head-hopping; focalization remains tight to the artist’s sensorium.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>High information density, zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful and pattern-taught; no mixed metaphors. Line-level propulsion matches the accumulative cadence; the final “ribbon in the fog” lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: memory-restoration via communal light-painting in a fog-orchard. Tropes (lost festival, magic film) are transformed through specific sensory labor and the fresco shard’s color key. Risky lyric structure stays legible under the accumulative lens.</comment>
