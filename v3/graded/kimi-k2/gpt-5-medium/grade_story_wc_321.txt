<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid ("broom bristles in the spilled starlight dust") and the choice to keep the tide is earned. Yet the deckhand’s contradictory impulses are mostly narrated rather than dramatized in real time, and the captain’s single nod is the only on-page status shift.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the ferry “steadied” and arrivals no longer vanish. Causality is lyric-accumulative; the lattice alignment and hourglass flip tighten the pattern with felt cost. Orientation is deliberately dreamlike but taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The spectral grotto’s star-varnished water and dripping letters anchor every subsequent choice; the mirrored constellations literally supply the pattern the protagonist must align. Spatial choreography is clear, sensory hierarchy tight, and the setting constrains the final maneuver.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—ending the ferry’s vanishing—is signaled early and escalates through the grotto lattice test. The tightening beat is the deliberate drift under dripping letters; the cost is the irreversible choice to keep the tide’s undertow. Pressure remains coherent under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme of permanence-in-transience emerges from the ferry’s paradox and the hourglass’s star-dust reversal. Subtext lives in gesture (commuters pocketing tickets like pocket-watches) rather than statement. Final image reweights prior absences without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric, compressed, and consistent—“river pretended to flow uphill” teaches the pattern immediately. Perceptual signature is distinct: clocks, dew, frost timetables. No head-hopping; the captain’s single line carries subtext. Rhythm modulates with pressure, accelerating during the lattice alignment.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive—“wake inscribed a lattice on the current” does triple work. Occasional lyric excess (“beehive of calendars”) flirts with overwriting but never stalls momentum. No loops or scaffold; grammar and tense are clean.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Premise of a vanishing commuter ferry steered by star-patterned wakes is fresh and fully committed. The hourglass counting “nothing” until starlight dust arrives transforms a familiar object. Risky dream-logic pays off in a resonant, inevitable image.</comment>
