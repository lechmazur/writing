<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade></grade><comment>Lucid, relentlessly interior voice reveals an architect of uncertainty whose reluctance is a tense stance rather than a trait. The coin-caster’s renunciation becomes the story’s engine, bending causality upside-down so that every choice is already its own echo.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Three-prophecy countdown—turn the dome, distill noise, trust the blind toss—creates tight backward causality. Each beat narrows options until a final charged poise readies the universe itself to exhale through the dome.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ambered observatory decks and featherlight coins are handled, spun, aimed; setting becomes both tool and pressure gauge. Spatial choreography is flawless.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes escalate as each fulfilled clause of the backwards prophecy compels the next dare. Cost is legible: breath metronomes notice that the dome turns.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme crystallizes as the price of knowing too much backwards: the cost is surrender to randomness. The final image re-codes memory itself.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyric compression holds without losing orientation. Pattern of amber/snow/coins is taught early and pays off in the closing aperture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose oscillates between incantatory denseness and surgical clarity; every line tightens towards the aperture. No wasted scaffolding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>“Backwards prophecy” and coin-casting turn familiar sci-fi into cosmic ritual; specific physical stakes prevent it from feeling gimmicky.</comment>
