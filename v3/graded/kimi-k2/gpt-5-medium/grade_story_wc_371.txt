<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lyrical interiority gives the lone character texture, but the second character arrives so late that their relationship never becomes a crucible; motivations hold steady and renunciation is quietly earned at the end.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Charged Poise: the shared bread & sweeping seeds crystallize “no miracle, only careful company.” Because/therefore links stay causal throughout; the new partnership feels inevitable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Ivy, lacquer, crumbs and cracked sill are specific, tactile, and the courtyard constraints force pruning & placement choices that directly charge the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—atonement through tending & witness—intensifies as each act of gentle clearing and feeding narrows the future; the cost is visible in the shared tears, crumbs, and seeding.</comment>

<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Theme of memory as slow witness emerges from the acts of carrying bread, sweeping crumbs, and pressing seeds; the final line reweights the premise without a sermon.</comment>

<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature— “creeping normality noticer,” lists of surrenders, careful hand imagery—remains distinct and rhythmically controlled; compression and lyric syntax serve pressure rather than obscure it.</comment>
<question>7</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Line-level craft is supple but twice indulges lush metaphor clusters within single beats (“moss and etiquette… one tender slice…”), a minor overwrite that holds the reader a fraction long.</comment>
<question>8</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The conceit of a guerrilla-gardening liturgy inside ruined grandeur is fresh and understated; the reversal of ghosts as co-tenders rather than haunts feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
