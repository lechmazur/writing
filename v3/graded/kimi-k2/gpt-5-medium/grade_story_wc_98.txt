<comment>The fantasy reality checker’s interiority is lucid and purpose-specific; contradictions between skepticism and hope feel embodied. His micro-choices—planting the seed, kneeling, recording contours—reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. Final renunciation is earned: he relinquishes the island’s dependency on him and accepts the tree’s autonomy, a felt cost scaled to the ridge.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Hybrid lens (Accumulative/Textural dominant at closure). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the seed’s sprouting recalibrates what the island remembers and how it listens. Montage and sensory accumulation reweight the premise; the final light “sorts myth from memory,” recharging earlier motifs with conceptual cost. No causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Specific locality—the ridge line, hibiscus archivists, salt tasting—constrains action (where to plant, how to anchor the tree). Pollen as archivist tape and “earth that kneels” charge the closure image. Micro-setting (the sleeping ear) becomes conclusive soil that alters outcome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: prevent cultural memory erosion. Tightening is textural (scent testimony shifts with humidity; monsoon fist at horizon narrows planting window). No perfect reversals, but luminous doubt forecloses passive waiting and crystallizes the act of planting—cost is rain counting its victims—earned via prior causality.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through particulars: the tension between certainty (myth) and porous memory (humidity), resolved by planting the seed where “doubt is luminous.” No moralizing final paragraph; closure image of pelican wings spelling names offers conceptual repricing that lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Vibrationally compressed sensory voice— “petals debate like cautious jurors,” “pollen coats my fingers”— never sags into filler. POV modesty holds; montage compression accelerates toward the planting beat. Rhythms echo tide shells and heartbeat style without losing compass clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud texture is musical and precise; figurative language is filtered through POV bias, avoiding metaphor muddle. One minor loop (“pollen coats… pollen shall” near midpoint) but paid off with light-thread payoff. High density lines do more than one job, propelling without purple prose.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Synthesis of lyric environmentalism and myth-ballast feels inevitable. Fresh inflections: scent-as-chronicle shift with humidity, hibiscus as archivists. Luminous doubt tone that crystallizes without cliché. Risk distinction earned: renunciation of vigilante-hero role is a non-obvious lift that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
