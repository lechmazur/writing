<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is textured and embodied; the chip, ants, and doorway all refract the narrator’s ambivalence between stasis and choice. The final step across the ant-bridge crystallizes a credible renunciation with felt cost. Minor slip: “empirically intuitive” is asserted more than dramatized in Ruth’s absence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the hallway of mirrors reconfigures the promise into daily practice, cost visible in the creek’s tug and the chip’s retained weight. Causal chain from receipt → ants → seam → mirror → step is tight; no orientation drift. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is selective and sensorily rich; the cavern’s impossible bloom and rising creek constrain the final choice. Micro-objects—chip, ants, petals—function as setting extensions that charge the ending. One minor spatial blur: exact relation of cavern mouth to creek level could be crisper.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will the narrator cross the doorway or retreat?—is signaled early and tightened by rising water and mirrored futures. One decisive turn: stepping into overlap forecloses map-bound safety with visible wet cost. Escalation is coherent under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of promises as iterative, observable choices emerges through concrete particulars (ants, petals, chip) without moralizing. Final image reweights the premise: the promise is not fulfilled but transformed into daily practice. Subtext in the chip’s retained weight is resonant and non-literal.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent; perceptual signature filters every detail through map-dealer precision. Syntax modulates with pressure—short clauses under creek rise, longer riffs in reflection. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is purposeful and patterned. Minor loop: “promise pull tight like a knot behind my ribs” echoes earlier “promise had not ended” but momentum survives. No artifacts in closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses antique maps, typography, and ant navigation into a fresh, non-obvious synthesis. The doorway of decisions as mirrored topographies feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric compression pays off without clarity loss.</comment>
