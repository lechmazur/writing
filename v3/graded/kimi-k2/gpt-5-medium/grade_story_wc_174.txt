<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sorin’s interior contradiction—urbane polish vs. raw guilt—drives every micro-choice; the moment his hands feel “like tools for theft” crystallizes the flaw. The woman’s arrival and her command of the stick externalize the cost, forcing a credible renunciation. Only the serenity trait stays ornamental, never tested under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the troupe’s method is reversed, applause withheld, and the cost is the surrender of narrative control. Causal chain holds—argument → guilt → promise → woman’s edit → open-door performance—without gaps. The dome’s acoustic hush reconfigures meaning in the final listening silence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The decommissioned dome’s curved shell and echoing acoustics literally amplify the ethical stakes; the scaffolding ribs become the new stage braces. Sensory detail is selective—moonlit vellum, chalk-mark footsteps—filtered through Sorin’s heightened guilt. The setting constrains the final choice: low lights, open doors, no applause.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether ethical storytelling can survive exploitative method—is signaled in the argument and tightened when Sorin vows to “remove my fingerprints.” The woman’s demand turns the punchline back on power, forcing a visible trade-off: applause is forfeited for shared authorship. Cost is legible in the final hush.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the reversal of puppeteer and audience, never sermonized. The half-lit epiphanies reweight from stolen laughter to collective listening; the final image of no-applause hush offers a resonant, non-moral answer. Subtext lives in gesture—offering the stick in silence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct lyric texture—“meteor hush,” “puddle of moon”—remains consistent under pressure. Compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; POV stays locked to Sorin’s selective perception, degrading appropriately under guilt.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and motive. Occasional lyric excess (“fish moving upstream”) is earned by pattern. No loops or scaffold; rhythm modulates with emotional crests.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The puppet-show-as-ethical-mirror premise is fresh, and the reversal of performer/audience feels inevitable in hindsight. Specificity—radar dome acoustics, vellum moon—grounds the concept. Risky open-door performance lands without gimmickry.</comment>
