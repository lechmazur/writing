<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is concrete—her “softly deliberate gait,” the river stone as weight, the tug of vines—yet the decisive sacrifice of her stored dreams feels slightly abstract; we sense the cost but not the full contradiction inside her. The flaw of over-empathy is consistent and drives the climax, but the moment of renunciation is narrated more than embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: Mira’s luminous regret poured into the soil reattaches Ilen’s shadow and inks her name into the sky—a Resonant Reconfiguration with visible price. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds; pattern of dream-exchange tightens stakes without causal reversals. Orientation is immediate and the final image reweights all prior motifs.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The blooming library is never mere backdrop; vines tighten aisles, petals fall like applause, and the soil literally drinks dreams—environment constrains tactics and charges the final image. Sensory selection is biased through Mira’s dusk-trained perception, keeping detail purposeful and urgent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“preserve the shape of hope”—is signaled early and tightened once: the library’s jealousy threatens balance until Mira trades her private futures. Agency is hers; coincidence complicates but does not resolve. Cost is felt in the emptied dream-casing glowing like unbuilt rooms.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of hope as cultivated, costly stewardship emerges from concrete acts—pouring dreams into soil, anchoring shadows—not from statement. Final petal-storm applause offers non-literal resonance that reweights the premise without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet disciplined; patterned elision (“shadow entered first and did not attach”) is taught early and paid off. Syntax mirrors Mira’s deliberate cadence; no head-hopping. Distinct perceptual signature—“listening to colors fade”—persists under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; figurative language is selective and purposeful. No loops or scaffold; each image advances atmosphere or stakes. Occasional elevated diction (“testimony that patience can sculpt gentler futures”) stays within Mira’s reflective register.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The premise—dreams as shareable, shadows as detachable scholars—feels inevitable in hindsight, not gimmicky. Risky lyric accumulation pays off in the final reconfiguration. Transformation test: the emotional arc collapses if library, stone, or dream-exchange is altered.</comment>
