<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The blind mapmaker’s tactile perception, interior contradiction, and embodied reaction to ring-cold anchor character throughout; his final kneel-and-touch micro-choice crystallizes “keep listening” into an earned reconfiguration with visible cost on the ring’s sudden silence. No unmotivated epiphanies—every realization is built from earlier sensory data.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: pressure deepens via layer of musical notes culminating in a cadence-shift closure—the ring’s stop-hum reweights all prior ultrasonic data into a resonant Reconfiguration bearing felt cost. All earlier ellipses resolve at this stillpoint.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</question><comment>Ultrasonic forest’s glass-string vault physically pressures the traverse—temperature shifts in the ring, lichen vowels—while the clearing’s sudden weaponed silence constrains the final kneel. Sufficient without over-cataloguing terrain.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominate early stake—“navigate uncharted emotional depths”—escalates as each musical interval narrows choice until the final sonic axis is earned. Cost is the literal loss of ring-hum and implicit surrender of former shoreline certainty.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: “consent to pivot without erasing the radius” reweights grief-map as living planet. No sermon; resonance arrives via final ring-silence chord aligning constellations and constellatory ache.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lustrous percussive diction—“weaponed with silence,” “dock where no apology landed”—maintains blind POV: tactile metonyms, sonic syntax, zero filter verbs. Voice modulates to hush as ring cools; prose remains legible, pattern-taught.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</question>
<comment>Line-to-line propulsion; figurative clusters are selective, tied to ring temperature. Only minor “leak from lichens” could tighten. Closure image lands clean with zero scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: grief-mapping via ultrasonic braille compass. Transforms abstract therapy-adjacent “navigate uncharted emotional depths” into concrete tactile journey. Risk of lyrical occlusion is fully paid off by earned sonic closure.</comment>
