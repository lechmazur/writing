<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is lush and embodied (“curated darkness like a library”), but the Gardener’s arrival shifts the arc from solitary struggle to negotiated treaty; the final consent gesture (“shapes of consent in the damp, uncertain air”) crystallizes the change with visible cost—yet the poet’s insomnia remains more asserted than dramatized in scene, capping the score just below 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the shared breath on the postcard reweights the shell into a living refuge. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each lullaby layer thickens the pattern until the final choir. Orientation is taught early (“gargantuan shell… tides remembered me”), and the cost is legible in the humid vow that forecloses solitary vigilance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The shell’s drip-and-creak orchestra and nacre corridors constrain every move; the postcard’s star-freckled gloss reappears at closure to charge the new atlas. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered (“reef-shadow joy twined through the corridors”). Micro-setting (pearl dust beds) directly enables the treaty garden, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transform pain into beauty without betraying memory—tightens when the Gardener demands a breath-signed vow. One decisive deepening: the shell’s walls begin to glow with “sorrows… turning them into lanterns,” a felt price that narrows the poet’s options from vigilance to tending. Agency drives the turn; coincidence plays no role.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</question><comment>Theme emerges organically from the central conflict: the cost of alchemizing grief into shelter. The final image—constellations rearranging on a living atlas—offers a non-literal answer to what hurt was asking. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in the still-waking nights. Recurring motifs (lullabies, postcard, shell) reweight meaning rather than decorate.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is unmistakably poet-insomniac: synesthetic, salt-inked, rhythmically tidal. Compression and elision (“shyly unstoppable”) are pattern-taught early and paid off in the final “rock the shell home.” No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains consistent even under the Gardener’s gaze. Dialogue is minimal but subtextual when it appears.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and function (“pressed sea blooms… trusting their stains to carry intentions”). No loops or scaffold; figurative language is disciplined, never muddling causality. Occasional elevated diction (“vegetal, and steadied into a climate”) fits the lyric register without register drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The insomnia-as-reef conceit feels inevitable and fresh; the treaty between thorns and petals reframes familiar grief-work without cliché. Specificity anchors the cosmic (“galaxy postcard”) in the tactile (“scallop lip”). Transformation test: swap shell for cave or postcard for letter and the emotional calculus collapses. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes without obscuring closure.</comment>
