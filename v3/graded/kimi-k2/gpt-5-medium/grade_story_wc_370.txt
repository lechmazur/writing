<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction is embodied—"absence is my coat and attention my lantern"—and the final refusal to return to old shapes is earned through the shared reading of Mistake and Wisdom. The friend’s on-page presence forces a crucible moment; micro-choice of reaching for the hand crystallizes the cost. Backstory is anchored to present micro-choices (selling the notebook, entering the corridor). Voice remains distinct, though a touch of therapeutic cadence in “stacked our motives on the table” nicks perfection.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of mirrored opposites (grief/gratitude, departure/reunion) tightens until the final Charged Poise—steady braid of meaning and the hand that steadies without claiming. Closure lands on the page with felt cost: “that refusal felt like the gentlest truth.” Orientation is clear by 120 words; no causality breaks. One transition (shelf → corridor) is seamless.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stationery shop dust and the corridor “carved by footsteps that never hurried” anchor place and mood. The library’s fluorescent lamps warming into discernment is a micro-setting shift that constrains perception and choice. The notebook’s prior sale threads memory into setting. Spatial choreography is clean; no white-room drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to live with the mistake of “staying while leaving”—is signaled early and escalates through the paired books exercise. The tightening is the co-reading that forecloses denial; cost is the irreversible change in the relationship (“books rarely return to uncreased spines”). Agency remains with the protagonist throughout.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>Theme of mistakes as rooms you enter, not verdicts, emerges organically from the paired volumes and the final refusal to reconcile into old shapes. Subtext in the hand-steadying gesture carries the weight of earned wisdom without moralizing. Final image of the city’s “familiar anonymity” reweights solitude as mercy, not escape.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</question><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise—“dust floated like waiting thoughts,” “librarian poured tea that held steady like a hand.” Perceptual signature is consistent: the recluse notices absence and attention with lantern-like focus. No POV drift; compression and elision (“I told him the truth and the unsent letters, too”) are taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; each sentence layers image and meaning. No loops or scaffold. Metaphors are fresh—“letters asked me to come within arm’s reach of midnight”—and never muddle causality. Rhythm modulates with emotional beats; final paragraph breathes appropriately.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>The “Order of Nestled Paradoxes” library that shelves opposites together is a fresh frame for processing relational rupture. The conceit is fully inhabited, not gimmicky; every detail (paired books, slate sign) serves the emotional arc. Transformation test: the story would collapse if the library were generic; its specificity is integral.</comment>
