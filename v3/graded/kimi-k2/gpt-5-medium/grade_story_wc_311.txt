<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is embodied and specific; the reaper’s contradictory tenderness and duty drive every micro-choice. The final naming of Shoreless crystallizes his arc with visible cost—he accepts endless labor in place of absolution. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible waived. Reflection stays within BRR and alters present tactics.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of naming fears tightens stakes until the crystallization of Shoreless reweights the premise. Closure is a Charged Poise—the dome shelves Miren’s voice, work opens “in the long building,” cost is the lifelong task itself. Orientation anchored by ~120 words; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Observatory, atlas page, and scythe function as micro-settings that constrain choices—lens, vellum, blade all physically shape the naming ritual. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered; brine ticking beneath stone mirrors interior absence. Final image of “thin, kind star” on scythe charges closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—naming the nameless fear—signaled early and escalates through each crystallized fear until Shoreless lands. Agency is renunciation: he accepts perpetual cartography of grief. One meaningful tightening suffices; cost is the unending labor, legible on page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of naming as bridge versus cage emerges organically from the reaper’s actions; no moralizing. Final image of drawing a harbor on the atlas reweights prior sea-monster margins into hope without stating it. Subtext in glass creatures’ chimes and gulls’ refusal to land deepens resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; perceptual signature filters every detail through the reaper’s grief-tuned attention. Syntax modulates with pressure—long breaths in calm beats, clipped fragments during crystallization. No dialogue, so mechanics waived; free indirect style remains consistent.</comment>

<comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; figurative language taught early (dome “breathed like a sleeping lung”) and paid off. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Rhythm accelerates during crystallization, then exhales into quiet closure. Zero artifacts in final third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise—reaper mapping heartbreak via obsolete astronomy—feels inevitable yet fresh. Sea-monster atlas and wax cylinders transform familiar grief tropes into specific ritual. Risky lyric compression succeeds because pattern is taught early and closure remains legible.</comment>
