<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied; the pianist’s longing and improvisatory nature drive every micro-choice. The broken clock and compasses act as concrete extensions of his inner conflict. Final renunciation of strict time is earned and carries felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the delayed last train confirms the encore’s success, reconfiguring the station’s rhythm. Causal chain—reel → arbor → improvisation → timetable ripple—holds cleanly. Cost is audible in the rare hush that “schedules bowed to.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Station concourse, arbor, and drifting tide are rendered with selective sensory precision that guides movement and stakes. The arbor’s shifting paths and salt wind directly constrain how the pianist navigates choice. Final image of paused concourse recharges the setting as living metronome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—derail fate without wrecking the world—tightens through each compass flicker and tide shift. One meaningful escalation: the last-train delay externalizes the wager’s success. Cost is the risk of permanent exile from clock-time, felt in the arbor’s ebbing tide.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of loving timetables while refusing obedience emerges through concrete objects and choices, never stated. Broken clock and flickering compasses reweight from symbols of stasis to instruments of possibility. Final hush offers resonant, non-moralizing answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with rhythmic control that mirrors musical phrasing. Perceptual signature—sound as touch, time as tide—remains consistent. No head-hopping; compression and elision are taught early and paid off in closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language serves pattern and pressure without clutter. Occasional stacked metaphors (“tide rose in the sky…choices were kelp”) flirt with excess but remain legible. No loops or scaffold; final cadence earns silence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses mundane station with surreal arbor via film-reel portal; transformation feels inevitable. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specificity of postcard-ivory keys and umbrella-rib keyboard anchors the fantastical in tactile reality.</comment>
