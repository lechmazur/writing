<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is embodied and specific; the poet’s contradictory impulses—fear vs. need to map scars—surface in micro-choices like hovering over the timer. The final tracing of the constellation against their own scar earns the renunciation of silence with visible cost. Minor slip: caretaker’s backstory is slightly expository.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the poet’s finger on the constellation reconfigures the city’s pain into a breathable map. Causal chain—letter → ascent → timed vigil → recognition—holds under Accumulative/Textural lens. Cost is legible in the rarefied language that now “breathes.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Stormlit observatory constrains every beat: the thinning air, the dome’s lightning pointers, the camera bolted to the rim. Micro-setting of the timer on the railing becomes a second skin. Weather actively guides the timing of exposures and the final hush.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—understanding the cartography of scars—tightens when the poet must match lightning to wounds under measured silence. One decisive deepening: stopping the timer at thunder’s crest forecloses retreat. Cost is the audible hush after the last bolt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of mapping pain into navigable stars emerges through concrete action; no moralizing. Final image of the city as “healed page drying” reweights prior wounds without statement. Subtext in caretaker’s “furiously tranquil” stillness and the ash-drawn constellation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; perceptual signature filters every bolt through poetic cognition. Rhythm modulates with storm tempo. Compression taught early (“furiously tranquil”) and paid off in caretaker’s truce of stillness and velocity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>High density, zero loops; figurative language is selective and pattern-taught. “Storm-kissed wonder” and “arterial lines” serve immediate stakes. No overwriting in peak beats; final line crystallizes without clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fusion of meteorology, cartography, and censorship feels inevitable and fresh. The vigil-in-pause conceit transforms a familiar climb-into-sky trope into a scar-reading ritual. Risky lyric compression succeeds without clarity loss.</comment>
