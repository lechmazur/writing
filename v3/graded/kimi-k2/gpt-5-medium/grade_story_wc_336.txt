<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Miren’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the seed’s hunger for testimony and her tactile pruning choices reveal contradictory impulses. Yet the child’s arrival feels slightly engineered, diluting the crucible pressure between them.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each pruning cut layers testimony into the seed until the final planting reconfigures the valley’s memory. Closure lands as Charged Poise—“the valley tasted a note like the memory of a lantern in fog”—with felt cost in the child’s promise and Miren’s relinquishment of the seed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Verdant parapet, waterfall mist, and mossed stone are selective and purposeful; the seam between flagstones literally hosts the decisive act. Micro-setting (applewood locket, pruning shears) constrains choice and charges the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“preserve the color of wonder”—is signaled early and tightened through each pruning cut that feeds the seed. One clear escalation: the child’s cracked jar delivers loneliness that the seed converts to sunrise, narrowing options to planting in the seam.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of memory-as-fruit emerges organically from pruning gestures and seed hunger; no explicit moralizing. Final image of lantern-in-fog reweights prior material without statement, inviting reflection on how wonder is husbanded.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct lyric texture—“sap and memory,” “bread learning to rise”—remains consistent; perceptual signature is Miren’s synesthetic orchard-listening. No POV drift; compression and elision taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is patterned and purposeful. Minor loop risk in “waterfall kept speaking in patient syllables” but rhythm supports breath. No artifacts in closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of arborist ritual and memory-keeping; orchard-as-memory-world feels inevitable. Risky lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry. Avoids generic orchard tropes through specificity of pruning-as-testimony.</comment>
