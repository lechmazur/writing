<question>1</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Wounded observer-physicist is vividly embodied through the shoulder crystal humming in storms; interiority feels lived (geode oracle, “intangibly tangible compass”). Agency stays interior—fine for this lens—but final choice (tilted observatory, vow to stay awake) costs are compressed rather than dramatized in-scene, so cap just under 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question>
<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/Textural drive taught early—each beat layers density (breaker clicks, light through crystal, data blur) until the final basin reconfiguration crystalizes stakes. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Charged Poise where “the world answers with a wounded hymn” carries conceptual cost of vigil—stance held with penalty legible. Causality intact under this lens.</comment>

<question>3</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Floating observatory is both looming threat and sensor cradle; geode pressed to glass and shoulder-to-glass tilt directly constrain stance in the final image. Spatial choreography is crisp, sensory hierarchy obeys crisis, minor white-room moments early negligible.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.5</comment>
<comment>Dominant stake—recovering unused potential in grief’s wake—signals early. One decisive deepening when chart blur forces drift; consequences for vigil and commander noted. Cost is present but more conceptual than visceral; stays within lens.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme accumulates from storm noise to silent hymn without moralizing; grief as dormant energy emerges entirely through concrete actions and objects. Bleak yet hopeful cadence earned by final image—no sermon delivered.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Voice is singular—percussive diction (“metallic clicks like ice”), patterned compression (“bleak exhilaration” repeated then modulated). Micro-timing of reflection anchored in physical cues keeps psychic distance stable. A few rhythmic near-repeats still serve intensification.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or redundant paraphrase; dense lines (“purple cathedral under skin”) land. Occasional packed figuration in final paragraph skates edge of overwriting but never muddies meaning. Strong aural patterning supports voice.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Premise—post-war weather station harvesting emotional inertia via physics—is fresh synthesis. Risk-taking syntax and fusion of survivor artifact with instrumentation feel inevitable in hindsight. Near-echoes of poetic canon minimized by granular specifics.</comment>
