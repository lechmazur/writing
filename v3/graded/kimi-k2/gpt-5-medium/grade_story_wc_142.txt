<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Nessa’s interiority is vivid—her “loops and ledgers” mind shapes every tactic—and the brother’s scaffold cameo crystallizes the family crucible. The spiral-chip reprise at the end carries palpable cost, sealing her earned stasis. Minor slip: the liaison’s shift from admiration to coolness is inferred rather than embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the rafts literally re-align, fusing VIP zone and fish market under public daylight, cost paid by the chip pressed into wet paint. Causal chain holds—every beat flows from Nessa’s encoded graffiti to the ballast-console act. Mosaic shards (night tarp meetings, dawn re-routes) are taught early and cohere under the Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The raft city breathes: “tents breathed like lungs,” “floats creaked,” and the chip’s grime of “salt and oil and a scuff of my mother’s laugh” anchors origin. Micro-setting (chip, console, wet paint) constrains the final choice. One over-rich phrase—“diplomatic gray”—barely grazes clarity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—navigate gentrification without fences—tightens when the liaison demands riot-proof guarantees. Escalation is driven by Nessa’s agency: encoded graffiti, console realignment, public fusion of zones. Cost is visible in the chip’s sacrifice and the brother’s torn loyalties.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the collision of memory and monetization; the final image of velvet ropes wedded to fish scales reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext hums in the spiral fossil and the mother’s solder-burned hands. No thematic drift or sermonizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct—“culture shock absorber,” “color grammar,” “grammar grows”—and rhythm modulates with pressure. Compression (“laughter was being leased by the hour”) is taught early and paid off. No head-hopping; POV stays locked to Nessa’s perceptual signature.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence layers image and motion. One mixed metaphor—“tide that buys new paint and sells old neighbors”—is instantly clarified by context. No loops or scaffold; final line “steer…toward a future that would not sell the past without buying our consent” lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The privatized carnival raft is a fresh synthesis; encoded graffiti as tactical choreography feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risky structural compression (mosaic shards) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Transformation test: story collapses if relocated to a static city.</comment>
