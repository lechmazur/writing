<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Interior glimpses flicker, but the poet remains archetype more than person; no single contradictory impulse wrestles visibly within one beat. The witness collective blends into choral “we” without differential motives. Renunciation is gestured—“former guard drops badge”—but the cost is reported rather than dramatized within a moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Cumulative-textural lens: each added sensorial layer tightens the communal breath until the stanza of stepping onto safe ice reweights what “boundary” means with quiet but undeniable after-shock. Closure lands—boundary walks awake rather than breaks—and the humming shell tone behind us pays the price for balance lost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mineral-ink air and quartz throat-song are specific enough to taste, and the glass fogging / clearing diaphragm becomes an active boundary tool. However, no recurring object physically constrains the final choice, keeping it shy of the 9 gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</question><comment>The dominant stake—“will we dare communal breath?”—intensifies in careful harmonic synchronization, then migrates onto ice. Cost is poet’s solitary first step & lake crack heard by all; felt, yet not visibly traded by others inside the scene.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme coheres around walking boundaries awake; it refracts through repeated soft re-authorings of ancient edicts without moral slogans. Final image of doorway widening without hinges answers the question of how law survives contact with compassion, quietly priced.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>Sensuous, sculpted clauses match witness POV: perception slants toward synesthetic mineral-metaphor, then breathes quieter during group sync. No head-hopping; oneiric compression taught early—reader stays oriented through taught cadence & pays at close.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Line-level craft soars: kinetic verbs, sculptural nouns, layered images that propel rather than decorate. Occasional excess—“lantern-moth hush repeats three times without new angle” pulls it below the 9 shine, yet rhythm remains controlled.</comment>

<comment>Fusing civic memory with lyric architecture—quartz colonnade becomes vocal instrument, ban on song re-inverted through group respiration—feels singular. The image of a law softened by touch rather than strike is fresh and quietly startling, integrated end-to-end.</comment>
