<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiors ache with contradictions (photo-cursed admission, fear-as-editor) but the “I” stays mostly reactive; decisions are dictated by the advisor and the dream-dictionary. Motivation (“why I agreed to return”) is asserted rather than embodied in scene work, so the felt-cost of renunciation lands but feels slightly imposed rather than earned through on-page struggle.</question>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure satisfies RR via Charged Poise—the funhouse “sealed behind us” image reweights the paradox so “unswerving attention” becomes the permanent solvent; on-page causal line (dictionary trick → paradox trap → camera flash) is clear under Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation debts cleared before 120-word mark; no teleports or continuity holes.</question>

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Funhouse corridor and rusted hinges are tactile obstacles, not backdrops; the metal clasp literally becomes a lock pick then escape key. Environment constrains each pivot: mirrors that birth unwanted negatives, decaying lips that must be coaxed open, fluorescent algae glow that marks after-burn cost.</question>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</comment>
<comment>Dominant stake—trick fear into self-reveal—rises with each beat: paradox entry, confession of “I edit when looked at,” camera flash that freezes the shadow. Escalation accumulates density rather than causal reversals; final charge re-anchors agency, no shortcuts.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</comment>
<comment>Theme coheres: the terror of being edited by another’s gaze is dramatized, not spoken, until the final non-moralizing image of daylight disguised as crack. Slight thematic abstraction (“fear owes me money”) risks preachy note but remains sub-text, not final sermon.</question>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</comment>
<comment>Voice delivers a night-lit carnival fever: “a rusted grin… nursing a glow,” breath like carnival taffy. Diction remains internally coherent; compression taught early (photographically cursed) yields payoff in earned paradox syntax. No POV slippage.</question>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</comment>
<comment>Every sentence multi-tasks: “licked its own contradictions,” “shadow…birthed nouns.” Occasional figurative excess (“breath of a shadow with eyes but not the faucets to drain them”) strays into purple but never blinds clarity at closure.</question>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</comment>
<comment>Faces born of mirrors, fear paid in “nouns bled,” and a paradoxical dictionary as weapon feel fresh. The carnival funhouse trope is familiar, but its procedural inversion—trick fear into digesting its own rule-breakers—offers genuine re-skin rather than mere dressing.</question>
