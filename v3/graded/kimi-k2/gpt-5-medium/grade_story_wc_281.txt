<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s skepticism and tenderness braid convincingly; her micro-choices (taps, shoulder softening) reveal shifting stakes. The narrator’s desire to retrieve the father’s map and her wish to quiet her brother’s last words are embodied, not declared. Cost is felt when the geode dulls and the rig stills. Interiority stays concrete, though one or two phrases flirt with therapy-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the pair renounce further forcing of memory, leaving the spent geode on the sill. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each pass of the wand layers density until the final hush reweights the stake. Orientation is swift; no causality breaks. The cost (work done, hope tempered) is legible in the last three lines.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The studio’s charged air, rain-veined windows, and trembling bulbs constrain movement and mood. The muscovite shard functions as micro-setting, its mica planes dictating camera angles and breath counts. Spatial choreography is clean; no white-room drift. One vivid sensory overload moment (“cobalt settled”) risks overwriting but is brief.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—retrieving lost words without force—tightens through each wand pass and static nip. Agency remains joint yet legible; the final stilling of the rig forecloses further attempts. Pressure escalates via pattern intensification rather than causal turns, fitting the Accumulative lens. A visible price: the geode’s spent glow and the deliberate setting-aside.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges quietly: memory must be met with kindness, not extraction. The willowglass hope motif reweights from fragile aspiration to tempered restraint in the final image. No moralizing; the insight is earned through tactile process. Subtext hums in fingertip taps and shared forehead pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded, with a perceptual signature attuned to light, breath, and static. Syntax modulates with emotional intensity; no head-hopping. Compression (“threads of color throb across the canvased air”) is taught early and paid off. Dialogue is sparse but distinct when it appears.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image or stakes. Metaphors are fresh and coherent (“static toddling across the concrete”). No loops or scaffold; rhythm breathes with scene needs. One near-purple phrase (“chorus braided from shy electricity”) is forgiven for its earned placement.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The telepathy-pill-recall conceit is handled as attention-training rather than gadgetry, a fresh angle. Somatic-marker grammar and light-painting memory retrieval synthesize into a singular, non-obvious ritual. Risky lyric compression pays off in the final hush. No derivative echoes.</comment>
