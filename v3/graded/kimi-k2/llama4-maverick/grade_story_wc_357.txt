<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Lyra’s curiosity and pilot competence are sketched, but interior contradiction is thin; the arrow-tip moment hints at personal resonance yet never complicates her tactics or costs her anything. No micro-choice under pressure reveals a deeper value hierarchy.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Lyra’s worldview shifts when she witnesses the echo-pool. However, the causal linkage between the arrow-tip and this revelation is asserted rather than dramatized, muting the cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Floating arches, inverted gravity, and the glowing pool are vividly rendered and directly shape navigation and stakes. Yet no single environmental constraint forces a costly choice that charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>6.5</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—uncovering the orchard’s resilience—escalates through the accelerated growth trail, but the final discovery feels gifted rather than wrested; the cost is observational, not paid.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>The theme of symbiosis between planet and cultivator emerges organically from the imagery, but the arrow-tip’s hinted history never ripens into thematic counterpoint, leaving resonance slightly one-note.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays coherent; sensory diction is precise (“whirling silence,” “ethereal fingers”). Occasional explanatory clauses (“she had modified it herself…”) dilute immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and propulsive; a few stock phrases (“stomach drop,” “dancing on the solar winds”) and mild scaffold (“she felt a sense of wonder…”) keep it from the highest band.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>The gravity-inverting orchard and echo-pool synthesis feels fresh, yet the broken arrow-tip subplot gestures toward deeper mythos without payoff, leaving originality partly untapped.</comment>
