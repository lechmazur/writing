<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Interiority is evocative but drifts into abstract self-diagnosis (“turmoil inside her”) rather than embodied contradiction. The decisive shift—choosing to write again—lacks a micro-choice on the page; it is narrated rather than dramatized. Ghost-woman functions as externalized conscience, but no status or relational pressure is applied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final image of mist re-settling reconfigures the novelist’s stance with felt cost (she must “continue… against the current”). Causality is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of mist/shell/muse tightens cadence. Orientation is clear by 80 words; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Mist and shell create micro-setting that constrains perception and later charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective—diffused light, swirling hush—filtered through POV priorities. Spatial choreography remains coherent; no white-room syndrome. Shell-as-talisman meets 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—writer’s block versus creative surrender—is signaled early. Pressure tightens via accumulative pattern: each return of mist/shell/muse narrows the option of quitting. Cost is felt in the final image (“against the current”), though escalation is more cadence than causal turn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Theme of art as navigation of inner wilderness emerges through concrete particulars—shell, mist, muse—without sermonizing. Final image reweights earlier motifs, offering non-literal answer to “how to write.” Subtext in ghost-woman’s silence is effective; avoids thematic echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet consistent, with controlled rhythm and purposeful repetition (“swirling hush”). Perceptual signature—selective attention to light, texture—remains character-bound. No head-hopping; POV distance stable. Compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, with varied sentence rhythm and high information density. Occasional soft phrases (“sense of calm wash over her”) drift toward cliché but do not stall momentum. No loops or scaffold in final third. Metaphors are coherent; no mixed vehicles.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Transformation of familiar “muse appears” trope into subconscious projection feels fresh due to shell/mist integration. Specificity of feral nexus and spiral fragment anchors universals. Risk-taking is moderate; avoids gimmickry but also avoids deeper structural daring.</comment>
