<comment>Interiority is evocative but largely abstract (“brittle awakenings,” “sense of purpose”); no contradictory impulses appear in-scene.  The character’s choices after the memory remain internal summarization—no on-page micro-choice shows she alters behavior today because of it.  Reincarnation memory functions more as backdrop than active driver for present-tense motivation.</comment>

<comment>Closure effect is Earned Stasis in the final paragraph—renunciation of solitude into acceptance—but the causality bridging memory → action → cost is outlined rather than dramatized.  Missing “how” the sundial epiphany reconfigures her stance on being alone; linkage stays thematic, not causal.  Orientation safe; library stone hum used well as anchoring device.</comment>

<comment>Cloudborne tidal library vividly evoked through filtered sensory prioritization (“musty parchment,” “window light”).  Brass sundial functions as micro-setting; its metallic scent and shifting shadows tie directly to Lyra’s moment-to-moment decisions.  No spatial contradictions, anchors established swiftly—only mild lapse when library is called “sanctuary” twice without freshening the description.</comment>

<grade>5.3</grade>
<comment>Single dominant stake (preservation vs. self-forged independence) signaled early, but tension escalates chiefly via contemplation.  No external pressure tests the choice until the final declarative image; cost registers rhetorically, not viscerally. Closure is Earned Stasis but without fresh narrowing—options foreclosed are abstractions.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of fragile transience emerges through recurrence of “brittle awakenings,” mirrored by auk extinction and cracked sundial light.  Subtext stays implicit; final image reframes solitude as survivable fragility.  Only soft spot: paragraph 4 repeats the phrase “brittle awakenings,” risking meta-signpost.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited focalization is stable, tactile, and tuned to minute changes of light on brass.  Micro-setting POV bias (“atomically reflective” registering like a heartbeat) enhances immediacy.  No head-hops; occasional elevated diction like “starkly apparent” momentarily breaks lexicon, but recovers within two beats.</comment>

<grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Syntax lilts gracefully, balancing long and short phrases to echo tidal rhythm.  One over-lavish clause—“musty scent of aged parchment and the gentle hum…”—leans purple but doesn’t derail.  No looped scaffold; pronouns and prop handling stay clean.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>6.1</grade>
<comment>The cloudborne memory-library conceit fresh, and reincarnation as contemporary great-auk unique.  However, “brittle awakenings” concept stays abstract; story risks poetic parable without sufficient lived specificity.  No bold structural risk; payoff predictable in hindsight.</comment>
