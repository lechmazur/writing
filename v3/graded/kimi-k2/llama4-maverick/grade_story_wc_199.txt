<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The seed sorter’s curiosity and decision to prod the speck catalyze the plot, but interior contradiction and embodied emotion remain lyric-safe rather than visceral; the arc from observer to interpreter is clear yet predictable.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of leaves, monuments, and glowing dust builds toward a single Resonant Reconfiguration in the final monument-illuminated prophecy. Closure lands on the page with cost—transformation is irreversible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Moonlit arbor supplies micro-setting pressure—seed husks become tools, treetop height limits movement—and charges the final glow. Specificity anchors stakes without overstretching length.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—decode the prophecy—tightens once as leaf-patterns unlock hidden meaning. Cost is the seed sorter’s irrevocable change; escalation remains lyric rather than causally intensifying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Theme surfaces through the tension between preservation and revelation; ending image of glowing arboreal wisdom reweights earlier monuments without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Lyrical voice sustains moonlit hush and perceptual specificity; compressed diction under stress works. No head-hopping; free indirect style is clean.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Rhythm and density serve atmosphere; occasional ornamental metaphor (moon-whisper secret) is minor. No loops, high sensory integration.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade>
<comment>Folkloric nexus and seed-code myth feel fresh, yet archetype drift (glowing destiny speck) slightly dilutes originality. Charged final image salvages distinction.</comment>
