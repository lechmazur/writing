<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Luna’s urge to transmute pain remains thematic rather than interiorized; the calm is stated but never pressured, so no contradiction is dramatized. Her camera work is graceful yet static, generating no consequential choice that forecloses a path. The moment at sunset is lovely, but no new cost is realized beyond a generic "meant to do this."</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The implied Accumulative/Textural lens tracks a single deepening—photographs piling toward “a masterpiece”—but closure is delivered in the vaguest “ready… work that lay ahead.” No DC, RR or CR is crystallized; absence of a legible cost blunts the resonance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Setting details are select and sensorily acute (warm orange glow, rusted ruins, climbing vine). Yet the lavender and factory exert no causal squeeze on decisions; they are atmospherically vivid backdrop without a tool-level constraint that reweights final options.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—collective healing through art—stays abstract; no tightening choice or on-page trade-off appears. No beat raises the cost of continuing or forecloses alternatives. Tension remains one-note static rather escalating under lens pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Thematic notes emerge: decay harbors beauty, nature reclaims ruin. Yet these arise from scenic description rather than embodied conflict; the final smile carries zero reweighting of any prior pain. Subtext is present but untested.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Luna’s perceptual signature is restrained, lyrical, consistent in focalization. Prose avoids therapy-speak and maintains clean psychic distance; “dove gray map case” returns without strain. Voice never falters yet also never escalates under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences flow with pleasant rhythm and few artifacts, but information is low-density—repetitions of serenity and lavender sap propulsion. A paraphrase loop about peace and beauty recurs without accumulation of new knowledge or cost.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Contrast of toxic factory wasteland against fragrant lavender field is striking; the juxtaposition is fresh without feeling contrived. Risk is tempered—setup feels familiar arthouse postcard, but treatment is specific and quiet.</comment>
