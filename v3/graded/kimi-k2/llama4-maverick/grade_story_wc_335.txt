<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“eyes…seemed to hold a world of sorrow”), but the archivist’s contradictory impulses remain largely summarized rather than dramatized in scene; the final smile feels earned yet the cost is more asserted than shown.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the archivist’s annotations crystallize into a “quiet triumph” that reweights the shadow’s exile. Causal chain is coherent under an Accumulative/Textural lens; however, the exact moment of cost is diffuse—felt but not sharply legible on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Library and playground swing are evoked with selective sensory detail; the shard-mirror and tea cup function as micro-settings that constrain the archivist’s precise movements. Final image of the empty cup recharges the motif, though the swing remains atmospheric rather than choice-shaping.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reversing exile—signaled early; pressure tightens through the archivist’s growing confidence and subsiding nervous habit. One meaningful deepening occurs as the tea-leaf geometry reveals longing, narrowing options toward mentorship. Cost is present but soft-edged.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of quiet mentorship and resilience emerges organically from the archivist’s tactile labor; the final smile offers a non-literal answer to exile without moralizing. Subtext in the “combative tenderness” of their movements lingers, though the swing’s echo could carry more conceptual weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is textured and consistent, with rhythmic control (“hush…creak…whisper”) that modulates under pressure. Perceptual signature is distinct—tea leaves as “tiny, twisted creatures”—and free indirect style stays clean. No head-hopping; minor drift into elevated diction (“topography of the soul”) is brief.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and propulsive; sentences advance multiple functions. Occasional figurative layering (“web of emotions”) risks overwriting but never stalls momentum. No loops or scaffold; minor filter-verb cluster (“seemed to hold”) is isolated.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Premise of soul-exile captured in glass and decoded via tea-leaf geometry feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risky quiet ending pays off; no close echoes. Specificity of the shard-mirror archive anchors the fantastical in lived detail.</comment>
