<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Interiority drifts toward poetic summary (“shiver ran down their spine,” “quiet satisfaction”) rather than embodied contradiction; no visible cost for the final insight. The astrologer’s motivation is stated but never tested by an opposing impulse or limitation, so the “rhythm of belonging” feels asserted, not earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Closure is a soft epiphany—glow “emanated from within”—with no decisive change or reconfiguration; the lens reads Accumulative/Textural, but the cadence shift is muted and the cost is only implied. Orientation is adequate, yet the plot beats are repetitive walks through corridors rather than tightening pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Bioluminescent walls and “shadowseam wonder” create textured atmosphere, but the facility never constrains choice or supplies a resource that alters tactics; it remains backdrop. Sensory detail is vivid yet ornamental, lacking the integration that would push this into the 9-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“learn the rhythm of belonging”—is declared early but never materially tested; no tightening beat narrows options or exacts a visible price. The night’s passage feels like duration, not escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of belonging emerges through imagery rather than dramatized conflict; the final glow gestures toward resonance but offers no reweighted premise or conceptual cost. Subtext stays atmospheric, never sharp.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is consistent, lyrical, and occasionally precise (“first fireflies of summer stirring within the depths”), but syntactic rhythm becomes repetitive across paragraphs, flattening urgency. No dialogue to test differentiation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean and often elegant, yet prone to paraphrase loops (“footsteps echoed… corridors… corridors…”) and filler phrases that dilute momentum. Metaphors are coherent but occasionally generic (“labyrinthine corridors”).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Underwater astrologer in a bioluminescent ruin is fresh, but the execution leans on familiar mystical quest beats without subverting them. The burnt feather’s final glow is a gentle twist, not a transformative reconfiguration.</comment>
