<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Interiority is present but generic (“weight of her task,” “odd sense of connection”) rather than embodied; the nut and blueprint trigger action but no contradictory impulse is dramatized. Final pride is stated, not earned through visible flaw or cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Causal chain is clear—nut → blueprint → labyrinth reactivation—yet the decisive change (glowing stones guiding travelers) is narrated rather than shown on-page; cost is implied but not felt by the caretaker in the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Orchard, cottage, and labyrinth are sketched with selective sensory cues; the mechanical birds supply atmospheric pressure. However, no environmental detail actively constrains the caretaker’s final choice or charges the closing image beyond mood.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore the labyrinth before night frost—is signaled early and met. Escalation is linear rather than tightening; the frost deadline is announced but never presses her resources or forces a trade-off on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Theme of reluctant duty becoming purposeful care emerges implicitly through action. Yet the final paragraph drifts toward explicit moral summary (“beacon of hope”), muting subtext and limiting resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited voice is consistent and unobtrusive, with modest perceptual signature. Syntax is serviceable but lacks rhythmic distinction; no compression or elision is taught or required by closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, readable, and free of loops or scaffold. Occasional cliché clusters (“golden glow,” “delicate veil of ice”) and filler phrases (“it was then that”) slightly dull immediacy but do not obscure causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade>
<comment>Familiar quest structure is refreshed by mechanical birds and impression-based activation, yet the caretaker’s arc and orchard curse remain archetypal. Specificity is moderate; premise could transplant to another setting without structural loss.</comment>
