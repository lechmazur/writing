<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The prince’s longing and frayed hope feel embodied in trembling handwork and hollow echoes, but his shift from passive relic to purposeful architect of rebirth arcs without concrete interior friction—no live contradiction undercuts his resolve, keeping the change informative rather than earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural pattern—each pattern-dense detail layers until the mechanized world slow-shifts—holds; closure lands as resonant reconfiguration when the heartbeat stills and beauty stirs, visible cost felt in the prince’s tears and world-wide hush.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Crystal spires and stone stalactites are vividly selective, but the suspended palace never pressures tactics; it serves more as sublime backdrop than constraint—until the final shared heartbeat, where setting and fate fuse, charging the image with hard-won quiet.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Single stake—restore beauty—is voiced early and tightened when assembly becomes irreversible; the palace’s thrum and the egg’s glow heighten stakes, and the final stillness carries undeniable, page-felt cost, satisfying accretive intensification.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of resurrecting beauty from a flawed genesis emerges through object, device, and breathless cadence rather than gloss—though late echoes verge on soft-lens wisdom, the final hush redeems it with resonant, non-moralizing weight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited channels a wistful, mythic diction—shards, stalactites, bitterly sweet—with rhythmic swell that crusts slightly purple in clusters but remains coherent; the voice never leaks perspective and tapers to silent awe at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose often lifts from showering modifiers yet propels, e.g., “quaking reverie… bitterly sweet nostalgia”; isolated mantra loops (“he felt,” “the prince felt”) and stock phrases drain punch, but no artifact stains the culminating stillness.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mechanical-earth heartbeat revived via etched fossil egg and crystalline ark offers fresh meld of decay–renewal myth; the fusion feels inevitable yet distinct, no recycled template in sight.</comment>
