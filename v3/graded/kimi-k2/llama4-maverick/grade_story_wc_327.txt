<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The storyteller’s interiority is evocative but remains largely observational; no contradictory impulse or micro-choice under pressure is dramatized. The “urgency” to preserve language is asserted rather than embodied in a costly decision. Closure is a lyrical stasis, not an earned renunciation. Voice is consistent, yet the character never risks or forfeits anything tangible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern density of birds, shadows, and echoes intensifies toward a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is swift and sustained. Closure is a Charged Poise—the canyon “reverberate[s] with a newfound sense of purpose”—but the cost is conceptual rather than felt on the page, capping the score below 8.8.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid, selective, and thematically charged; the towers of bone and kinetic bird-shadows constrain perception and guide the translation task. Sensory hierarchy reflects the POV’s priorities. The canyon’s echo-system functions as both environment and tool, directly shaping the final image. Meets the 9+ gate but lacks a single detail that physically limits the storyteller’s final move.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving the dying language—is clear early. Escalation is textural: patterns intensify, whispers swell. Yet the storyteller’s agency is observational; no decisive trade-off or irreversible cost is dramatized. The tightening is aesthetic rather than tactical, limiting the score to the high 6s.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of translation-as-survival emerges organically from image and action. Subtext resides in the flawed diamond’s transformation from curse to catalyst. Final image reweights prior motifs without moralizing. Complexity is present, but the lack of a tangible price keeps resonance just shy of the 8.5 band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical, consistent, and perceptually specific—“quietly articulate” diction mirrors the storyteller’s task. Syntax modulates with the swelling echoes. No POV drift or register mismatch. Compression and elision are purposeful and paid off at closure. Meets 9+ technical bar but lacks the final tightening that would push it higher.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet fluid; figurative language is patterned and coherent. Occasional near-repetition (“whispers of the ancients” / “whispers of the canyon”) and stacked modifiers slightly dull momentum. No mixed metaphors or clarity breaks at closure. High information density overall, but minor loops prevent 8.8+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes familiar motifs—echo-canyon, cursed gem, language death—into a fresh accumulative design. Risk lies in the lyric, almost static structure, but coherence holds. Specificity of bone towers and copper-veined skin grounds the mythic frame. Not transformative enough for the 9-band, yet memorably voiced.</comment>
