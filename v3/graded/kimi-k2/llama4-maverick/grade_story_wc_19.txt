<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Eli’s claustrophobia and desire to taste silences are clearly rooted, but the interiority drifts toward lyrical summary (“flavors of silence began to sprout”) rather than embodied contradiction under pressure; the final peace feels more declared than earned by micro-choices on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a gentle Charged Poise—Eli’s world “stretches” with visible emotional cost—yet the Accumulative/Textural lens is only loosely taught; the hour of inversion is more atmospheric than causally tightened, and the porcelain doll’s payoff is soft rather than decisive.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The xenial trellis is vividly sketched—“latticework of gardens and pathways suspended above the clouds”—and the floating objects during inversion anchor the scene spatially; however, the setting constrains choice only atmospherically, not tactically, capping the score below 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—collecting silences to ease claustrophobia—is signaled early and deepens through the hour, but the pressure escalates via lyrical accretion rather than a narrowing of options; the cost is emotional but diffuse, lacking a single tightening beat that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of inner expansion through curated silence emerges organically from Eli’s sensory journey, yet the final paragraph edges toward overt moralizing (“solace and growth could be found”), blunting subtext and preventing higher resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is consistently lyrical and child-sensitive, with pleasing rhythmic control; occasional filter phrases (“Eli felt”) intrude but do not stall momentum, and the POV remains stable throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is fluid and image-rich, but repeated abstract phrasing—“intangibly tangible presence,” “gilded hush”—creates minor loops that dilute density; no line-level artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The conceit of inverted gravity as therapy for claustrophobia is fresh and non-obvious; the execution leans on lyric accumulation rather than structural risk, keeping it just shy of the 8.5+ band.</comment>
