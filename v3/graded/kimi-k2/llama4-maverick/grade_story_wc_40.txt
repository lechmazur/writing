<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Scholar’s reticence is embodied in drumming fingers and ink-stained hands, but interiority drifts into abstract “weight of forgotten knowledge.” The summons forces a visible micro-choice—stooping for the crystal—yet the renunciation of isolation feels more declared than dramatized; cost is implied rather than felt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern-seeking and silence accumulate until the summons ruptures the hush. Closure is a Charged Poise—scholar stepping into dawn with crystal—reconfiguring options. Causality is loose; the summons arrives without prior trigger, and the cost of testimony is gestured at, not shown.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Library’s “shadowed” hush and “grimy windows” anchor early; the crystal’s glint and the wet-earth scent outside are vivid and selective. The setting constrains the scholar’s isolation and is recharged in the final image, though spatial choreography of the corridors remains vague.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—protect vs. share the decoded growth pattern—is signaled early. Escalation arrives via the summons, a single tightening beat. Agency is mostly reactive; the scholar’s resolve is asserted rather than tested on the page, so the visible cost is muted.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of knowledge versus exposure emerges through the scholar’s reluctance and the crystal’s echoing silence. Subtext is strongest in the crystal’s fall and retrieval; the dawn light reframes the pattern as possibility. Final resonance is present but slightly diluted by abstract phrasing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Voice is consistent, hushed, and slightly archaic without slipping. Sensory filtering is character-specific: dust, parchment, ink. Rhythm modulates with the hush-to-footsteps shift. No dialogue to test distinction; interior monologue avoids filter-verb clutter.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, with selective sensory detail and purposeful repetition of “hush” and “pattern.” Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing” vibe) fits the scholarly POV. No loops or mixed metaphors; momentum is steady until the slightly expository final paragraph.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Post-dictionary world and sonically reflective crystal offer fresh speculative texture. The premise is not wholly new, but the integration of silence-as-substance and pattern-as-growth feels specific. Risk is moderate; no structural gimmicks, yet no daring inversion either.</comment>
