<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Interior monologue is lyrical but abstract; contradiction between eternal cycles and renewed urgency is stated, never dramatized. No visceral cost shown until the final paragraph’s enigmatic smile leaves stakes undefined.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Accumulative pattern taught early (retracing → labyrinth → transformation); closure image reweights meaning via “ brightness darkening.” Lacks visible material cost, relying instead on tonal shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Glowing viaduct is evoked with kinetic flash but never pressures a tactical choice; mist and puddles stay decorative. Descriptive images recur without evolving constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Refractured timelines shape the metanarrative goal, yet actual stakes remain abstract—renowned tablet’s secrets shift no live options mid-scene. Pressure tightens only as atmospheric darkening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Theme of self-knowledge through cyclic mortality is coherent throughout, but final non-literal glow risks veering into pseudo-profundity. Strong affect fused with timelessness dampens critique.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Emotion leans ethereal rather than interrogatory; “periodically eternal” becomes a label divorced from bodily limits. Recurrent hypostatization—gravity “defier,” time “fluid”—nudges toward stylish monotone.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Syntax is elegant yet repetitive—phrases like “labyrinth of self,” “fractured timelines” cycle like choruses without new connotation. Purple densities appear without pressure-specific payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Trope remix grounds immortality myth in self-therapy quest via sculptable reality. The final figure of “darkening brightness” fuses sci-fi and mysticism into signature imagery.</comment>
