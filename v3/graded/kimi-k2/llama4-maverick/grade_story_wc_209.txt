<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Luna’s quest is driven and consistent, but her interiority trades in gentle abstractions—“umbral tenderness,” “reckon the mysteries”—rather than sharp contradictory impulses acted out in scene. The final understanding is declared rather than dramatized; we see only soft awe, no irrevocable choice or forfeited alternative. This flattens the arc: the cost is felt generically, never specifically on Luna’s body, social ties, or artistic freedom.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Track A single-scene accumulation hangs together. Orientation is sound at 60–70 words; no orientation debt. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: moonlight and cathedral glass re-weight Luna’s perception, a quiet Charged Poise. Yet the “cost” remains conceptual; nothing is given up or narrowed on the page. Causality works via accretion, but the decisive beat lacks a wound the reader can point to, keeping it below 8.8+ excellence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Amber pavilion, autumn chill, and cathedral glass are atmospherically vivid. Select sensory detail—glinting etched panes, fading warmth—integrates with Luna’s hush. However, none of these micro-settings or objects actively constrains a tactical choice; they color mood more than they tighten options, so the 9+ gate (environment must constrain choice) is missed. Highest credible score within band.</comment>

<comment>The dominant stake—“to understand why flowers bloom at night”—is poetic but diffuse; pressure remains contemplative, never sharpening to a hard trade-off. A single deepening occurs when the glass narrative “speaks,” but the narrowing is interpretive rather than visceral. Because the cost is unembodied, escalation scores only solid-mid.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>The intertwining of moonlight and epiphany coheres into a muted theme of quiet symbiosis between darkness and bloom. Subtext leans on image more than action; the realization resists tidy moralizing. The final “world seemed to bloom alongside her” offers resonant CR, reweighting earlier imagery without explicit statement. Still lacks the felt wound that would push past low-nine.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is languid, lyrical, consistently filtered through Luna’s sensitive perception. Recurring motifs—“whispering forests,” “moonlit gardens”—build a coherent sensorium. Rhythm breathes with scene, yet occasional soft abstractions drift toward poetic boilerplate, blunting full distinctiveness; nothing misfires badly enough to scar. Stays above 7.6.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is largely smooth and free of repetitive loops. Small clusters of near-paraphrase (“luna felt…”, “luna began to…”) appear but do not stall momentum. Metaphor remains controlled; one mixed image (“moonlight’s gentle caress” set against “etched glass”) is forgiven inside lyrical allowance. Meets craft bar for publication if not exemplary.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of nocturnal botany, cathedral windows, and postcard memory yields a delicate, non-novel premise. Freshness lies less in concept than in its gentle tonal execution. No bold formal or thematic risk raises stakes; transformation feels gentle rather than surprising. Satisfying but unstartling.</comment>
