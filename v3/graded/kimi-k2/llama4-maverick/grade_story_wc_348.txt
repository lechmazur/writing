<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Maria’s grief and scientific vocation are credibly fused; the interior contradiction between isolation and connection is dramatized through her micro-choice to reframe her research. The shift from mourning to purposeful action is earned, though the sister backstory is delivered in a single reflective block that slightly flattens pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Single-scene structure holds; the ravine observation triggers the causal insight that reconfigures her research goal. Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the new purpose is crystallized, the cost is the irrevocable loss of Sofia and the old self. Orientation is immediate; no lens drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>The braided ravine is rendered with selective sensory detail; foam patterns and the empty chrysalis are used as micro-settings that constrain Maria’s thinking and later re-weight the theme. Spatial anchors are clear; the environment subtly guides her epiphany without ornamental excess.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—transform grief into meaningful connection via science—is signaled early. A single tightening beat occurs when the foam insight forces a redefinition of her work’s purpose. Cost is felt in the irrevocability of Sofia’s absence; no external antagonist needed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of translating separation into connection emerges organically from Maria’s observation and choice; no explicit moralizing. The empty chrysalis and river foam reprise at closure to reweight the premise without overt statement. Subtext is carried in image and action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays close to Maria’s perceptual signature; diction is precise and rhythmic, matching her scientific ear for “symphonically minded” detail. No head-hopping; voice modulates with emotional intensity. Dialogue is absent, so no voice contamination.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, vivid, and propulsive; no loops or scaffold. Metaphors are controlled and serve character perception. Occasional elevated phrasing (“symphonically minded ears”) is justified by POV. No artifacts in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>The fusion of polymer science with grief work feels fresh; the foam-as-network insight is specific and non-generic. The chrysalis motif is transformed from cliché to earned resonance. Risk is moderate but coherent; no derivative premise issues.</comment>
