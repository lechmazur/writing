<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The caretaker’s “brazen calm” is stated but never embodied in a moment of visible contradiction; interiority remains generic (“they knew,” “they believed”). No micro-choice under pressure shows the trait in action. The diary is handled but never used to alter a present decision. Closure is a peaceful acceptance rather than an earned renunciation with cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Closure is a quiet Earned Stasis—acceptance of death—but the causal chain between architectural secrets → copper wiring → interspecies harmony is asserted rather than dramatized. The six-month deadline is named yet never narrows options on the page. Transitions are smooth, yet the drive lens stays Accumulative/Textural without a decisive tightening beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Stone pillars, orchard scents, and copper wire are vividly sketched and filtered through caretaker attention. The setting subtly guides action—copper on oak is spatially precise. However, the temple’s “living stone” remains atmospheric backdrop; it never constrains a choice or charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—create lasting interspecies respect—is declared early. Pressure is diffuse: no scene-level test of the harmony goal, no visible trade-off forced by dwindling time. Escalation is textural (orchard “flourishes”) rather than causal; cost is elegiac rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of reciprocity emerges through caretaker action and orchard response, avoiding overt moralizing. Subtext is strongest in the copper wire’s “subtle song,” a resonant non-literal answer. Yet the theme’s complexity is undercut by the absence of interspecies conflict or sacrifice on the page.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays consistent; perceptual signature is calm, observational, slightly elevated. Rhythm modulates with long lyrical sentences that match caretaker temperament. No dialogue, so voice cohesion is high; occasional filter phrases (“they watched”) slightly dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is fluid, with pleasing cadence and selective sensory detail. Minor loop: “the caretaker… the caretaker…” openings recur. No mixed metaphors or purple drift. Density is good; every paragraph advances atmosphere or caretaker intent. No artifacts in closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Fusion of ancient temple secrets with bio-acoustic arboriculture feels fresh and specific. The copper-wire method is non-obvious yet plausible within the invented world. Risk is moderate—quiet ecological lyric rather than bold structural experiment—but the synthesis is coherent and memorable.</comment>
