<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Aria’s interiority is vivid—her tactile handling of black sand and the coin shows embodied emotion—but the “scars can sing” epiphany is stated more than dramatized, and the grafting beat feels like a gentle ritual rather than a choice that costs her anything visible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final image of Aria standing watch reconfigures her stance from passive healing to active guardianship, and the cost is felt in the open-ended vigil. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens; each reflection and sensory layer tightens the thematic stake without causal reversals.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon and volcanic beach are rendered with selective, sensory economy; the black sand pouch functions as micro-setting that constrains her tactile ritual and reappears in the final breath, charging the closing image. Weather and tide remain consistent and purposeful.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—healing a scarred world—escalates through accumulating sensory pressure rather than reversals; the grafting act is the single tightening beat. Cost is present but diffuse (emotional labor, ongoing vigil), not sharply dramatized on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</question><comment>Theme of compassionate witness emerges organically from Aria’s grafting and vigil; the coin and black sand quietly reweight the premise without sermonizing. Final image offers resonant, non-literal answer—guardianship as song—though earlier “scars can sing” line flirts with thematic echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</question><comment>Third-person limited stays close to Aria’s perceptual bias; diction is lyrical yet disciplined, matching the kelp-drift tone. No head-hopping; interior monologue remains character-specific and avoids therapy-speak.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; occasional soft phrases (“kelp-drift peace,” “scars can sing”) edge toward poetic convenience but do not loop or stall momentum. No scaffolding or mixed metaphors in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Firefighter daughter of arsonist is fresh angle; grafting as literal healing metaphor is specific and grounded. Risk is moderate—lyric meditation over plot—but the synthesis feels inevitable and avoids genre templates.</comment>
