<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Interiority is lush but abstract; the collector’s “inexplicable connection” and “quest” remain vague, so the final surrender feels pre-ordained rather than earned through visible contradiction or cost. No micro-choice under pressure is dramatized—she simply follows the compass and dissolves into unity. Eccentricity is asserted, not tested.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final image of becoming “one with the lagoon” reconfigures meaning and carries conceptual cost. Yet the causal chain is thin—visions from psychometry lead her here, but the leap from “following symbols” to ontological merger is asserted rather than demonstrated. Orientation is clear early; no lens contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Subterranean lagoon is vividly evoked—petrichor, luminescent fungi, glassy water—yet it remains backdrop; it does not physically constrain her choices or reweight the final image. Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric, but the setting never pushes back.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“to find the place where explanations fail”—is declared, not tested; no tightening or trade-off occurs. Pressure is atmospheric, not causal; the grotto symbols appear and are deciphered without resistance or cost. Escalation is poetic accumulation, not option-narrowing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme of liminal knowing emerges through imagery rather than statement, culminating in the resonant final image. Yet the ambiguity feels slightly engineered—no prior contradiction within the collector complicates the transcendence, so the conceptual repricing is elegant but not deeply earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical, consistent, and textured; perceptual signature is strong (“resonant hush,” “lotus flower” unfolding). No dialogue, so no register clash. Occasional elevated diction (“otherworldly energy”) risks abstraction but stays within the collector’s idiom.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is fluid and rhythmic; figurative language is dense but patterned. A few soft loops (“resonant hush” twice, “mysteries” thrice) and minor scaffold (“she felt… she felt…”) slightly dull momentum. No clarity issues at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Premise—petrichor collector using psychometry to seek the ineffable—is fresh and non-obvious. Execution leans on familiar mystical tropes (ancient symbols, unity with nature) but redeems them through sensory specificity and a quiet, earned finale. Risk is moderate; transformation is internal rather than structural.</comment>
