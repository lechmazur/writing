<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Emilia’s skepticism is stated but never tested in action; her interiority drifts into lyrical summary rather than embodied contradiction. The “courageously kind” label is repeated but never complicates a choice. No micro-choice under pressure reveals hierarchy of values; the final descent feels inevitable, not earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Closure is a gentle Charged Poise—Emilia leaves with “newfound appreciation”—but the cost is asserted, not dramatized. Causality is loose: the tile’s patterns unlock memories off-stage, and the whale-song link is asserted rather than demonstrated. Orientation is clear, yet the drive lens tilts Accumulative without a taught pattern.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The tower’s latticework and sea-view are vivid and selective, filtering through Emilia’s perception. Weather and migration sounds integrate with mood, but the setting never materially constrains her choices; it remains atmospheric backdrop rather than active pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Stakes—“unlock entangled memories”—are declared early but stay abstract; no concrete loss or narrowing of options occurs. Escalation is lyrical accumulation, not pressure. The whales’ song intensifies mood yet never forces a decision or trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of memory-as-tapestry emerges through image rather than statement, but the final paragraph drifts toward gentle moralizing (“power of imagination”). Subtext is present yet thin; the whales and tile never reweight each other in a surprising way.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited holds steady; perceptual signature is consistent, with lyrical diction matching Emilia’s reflective stance. No dialogue to test voice distinction. Occasional elevated phrasing (“alchemy of memory and imagination”) fits the elevated register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is fluid and rhythmic, but figurative layering becomes dense without pattern-teaching; “unheard symphony” and “fabric of time” verge on stock. No loops or scaffold, yet some sentences do double duty only through lyrical inflation rather than precision.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade>
<comment>Familiar mystic-tower trope is refreshed by whale-migration overlay, yet the synthesis remains decorative. The magic-square conceit feels generic; no rule or consequence is particular to this tile. Emotional specificity is present but not transformative.</comment>
