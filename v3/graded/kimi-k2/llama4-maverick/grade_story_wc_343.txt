<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Eli’s curiosity is clear, but interior contradiction and embodied cost are thin; the final resolve to “set course” feels more declared than earned. No contradictory impulse is dramatized mid-scene, and the only cost is deferred to the future.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure is a soft CR (new map, new resolve) rather than a decisive change with on-page cost; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds, but the reconfiguration lacks felt price. Orientation is clear, and the pattern of decoding is legible, yet the ending drifts rather than tightens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Airship cabin, hopscotch board, and starling murmurs are vivid and selective; the hopscotch board constrains the decoding choice. Micro-setting (phrasebook, charts) functions as lived-in tools, though the final image does not hinge on a specific environmental constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—discovery of hidden location—is signaled early; pressure escalates via pattern recognition rather than narrowing options. No visible price is paid on the page; the tightening is intellectual, not tactical or emotional.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme of solitary pursuit versus communal belonging is emergent and resonant, carried by Eli’s withheld discovery. Final image gestures toward conceptual repricing but stops short of charging the silence with undeniable cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Voice is consistent, lyrical, and filtered through Eli’s map-centric perception; perceptual signature is distinct (“scratch of their pen”). No dialogue, so no voice leakage; compression and elision are purposeful and legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with scene needs; minor scaffold (“As the…”) and some soft modifiers, but no loops or mixed metaphors. High information density; sentences advance atmosphere and action simultaneously.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of antique airship, starling murmurs, and hopscotch cipher; tropes feel specific to Eli’s gaze. Risk is moderate—quiet lyric closure rather than spectacle—but coherence remains intact.</comment>
