<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid—“furiously tranquil” embodies contradiction—but the poet’s choices remain observational; the letter-opening beat is too summary to register as a decisive, costly act.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the storm’s beauty reframed by new self-knowledge. Causality is Accumulative/Textural; the lens holds, yet the envelope’s payoff feels slightly unearned because its earlier concealment is only asserted, not dramatized.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The stormlit observatory is tactile—wind, lightning, altitude—and the darkroom timer’s ticking threads through body and storm, constraining the vigil’s rhythm. Spatial choreography is clean; the setting charges the final image without ornamental overload.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—self-reckoning via scars—is signaled early and deepened by storm-mirrored turmoil. Yet escalation is atmospheric rather than tactical; no concrete choice narrows options until the letter is opened, and that act carries minimal on-page cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of mapping internal wounds through external chaos emerges organically from imagery; the storm’s “cartography” reweights the premise at closure. Subtext is strong, but a touch of abstract phrasing (“hidden patterns”) slightly dilutes resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrically consistent, with storm-charged diction and rhythmic control. Compression and elevated register are purposeful; no head-hopping. Occasional poetic abstractions edge toward overwriting but remain within the poet’s perceptual signature.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, sentences doing double duty. Minor loops (“storm…storm”) and near-synonym churn (“turbulence…turmoil”) appear but never obscure causality or dull the closure image. Metaphors cohere; no mixed vehicles.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Fusion of darkroom timer, bus timetable, and storm as psychic mirror feels fresh. Familiar tropes of cathartic storm and hidden letter are transformed through sensory specificity and the vigil conceit. One near-echo of “chorus of the damned” is minor.</comment>
