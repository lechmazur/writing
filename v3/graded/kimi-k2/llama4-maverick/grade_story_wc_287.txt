<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The gardener’s interiority is consistent but generalized; “wistfully pragmatic” is stated rather than embodied in micro-choices. The final beat—descending with the tooth—shows a quiet renunciation, yet the cost feels abstract rather than visceral.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure is a soft Charged Poise: the gardener finishes pruning, dawn rises, and the city is “wrapped in a soft blanket.” The lens is Accumulative/Textural; the cadence shift lands, but the felt cost is diffuse rather than concrete.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Harbor moonlight, fire-escape steel, and the rosebush are vividly rendered and filter through the gardener’s bias. The setting constrains action—only narrow ledges for plants—yet the final image doesn’t hinge on any spatial or object constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—bringing light to shadows—remains thematic rather than tested; no single choice narrows options or exacts a visible price. Escalation is atmospheric, not causal; the oars’ rhythm deepens mood but doesn’t force adaptation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme of nurturing hidden beauty emerges organically from pruning the rosebush and pocketing the tooth. The ending reweights the motif of light without moralizing, but the insight remains gentle rather than piercing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical, consistent, and perceptually specific: “quivering hush,” “soothing rhythm.” No dialogue; the prose’s cadence modulates with emotional intensity. A few near-abstract phrases (“weaving a spell”) slightly dilute immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is fluid and sensory, with rhythmic variation and minimal scaffold. Occasional soft fillers—“as if,” “seemed to”—slightly cushion impact. No mixed metaphors or loops, but density could be tighter under word-limit pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The fire-escape gardener as urban mystic feels fresh; the lockmaster’s tooth repurposed as talisman is a subtle twist. Risk is moderate—lyric meditation over plot—but the synthesis coheres without gimmickry.</comment>
