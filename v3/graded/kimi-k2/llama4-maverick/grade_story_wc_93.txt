<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The herder’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“familiar tingle of the precognitive curse”), but the character’s contradictory impulses remain abstract; the final “smile” and “peace” arrive without dramatized cost or struggle, so the change feels declared rather than earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the vision reweights the premise and the herder’s stance crystallizes with a felt conceptual cost (“weight of unfulfilled prophecies had been lifted”). Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern density tightens toward the final image without causal contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Setting is selective and purposeful: the tidal bluff, aurora, and painted rocks constrain placement and ritual motion; the “borrowed dawn” tone modulates from wonder to earned stillness. Micro-setting (rocks, stardust) charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—unlocking cosmic patterns via stardust—is signaled early and escalates through ritual precision; the final vision tightens options by revealing secrets, but the on-page cost is conceptual rather than viscerally felt, keeping it just below the 8.8 band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of cosmic order versus individual burden emerges through ritual action and image; the final reconfiguration avoids moralizing. Subtext resides in the herder’s tactile reverence and the precognitive curse’s quiet release, though the epiphany edges toward the abstract.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet disciplined, with rhythmic control and precise diction (“borrowed dawn tone,” “symphony of pattern”). POV remains stable; perceptual signature is consistent and character-bound. No dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, vivid, and propulsive; figurative language is selective and pattern-taught. Occasional elevated phrasing (“sacred patterns that governed the cosmos”) risks register drift but remains within the herder’s mythic register. No loops or scaffold detected.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The eel-herder, star-dust ritual, and auroral bluff synthesize into a fresh, non-obvious mythic vignette. Transformation test passes: specificity of ritual mechanics and cosmic stakes would collapse if replaced. Risk-taking is coherent and heightens resonance without obscuring clarity.</comment>
