<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The worker’s interiority is embodied (“steady hum of sorrow”) and their moonlit healing trait constrains action, but the final shift from sorrow to “mundane miracles” is asserted rather than dramatized; no contradictory impulse is shown in-scene. The motivation to map dreams is clear yet feels externally assigned, not mined from internal conflict.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the sextant’s restoration glows with lunar light, sorrow dissipates, and the worker steps into a wider vocation. Causality is lyrical (Accumulative/Textural lens) rather than tight; the pin-drop moment feels symbolic rather than causal. Orientation is swift and sustained; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stormlit tower, ozone, damp stone, and moonlight are vivid and selective, anchoring every beat. The sextant itself becomes micro-setting that constrains the worker’s tactile task. Weather and moonlight evolve with the scene, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—heal the sextant by deconstructing sorrow—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once when the storm and heartbeat sync, but the cost is diffuse; the worker’s sorrow eases without visible forfeiture. Agency is present yet cushioned by the miraculous frame.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of healing-through-brokenness emerges organically from the worker’s task and the moonlit restoration. Subtext is carried by the sextant’s glow and the trees’ silent witness, avoiding explicit moralizing. Final image of “mundane miracles” offers quiet resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited voice is consistent, with tactile diction (“trudged,” “twisted,” “lunar light”). Rhythm modulates with scene intensity; no head-hopping or register drift. Perceptual signature is strong: the worker notices what a maintenance healer would—broken instruments, ozone, moonlight.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose is clean, vivid, and propulsive; no loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated phrasing (“quantifiable force,” “conceptual repricing”) nudges register but stays within lyrical tolerance. Sentence variety supports momentum; no artifacts touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Familiar fantasy elements—tower, storm, moon-magic—are refreshed through the sorrow-as-substance conceit and the maintenance-worker lens. The integration feels inevitable rather than gimmicky. One fresh inflection: sorrow measured like starlight.</comment>
