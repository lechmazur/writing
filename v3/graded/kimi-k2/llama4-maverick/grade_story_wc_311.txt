<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Interiority is evocative but drifts toward poetic summary; the reaper’s grief is palpable yet never crystallizes into a single, costly micro-choice that alters tactics. The “bittersweet ache” remains atmospheric rather than dramatized through action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each paragraph layers sensory density until the final image reweights the atlas page as a charged relic. Closure is a Charged Poise—the reaper’s silent renunciation of forgetting—felt but not yet paid, satisfying the lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Observatory’s stone, dusk light, and salt-tinged air are filtered through the reaper’s selective attention, guiding the crystallizing ritual. The atlas page itself becomes a tactile extension of setting, constraining the final gesture.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—bearing witness to forgotten sacrifices—escalates via density, not causality. A single cadence shift (crystallization) tightens the cost, but the lack of external opposition keeps pressure internal and diffuse.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of memorialization emerges organically from the reaper’s act; no explicit statement intrudes. The atlas page’s final whisper reconfigures the concept of “naming” into an elegy, resonant without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Voice is consistent, lyrical, and biased toward maritime melancholy; no head-hopping. Occasional poetic abstractions (“distant intimacy”) risk distancing but are re-grounded by sensory anchors.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Rhythm modulates well; some sentences verge on purple but momentum survives. One paraphrase loop (“the reaper felt… the reaper’s heart…”) mildly dulls urgency near the climax.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Familiar grief-of-immortal tropes are refreshed by the maritime atlas conceit and crystallization ritual. The synthesis feels inevitable, though the core conceit flirts with elegiac cliché.</comment>
