<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The shepherd’s interiority is evocative—“fjord quiet,” “razor edges”—but motivation stays abstract; no concrete contradiction or micro-choice under pressure. The final “counting backwards” never forces a visible trade-off or cost, so the arc feels observational rather than earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Closure is a gentle Charged Poise: the shepherd returns to vigilance, clocks “at peace,” but the cost is only implied. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—ticking density swells, then settles—yet the lack of a decisive change keeps it short of high-band resonance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Horizon station and hydraulic clocks are sensuously anchored; the mantle clock key’s tactile return recharges the final image. Setting constrains mood and ritual, but never forces a tactical choice, capping the score below 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“to understand what clocks really measure”—is declared early but never tested; no tightening trade-off or visible price emerges. Pressure is atmospheric, not causal, so escalation remains flat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of measured time versus lived time surfaces through image and rhythm, not statement. The final lullaby of ticking offers quiet resonance, but the absence of a cost-bearing choice blunts conceptual weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is hushed, lyrical, and consistent; perceptual signature favors hush and precision. Occasional template cadence (“the shepherd’s eyes… the shepherd’s hand…”) slightly flattens rhythm under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, sensory, and mostly propulsive; a few redundant prepositional phrases (“with a soft click,” “with renewed intensity”) create minor drag. No loops or mixed metaphors, but density could be tighter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Hydraulic-clock guardian counting backwards is a fresh angle on time-mysticism. The execution leans meditative rather than daring; risk-taking is stylistic, not structural, so ingenuity feels moderate.</comment>
