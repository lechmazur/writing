<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical and embodied (“fingers stained with rich soil and sap”), but motivation stays abstract—no contradictory impulse or visible cost when the sculptor chooses to weave empathy into the grove. The final smile registers as sentiment rather than earned renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each paragraph layers sensory density until the porcelain insulator reweights the sculpture and the grove resonates. Closure is a Charged Poise—the grove “still swaying” after the sculptor leaves—yet the cost is diffuse, more atmospheric than personal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The siskin alder grove is rendered with tactile specificity (“rough-hewn trees,” “underbrush”) and functions as both resonant chamber and constraint; the porcelain insulator’s foreign glaze charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean, though the hedgehog event remains off-stage and abstract.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reawakening empathy through music—is signaled early and escalates via incremental resonance rather than reversal. The tightening is textural: silence thickens until the grove vibrates. Cost is atmospheric, not personal, keeping the score below 8.0.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of empathy as restorative vibration emerges organically from the sculptor’s craft and the grove’s response. Final image of trees “still swaying” offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. A touch of abstract phrasing (“empathy in motion”) slightly blunts subtext.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is consistently lyrical, with rhythmic control and selective sensory focus that mirrors the sculptor’s synesthetic perception. No POV drift; diction stays within the artisanal lexicon. Compression and patterned elision are purposeful and legible at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is musical and dense yet propulsive; occasional soft phrases (“deep motivation,” “measure of empathy”) edge toward abstraction but do not stall momentum. No loops or mixed metaphors; sentence rhythm modulates with scene intensity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Premise of a post-silence world re-awakened by arboreal music is fresh; the porcelain insulator’s integration feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk is lyrical rather than structural; transformation is more atmospheric than conceptual, keeping it just below 8.5.</comment>
