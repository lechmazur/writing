<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The negotiator’s interiority is atmospheric but generic; her “uncommonly thoughtful” trait is asserted rather than dramatized. No contradictory impulses surface in-scene; choices are reported, not embodied. The antique pull’s final pocketing is the only micro-choice, but it carries no visible cost or character-specific resonance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise—the negotiator walks away with the pull in pocket, claiming peace—but the cost is asserted, not felt. The lens is Accumulative/Textural; moon phases pattern tension, yet the decisive shift is narrated rather than dramatized. Orientation is clear; no causality breaks, but escalation is soft.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The parapet’s mist and wind are vivid, selective, and mirrored in the emotional hush. Weather constrains visibility and speech volume, shaping the hushed delivery. The antique pull functions as micro-setting, but its materiality never alters a tactical choice; it remains symbolic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Stake—“recycle mistakes into wisdom”—is declared early but never tested on-page; negotiations resolve off-stage. Pressure is atmospheric, not causal; no tightening choice or visible price is dramatized. The breakthrough is attributed to moon phases rather than negotiator agency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of transmuting past harm into wisdom emerges through image and silence, avoiding overt moralizing. The pull’s reprise in the final pocket offers quiet resonance, though the conceptual cost remains abstract. Subtext is present but not sharply charged.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited voice is consistent, with lyrical compression and controlled rhythm. Sensory filtering is biased toward the negotiator’s calm detachment. No dialogue appears; voice sustains the furrowed hush without monotony.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and free of loops or scaffold. Figurative language is restrained; no mixed metaphors. Occasional elevated diction (“recycle their mistakes into wisdom”) edges toward abstraction but does not stall momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>The moon-phase negotiation frame is fresh, yet the prisoner-exchange trope remains familiar and under-transformed. Specificity lies in the atmospheric hush and antique pull, but the plot beats could transplant unchanged. Risk is moderate; ingenuity is present but not bold.</comment>
