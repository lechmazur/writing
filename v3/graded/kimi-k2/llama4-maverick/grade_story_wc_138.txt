<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Kael’s ancient ennui and sudden intrigue land cleanly, but interiority drifts into cosmic abstraction (“a spark of intrigue was lit”) rather than embodied cost. The shadow-self moment crystallizes contradiction—duplicate Kael embodies post-goodbye residue—yet this confrontation is more emblem than struggle. Emotion is signaled, not corporeally tested, so flaws remain scenic décor rather than live constraints.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Narrative tracks a causal arc: boredom → discovery → ritual → emergence. Closure satisfies Resonant Reconfiguration: the doubled Kael reweights “after goodbye” from terror to continuity, with spatial mutiny as Charged Poise. Occasional drifting abstracts—storm “subside” rather than residual energy cost—mutes the final punch.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The prismatic escondite’s walls, magnetic circuits, and storm auroras are vividly selective and ground ritual action. Storm timeline collapses near end—energy should still lacerate—but earlier sensory specificity pins us spatially. Setting constrains ritual range by prism walls, satisfying gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—what remains after goodbye—escalates via ritual build-up. Spatial mutiny offers a tangible test. Cost arrives conceptually but isn’t viscerally felt; duplicate appears as echo, not forfeiture of existence. Escalation thus softens before closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of transformation-after-death emerges organically from ritual outcome. Ends without sermonizing; resonance is imagistic. Duplicate’s phrase “I am what remains” carries conceptual repricing without moral summary, meeting bar.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate stays consistent and lyrical, filtering cosmos through Kael’s sensory lexicon. Distinct diction (“siren’s song,” “prismatic haze”) sustains voice under pressure, aligning with immortal perceptual signature.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose sings but leans ornate in patches (“colors swirled, a kaleidoscope of possibilities”), risking density drift. Strong cadence control and no redundant loops; final image crystallizes clearly. Minor figurative surplus in penultimate paragraphs nips 9-band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</question>
<comment>Fresh splice of immortal ennui, metaphysical post-death speculation, and hard-SF spatial mutiny. Combines mythic resonance with laboratory ritual. Bold integration feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
