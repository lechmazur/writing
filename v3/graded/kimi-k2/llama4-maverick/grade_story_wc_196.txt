<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Emilia’s interiority is textured and consistent, but her choices remain observational; the decisive shift to “guardian of memories” is asserted rather than dramatized through a costly micro-choice. No contradictory impulse is staged in scene; the emotional arc is summary-led.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure is a gentle Resonant Reconfiguration—Emilia’s stance crystallizes into purpose—but the cost is only implied (“broken heart slowly mending”). Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern holds, yet the final tightening lacks a tangible forfeiture on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The foster-care file room is vividly evoked through sensory selectivity (“musty smell,” “accumulated dust patterns”), and the button functions as micro-setting that charges the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent; environment subtly guides her tactile discoveries.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving forgotten kindnesses—is clear early. Pressure deepens via accretion of discovered stories, but no single beat forces a trade-off or visible price; escalation is atmospheric rather than option-narrowing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of magnifying small kindnesses emerges organically from the particulars; the button’s reweighting at closure offers quiet resonance without moralizing. Subtext is carried through gesture and object rather than statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is consistent, lyrical, and filtered through Emilia’s perceptual bias; syntactic rhythm modulates with emotional intensity. No dialogue to test, but free-indirect texture is clean and purposeful.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is fluid and read-aloud ready, but occasional scaffold phrases (“she was no longer just an archivist, but…”) and mild overwriting (“sanctuary of remembrance” twice) dull momentum. No artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Familiar premise—lonely archivist uncovers hidden past—is refreshed by the foster-care context and the dust-pattern forensic conceit. Specificity of the button’s journey from trinket to talisman feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
