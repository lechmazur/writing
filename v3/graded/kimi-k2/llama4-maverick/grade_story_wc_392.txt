<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Maya’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“watchfully calm,” “fortified vulnerability”), but her contradictory impulses remain abstract; the lantern catalyzes memory yet never forces a micro-choice that visibly costs her. The final “liberation” is asserted rather than dramatized through action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—Maya exits “changed”—but the lens is Accumulative/Textural; the lantern’s reprise reweights meaning rather than causing a decisive act. Cost is implied (“no longer controlled”) yet not made visceral on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The tunnel’s damp decay and lantern glow are selective and atmospheric, but the setting never materially constrains Maya’s choices; it serves as backdrop rather than obstacle or resource. The lantern’s history is evocative yet doesn’t alter tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—uncovering the young woman’s preventable death—remains abstract; pressure never tightens through a concrete test or trade-off. Escalation is emotional accumulation rather than narrowing options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme of personal freedom emerges organically from the lantern’s inscription and Maya’s reflection, but the final paragraph edges toward overt articulation (“she was no longer controlled”), blunting subtext. Resonance is present yet slightly sermonized.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice is consistent, sensory, and textured; perceptual signature is strong (“thick with the scent of damp earth and decay”). No dialogue to test, but internal cadence modulates with emotional intensity. Minor drift into therapeutic phrasing near the end.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and vivid; occasional scaffold (“memories that had been entangled… began to untangle”) and mild overwriting (“fortified vulnerability”) slightly dull momentum. No loops or artifacts in the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The fusion of underground-railroad lantern with modern death investigation is fresh, but the emotional arc is familiar self-liberation. Specificity of the lantern’s history and tunnel graffiti adds texture, yet the transformation feels inevitable rather than surprising.</comment>
