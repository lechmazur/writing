<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The timekeeper’s interiority is consistent—curiosity and quiet resolve—but never contradicted or embodied in a high-stakes micro-choice; the final “smile” feels unearned because no prior beat shows a cost paid or path foreclosed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a soft Charged Poise—the capsule’s repair crystallizes understanding—but the causal linkage between garage-sale messages and the decisive insight is asserted rather than dramatized, blurring the lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The emerald silo and the cracked clock are vividly sketched and return in the final image, but they serve more as atmospheric backdrop than active constraints on choice; the capsule itself is the only object that meaningfully narrows options.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—“understand the texture of time passing”—is signaled early and deepened by the capsule’s repair, yet the pressure curve is flat; no visible trade-off or narrowing of options occurs on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of rediscovering meaning in a timeless world emerges through pattern and image rather than statement, but the final smile edges toward sentimentality, blunting the conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice is consistent, with selective sensory detail and controlled rhythm; no head-hop or register drift, though the prose occasionally slips into abstract cadence (“haunting and profound”).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean and rhythmic, but repeated phrases (“timekeeper’s gaze,” “emerald silo”) and stacked modifiers create mild loop artifacts that dull momentum in the middle third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>The conceit of embedding cryptic messages in garage-sale listings is fresh and specific; the timeless-world premise avoids cliché, though the capsule-as-catalyst is familiar SF territory.</comment>
