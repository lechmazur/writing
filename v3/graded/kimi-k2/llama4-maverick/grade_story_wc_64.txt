<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical but generic; the gardener’s “quest” is stated rather than embodied in micro-choices. No contradictory impulses appear on the page; the gardener simply works and then “realizes.” The final “newfound purpose” lacks prior causality and visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Closure is a soft epiphany (“journey just begun”) rather than a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with felt cost. Accumulative/Textural lens is coherent—images layer toward a mood—but the ending merely promises continuation, not a before/after shift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setting is vividly textured: cobalt silo, starlight, lavender dust. These details create atmosphere and subtly guide the gardener’s ritual, but they do not constrain a final choice or charge the closure image, keeping it just shy of 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—deciphering the echoes—is signaled early, yet pressure never escalates; the gardener’s task proceeds without complication or narrowing options. No visible price is paid; the crystal simply “hums” and understanding arrives.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of intention surviving death emerges through imagery rather than statement, but the final paragraph edges toward overt articulation (“reminder of the intentions that lay beyond”), blunting subtext. Resonance is present yet not fully earned by prior struggle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Voice is consistent, lyrical, and atmospheric; perceptual signature favors tactile and olfactory detail. Occasional elevated diction (“velveteen gloom,” “celestial map”) feels ornamental rather than character-bound, keeping it below 8.0.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is fluid and sensory-rich, but repetitive sentence stems (“the gardener… the gardener…”) and mild paraphrase loops dull momentum. No artifacts obstruct closure, yet rhythm could be tighter under pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Combining cemetery caretaking with mystical sound-echoes is fresh, but the execution leans on familiar lyrical tropes. The tapestry-crystal linkage feels inevitable in hindsight, offering modest but genuine transformation of premise.</comment>
