<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Interiority is atmospheric but abstract; the crisis actor’s “benevolently ruthless” trait is asserted rather than embodied in choice. The survivor’s shift from passivity to seeing “opportunities” is too compressed to feel earned. Relationships remain symbolic rather than crucibles of pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the trio poised on the threshold reconfigures the void into possibility. Causality is loose—why the historian arrives now is unexplained—yet the final image satisfies the lens. Orientation is clear within 120 words; whispering gallery anchors space.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>The whispering gallery’s acoustics and chessboard’s missing pawns are vivid, selective, and thematically charged; they constrain the final stance crystallization. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions. The “nomadic penumbra” remains atmospheric rather than materially constraining.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Stake is the void left by the interregnum; pressure tightens as the trio commits to “unbind the past.” Agency is collective, diffuse; no single protagonist’s cost is dramatized. Escalation is tonal rather than causal, yet the final poise carries felt weight.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of small gestures shaping history emerges through image, not statement. The luminous absence motif reweights from loss to possibility at closure. Subtext in the chessboard and footstep-words is coherent; moral complexity is hinted but not fully plumbed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person omniscient voice is consistent, with lyrical compression that suits the gallery’s echo. Syntax modulates with emotional rise; no head-hopping. Distinct perceptual signature is present but could sharpen further under pressure.</comment>

<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; figurative language is selective. Occasional elevated diction (“nomadic penumbra,” “luminous absence”) risks register drift yet remains legible. No loops or scaffold in final third.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Premise of crisis actor + survivor + historian unbinding past via footstep-words is fresh synthesis. Chessboard-pawn absence is a non-obvious symbol that reweights at closure. Risk-taking is moderate; could push further into the penumbra’s logic.</comment>
