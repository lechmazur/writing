<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid (burned skin, pillbox) but the “other self” apparition resolves the conflict without a visible cost or micro-choice; the arc feels therapeutic rather than earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with the reunion image, but the lens drifts from causal search to situational acceptance; the pillbox and snow codes never materially alter the outcome.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mist, bluff, and wet-earth scent create tactile pressure; the clearing’s revelation is spatially coherent. Setting guides mood more than choice, keeping it below 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Stake—“find where unused courage waits”—is clear early, yet pressure plateaus; the apparition offers comfort, not a narrowing of options or felt price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme of self-reconciliation emerges through image rather than statement, but the ending’s uplift edges toward sentimentality, blunting complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Voice is consistent, lyrical, and filtered through the spy’s wary perception; occasional soft-focus phrasing (“silver hush”) repeats without fresh charge.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is fluid and sensory, but “mist swirled around her” and variants loop; one mixed metaphor (“skeletal fingers against the grey”) slightly jars.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Reunion with spectral double is familiar; specificity of burned spy and pillbox helps, yet the overall arc remains recognizable psychological fantasy.</comment>
