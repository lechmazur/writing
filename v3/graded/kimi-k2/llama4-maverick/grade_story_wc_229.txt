<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elian’s interiority is vivid and embodied, but his contradictory impulses remain abstract; the “purifying” belief is asserted rather than dramatized through micro-choices. The final stance crystallizes, yet the cost feels diffuse rather than specific.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the dawn image reweights the premise that “whispers travel farther.” Causality is Accumulative/Textural; the garden scent and vial cork accumulate resonance until the final cadence shift. Orientation is clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question>
<grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>The cobalt lighthouse, garden, and dawn light are filtered through Elian’s perceptual bias; the scent constrains his ritual and charges the final image. Spatial anchors remain coherent; selective sensory detail mirrors internal state without clutter.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—proving quiet intent can span oceans—is signaled early and deepened through the beckoning ritual. Pressure tightens once via the crescendo of “vibrations,” but the visible cost is conceptual rather than concrete.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the tension between loud assertion and quiet transmission; the garden scent and cork reprise reweight the motif without moralizing. Subtext is carried by sensory imagery and ritual gesture.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays close to Elian’s perceptual signature; diction is lyrical yet controlled, modulating with emotional intensity. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with purposeful repetition that teaches the pattern. Minor filter-verb clusters (“he felt”) appear but do not stall momentum or cloud the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of lighthouse keeper, vial cork, and vibrational intent feels fresh; the quiet-transmission premise is explored through lived ritual rather than abstract statement. Risk lies in the lyrical mode, but coherence holds.</comment>
