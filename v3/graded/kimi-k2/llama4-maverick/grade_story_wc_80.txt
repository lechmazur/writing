<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Interiority is evocative (“stoically sensitive,” “hushed blaze”) but remains largely atmospheric; no contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene. The surveyor’s motivation is declared rather than tested under pressure, and the final “smiled” feels unearned because no micro-choice visibly forecloses a path. Character functions more as lyrical lens than agent.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><<comment>Closure is a lyric Resonant Reconfiguration: the surveyor leaves the inkwell behind as “testament to the power of interlaced absence,” reweighting the premise with conceptual cost. Causality is Accumulative/Textural—density of image and cadence shift replace plot turns. Orientation is clear by line 3; no lens ambiguity. The cost is felt in the final image, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Submerged pavilion is vividly textured—“silt and aquatic life,” “warm orange glow”—and the inkwell serves as micro-setting that constrains the final gesture. Sensory hierarchy aligns with professional gaze. Environment guides the only physical choice (retrieve, then relinquish), charging the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving stories against oblivion—is declared early. Pressure deepens via accumulative imagery rather than causal escalation; no single beat narrows options or exacts visible price. Closure is poetic but stakes remain abstract; cost is conceptual, not viscerally tested.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme of “interlaced absence” emerges through image pattern (inkwell, notes, submerged stones) rather than statement. Final image reweights absence as generative, not loss. Subtext is sustained, but theme edges toward overt in final paragraph (“a guiding light to the future”).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Voice is lyrically consistent, with rhythmic control (“the stillness that followed was a welcome respite”). Perceptual signature is distinct—professional detachment laced with elegy. No POV drift; compression and elision are taught early and paid off in closure cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet fluid; occasional soft filler (“the surveyor’s heart burned with a hushed blaze”) slightly dilutes peak beats. No loops or mixed metaphors. Strong sentence variety and tactile specificity. One paraphrase loop (“stories of the past… stories yet to be told”) keeps it from 8.5+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Premise—underwater archeology as elegy—is fresh; execution leans on lyric accumulation rather than novel turns. Inkwell-as-relic motif is familiar but reweighted effectively. Risk is moderate; voice and setting distinguish it from template.</comment>
