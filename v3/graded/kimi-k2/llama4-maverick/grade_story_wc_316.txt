<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Kaito’s contradictory impulses (clone guilt vs. self-reclamation) are named but never embodied in a risky on-the-page action; the meditation stance reads identical at the end as the start, so the “change” is rhetorical not tactile. Emotional labels (“turmoil,” “determination”) stall at summary rather than reveal stress in gesture or breathing. Only the brain jar moment flashes interior contradiction, yet no consequential micro-choice follows.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>No discernible before/after caused by the meditation sequence; the eccentric premise signals an Accumulative/Textural lens yet adds texture without cohesion. Closure is asserted (“He was free”) rather than dramatized—the dojo doors opening does not foreclose any path or make the cost legible. Historical flux remains background static; timeline slippage fails to narrow Kaito’s options or knowledge.</comment>

<comment>Early anchoring—“floating rock dojo, soft hum of levitation engines”—plants spatial footing with sensory restraint. The brain jar recurs like a villainous object, its “haunting reminder” intercut with breath to bond décor to psychic weight. Micro-setting subtler: body on tatami mat is filtered by Kaito’s selective attention (jets, jar, heartbeat). However, none of these details later constrain a single decision or final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade>
<comment>Stakes (“defeat emotional numbness”) are declared but never tested under tangible pressure; the dominant conflict remains internal and static. The clone custody war is backstory flashback, not a live antagonistic force. No escalation beats—the brain jar never shifts meaning, complementary opposites never create escalating tension, and “history rewrites itself” exerts zero consequence on tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of authentic identity vs manufactured duplicate lurks unstated yet stumbles against therapeutic phrasing passes (“embracing the contradictions … vivify”). Subtext surfaces once when the labeled brain is called “a constant reminder,” but the piece halts there instead of weaving the symbol into final resonance. Ambiguity about whether numbness is defeated lacks felt, specific cost to charge the idea.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Narrative voice retains a consistent meditative cadence that widens slightly under Kaito’s stress. Wordiness creeps in (“a determination to confront … through the practice…”) but rhythm steadies during the single sustained paragraph. No dialogue or head-hopping issues exist; POV never wavers; perceptual filter (“soft hum of engines”) stays true to inward focus. Still, the diction tilts toward boilerplate spirituality.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.0</grade>
<comment>Several prolonged phrases that restate the same abstract motion (“numbness … transcend … vivify”) create paraphrase loops costing density. Figurative vehicles—“the very fabric of reality seeming to bend”—teeter on purple yet cease before muddling the key beat. Comma-splice stall appears once or twice without clinical harm. Overall prose is pressure-fed and keeps reader orientation intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Canvas of clone vs original contemplation within a levitating dojo provides distinctive world marker, but the lack of fresh kinetic twist keeps it from maximal freshness. Clone custody war feels conceptually interesting yet underexploited; its SF premise hinted at rather than mined. Blending meditation arc with quantum history rewrites promises a risky synthesis that story stops short of delivering.</comment>
