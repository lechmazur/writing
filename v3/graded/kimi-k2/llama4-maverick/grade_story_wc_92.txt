<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The sentinel’s interiority is serviceable but generic—no contradictory impulses are dramatized in scene. The bronze quill holder and cradle of sparks function as props rather than extensions of her psyche. The final “surge of determination” is declared, not embodied. We never see her flaw or a felt cost for her choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the cradle ignites and the fort is “reborn.” Yet the blackout’s cause, the conspirator’s identity, and the mechanism of the cradle remain off-stage conveniences. Orientation is clear, but causality is soft—events happen “as if” ordained rather than earned.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>The luminous fort at twilight and the blackout are atmospherically vivid, but the setting never constrains the sentinel’s choices. The cradle’s glow is a backdrop, not a tactical factor. Spatial choreography is coherent; the sundial’s shadows are the only detail that guides action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade>
<comment>A single dominant stake—ignite the revolution—is declared early and achieved without meaningful tightening. No live option is foreclosed; the blackout merely enables rather than complicates. Agency is asserted, not tested; cost is absent on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Theme of silent revolution emerges through imagery rather than didactic statement. The cradle as beacon of creativity is coherent but not deepened by contradiction or irony. Subtext is thin; the conspirator’s smile is the only gesture beyond plot function.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays consistent, with a calm, slightly elevated register that suits the sentinel. No dialogue to judge. Occasional stock phrasing (“inky darkness,” “ever watchful”) flattens the voice under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>6.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean but leans on familiar fantasy cadences (“luminous fort,” “ethereal light”). Some paraphrase loops (“new era of freedom and creativity” appears twice). No syntactic muddle, yet little rhythmic urgency in the climax.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>The blackout-as-catalyst and coded sundial angle are fresh touches within a familiar rebellion arc. The cradle of sparks is evocative but not conceptually daring. Specificity is moderate; the story could transplant to another castle without structural loss.</comment>
