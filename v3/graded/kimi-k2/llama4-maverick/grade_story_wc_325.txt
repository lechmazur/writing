<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Lyra’s claustophilia and “stand by the unremembered” motive are stated, not embodied; no contradictory impulse surfaces under pressure. Her interiority is generic (“mind racing,” “sense of peace”) rather than character-specific. The final endurance lacks visible cost—she simply emerges “changed” without on-page evidence of that change.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis—she escapes with codex and altered perception—but the causal chain is thin: gold fleck appears only at the exit, phase transition is asserted rather than prepared, and tidal deadline feels ornamental. Orientation is clear, yet the drive lens (Causal) wobbles because the critical mechanics (cable travel) are withheld until the final paragraph.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>The seafloor facility and cable hum are vividly evoked (“steel walls covered in anemones,” “crashing hush”), but the environment never constrains her choices; it’s backdrop, not obstacle. The codex and gold fleck function as micro-setting objects, yet their integration is late and light. Still, sensory specificity is strong and consistent.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>6.0</grade>
<comment>Stakes (retrieve codex, escape before tide) are declared early and re-stated, but pressure plateaus: no mid-story tightening, no resource lost, no option foreclosed. The phase-transition escape arrives as sudden solution rather than earned escalation. One mild deepening—realizing cables can be used for travel—doesn’t carry visible cost.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>6.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of honoring the forgotten researchers emerges through Lyra’s stated motive and the logbook, yet the story tells rather than dramatizes her bond with them. The final image of “crashing hush” reweights the premise slightly, but the conceptual cost remains abstract. Subtext is present but not sharp.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays coherent; no head-hop. Prose is clean, occasionally lyrical (“torrent,” “monolith”), but lacks a truly distinctive perceptual signature—Lyra’s voice could belong to any determined explorer. No dialogue to test differentiation. Compression is adequate; no intrusive exposition.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Sentences flow; rhythm varies; no loops or scaffold. Occasional stock phrasing (“secrets they had revealed to her”) but nothing that dulls momentum. Information density is solid; setting details are woven through action. Minor overwriting (“filled her entire being”) doesn’t obscure clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Fusing claustophilia, undersea cable phase travel, and memorial duty is fresh, yet the execution leans on familiar tropes (abandoned lab, glowing key). The synthesis feels more clever than inevitable; the story could swap settings with minor edits. Still, the combination is memorable within flash length.</comment>
