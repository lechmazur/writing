<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is lush and embodied—skin drinking scent, tattoos shifting—but motivation (“navigate uncharted emotional depths”) is asserted rather than dramatized until the final paragraph. No contradictory impulses act in scene; the mapmaker proceeds with steady wonder. The stillpoint epiphany lands as earned resonance, but the absence of struggle or visible cost caps the arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the stillpoint’s convergence reweights the mapmaker’s self-knowledge with quiet blaze. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of sensory pattern builds to cadence shift. Causality is loose but coherent under lyric design; no orientation debt. Cost is felt but abstract, limiting 9-band entry.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Ultrasonic forest is rendered through synesthetic detail—trees “sang,” air “alive with scent”—and the compass ring’s glow becomes micro-setting that charges the final image. Spatial anchors are clear; world rules remain consistent. Setting constrains perception rather than action, so 9-band gate not met.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is internal: mapmaker’s need to understand sorrow. Pressure tightens via intensifying melody and constellation pause, but escalation is atmospheric rather than tactical. No visible forfeiture or narrowing of options; cost is conceptual. Sufficient for length but not high-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of harmony between self and cosmos emerges through sensory accumulation, never stated. Final image reweights earlier motifs (ring, tattoos, melody) into quiet blaze of insight. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers. Subtext operates in gesture and silence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric, consistent, and textured—cadences swell and ebb with emotional intensity. Perceptual signature is distinct: synesthetic, tactile, mythic. No dialogue; free indirect style is clean. Occasional elevated diction (“uncharted emotional depths”) edges toward register drift but stays within tolerable range.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is musical and dense; metaphors rarely repeat, rhythm varies. Minor scaffold: “quiet blaze” appears twice without reweighting until final line. No loops or filter-verb stacks. Clarity intact; closure image sharp. One mixed metaphor—“mapmaker was its instrument”—does not obscure meaning.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: blind cartographer guided by ultrasonic flora and skin-borne language. Premise commits fully; no retreat to cliché. Risk lies in lyric abstraction, but coherence holds. Transformation test passes—story would collapse if elements swapped.</comment>
