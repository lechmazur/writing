<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical but generic; the custodian’s “desire to prove coincidences have meaning” is asserted, not embodied. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in scene, and the final choice to touch the orrery feels inevitable rather than costly. The character remains more archetype than individual.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the orrery flares, rekindling knowledge, with a felt cost in the custodian’s awed stance. Causal linkage is thin—why the shard activates the orrery now is unexplained—but the lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds. Orientation is clear by 120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The glass pavilion hums and glints with tactile specificity; the broken prism and orrery act as micro-settings that constrain choice. Sensory detail is selective, though “sweet scent of thistle” edges toward cliché. Setting subtly guides movement via star charts etched on walls.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover lost knowledge—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once when the shard flares, but the cost is more wonder than loss. Escalation is atmospheric rather than causal; the custodian’s agency is largely observational.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme of pattern versus chaos emerges through the custodian’s quest and the orrery’s reanimation. Subtext is present but occasionally spelled out (“driven by a conviction that coincidences…”). Final image reweights the premise without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Voice is consistent, lyrical, and slightly elevated throughout. Syntax modulates with emotional intensity; no head-hopping. Occasional filter verbs (“they felt”) dilute immediacy but fit the meditative tone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Prose is clean and rhythmic, with only minor loops (“as they walked… as they did”). Metaphors are coherent; no mixed vehicles. Density is high, though some phrases verge on purple (“velvet expanse”).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Post-apocalyptic star-seeker trope is refreshed by the glass humming pavilion and the shard of hush. The synthesis feels organic, not checklist. A small risk in lyric compression pays off in the final reconfiguration.</comment>
