<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The visionary is sketched more as an observing lens than a chooser; her “decisions” are abstract (“continue to listen,” “guide the prophet’s rise”) rather than dramatized micro-choices that alter tactics. Interiority drifts toward lyrical summary (“lyrically prophetic mind”) instead of embodied contradiction under pressure. No visible cost is paid by her on the page; the prophet’s rise happens without her stakes being tested.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Closure is a soft Resonant Reconfiguration: the visionary smiles back at a dawn already achieved, but the decisive change occurs off-stage in the populace, not through her agency. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—mood and image accumulate toward a final tableau—yet the ending lacks a felt cost exacted from her. Orientation is clear early; causality is loose, more montage than because/therefore chain.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The stormlit observatory and cobalt portico are vividly anchored and return in the final image, lending atmospheric coherence. However, the setting never physically constrains her choices or supplies resources that alter outcome; it remains backdrop rather than active pressure. Sensory selection is selective and lyrical, supporting tone, but specificity stops short of tactical leverage.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—“shaping a new dawn”—is declared early but stays abstract; no on-page tightening forces a trade-off or visible price from the visionary. Pressure escalates only in summary (“prophet’s influence grew like wildfire”) without a beat where her options narrow or knowledge shifts. Conflict remains observational, not crucible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Theme of shifting allegiance emerges implicitly through radio voices and populace drift, avoiding overt statement. Yet the visionary’s personal stake in this theme is asserted rather than dramatized, so the final resonance feels second-hand. Subtext is present but thin; the ending image reprises the portico without reweighting its meaning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>The lyric third-person voice is consistent, with rhythmic control and selective metaphor (“gritty whimsy,” “cobalt glass”). Perceptual signature is more atmospheric than character-specific; the visionary’s inner diction merges with the narrator’s. No dialogue or head-hopping issues; compression is purposeful, though occasional poetic abstractions edge toward summary.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is fluid and largely free of loops, with pleasing cadence. Occasional stock phrases (“lost in thought,” “winds howling”) and elevated lyricism drift into purple at high-pressure moments. Information density is moderate; some sentences could carry double duty. Grammar and clarity are clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of storm-observatory, radio prophecy, and shifting allegiance offers a fresh atmospheric angle, though the prophet figure remains generic. The visionary’s passive witness role feels like a missed opportunity for deeper transformation. Specificity of image lifts the piece above cliché, but core plot beats could transplant unchanged to another setting.</comment>
