<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Interiority is evocative but remains summary; the genealogist’s guilt is stated rather than embodied in a micro-choice. The driftwood memory flash is the single embodied beat, yet it doesn’t force a decision—she simply “knows she has to continue.” Motivation is clear, but the causal link to the next action is soft, limiting earned cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: she walks into the night “with a sense of resolve,” reconfiguring her stance toward the withheld truth. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—images (watch hand, carvings, terrace) accrue pressure until the final crystallization. However, the cost is only implied; no forfeiture or irrevocable act appears on the page, keeping it shy of higher bands.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The cobalt terrace, watch hand, and driftwood carvings are vividly rendered and filtered through the POV’s melancholy. The terrace’s “lunar glow” and the carvings’ “skeletal fingers” constrain mood and mirror internal stakes. Yet none of these micro-settings physically limits her next move; they serve atmosphere more than tactic, capping the score below 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—uncover a family secret while burdened by her own false histories—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once: the driftwood carving triggers a memory that makes the task personal. However, the escalation is atmospheric rather than causal; no option is foreclosed and no visible price is paid, so the tightening feels moderate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of truth versus manufactured memory emerges organically through the genealogist’s craft and the “sieved hush.” The ending image of the watch hand glinting in darkness offers a non-literal reweighting of her complicity. A touch of thematic echo (“some secrets were meant to remain hidden”) edges toward statement, but the ambiguity largely holds.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical, consistent, and character-specific: “the waves lapping against the shore like a mournful sigh” fits her rueful intellect. Patterned elision (“sieved hush”) is taught early and paid off. No dialogue appears; the internal monologue avoids filter-verb clutter and sustains a hushed cadence that mirrors the terrace gloom.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with strong sensory specificity. Occasional soft scaffolding (“she felt the weight… she began to make her way”) slightly dilutes propulsion. Mixed metaphors are avoided; only minor loops (“secrets that lay hidden… waiting to be uncovered”) appear. Overall craft is polished, but not yet flawless under pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>The black-market genealogist who sells false memories while hunting real ones is a fresh angle; the “sieved hush” concept is a memorable coinage. Driftwood carvings as physicalized secrets is inventive. Yet the plot arc—guilt, walk, resolve—remains familiar; the synthesis feels thoughtful rather than startling, keeping it below 8.8.</comment>
