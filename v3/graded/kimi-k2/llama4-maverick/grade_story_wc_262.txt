<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The crystal gazer’s interiority is atmospheric but generic; no contradictory impulses or micro-choice under pressure. The “unused love” motive is stated, not embodied. Closure is an abstract acceptance rather than a decision with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of letters thickens atmosphere until a Charged Poise reweights the stake. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (“weight of unused love lifting”) with felt cost, but causality between film strip and epiphany remains soft.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Projection booth is vividly anchored early; celluloid scent and flickering frames constrain perception. Micro-setting—the film strip itself—becomes the portal, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent, though larger theater geography stays off-stage.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“find where unused love is stored”—is signaled early. Pressure intensifies via accumulating letters, but no tightening choice or forfeiture occurs; the climax is revelation, not agency. Cost is atmospheric, not tactical.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme of lingering love emerges through image pattern rather than statement. Final image of “hushed thunder” offers non-literal resonance, but epiphany is slightly abstract, muting subtextual punch.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice is consistent, lyrical, and filtered through a spatially imaginative POV. Syntax and rhythm modulate with emotional swell; no head-hopping. Occasional elevated diction (“inexplicable pull”) edges toward purple but stays within tolerable texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is lush yet mostly propulsive; selective figurative language supports mood. A few stacked metaphors (“autumn leaves on a gusty day”) risk overwriting but do not stall momentum. No loops or scaffold; grammar clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Familiar psychic-detective trope is refreshed by vintage-cinema frame and letters-as-memory conceit. Specificity of projection booth and celluloid scent lends authenticity. Risk is moderate; payoff feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
