<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Interiority is evocative but drifts toward abstraction (“desire to forgive the unfinished”); no embodied contradiction surfaces in scene. Micro-choices are implied rather than dramatized; the final beat feels more declarative than earned. Rose-thorn and key function as symbols, not active constraints on her tactics.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure is a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration—she steps back, “peace wash over her”—but the cost is only asserted, not dramatized. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of light, scent, and color intensifies toward the pearl-twilight page. However, the causal chain between key, thorn, and textual subversion remains opaque.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Marble sanctuary and aurora are vividly rendered and filter through the forger’s selective attention; the drip of stalactites supplies a living clock. Yet the setting never materially constrains her choices—she could forge anywhere. Rose thorn and key act as micro-settings but lack tactile interaction after the prick.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—subverting an unjust text—is signaled early and held. Pressure tightens via the “calibrated treason” line, but the actual escalation is atmospheric rather than tactical; no option is foreclosed on the page. Cost is gestured at (“subtle manipulation”) yet never made visible or felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of rewriting history to heal inherited wounds emerges through image and action rather than statement. The pearl-twilight hue reweights meaning at the end, offering a non-literal answer. Still, the moral calculus stays abstract; the reader senses complexity without concrete stakes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical, consistent, and textured; perceptual signature favors synesthetic light and scent. No dialogue, so compression and rhythm carry the beat. Occasional elevated diction (“otherworldly energy”) edges toward purple but remains within the forger’s reverent register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose is lush yet disciplined; sentences vary in length and avoid loops. A few stacked modifiers (“soft, luminous color that was both calming and unsettling”) flirt with overwriting but do not stall momentum. No line-level artifacts touch the closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Premise—calligraphy forgery as historical restitution—is fresh and grounded in sensory detail. The “key with no apparent lock” risks gimmick yet is saved by heirloom mystique. Transformation is modest; the story could survive with altered symbols, but the auroral sanctuary fusion feels singular.</comment>
