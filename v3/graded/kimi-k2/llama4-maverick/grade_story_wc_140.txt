<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Interiority is evocative but generic; the survivor’s “morbid fascination” and “need to understand” are stated rather than embodied. No contradictory impulses are dramatized, and the final contemplation lacks a visible cost. The nameless identity is atmospheric but never tested under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a quiet Charged Poise—the survivor’s layered narrative crystallizes erased histories with felt conceptual cost. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern is taught early and held. Orientation is clear within 120 words; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The container labyrinth is vividly sketched and functions as both literal maze and metaphor for memory. The poison-bottle label is handled twice—first as lure, then as talisman—charging the final image. Spatial choreography remains coherent; tide rhythm supplies temporal anchor.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—recovering erased histories—is signaled early and deepened by each fragment collected. Escalation is textural rather than causal: density of stories increases until the final reconfiguration. No visible price is extracted on the page, limiting tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of memory’s texture emerges organically from the survivor’s accumulative labor. The poison label’s reprise reweights earlier imagery without moralizing. Subtext operates in silence and gesture—no explicit thesis offered.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited maintains consistent distance; perceptual signature is filtered through the survivor’s “differently filtered reality.” Rhythm modulates with tide cadence. No dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is lyrical yet concise; sensory detail is selective and purposeful. Occasional abstract phrasing (“canvas with layers of meaning”) slightly dilutes immediacy. No loops or scaffold artifacts.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of port-city labyrinth as memory palace; poison label as relic of forgotten lives. Concept feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Avoids stock post-apocalyptic tropes.</comment>
