<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Interiority is evocative (“raw solace,” “open wound”) yet drifts toward summary; the censer foot and moon-phase trait are introduced early but never alter a present choice, so the final acceptance feels more stated than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Closure is a quiet Earned Stasis—acceptance at dawn—yet the causal chain from midnight calls to that moment is asserted rather than shown; orientation is clear, but the lens (Accumulative/Textural) is only loosely taught.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Starlit signal station and wrecked landscape are atmospherically vivid, but the setting never physically constrains her path or resources; the censer foot serves as micro-setting yet remains inert, so the environment doesn’t tighten the final choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—reclaiming the geography of loss—is signaled early and reiterated, but pressure escalates only through lyrical accumulation; no single beat narrows options or exacts a visible price before the dawn tableau.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of rebuilding from fragments emerges organically from image pattern (patchwork, salvage, map-making) and is left resonant rather than stated; the final plain reweights earlier motifs without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is textured and consistent, with rhythmic control (“canvas of shadows and light,” “topography of loss and memory”); compression and elision are purposeful, though occasional elevated diction edges toward the poetic-generic.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is generally lean and vivid, but repeated stems (“as she…”) and near-paraphrase loops (“a sense of…”) dull momentum; no figurative muddle at climax, yet minor scaffolding accumulates.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Reverse migration through a moon-tuned post-industrial wasteland is a fresh synthesis; the concept commits fully, though the execution leans on familiar lyric tropes rather than surprising turns.</comment>
