<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical but generic; no contradictory impulses on the page. The “net-mender” label never constrains any choice—she could be any reflective wanderer. Closure is a serene acceptance rather than a renunciation with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as quiet Charged Poise, but the drive lens is Accumulative/Textural and the cost is only implied. Orientation is clear early; no causal reversals, only deepening mood. The whisk and moon path serve as pattern, not plot.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Evocative sensory layering—mist, lapping water, firefly light—creates texture that supports the Accumulative lens. Micro-setting (stone bench, clearing) is present but never constrains action. Final image recharges earlier motifs without physical leverage.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is abstract: “grasp hidden truths.” Pressure never tightens; no live option is foreclosed. The walk along the moon path is atmospheric, not tactical escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme of unseen labor emerges through image rather than statement. Subtext is present but diffuse; no charged reprise reweights the premise. Resonance is gentle, not unsettling.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Voice is consistent, lyrical, and POV-anchored. Rhythm modulates with mood; no head-hopping. Occasional elevated diction (“scintillatingly somber”) feels slightly self-conscious but stays within tolerable range.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is fluid, with minor loops (“hidden patterns” repeated without new pressure). Figurative language is coherent; no mixed metaphors. A few filter verbs dull immediacy but do not obscure closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade>
<comment>Fusion of net-mending philosophy with moon-path mysticism is fresh but under-exploited. Firefly season and bamboo whisk feel chosen for mood, not necessity. No single risk-taking move distinguishes the piece.</comment>
