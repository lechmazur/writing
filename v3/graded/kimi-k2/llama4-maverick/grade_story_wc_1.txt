<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Interiority is evocative but drifts into abstract self-diagnosis (“felt a sense of disorientation,” “overwhelming desire to discover purpose”) rather than embodied contradiction. The final stance crystallizes, yet the cost is asserted rather than dramatized—no concrete forfeiture is shown on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the ledger, frost, and scorched testament converge to reconfigure her purpose. However, the lens tilts Accumulative/Textural, and the single tightening beat (ledger → frost pattern) is elegant but under-motivated; causality is lyrical rather than driven by choice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Canyon and frost are vividly rendered and filter through the artist’s perceptual bias. The frost patterns finally charge the closure image, satisfying the 9+ gate, yet the environment never actively constrains her choices—she could have decoded the ledger elsewhere.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reclaiming family truth—surfaces early. Pressure tightens once when frost patterns echo the ledger code, but the escalation is observational, not agonistic; no visible price is paid on the page to earn the insight.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme of finding meaning in stillness emerges organically from imagery rather than statement. The final image reweights the premise, yet the conceptual cost remains gentle—more affirmation than reckoning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical, consistent, and textured; perceptual signature is strong (“inky shadows,” “drifting resonance”). Compression and patterned diction suit the Accumulative lens, though occasional elevated phrasing edges toward poetic boilerplate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Prose is fluid and read-aloud ready, with rhythmic variation. Minor scaffold appears (“she felt,” “she knew”) and a few near-paraphrase loops dull momentum, but no artifact obscures closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Fusion of glass artistry, smuggler’s ledger, and frost code feels fresh, yet the underlying quest-for-heritage arc is familiar. Specificity of craft and landscape elevates it above template, but risk-taking is moderate.</comment>
