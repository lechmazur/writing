<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The cartographer’s curiosity is stated but never tested by a concrete dilemma; interiority drifts into abstract “legacy” without embodied contradiction. No micro-choice alters tactics; the ending is acceptance, not earned renunciation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Closure is a soft thematic summary rather than a decisive change; the cartographer simply keeps mapping. Causal linkage between film, diaries, and final stance is asserted, not dramatized.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Ivy-veiled passage and cold hearth are evoked with selective sensory detail, but neither constrains a pivotal choice or charges the final image. Setting remains atmospheric backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Stakes—“what walls dream”—stay abstract; no tightening beat forces trade-off or visible cost. Pressure is diffuse nostalgia rather than escalating constraint.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of legacy emerges through imagery but is ultimately spelled out in the closing paragraphs. Subtext yields to explicit statement, blunting resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is consistent, lyrical, and slightly antiquated, fitting the antiquarian mood. However, the cartographer’s perceptual signature lacks idiosyncratic detail; diction is elegant but generic.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is fluid yet loops on “corridor,” “legacy,” “whispers” without new pressure. Several sentences restate the same emotional beat, diluting momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.0</grade>
<comment>Mapping haunted memory via echo cartography is fresh, but the execution leans on familiar gothic tropes without transformative twist. Risk is moderate; payoff modest.</comment>
