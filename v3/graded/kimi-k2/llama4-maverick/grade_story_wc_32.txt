<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid—“stoically sensitive” is embodied in the deliberate slowness of the hands and the rock-steady stance under crescendo—but the final smile feels slightly unearned because the cost of the gamble is asserted rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the broken crozier is transformed, destiny is interrupted, and the lens is Accumulative/Textural—the density of twilight, scent, and vibration tightens until the new creation crystallizes. One transition (gathering fragments → weaving pattern) is coherent and taught early.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The ember nexus is more than backdrop; its sulfur stink and scorched earth constrain the alchemist’s breathing and tools, while the twilight’s frozen bloom charges the final image. Spatial anchors are present by line 4.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—shatter stifling destiny—is signaled early and tightened through successive approximation; the final reconfiguration forecloses the old path. Cost is implied in the “trepidation” on the alchemist’s face, but not viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of creative destruction emerges organically from the alchemist’s handling of the crozier; no moralizing statement intrudes. The final image of the “twisted, beautiful thing” offers a resonant, non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is textured, lyrical, and consistent; perceptual signature filters every detail through the alchemist’s stoic sensitivity. No dialogue, so no register clash.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; occasional stacked modifiers (“frozen bloom of color”) flirt with overwriting yet serve the accumulative design. No loops or scaffold detected.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Familiar alchemist trope is refreshed by the fusion of sacred relic and creative-destruction concept; the crozier’s rebirth feels inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
