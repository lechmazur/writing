<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Interiority is evocative but drifts into abstract self-diagnosis (“dimensionally homesick,” “make friends with uncertainty”) without embodied contradiction. The pendant’s shift from trophy to key is asserted rather than dramatized through micro-choice. Earned stasis is present—she accepts perpetual watch—but the cost feels generalized, not specific to her flaw.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the mist clears, statues shift, and she embraces uncertainty with the pendant glowing. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of mist and statues reweights the stake. Causality is loose; the turn hinges on reverie rather than a concrete trigger, but the final image reconfigures meaning with felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Frozen garden and mist are vividly rendered and filter through the guardian’s perceptual bias. The statues’ shift from macabre to serene mirrors her internal reconfiguration, charging the closure. Pendant’s glow and mist’s thickness constrain her path, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—safeguarding knowledge vs. crushing isolation—is signaled early. Pressure tightens via the mist’s thickening and the statues’ gaze, forcing her to interiorize exteriors. Cost is conceptual (perpetual vigilance) but not viscerally felt on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of embracing uncertainty emerges through the guardian’s shift from burden to acceptance. Subtext resides in the statues’ changing expressions and the pendant’s glow. Final image avoids moralizing, offering resonant ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice is lush, consistent, and filtered through the guardian’s melancholic perception. Syntax and diction match her arcane, introspective stance. No dialogue; internal monologue avoids filter-verb clutter. Occasional elevated phrasing (“dimensional harmonics”) risks register drift but stays within her lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical and propulsive, with rhythmic variation. Some metaphor stacking (“ethereal tentacles,” “morbid perfume”) borders on purple but serves atmosphere. No loops or scaffold; clarity intact. Minor register drift in “conceptual repricing” phrasing.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Familiar gothic-fantasy tropes (mist, statues, cultist token) are reconfigured through the guardian’s dimensional homesickness and the library’s metaphysical stakes. The shift from horror to serenity feels earned. Risk lies in the lyric mode; it pays off in the final image.</comment>
