<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Naomi’s curiosity is palpable, but her choices remain largely observational; the parley with Ada is the single active beat. Ada’s retrocognitive state is atmospherically vivid yet never constrains or enables a concrete action on the page. Interiority is textured (“inexplicable connection,” “heart still ablaze”), but contradictions or micro-choices under pressure are absent. The ending’s sense of purpose feels asserted rather than earned by prior causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The diary discovery is the inciting spark, yet its decryption is narrated rather than dramatized, softening the causal link. Closure is a lyrical reprise (“she would return…until the secrets were fully revealed”)—a Charged Poise—but the cost remains conceptual rather than felt on the page. Orientation is clear early, and the single scene holds, but the lens tilts toward Accumulative/Textural without a decisive tightening. The ending’s promise of return forecloses nothing now.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>The zeppelin library is richly sensed (“aged paper,” “soft hum”), and the obsidian lagoon’s mirror-like surface reappears to frame the final image, charging the mood. Spatial anchors are immediate and stable; bodies and objects track cleanly. The setting’s influence on choice is suggestive rather than concrete—no door locks or altitude problem shapes tactics—so it falls short of the 9+ gate. Still, the atmosphere is integral and coherent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—“uncover the truth”—is signaled early and reiterated, but the only escalation is the gradual deciphering of debris patterns; no option is foreclosed or price visibly paid. Pressure is atmospheric, not causal, aligning with the Accumulative lens. The parley deepens knowledge yet does not tighten the protagonist’s choices. A single meaningful intensification is hinted at but not realized on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Theme of memory’s persistence and the ethics of archival truth emerges through image and dialogue rather than statement. The lagoon’s mirroring and Ada’s looping memory create a resonant counterpoint, inviting reflection on what should be unearthed. The final image reweights earlier motifs without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers effectively, though the thematic cost is more conceptual than visceral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays close to Naomi’s selective attention; perceptual signature is consistent (“fingers trailed over the spines”). Diction is elevated but remains within Naomi’s scholarly register. Dialogue is sparse yet purposeful, carrying subtext in hushed tones. No head-hopping or register drift; rhythm modulates with the zeppelin’s lull and the hush of reverie.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is lyrical yet disciplined, with varied sentence lengths that echo the zeppelin’s drift. Occasional soft-focus phrases (“swirl of memories and emotions”) edge toward abstraction but do not clog momentum. No loops or scaffold; information density is high. Metaphors are coherent, though a few (“searing reverie”) flirt with excess heat without embodiment.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>The floating archive and retrocognitive librarian synthesize familiar tropes into a fresh, dreamlike frame. The encrypted diary and debris-code language feel invented for this world rather than borrowed. Specificity of the obsidian lagoon and the airborne library anchors the concept. While the emotional arc is recognizable, the atmospheric execution and charged imagery elevate it beyond template.</comment>
