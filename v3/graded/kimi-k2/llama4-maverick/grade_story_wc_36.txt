<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied (“memories flood back – triumphs and failures”), but the arc is more reverie than choice; the final “smile” is earned yet lacks a visible, irreversible cost. Motivation is clear but static; no contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the flute’s silence and the sentinel markers reconfigure her stance toward future returns, with the cost felt in her “newfound reverence.” Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern holds, though driftwood markers appear late and lightly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Thunder-echo range and canyon hush are vivid and atmospheric; the clearing’s driftwood markers finally constrain her path back, charging the closure image. Early anchors are secure; micro-setting (flute, satchel) also constrains action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</question><comment>Dominant stake—insight through failure—is signaled early; pressure tightens as the music blurs reality, but the cost is more metaphysical than tactical. One meaningful deepening occurs, yet options are not visibly foreclosed on-page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of learning through failure emerges organically from her memories and the flute’s trial; final silence offers a resonant, non-moralizing answer. Subtext in gesture (“carefully re-cased”) is effective, though driftwood motif feels tacked on.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical, consistent, and perceptually specific (“avalanchingly quiet,” “sagebrush and distant rumble”). Rhythm modulates with emotional rise; no POV leakage. Compression and elision are purposeful and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose is fluid and image-dense; occasional purple flourishes (“vortex of sound that was both beautiful and terrifying”) risk overwriting but do not stall momentum. No loops or scaffold; grammar clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Transforms the familiar “journey to wisdom” trope through sensory specificity and the charged flute ritual. The canyon hush as both literal and metaphysical constraint feels fresh. Risk is moderate but coherent.</comment>
