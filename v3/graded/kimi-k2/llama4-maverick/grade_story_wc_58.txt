<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The traveler’s interiority is vivid and embodied, but choices remain observational; the “obituaries for the living” premise is evocative yet never tested by an on-page decision that alters the present moment. The final beat—snapping the thread—carries symbolic weight but lacks prior causality that would make the renunciation feel earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the garden’s silence is reconfigured into “quiet, otherworldly music,” and the cost is the irrevocable snap of the thread. Causality is accumulative/textural; the pattern of absence and writing tightens into the final image without contradiction. Orientation is clear by ~80 words; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The shadowed autumn garden is rendered with selective, sensory precision; damp earth and lunar glow constrain mood and pacing. The palace carpet thread functions as micro-setting/object that charges the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent; no floating props.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—mapping the geography of healing—is signaled early. Pressure deepens through accumulative texture rather than causal turns; the act of writing becomes the tightening. Cost is felt in the snapped thread, but escalation is modest and largely internal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of absence-as-presence emerges organically from the traveler’s writing ritual and the town’s emptiness. Subtext operates in gesture and silence; no moralizing. Final image reweights the premise without explicit statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical, consistent, and character-specific; perceptual signature favors texture over plot. Syntax modulates with emotional intensity. No dialogue; no POV leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is lush yet controlled; occasional near-repetition (“shadowed garden… shadows”) is minor. Rhythm breathes with scene needs. No mixed metaphors or scaffold loops in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>The conceit of “obituaries for the living” offers a fresh angle on elegy; transformation test passes. Thread-as-connection motif is specific rather than generic. Risk is moderate; execution coherent.</comment>
