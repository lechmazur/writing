<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Erebus’s desire to restore balance is stated but never tested; he never chooses between competing values or suffers visible cost. Interiority is atmospheric (“coax music from the most lifeless of boxes”) rather than embodied under pressure. The single on-page character remains consistent, yet no contradictory impulse or micro-choice alters his trajectory. Closure is gentle stasis, not earned renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the crystalline note reconfigures silence into song with felt conceptual cost (light reclaimed from midnight). Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of resonance intensifies until final cadence shift. Orientation is clear by 120 words; no causality breaks. One tightening beat suffices for length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Resonance chamber is evoked through tactile sound (“air vibrated with whispers”) and tool-specific detail (“luminescent orbs”). The golden chip and music box serve as micro-settings that constrain Erebus’s choices. Sensory hierarchy is biased to auditory and luminous, matching POV. Spatial choreography remains coherent; no static exposition.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</question><comment>Dominant stake—restoring lost song to an intact box—is signaled early. Pressure tightens via resonance alignment, but agency is largely intuitive; no trade-off or forfeiture is dramatized. Cost is conceptual (light reclaimed) rather than personal. One meaningful intensification meets length requirement.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Theme of balance between silence and song emerges through concrete repair action rather than statement. Subtext operates in the chip’s dimming glow—an unspoken price. Final crystalline note offers resonant, non-literal answer. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical, tactile, and consistent: “tinkersong wonder,” “covenant of rust.” Syntax modulates with deliberate slowness during repair, accelerating at the release of the note. No dialogue; interior texture is coherent. Occasional elevated diction (“transmutation,” “ethereal”) fits mystic frame.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid; each sentence layers atmosphere or process. No loops or scaffold. Figurative language is selective (“tear in the fabric of silence”) and paid off. Minor register drift (“philosopher’s stone”) is genre-motivated. Final cadence is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: music-box repair as metaphysical restoration, philosopher’s stone fragment as tuning fork. Tropes are transformed through specificity of craft. Risk lies in quiet lyricism rather than plot twist; coherence remains. Feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
