<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The boy’s motivation to “thread the labyrinth with his own story” is stated but never dramatized; no micro-choice under pressure shows how this desire alters tactics or exacts cost. Interiority drifts into atmospheric summary (“he felt…”) rather than embodied contradiction. The final beat merely hovers at the threshold—no earned renunciation or decisive action—so the character arc stalls.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Closure is missing: the piece ends on atmospheric suspension rather than a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with felt cost. The inferred lens (Accumulative/Textural) is taught, but the promised tightening never arrives; the labyrinth remains unthreaded and stakes unaltered. Orientation is adequate, yet the absence of a culminating beat breaks causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The lighthouse-prison and lattice are vividly evoked through salt, decay, and copperlight, anchoring mood. However, the setting never constrains a choice or charges the final image; it remains backdrop. Spatial choreography is coherent, but the environment’s potential to shape tactics is unexplored.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>A dominant stake—uncovering hidden stories—is signaled early, yet pressure never escalates; the boy’s agency is limited to walking and noticing. No meaningful tightening or cost is dramatized. Coincidence and atmosphere substitute for escalating conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>Theme of inherited narrative burden glimmers through the father’s legacy and the lattice motif, but it stays implicit and unresolved. Subtext is present yet lacks a final reweighting; the ending offers no resonant reconfiguration of meaning. Complexity is hinted, not tested.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is atmospheric, lyrical, and consistent; perceptual signature favors hush and copperlight. Syntax modulates with mood, though occasional filter phrases (“he could feel”) dilute immediacy. No head-hopping; POV remains stable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is generally clean and rhythmic, with selective sensory detail. A few loops (“the boy felt… the boy knew…”) and elevated diction (“specter,” “labyrinthine”) flirt with overwriting but do not obscure clarity. No artifacts touch the final beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>The fusion of fairy-tale echo (“cry wolf”) with Gothic lighthouse-prison is fresh, yet the story does not push the premise to a non-obvious conclusion. Specificity of lattice and copperlight helps, but the ending feels inevitable rather than transformative. Risk is moderate; payoff muted.</comment>
