<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Aria’s interiority is vivid—her “toes curled over the edge” and the moonstone’s pull are embodied—but the “cosmic verse on mortal skin” motive is asserted rather than dramatized until the final dance. The exile backstory is summary, not crucible. The earned stillness at the end carries felt cost, yet the obsidian grace is more label than lived contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the dance layers density until the verse “etches on her skin,” a Charged Poise that reweights the stake. Orientation is swift; causality is lyric rather than stepwise, coherent under the chosen lens. Closure lands on the page with visible transformation and cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The twilight garden is rendered through scent, lapping waves, and star gaps that literally guide the choreography. The moonstone cabochon functions as micro-setting, constraining her hand and later charging the final image. Spatial anchors hold; sensory selection is purposeful and POV-filtered.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transcribing the cosmos onto flesh—is signaled early and tightened by the dance’s crescendo. The pressure is textural rather than causal: each swirl narrows possibility until the verse manifests. Cost is the exile’s solitude and the irreversible skin-mark, legible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of art as cosmic conduit emerges through action, not statement. The nostalgia ban’s absence is felt as negative space, freeing but also isolating. Final image of the fading speck reweights the premise without moralizing, though a touch of abstract phrasing keeps it shy of the 9-band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical, consistent, and perceptually specific—“obsidian grace,” “gaps between stars”—without purple drift. Syntax modulates with the dance’s rhythm; no head-hopping. Compression is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense. Occasional soft phrases (“seep into her bones,” “gift beyond measure”) flirt with cliché but do not stall momentum. No loops or scaffold; figurative language serves the beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The fusion of tide-dance mysticism with skin-etched cosmos feels fresh, not derivative. The nostalgia ban as negative constraint is inventive. Risk is present in the lyric mode, but specificity of motion and image keeps it grounded.</comment>
