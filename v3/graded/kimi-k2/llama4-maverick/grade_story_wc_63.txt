<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Interiority leans on diagnostic therapy-speak—“feel engulfed,” “make amends”—rather than embodied contradiction. Elara’s desire for incremental absolution is stated repeatedly but never forces a micro-choice that costs her the old self; the rake handle offers only affirmation. No flaw-led error or visible trade-off triggers her walk; the change is too smooth, lacking earned friction at the end.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Drive drifts; causal link between seeing inscriptions and walking is inferential rather than dramatized. Closure beats with Charged Poise—“I step into light” echo—but no external price is shown or foreclosed, so the cost feels conceptual, not lived. Orienting landmarks are clear; no caps invoked.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Obsidian ridge’s salt spray and rocky torque constrain footing and mood; the tower’s pendulum arc anchors space. Micro-setting—the cracked rake handle—functions as prop that Elara physically manipulates, tying reflection to action. Sensory specificity is selective, avoiding catalog, and the final lunar glow recharges the ridge’s darkness. Enough to satisfy the lower 7+ band but not the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade>
<comment>Stakes—self-forgiveness and shared balance—are declared not tested by an external dilemma. Single tightening scene (pick up handle → walk) lacks rising contradiction or resource loss; escalation is emotional, not causal. Agency is interior; no live option narrows in the scene window.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of incremental recovery emerges via repetitive assertion rather than dramatized cost; resonance flattened by final-paragraph “redemption is within grasp.” Motif (pendulum rhythm) recurs without shifting meaning under pressure; subtext remains largely on surface.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Narrative voice is consistently lyrical without head-hop; metaphors (tidal obsidian, brass heartbeat) are apt for a solitary technician’s heightened perception. Repetition of “pendulum bob resumed its swing” and similar cadences borders on template but stays within acceptable range for lyric mode.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is vivid and read-aloud smooth; occasional looping near-synonyms (“stillness give way to motion…continue to emerge”) creates mild scaffold. No mixed metaphors or clarity failures. Density holds; no artifacts threaten closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh only in grafting clock-tender mythos to geologic setting; incremental absolution trope is familiar. Rake-handle as portable conscience is clever but executed more as talisman than mechanism. Overall synthesis pleasant but not strikingly original; transformation could swap ridge and clock with minimal change.</comment>
