<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Emilia’s “emotionally rational” label is stated but never embodied in a contradictory impulse; her interiority is smooth exposition. The final smile feels unearned because no prior beat shows her paying a visible cost for the truth she rescues.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a tidy success beat—sunlight, smile, ivy relaxing—without a felt or conceptual price. The causal chain is clear (find letter → decode → leave), but the ending lacks the required cost under the Causal lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The station’s damp rot and ivy are vivid and selective, but they never constrain Emilia’s choices; the ivy merely “seems to relax” at the end, a decorative echo rather than a force that charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—rescuing truth from lies—is declared early, yet pressure never tightens; the archive yields its secret without resistance or trade-off. One micro-choice (picking up the letter) is not enough escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The theme of noble lies emerges organically from the letter’s content, but the story resolves into a neat victory that blunts moral complexity. The final sunlight image offers little reweighting of the premise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays consistent; diction is clean, though occasionally lapses into generic historian cadence (“tangled web of history”). No dialogue to test voice distinction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is fluid and mostly free of loops, but metaphors like “morbid perfume” and “ghostly figure” feel slightly stock. No artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The premise—historian in ruined station decoding a medieval letter—offers mild freshness, yet the plot beats follow a familiar treasure-hunt arc without a transformative twist.</comment>
