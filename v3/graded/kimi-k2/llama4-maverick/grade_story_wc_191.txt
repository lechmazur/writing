<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Aria’s curiosity and determination are clear, but her interiority is generic (“her heart quickened,” “renewed determination”) rather than embodied or contradictory. The ruby flake’s energy surge is the only moment her body reacts, and it’s glossed. No visible cost or flaw complicates her ascent; she succeeds without struggle or renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The causal chain is linear and coherent: ruby flake → murals → stairway → throne. Closure is a Decisive Change (throne claimed), but the cost is asserted rather than dramatized—“she would forever be bound” is summary, not felt. Orientation is swift; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>The orchard’s iridescent bark and cybernetic birds are vivid, but they remain backdrop; only the ruby flake’s light actively guides choice. Spatial choreography is clear, yet the environment never constrains Aria—she walks unimpeded. Final image of twin suns is lovely but doesn’t reweight the premise.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—claim the throne—is signaled early. Pressure is the sunrise deadline, but it never tightens; Aria reaches the top with time to spare. No meaningful trade-off or escalation; the stairway simply appears when needed. Stakes remain abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of reclaiming lost glory emerges through murals and throne, but it’s stated in the final paragraph rather than resonating through image or gesture. The “futuristic nostalgia” tone is consistent yet superficial—no ironic tension or reconfiguration of meaning at the end.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays anchored to Aria; no POV drift. Diction is elevated-fantasy standard (“loomed in her mind’s eye,” “stardust”)—consistent but not distinctive. Rhythm is smooth, with purposeful paragraphing; no experimental compression or elision.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, vivid, and propulsive, but leans on stock phrases (“weight of her quest settling upon her shoulders”). No loops or mixed metaphors. Information density is good; each sentence advances scene or mood. Minor overwriting in descriptive passages keeps it from the 8-band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade>
<comment>Post-post-apocalyptic orchard and data-rich murals freshen the quest trope, yet the arc—artifact guides hero to throne—remains familiar. Specificity (ruby flake, cybernetic birds) helps, but the transformation isn’t surprising; any planet and any relic could substitute.</comment>
