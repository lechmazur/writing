<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Interiority is evocative (“felt herself becoming a conduit”) but remains abstract; no contradictory impulse is dramatized in scene. The cartomancer’s curiosity is asserted rather than tested under pressure, so the final quiet satisfaction feels unearned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Closure is a soft Charged Poise: dawn light and coiled tape crystallize her stance without visible cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern density increases—but the tightening is more mood than irreversible choice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rain-beaded skylight and onyx cards are vivid and consistent; the loft’s shifting light subtly mirrors interior state. Yet the setting never physically constrains her choices; it’s backdrop, not lever.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Stated stake—“map cultural patterns lost in the crashes”—remains thematic; no concrete test or trade-off appears. Pressure is atmospheric, not causal; the night’s work changes nothing we can see.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme of inherited mystery versus engineered knowledge is coherent but delivered through lyrical exposition rather than dramatized conflict. Final image offers quiet resonance, yet the conceptual cost is implied, not palpable.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Voice is lush, rhythmic, and consistent; perceptual signature filters every detail through the cartomancer’s arcane focus. Occasional poetic drift (“mystical sanctuary”) edges toward purple but stays controlled.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is fluid and sensory, but repetitive cadences (“as she worked… as the rain… as the first hints”) dull momentum. No line-level artifacts touch closure, yet density could be tighter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Fusion of post-crash crypto aftermath with cartomantic reverse engineering feels fresh; avoids stock tropes. Risk is moderate—lyric meditation over plot—but specificity of onyx-ink craft keeps it memorable.</comment>
