<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Aria is sketched rather than embodied; her “calling” is asserted, not dramatized through contradictory choice. No interior conflict surfaces; the iceberg decision is presented as inevitable epiphany. The muted inhabitants remain off-stage props, so status/relationship pressure is absent. Earned change is announced, not paid for on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Closure is a declarative Conceptual Repricing (“era of words ending”) rather than a dramatized pivot; cost is abstract. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, but escalation is diffuse—repetitive paragraphs of rising wonder without tightening stakes. Orientation is clear early, yet causality between iceberg arrival and universal linguistic shift is asserted, not built.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>The bluff above clouds, kinetic sculpture, and iceberg fragment are vividly sensed and return in the final image. However, the setting constrains no tactical choice; it serves as luminous backdrop rather than obstacle or tool. Spatial choreography is coherent; weather and light are filtered through Aria’s awe. Micro-setting (sculpture) is foregrounded but never limits action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“preserve the color of wonder”—is stated early but never tested or opposed; pressure plateaus. No meaningful tightening or trade-off appears; the sculpture’s upgrade proceeds without friction. Agency is observational; coincidence (iceberg arrival) initiates, not complicates. Cost is metaphorical, not felt on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of post-linguistic communion emerges through imagery rather than moralizing, yet its emergence is too smooth—lacks struggle-born insight. Subtext is thin; silence is literalized rather than explored through gesture or withheld speech. Final image of glistening sculpture offers quiet resonance but no conceptual repricing that reweights prior material with new ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice is consistent, with controlled cadence and selective sensory detail. No dialogue, so no voice leakage. Diction remains within Aria’s contemplative register; slight poetic inflation (“symphonies of truth”) is motif-consistent. Perceptual signature is present but generalized; stronger idiosyncrasy could heighten immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is fluid and largely free of loops, but rhythmic repetition of “glisten,” “symphonies,” and “whispers” dulls impact. Some sentences stack ethereal modifiers without fresh information. Line-level clarity is high; no grammar or tense slips. Compression is adequate, yet occasional filler phrases (“stood as a testament”) slacken momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Premise—bell tuner on cloud bluff forging post-verbal art—is fresh, though echoes of eco-fantasy lyricism. Iceberg fragment as prism for universal truth is a striking synthesis. Risk is moderate; execution leans safe rather than daring. Specificity of kinetic sculpture mechanics could deepen originality; as is, concept outruns lived detail.</comment>
