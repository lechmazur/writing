<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>A passive protagonist whose trait is asserted rather than dramatized; no evident internal contradiction or visible flaw complicating the climax, and every micro-choice flows from fixed serenity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Shadow-work-as-dimension-key appears first at paragraph four, too late to anchor causality; closure offers a “creaked open” dimension but no on-page Decisive Change or visible cost, leaving the Resonant Reconfiguration more asserted than earned.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The recycled ship is evoked with tactile diction (“worn metal and faded wires,” “scent of aged paper”), but never constrains Aurora’s choices or the closure image; details are sensory wallpaper rather than tactical leverage.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>A single escalating stake—unlock the dimension—persists, but pressure never tightens via obstacle or fork; progress feels accumulative rather than conflict-driven, with no felt price paid for the final opening.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</question><comment>Theme of compassionate memory is implicit and consistent, yet the final beat avoids the messy moral ambiguity that shadow work promises; the takeaway floats safely in lyrical uplift rather than earned complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</question><comment>Detached lyricism drifts toward over-rich diction (“ghostly resolve,” “worn metal and faded wires” repeated), but Aurora’s perceptual signature remains coherent; few filter verbs and a haunting rhythm almost sustain voice under the mild overwriting.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Melodic cadence veers into template phrases (“deep sense of resolve” / “deep sense of wonder”) and mild paraphrase loops across paragraphs, preventing the punch-through clarity demanded at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</question><comment>A gentle fusion of starship elegy and Buddhist miniature relic feels fresh, yet the execution lands safely within established lyric-SF register; no single detail or turn feels unforeseeable, muting full ingenuity.</comment>
