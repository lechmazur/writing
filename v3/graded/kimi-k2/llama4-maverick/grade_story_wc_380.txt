<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The lighter’s interiority is evocative but remains largely observational; the pressed-wildflower book hints at motive yet never forces a hard choice. The final touch of the crystal triggers memory-flood more than decision, so the cost feels external rather than earned by prior contradiction. No micro-choice under pressure is dramatized; the character drifts rather than acts.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—memories restored, stance shifted—but the causal chain from whale → gravity shift → coffee-ground vision → crystal is asserted rather than demonstrated. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern and mood deepen, yet the tightening beat is the crystal’s touch, not the lighter’s. Cost is implied (overwhelming memory) yet not dramatized as forfeiture.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dock-side dusk, salt-crystal chamber, and subterranean tunnels are vividly sketched and filtered through the lighter’s perceptual bias. The crystalline structures refract lantern-light to mirror the gravity warps, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; only the whale’s shore remains slightly abstract, preventing full 8+ constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recovering deleted memories—is signaled early and escalates through gravitational pull toward the crystal. Yet the tightening moment is the crystal’s agency, not the lighter’s; pressure grows atmospherically rather than through narrowed options. A visible cost is implied but not enacted on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme of reclamation versus erasure emerges through the wildflower book and memory flood, avoiding explicit moralizing. The whale’s beaching and gravity pockets serve as non-literal answers to where lost memories go. Final image of lantern-light as celebration reweights earlier motifs with quiet resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited voice is consistent, with lyrical compression that suits the Accumulative/Textural lens. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered; rhythm modulates with descent into tunnels. No dialogue to test voice distinction; occasional poetic diction edges toward elevated register but remains coherent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; figurative language is restrained and purposeful. Minor scaffold phrases (“the lighter’s task took on…”) appear but do not stall momentum. No mixed metaphors or loops in peak beats; clarity remains intact through closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Fusion of maritime melancholy, quantum-gravity anomaly, and coffee-ground divination feels fresh and specific. The whale as catalyst for memory-archaeology is an unexpected synthesis. Risk-taking is moderate; concept commits fully without gimmickry, though the memory-crystal risks familiar tropes.</comment>
