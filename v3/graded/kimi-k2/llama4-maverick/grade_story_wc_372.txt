<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara’s “gently meticulous” trait is asserted repeatedly but never tested; she sorts and scans without visible trade-off or contradiction. No interior contradiction or embodied emotion is dramatized; the final “smile” feels unearned because no prior flaw or cost is shown.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Closure is a quiet Charged Poise—Elara returns the slide with “satisfaction”—but the cost is abstract and off-stage. Causality is loose: the lantern slide glows, frequencies reveal a pattern, yet no concrete choice narrows options or forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The frozen library’s quartz hush and cloud-height chill are vividly evoked and filter through Elara’s sensory priorities. However, the setting never constrains her actions; shelves and mist are backdrop rather than tactical resource.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—“preserve the essence before oblivion”—is declared early but remains abstract. No visible price or narrowing of options occurs; the pattern of frequencies is revealed without forcing a trade-off or irreversible choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Theme of memory’s fragility emerges through imagery rather than statement, yet the final reprise of “luminous vows” feels ornamental, not reweighted. Subtext is present but lacks a final conceptual sting.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays close to Elara’s perceptual signature; diction is consistent and textured. No head-hopping or register drift; the lyric cadence suits the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is lyrical and largely free of loops, but occasional stacked modifiers (“quartz hush,” “luminous vows”) edge toward purple. Density is high; rhythm modulates with scene needs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade>
<comment>The magic-archive-above-the-clouds premise is fresh, yet the luminous-vow concept remains generic; the lantern slide never surprises. Risk is modest; execution is competent but not transformative.</comment>
