<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied ("driftingly alert," "hairs on the back of her neck stand on end"), but the balladeer’s contradictory impulses remain muted; her final insight feels foreshadowed rather than wrested from struggle. The flower-press bolt plate hints at personal stakes yet never collides with them under pressure. Motivation is legible but not deeply conflicted; the cost of articulation is aesthetic, not existential.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each charcoal stroke thickens the pattern until the mural crystallizes into a Charged Poise—the ghost’s breeze reconfigures both courtyard and self. Orientation is swift; the mist, bench, and storm are anchored by line 3. Closure lands on the page with felt cost: the balladeer leaves “forever changed,” the courtyard likewise. Minor drift: the causal link between bolt plate and final beat is asserted, not dramatized.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The misty courtyard is no backdrop; its wet stone, ozone, and flickering lightning compress perception and dictate tempo. The bolt plate functions as micro-setting, its engravings mirrored in swirling fog, charging the final image when pocketed “with new significance.” Spatial choreography is clean; the storm’s choreography of light and sound tracks across the single scene. Sensory hierarchy is biased to the balladeer’s synesthetic craft.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—articulate the ghost’s unspoken needs—tightens once: each graffitoed symbol raises the stakes until refusal is impossible. Agency is exercised through encoding; the storm’s pressure externalizes internal urgency. Cost is aesthetic and spiritual rather than material, but legible in the “expectant hush” and the irrevocable change left behind. One clear deepening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through pattern: code as empathy, art as séance. The final image—the lingering song—reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture: the bolt plate’s silence, the ghost’s breeze. Ambiguity is purposeful; the courtyard remains “forever changed,” yet the ghost’s need is only partly voiced, inviting reflection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical, consistent, and texture-driven: “tinkersong curiosity,” “otherworldly hum.” Perceptual signature is selective—sound of wet stone, scent of ozone—filtered through the balladeer’s synesthetic lens. Syntax modulates with intensity; short clauses under lightning, longer breaths in mist. No dialogue, so no voice contamination. Occasional elevated diction (“mystical nexus”) nudges register but remains coherent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid; each sentence layers image and motion. No loops or scaffold; “tendrils of fog curl” is not repeated. Metaphors are precise: “fabric of reality was thin.” Rhythm accelerates with storm, breathes with encoding. Minor overwriting—“very fabric,” “essence of the ghost”—dulls peak beats slightly but does not obscure closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Fusion of ghost-in-code and graffiti-as-séance feels fresh; the bolt plate as cipher-key is particular to this world. Tropes are transformed: the haunted courtyard becomes a compiler, the balladeer a debugger of longing. Risk is moderate—lyric accumulation over plot—but coherence holds. No close echoes of famous scenes.</comment>
