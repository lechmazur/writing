<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Raven’s loneliness is stated but never embodied; the moon-rock fragment is a prop, not a crucible. The “desperately jocular” mask is asserted, not dramatized, so the final lifting of loneliness feels unearned. No micro-choice under pressure reveals a hierarchy of values.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Closure is a soft Conceptual Repricing: the station’s atmosphere shifts from despair to community. However, the moon rock’s agency is asserted rather than dramatized, and the rumor chain’s mechanics remain off-stage, blurring the causal lens. Cost is diffuse—no single forfeiture is legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The ivy-choked station is vividly sketched and mirrors Raven’s entrapment, but it never constrains a choice or supplies a resource. It serves as textured backdrop rather than active pressure. Strong sensory filter, yet lacks final leverage.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—curing loneliness—is clear, but escalation is atmospheric rather than causal. The “gentle virus” of kindness spreads without visible trade-offs or narrowing options. No beat tests commitment; tension remains ambient.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme of communal healing emerges organically from the accumulating vignettes, but the final paragraph moralizes (“the cure…was not a single event”). Subtext is strongest in the crowd’s wordless exchanges; Raven’s interiority drifts toward abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice is consistent, lightly ironic, with a distinct perceptual tilt (“ivy tendrils curling around their ankles like skeletal fingers”). Compression and elision are purposeful. Occasional drift into editorial omniscience (“the world was just a little bit brighter”) weakens POV modesty.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is fluid, with rhythmic variation and selective detail. Minor scaffold: “As the night wore on” appears twice in three sentences; “the station became a hub” restates prior beat. No figurative muddle, but momentum stalls in summary patches.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The moon-rock-as-catalyst premise is fresh, and the rumor-chain delivery system is intriguing, though under-exploited. Transformation of a ruin into a commons feels earned. Avoids cliché, but leans on familiar “lonely savior” arc.</comment>
