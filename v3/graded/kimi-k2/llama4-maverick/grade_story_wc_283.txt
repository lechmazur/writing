<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical but generic; “quietly inspired” is asserted, never embodied. No contradictory impulses on the page; the turner’s choices are reported, not dramatized. The final smile lacks earned cost; it reads as closure summary rather than stance crystallization.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Closure is a soft Charged Poise—the turner smiles at ongoing work—but the cost is abstract. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern taught early and held. Orientation is clear by line 3. However, the prophecy-to-possibility shift is narrated, not enacted, blunting the Decisive Change.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Amber warehouse and canyon echo are vividly sketched and return in the final image. Micro-setting (buttons, hourglasses) constrains the cataloging action. Sensory selection favors hush and texture, supporting the unearthed-silence tone. Spatial anchors remain stable.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—uncovering the prophecy’s living form—is signaled early. Pressure accrues texturally via cataloging, but no single tightening beat narrows options; escalation is diffuse. Agency is observational rather than decisive until the final smile, which carries diffuse cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of shared wisdom emerges through image (canyon echo, buttons) rather than statement. Subtext resides in silence and reverberation. Final tableau reweights the warehouse from mausoleum to crucible without moralizing. Complexity is present but not fully plumbed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice is consistent, with rhythmic control and selective detail. No dialogue; perceptual signature is atmospheric rather than character-specific. Compression is purposeful; no head-hopping. Register remains elevated but coherent with the meditative stance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is fluid, with varied sentence rhythm and high information density. Occasional soft loops (“the turner’s work was not done; rather, it was just beginning”) are minor. Metaphors (harp-string hum, crucible) are apt and not over-stacked. No line-level artifacts impair closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Premise—prophecy distilled from lost buttons and canyon echo—is fresh and non-obvious. Tropes of time and memory are transformed through tactile cataloging. Specificity of amber warehouse and button taxonomy anchors the concept. Risk is moderate; payoff is quiet but coherent.</comment>
