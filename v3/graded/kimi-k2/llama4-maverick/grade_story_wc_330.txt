<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The carpenter’s “quietly persistent” trait is stated repeatedly but never tested by a hard choice; the wrong-turn/oasis beat is passive coincidence rather than an active decision that reveals character. Interiority drifts into lyrical summary (“interpret silence as possibility”) without embodied contradiction or cost. The final smile feels unearned because no prior beat shows the carpenter paying a visible price for the insight.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Closure is a gentle Charged Poise—the carpenter returns to work “infused with a newfound sense of purpose”—but the cost is only asserted, not dramatized. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of mist, bells, halo glow thickens toward dawn. However, the oasis detour is a gratuitous coincidence that does not tighten the pattern or foreclose an option; it merely supplies mood.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is rich and selective—rusty wheels, halo glow, wind-bell chime—yet the circus train never constrains a choice; the oasis appears by author fiat rather than environmental logic. Sensory detail is vivid but ornamental; no object or setting state alters tactics or charges the final image beyond mood.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake—“to interpret silence as possibility”—is announced early but never put under pressure; the oasis encounter does not test or deepen it. No meaningful tightening or trade-off occurs; the carpenter simply receives a lyrical confirmation. Escalation is atmospheric, not causal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Theme of finding beauty in stillness emerges through recurring images (mist, bells, halo) rather than assertion, yet the final smile edges toward explicit moral. Subtext is present but thin; the singer functions more as symbol than as pressure. Resonance is pleasant but not conceptually reweighted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Voice is consistent, lyrical, and perceptually anchored in the carpenter’s selective noticing. Syntax and diction suit a meditative mood; no head-hopping or register drift. Compression and elision are purposeful, though occasional soft-focus phrasing (“misting hush that seemed to carry the whispers of forgotten dreams”) edges toward cliché.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Prose is fluid and read-aloud rhythmic, with only minor loops (“the carpenter’s thoughts turned…”). Figurative language is occasionally stacked but never muddles causality. A few near-paraphrase pairs (“silent moon… silent carousel carpenter”) could be tightened, yet momentum holds.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The abandoned-circus frame is evocative, but the oasis interlude feels imported rather than transformed from the premise. Freshness lies in the halo-lit wood-shaping detail, yet the overall arc follows a familiar lyrical quest pattern without a surprising turn. Risk is moderate; specificity is present but not transformative.</comment>
