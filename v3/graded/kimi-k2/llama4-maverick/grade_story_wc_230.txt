<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is embodied and character-specific; the truthful compulsion is dramatized through micro-choices like the stomach lurch when handling the eye. The final resolve is earned by prior causality, though the “psychological safety” motive is more asserted than tested in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the forager’s vanishing into rain crystallizes the cost of balancing rationality and emotion. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of storm, orchard, and eye reweights meaning. Orientation is anchored early; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Storm-battered orchard is vivid, selective, and mirrored in the psyche; the antique glass eye functions as micro-setting that constrains the final choice. Weather and terrain pressure tactics without slipping into postcard description.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—tempering involuntary honesty—tightens when cures are found; the cost is felt in the “unease” and the final resolve to keep the eye. One clear escalation: discovery of relic → discovery of cures → decision to experiment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of empathy’s excess emerges through concrete relic history and personal stakes; no moralizing. Final image of fractured grace offers resonant, non-literal answer to how one lives with unfiltered truth.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice is consistent, textured, and perceptually biased; “storm-battered orchard” and “fractured grace” carry distinct cadence. No dialogue, so no voice contamination; free-indirect style is clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Prose is lean and propulsive, but occasional template cadence (“As they…”) and mild overwriting (“complex and often contradictory nature”) dull peak beats. No loops or mixed metaphors, yet density could be higher.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Premise of post-empathy-virus world and relic smuggling feels fresh via grounded forager lens. Risky lyric structure pays off in final image; no derivative echoes.</comment>
