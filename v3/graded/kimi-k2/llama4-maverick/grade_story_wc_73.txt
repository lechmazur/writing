<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Deep interiority and contradictory impulses are present in the climbing/tumbling dice metaphor. However, character motivation ("grim optimist" etc.) is stated rather than embodied, and the final choice to keep climbing feels more abstract than viscerally costly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds elegantly—the staircase and dice serve as coherent iterations of obsession. Closure succeeds as Charged Poise: the final line crystallizes a self-aware perpetuity. Minor causality wobble: the rupture roll has no tangible consequence within the pattern.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The stairwell is consistently rendered through sound, shadow, texture; the dice become micro-setting in the palm. While environment never constrains bodily danger, it exerts thematic pressure that reweights the ending image of endless ascent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake (perpetual discovery) stays legible; each upward beat tightens to obsession’s spiral. One micro-turn—the roll’s randomness briefly ruptures deterministic hope—though the cost is largely conceptual rather than a live option surrendered.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Chaos vs order theme emerges from concrete tactile acts (rolling imperfect dice) rather than statement. Final image reframes prior material: the infinite staircase becomes both prison and privilege, reweighing without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Hypnotic lyrical control, rhythmic layering matched to climbing cadence. Compression of syntax under obsession reads purposeful; perceptual signature is distinct. Never violates POV modesty even when speculative.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Few slips; occasional near-loop ("never-ending" x3), but each reiteration gains new semantic weight. Metaphors are coherent across physics and philosophy. Micro-edits only for economy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Familiar premise reborn through dice object + staircase obsession. Fresh inflection lies in turning mathematical proofing into tactile ritual. Slight deduction: Sisyphus echoes are not fully transformed away.</comment>
