<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Eli’s interiority is textured—salt-stung eyes, fingers that “move with a life of their own”—but the shift from scholar to seeker is asserted more than dramatized; the final renunciation (“embracing the fluidity of existence”) feels lightly earned because the prior beats never test his attachment with visible stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the empty snow globe reweights the premise that letting go is reframing, not release. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each object (logbook, net, globe) layers density until the final image crystallizes the cost. One causality wobble: the net-message arrives as pure gift, not earned by prior tactics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The sunken library is vivid—“luminescent fish,” “scent of salt and decay”—and the micro-setting of the broken mirror and empty globe constrains the final self-recognition. Spatial anchors are clear; only the transition back to surface is elided, but that serves the dreamlike cadence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding surrender—intensifies through each relic discovered, tightening from curiosity to melancholy acceptance. Pressure is textural rather than causal; the cost is conceptual (transience acknowledged) yet still felt in the red-rimmed eyes. One tightening beat suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from objects and actions; the snow globe’s final stillness answers the question without moralizing. The “physics of letting go” stays implicit, avoiding thematic echo until the last line, where it reconfigures prior material. Minor abstraction in “sophisticated sorrow” keeps it from the 9-band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is consistent, lyric, and perceptually specific—“soft glow of luminescent fish,” “saltwater and the weight of my discoveries.” Syntax modulates with emotional rise; no head-hopping. Compression in the ascent is purposeful and taught by the pattern.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; figurative language is selective. One scaffold loop—“I’d come… I’d found… I’d come”—appears mid-story but does not obscure closure. No mixed metaphors or register drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The sunken-ship-library premise is fresh, and the integration of Earhart, physics of release, and antique relics feels non-obvious. The snow globe’s transformation from wonder to void is an earned reweighting. Slight risk aversion in keeping the journey solitary and conflict abstract holds it below 8.5.</comment>
