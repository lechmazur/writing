<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Interiority is evocative but drifts toward abstract therapy-speak (“dissonance of old guilt”) and lacks a single embodied micro-choice that alters tactics; the guilt remains more label than lived contradiction. The amber, letters, and baby-cry gift orbit the character but do not force a visible trade-off on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Closure is a soft atmospheric fade rather than a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration; the cord tether and meteor hush are evocative but do not foreclose a path with felt cost. Causality is lyrical-accumulative, yet the lens is not taught early enough to justify the final drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>“Laboratory of lost sounds” is vivid and textured, with sandalwood, myrrh, and flickering candles grounding the scene; the dresser and letters function as micro-setting objects that charge memory. However, the space never physically constrains a final choice, capping the score below 9-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“hush the dissonance of old guilt”—is signaled early, but pressure plateaus rather than tightens; the haunted firmware and folding time are atmospheric complications rather than escalating forces that narrow options or extract cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of guilt transmuted through art and sound emerges organically from constellation tattoos and meteor hush, avoiding overt moralizing. Yet the final image reprises mood rather than reweighting the premise with undeniable conceptual cost, leaving resonance slightly diffuse.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Voice is lush, rhythmic, and consistent; sensory diction (“susurrus,” “myrrh”) feels character-bound. Compression and ellipses are purposeful, though occasional poetic abstractions edge toward overwriting under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is generally propulsive and image-dense, but recurrent soft-focus phrases (“gentle susurrus,” “weight of the stars”) create minor loops. No single artifact harms clarity at closure, yet trimming 5–6 near-duplicates would sharpen the cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Constellation tattoos that absorb inner dissonance, haunted firmware, and meteor hush synthesize into a fresh, non-obvious lyric frame. The risk is coherent and memorable, though the payoff leans atmospheric rather than structurally daring.</comment>
