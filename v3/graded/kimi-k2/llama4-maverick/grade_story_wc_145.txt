<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Emilia’s quest is clear, but interiority stays abstract (“turmoil beneath her surface”); no embodied contradiction under pressure. Her final step onto the lake is a choice, yet the cost feels prospective rather than paid. The phrasebook bond is asserted, not dramatized in a micro-choice. Competence dominates; genuine struggle is muted.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Closure is a prospective Decisive Change—she steps onto the ice—but the cost is still ahead, not yet felt. Causal chain is thin: condensation pattern → decipher → walk; no intermediate obstacle or trade-off. Orientation is clear early; no disorientation taught. Lens reads Causal, but escalation is one-step, lacking tightening beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Outpost and frozen lake are vividly sketched, with sensory selection filtered through Emilia’s goal. Setting supplies isolation and silence, but does not actively constrain her final choice; ice could crack, yet no cue of danger. Micro-setting (windowpane) functions as tool. Strong atmosphere, but environmental stakes remain potential.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—find the convergence—is signaled early. Pressure is atmospheric, not causal; no tightening beat narrows options or exacts a price before the final step. Escalation is a single rise in anticipation rather than a narrowing of possibilities. Agency is present but untested by obstacle or loss.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Theme of knowledge-seeking versus unknown cost emerges implicitly through Emilia’s drive and the ominous stillness. No overt statement, but the ending’s hush invites reflection. Complexity is hinted; ambiguity remains quiet rather than charged. Resonance is moderate—final image reweights the quest but lacks conceptual sting.</comment>

<comment>Voice is consistent, with restrained diction fitting an editor’s precision. Sensory detail is selective; rhythm modulates with mood. No dialogue, so no voice slippage. Occasional lyrical lift (“stars twinkled like diamonds”) edges toward cliché but stays controlled. Perceptual signature is present but not yet distinctively sharp.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, readable, and mostly propulsive. Some repeated sentence stems (“As she walked…”) create mild cadence loops. Figurative language is sparse; when used, it’s serviceable. No overwriting, but also no high-density compression. Artifacts are minor and do not obscure closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Convergence as geographical anomaly is fresh; execution leans on familiar quest beats. Specificity of atlas editor and condensation cipher helps, yet overall arc feels archetypal. Risk-taking is modest; transformation is incremental rather than revelatory. Memorable elements are present but not yet fully synthesized.</comment>
