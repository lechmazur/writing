<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical but abstract; “shadowed rapture” and “remembered stardust” remain labels rather than embodied contradiction. No micro-choice under pressure—she simply lowers the astrolabe and smiles. Motivation (free creativity) is stated, not dramatized through a visible cost or trade-off.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: dawn arrives, creativity is “freed,” and the path is “illuminated.” Yet the cost is only asserted (“weight lifting”) rather than dramatized; lens is Accumulative/Textural, pattern held, but causality between ritual and breakthrough remains asserted, not proven.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Aurora and archway are vivid and continuous; the astrolabe’s shifting glow mirrors internal change. However, the setting never physically constrains her choices—she could leave at any moment—so it charges mood more than tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—freeing creativity—is clear early. Pressure intensifies via aurora’s “hypnotic spell,” but the tightening is atmospheric rather than causal; no option is foreclosed, no visible price paid. Agency is passive reception rather than active decision.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of cosmic attunement vs. inner doubt emerges implicitly through ritual and sky. Subtext is present but diluted by overt lyric statement (“unlock the hidden chambers of her own imagination”). Final image gestures toward resonance without reweighting prior material.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is lush, consistent, and sensorily selective. Syntax modulates with aurora’s pulse; no POV drift. Occasional poetic inflation (“wings of pure enchantment”) slightly blurs perceptual specificity under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is fluid, with rhythmic variation and vivid imagery. However, stacked modifiers (“celestial ballet,” “velvet expanse,” “ethereal glow”) create density without added pressure. No loops or scaffolding, but figurative surplus nudges toward purple.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Combines astrolabe, aurora, and stardust in a fresh constellation, avoiding cliché through sustained lyric texture. Yet the arc—ritual yields inspiration—remains familiar; risk is stylistic rather than structural.</comment>
