<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Echo’s obsession is vivid, but interiority drifts into abstract “mathematics of emotion” labels; embodied contradiction appears only in the borrowed-personality gimmick, never tested under pressure. The final smile registers as a summary, not a felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the print’s “lucid turbulence” reconfigures meaning with conceptual cost. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern intensifies until stars vanish. Orientation is clear by 70 words; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Workshop and fragment are tactile and luminous; the fragment constrains the final choice by slotting into the press. Star extinction supplies a tightening cadence. Micro-setting (press, type, orbs) carries the scene without white-room drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—unlock empathy’s math—tightens as each star vanishes, a visible countdown. Agency is Echo’s decision to finish the print despite erasure of the sky; cost is the irreversible darkening. No reversals, but pressure deepens under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of empathy-as-code emerges from the print’s ambiguity rather than statement. Final image of “soft whisper of words” offers non-literal resonance. Avoids moralizing, but late abstraction (“profound understanding”) edges toward label-speak.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is consistent, lyrical, and sensorily precise; perceptual signature centers on metallic smells and starlight. No dialogue, so no drift. Occasional elevated diction (“lucid turbulence”) fits Echo’s cerebral bent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; only minor loops (“as they worked… as the night wore on”). Metaphors stay coherent. Final paragraph avoids purple overload; rhythm mirrors the press’s whir.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: letterpress + Halo fragment + empathy math feels inevitable, not gimmick. Risky star-erasure countdown pays off. Avoids stock tropes; “transposed empathy” is explored through material process, not lecture.</comment>
