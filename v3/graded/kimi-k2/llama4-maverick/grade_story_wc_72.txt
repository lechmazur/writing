<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The statue’s interiority is abstract and declarative (“felt a sudden jolt of understanding”) rather than embodied; its kindness is asserted, not dramatized in a costly choice. The parrotfish functions as an info-dump mouthpiece, not a relationship crucible. No micro-choice under pressure shows the statue’s values colliding.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure is a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration—garden re-seen as thriving—earned by the statue’s telepathic synthesis. Causality is soft: the ampoule’s arrival triggers revelation rather than a because/therefore chain. Orientation is clear early; lens holds as Accumulative/Textural.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The underwater garden is vividly rendered (“coral and anemones swayed like ballerinas”) and filters through the statue’s stony perception. Spatial anchors hold; decay and renewal are textured through sensory detail. The garden’s state constrains the statue’s final stance, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restoring meaning to the garden—is signaled early. Pressure deepens via accumulating historical fragments, but the cost is conceptual, not visceral. The statue’s agency is contemplative; no live option is foreclosed on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of nuance over certainty emerges through the statue’s shifting perception, not statement. Subtext lives in the decay-to-vibrancy imagery. Final image reweights the premise without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice is consistent, lyrical, and statue-apt (“incisively kind nature”). No dialogue; internal monologue avoids filter clutter. Rhythm modulates with revelation beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is fluid but leans on abstract summary (“cascade of revelations”) and repetitive phrasing (“the statue realized… the statue began… the statue’s thoughts”). No loops in closure, yet figurative language occasionally drifts toward the decorative.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Forgotten underwater garden + telepathic statue is a fresh synthesis; the “animate lifeless” tone transforms decay into ecosystem without gimmickry. Revelation via structural weakness is a non-obvious twist. Specificity grounds the fantastical.</comment>
