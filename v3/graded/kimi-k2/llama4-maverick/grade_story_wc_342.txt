<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The artist’s interiority is vivid and embodied—“quiet reverence,” “unsettling sense of kinship”—but the final renunciation (leaving the doomed library) is more stated than dramatized; we feel the cost intellectually rather than through a visible micro-choice on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the rising density of stillness, scent, and mirrored sky tightens toward the Charged Poise of the glowing portrait. Closure lands cleanly, though the demolition countdown is announced rather than shown ticking.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The tree-trunk library is tactile and constraining—musty air, dappled light, hidden book safe—yet the “mirrored sky” inside the canvas reconfigures the space at the end, making setting an active participant in the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—capture the infinite before loss—escalates through sensory compression and the artist’s accelerating brushwork; the cost is the inevitable demolition, but agency is mostly contemplative rather than a decisive act that narrows options.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of finite craft grasping the infinite emerges through concrete particulars: coin indentations, fractal brushstrokes, mirrored sky. No moralizing; the final image reframes the quest as both noble and quixotic without explicit statement.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Voice is hushed, reverent, textured with sensory specificity—“soft, golden light,” “faint indentations.” Rhythm modulates with the library’s stillness, never breaking the single POV or drifting into exposition.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and lyrical, each sentence layering scent, light, or texture without redundancy. Occasional elevated diction (“quixotic,” “transience”) fits the scholarly POV and does not stall momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The portrait-inside-a-tree conceit feels fresh, and the fractal-coin decryption device is an elegant, non-obvious synthesis. The risk is quiet rather than flashy, but the payoff is earned and memorable.</comment>
