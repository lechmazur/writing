<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Akira’s interiority is lyrical but abstract; “phototropic to kindness” is asserted, not embodied. No contradictory impulse is dramatized, and the final choice (taking the glass) feels predetermined rather than earned by prior micro-choices under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Closure is a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration: the glass becomes talisman of kindness-infused resistance. Causality is textural/accumulative; the lens holds, but the cost is diffuse—no concrete forfeiture on the page. Orientation is clear by 80 words; no drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The scorched oasis is vividly etched—heat, scent of old honey, cracked earth—and the lantern glass functions as micro-setting that constrains the final choice. Spatial choreography is clean; environmental details evolve with the sun’s arc.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Stakes are thematic (understanding resistance to change) rather than tactical; pressure rises via sensory accumulation, not narrowing options. No visible price is paid—Akira simply leaves with the glass—so escalation remains mild.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: places resist change when kindness lingers as phototropic residue. The final image reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext is carried by the glass’s evolving resonance and the thrum’s quiet heartbeat.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Voice is meditative, consistent, and textured; perceptual signature favors gentle curves, sun patterns, and faint hums. No dialogue, so no register clash. Rhythm modulates with the deepening thrum, supporting the lyrical closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and largely free of loops. Occasional soft filler (“seemed to,” “as if”) slightly dilutes pressure. Metaphors stay coherent; no overwriting in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>The fusion of beekeeping ruin, zen potter, and kindness-as-physics is fresh, yet the concept’s execution leans familiar—mystical object grants insight. Specificity of scent and glass patterns helps, but the arc feels gently inevitable rather than surprising.</comment>
