<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Interiority drifts toward poetic abstraction (“boundary-lessly trapped”) without embodied contradiction; the weaver’s final stance is legible but the cost is diffuse, not dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Charged Poise—the tapestry reconfigures meaning and the grotto hums—but the lens reads Accumulative/Textural; causality is atmospheric rather than because/therefore, which is acceptable under that lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Bronze grotto and lamp burner are tactile, selective, and return in the final image; they constrain the weaver’s ritual space and charge the ending glow.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Stake—“collect the weights of burdens”—is announced early and tightened through weaving, but the cost is conceptual; no visible forfeiture or narrowing of options on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of measured burdens emerges through image and silence rather than statement; final tapestry reweights premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lyridiction is consistent and voice-driven; occasional elevated register (“whalebone reverie”) stays within the weaver’s mythic idiom; no head-hop.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Strong rhythm and selective detail, but slight over-patterning in “shimmering with a light that was both fragile and resilient” dulls the peak beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Fractal-weaver mythos feels fresh; however, the “collect burdens” quest is a familiar archetype, slightly muting the originality punch.</comment>
