<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Sentinel’s interiority is evocative but static; no contradictory impulses in scene, no micro-choice that alters tactics. “Gently persuasive” remains label-level; final stance crystallizes without visible cost. Emotional arc is atmospheric rather than pressured.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Single continuous scene; orientation is clear by 120 words. Closure lands as Charged Poise—sentinel’s realization reweights premise—but cost is conceptual, not dramatized. Causal linkage is loose; events accumulate rather than tighten.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Autumn vineyard rendered with vivid, selective detail; amber pavilion and burned letter act as micro-settings that mirror theme. Sensory hierarchy supports mood rather than constraining choice, so 9+ gate not met. Spatial choreography is clean.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding destined mismatches—signaled early but never tested under rising pressure. No narrowing of options; no trade-off or forfeiture. Escalation is atmospheric deepening, not causal tightening.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of destined mismatches emerges organically through vineyard imagery and fragmentary letter. Final image reweights premise without moralizing. Subtext is present but diffuse; ambiguity is coherent yet lacks sharp bite.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lyrical, consistent third-person limited voice with distinct perceptual signature. Syntax and rhythm modulate with emotional cadence. No dialogue; no POV drift. Compression and elision are purposeful and legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical, dense, and largely loop-free; occasional soft filler (“quiet, passionate subtlety”) but no artifact clusters. Metaphors are coherent; rhythm supports contemplative pacing. High-band craft with minor slack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of vineyard-as-human-heart metaphor; avoids cliché through sensory specificity. Premise is familiar but transformed by accumulative lyric design. Risk is moderate; payoff is quiet resonance rather than bold subversion.</comment>
