<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical but generic; “furiously tranquil” never manifests as embodied contradiction. The seed saver’s final insight—passing the burden on—reads as authorial gloss rather than earned character logic. No micro-choice under pressure anchors the shift.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the cap’s true key is sharing, not possessing. Yet the causal chain is thin—no prior beat sets up “passing it down” as a live dilemma. Orientation is clear; one continuous scene holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Icebound atrium and starlight are evocatively sketched, but the glass panes never constrain action; the thaw is backdrop, not obstacle. Micro-setting (acorn cap) does charge the final image, lifting the score.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“preserve the balance”—remains abstract; no concrete loss or trade-off is dramatized. The vortex’s hum intensifies, yet pressure stays atmospheric rather than option-narrowing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of cyclical guardianship emerges through imagery rather than statement, but the final paragraph’s overt lesson (“it was not the destination…”) edges into moralizing. Subtext is present yet occasionally over-articulated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-modulated to the meditative mode. No POV drift; sensory filtering is character-true. Occasional elevated diction (“otherworldly energy”) slightly dilutes immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is fluid, with rhythmic variation and strong cadence. Minor loops (“she knew that…”) and soft intensifiers (“overwhelming,” “unlike any other”) slightly dull edge. No artifact touches closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Seed-saver mythos feels fresh; the vortex inheritance is a non-obvious twist on stewardship tales. However, the cosmic vision sequence risks familiar eco-apocalypse imagery. Specificity of the acorn cap rescues originality.</comment>
