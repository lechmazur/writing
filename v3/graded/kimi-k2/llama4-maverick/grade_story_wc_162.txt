<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade>
<comment>Protagonist’s reflective interiority is vivid and well sustained, yet motive for crossing the final threshold leans on thematic statement (“spiritual distance”) rather than an active choice with visible cost. Emotional embodiment is present but lacks the contradictory, scene-tested impulse needed for 6+ bands. The reunion smile reads tidy, not earned price.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.6</grade>
<comment>Closure is present—reunion reconfigures emotional stakes—but the Decisive Change hinges on the logbook code and father’s wave, neither force having causal traction in earlier beats. Accumulative/Textural lens holds pattern; cost is felt, yet unmotivated: why now? This lack of narrowing pressure caps it.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prism terrace operates as both spectacle and tactile labyrinth (“colors bleeding into one another”); the environment continually constrains viewpoint and steers footfall. Spatial poetics anchor each beat; however, final image relies on ethereal reunion rather than environment-locked choice, keeping it from 8.5+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“why thresholds feel sacred”—is stated not tested; pressure stays atmospheric rather than narrowing. One meaningful tightening occurs when symbols resolve into path, but agency feels conferred by code and father, not forged by contradiction. The cost (peaceful reunion) undercuts tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade>
<comment>“Necessary distances” emerges as gentle motif about mystery and paternal love, but theme is given lines like “It was all part of a larger whole,” diluting resonance. Subtext functions best in bench-grain passage; elsewhere explanatory voice intrudes—tidy lesson lowers punch.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Tone is consistent, with crystalline, drifting cadence mimicking prism diffraction. Free indirect glide is steady, but occasional drift toward poetic aphorism (“world full of mysteries”) nudges voice toward narrator commentary. Distinct sensory register remains intact under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is lush yet disciplined; no loops or clichés, rhythm breathes with scene. Some lines achieve double duty: image plus emotional cue. Minor overwriting appears in clusters like “fractured hush that vibrated with palpable energy,” a mixed metaphor, holding this from 7+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade>
<comment>Synthesis of corn-maze lineage inside dreamlike prism is fresh; however, the beat structure recapitulates familiar quest template—lost child, mystical terrain, wise father epiphany—lessening surprise. Specificity of light-diffracting maze almost but doesn’t quite push into revelatory originality.</comment>
