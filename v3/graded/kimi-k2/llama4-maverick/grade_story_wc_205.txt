<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“burnished sorrow”); contradictory impulses surface in the tension between revolutionary past and poetic present. Micro-choices (picking up shard, covering mirrors) reveal hierarchy of values. Final renunciation of active revolution for chronicler role is earned, though the cost feels more asserted than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the shard becomes talisman, the revolutionary becomes chronicler. Causal chain is lyric/accumulative; each beat layers density until the final image crystallizes the shift. Cost is felt in “burnished sorrow” and acceptance of permanent exile. Orientation anchors early; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Baroque asteroid is rendered through tactile, lived detail—dust on facets, luminescent air—that constrains movement and mood. The shard functions as micro-setting, charging the final image. Sensory selection mirrors interior narrowing under pressure. Spatial choreography is coherent; no static repetition.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—reimagining a lost civilization—drives every beat. Escalation is textural: each artifact and verse adds weight until the final crystallization. No external antagonist; pressure is internal and accumulative. One deepening turn: shard’s glint shifts from curiosity to talismanic burden.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of transformation through memory and loss emerges organically from character’s choices and artifacts. Subtext operates in the shard’s glint and the covered mirrors. Final image reframes prior material without moralizing. Complexity lingers: sorrow and creation are inseparable.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical, consistent, and character-specific; perceptual signature filters every detail through poetic bias. Rhythm modulates with emotional intensity. No dialogue; interior monologue avoids filter-verb clutter. Patterned elision (e.g., ellipsis of analysis process) is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is purposeful, not purple. Occasional template cadence (“the words flowing like a river”) is minor. No loops or scaffold. High information density: each sentence layers image or stakes. Final paragraph crystallizes without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Premise—ex-revolutionary as archaeologist on baroque asteroid after time becomes visible—is fresh synthesis of familiar tropes. Specificity of shard, mirrors, and sorrow distinguishes it from generic space archaeology. Transformation test passes: story would collapse if setting or vocation changed. Risky lyric structure holds.</comment>
