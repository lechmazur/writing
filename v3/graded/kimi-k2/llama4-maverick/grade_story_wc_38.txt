<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Aria’s interiority is vivid—her urge to dance her code is embodied—but the stakes never tighten; her “calm defiance” is asserted more than tested. No contradictory impulse is dramatized mid-scene, so the final step into light feels pre-ordained rather than earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each return of the dice, journal, and spider web layers pattern until the final Charged Poise. Yet the causality between decoding and the door opening is elided; the cost is felt but not visibly paid on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The sunken laboratory is evoked in spare, sensory strokes—“saltwater and decay,” “rusting equipment”—that stay tethered to Aria’s perception. It functions as pressure rather than backdrop, though it never physically constrains her final move.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—escape via self-encoded strength—is clear early, but pressure plateaus. The spider’s web supplies a lyrical clock yet doesn’t tighten options; Aria’s agency at the climax is asserted, not forced by a visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</question><comment>Theme of transmuting vulnerability into power emerges through motif (dice, web, journal) rather than statement. The final image of dice as talisman reweights prior symbols, but the insight remains slightly abstract, blunting resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice is consistent, with rhythmic, sensory diction that mirrors Aria’s dancerly cognition. Occasional elevated phrasing (“otherworldly light”) edges toward poetic overlay, yet the perceptual signature stays distinct.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is lean and musical, with purposeful repetition that accretes texture. A few soft loops (“Aria felt a sense of…”) and abstract nouns slightly dilute immediacy, but no line-level artifact obscures the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The fusion of code-breaking and dance feels fresh, and the submerged lab frame is non-generic. Yet the escape arc treads familiar “triumph through art” territory without a surprising inflection; risk is stylistic rather than structural.</comment>
