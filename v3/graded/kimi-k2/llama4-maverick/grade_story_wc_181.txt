<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Curator’s interiority is vivid (“brightened disquiet”) and embodied, but the final epiphany feels slightly pre-packaged rather than wrested from struggle; no contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing—knowledge reframed—yet the cost is more asserted (“never see the world the same”) than dramatized; lens holds as Accumulative/Textural.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>“Astral orchard” and “lonely asteroid” are specific and atmospheric; the bathroom micro-setting constrains the breakthrough, but the orchard itself never limits choice or reappears to charge the ending.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—access to forbidden knowledge—tightens once in the bathroom; however, escalation is gentle, and the price (loss of prior worldview) is stated more than felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Theme of nonlinear knowledge emerges organically from the final image; avoids moralizing, but the conceptual shift is slightly abstract, muting resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature (“stardust on the lonely asteroid”); no head-hopping, though occasional poetic overlay edges toward overwriting.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is fluid and rhythmic, but repeated “brightened disquiet” and similar phrasing create minor loops; no artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of cosmic orchard, secret order, and bathroom epiphany; premise feels specific to this voice, though the nonlinear-inheritance conceit flirts with abstraction.</comment>
