<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid (“empirically ironic nature – a blend of skepticism and wonder”) and embodied emotion surfaces in the tremor when the tile’s glow merges with starlight. Yet the astronomer’s contradictory impulses (skepticism vs. longing) are asserted more than dramatized in scene; no single micro-choice under pressure crystallizes the cost until the final beat, which softens the earned change.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the covenant crystallizes in the charged poise of the astronomer holding the tile aloft while the palace holds its breath. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each lyrical return of “dusky harmony” thickens the pattern until the final image reweights the premise. Cost is felt in the irreversible fusion of mortal and cosmic, though the beat is slightly diffuse.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The palace is evoked in selective, sensory strokes—“crumbling frescoes whispered tales,” “twilight halls”—that filter through the astronomer’s awe. The tile itself becomes micro-setting, constraining the final gesture; its etched symbols glow and guide the covenant. Spatial anchors are clear early; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—sealing a covenant with the unknown—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightens once when the tile’s decrypted harmony forces the astronomer to act. The pressure is lyrical rather than causal, but the final image narrows all options to a single stance. Cost is conceptual (loss of empirical distance) rather than visceral, yet legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of encrypted devotion emerges organically from the tile’s deciphering and the astronomer’s longing; no explicit moralizing. The final image of “dusky harmony” reweights prior material without statement. Subtext in the tile’s shimmer and the palace’s held breath invites reflection on the price of transcendence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is lush yet disciplined, with rhythmic control (“shimmered like moonlight on a midnight lake”) that modulates under pressure. POV remains tightly focalized; no head-hop. Occasional elevated diction (“inextricably linked”) is consistent with the astronomer’s reverent register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and propulsive, but figurative density borders on excess in the middle third (“twilight and stardust,” “celestial rhythms”). No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. One mixed metaphor (“wings of a dusky harmony”) slightly muddies the final ascent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The fusion of Babylonian mysticism with empirical astronomy feels fresh; the magic-square-as-cipher trope is transformed through the astronomer’s lived practice. The covenant moment avoids cliché by remaining conceptual rather than theatrical. Specificity of frescoes and tile symbols anchors the vision.</comment>
