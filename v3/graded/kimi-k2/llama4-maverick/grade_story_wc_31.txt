<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Kael shows contradictions—duty vs obsession—from the outset, but the momentum stutter when his “color of sound” motive is stated vaguely rather than embodied in beats. Earned silence at the end lands, confirming a modest arc under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Causal thread feels causal only in patches; the library key appears too late to be the signal cause for final wonder. Closure lands lyrically—an Accumulative/Textural image of lanterns, not a decisive reconfiguration—so lens stays mid-range.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Micro-setting (crippled hull, lantern glow across water) constrains choice and charges the ending image. Salt-tactile detail stays character-filtered; consistency holds.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“unlock luminous vows”—narrows options once; lantern release provides soft external tick-tock. Cost remains atmospheric rather than tactile.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Themes of perception vs legacy emerge through image, never thesis speak. Final lantern sea reprises early light motif and reweights vows into transcendent vision.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Single POV held; diction salt-hollowed, elliptical, suits Kael. Compression and poetic elision pay off in closure under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Luminous diction and rhythmic control drive meteor hush with no stray metaphors. Phrasing loops minimal; ends on charged poise without clutter.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Synthesis feels fresh: library in sunken hull married to sound-reimagined reality. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes; echoes faintly derivative but ultimately distinct.</comment>
