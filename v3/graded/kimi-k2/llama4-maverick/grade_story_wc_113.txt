<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Rachel’s interiority is vivid—her urge to “unravel the code” is embodied in micro-choices like tilting the program to let water reveal images. Yet the “lately inspired” trait is asserted rather than dramatized, and her final change is more mood than costly decision. The ghost remains off-page, so no crucible relationship is tested.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final image of lanterns flickering while the water “echoes the music” crystallizes a new, wordless understanding. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each water-formed image layers density until the program’s message reweights the stake. Causality is soft but coherent under this lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The flooded pit, flickering lanterns, and water-damaged program are tactile constraints that guide Rachel’s manipulations. The viola under her chin functions as micro-setting, vibrating in sympathy with unseen music. Spatial choreography is clean; the lanterns’ dying glow charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</question><comment>The dominant stake—decipher the ghost’s code—tightens once when Rachel tilts the program and the images clarify. The cost is conceptual (loss of prior certainty) rather than visceral, but it is legible on the page. Pressure escalates through pattern intensification, not causal turns.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</question><comment>Theme emerges from the interplay of silence and latent music: the “hush of unstruck chords” becomes a metaphor for unrealized potential. The final image reweights this without moralizing. Subtext resides in gesture—tilting the program, the viola’s sympathetic vibration—rather than statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</question><comment>The lyrical third-person limited voice is consistent, with perceptual signature in phrases like “in between spaces where music and reality merged.” Rhythm modulates with tension; no head-hopping. Compression is purposeful; elision of the ghost’s identity is taught early and paid off in the wordless closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</question><comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense: “water lapped gently against the instrument, as if trying to soothe the unstruck chords.” Occasional soft-focus phrases (“beauty that was both haunting and sublime”) flirt with overwriting but do not stall momentum. No loops or scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</question><comment>The synthesis of water-damaged sheet music as oracle is fresh; the ghost-code premise is familiar but transformed through Rachel’s tactile deciphering. Risk lies in the quiet, lyric mode, yet it heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specificity of the flooded opera house anchors universals.</comment>
