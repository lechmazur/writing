<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elian’s interiority is present but generalized; “red-rimmed eyes” and “flawed beauty” are labels rather than embodied contradiction. No micro-choice under pressure is dramatized—negotiations open because delegates “began to open up,” not via Elian’s active tactic. The ending’s “measure of peace” is asserted, not earned by a visible renunciation or cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Closure is a soft Charged Poise—hope asserted while Elian stands alone—but the cost is abstract (“price of redemption had been worth paying”) rather than dramatized. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of celestial imagery reweights mood, yet no causal tightening narrows options. Orientation is clear; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The terrace and midsummer heat are vividly sketched (“worn stone seemed to hum”), but they function as backdrop rather than constraint. The ebony clipboard is the only object that charges the final image; the terrace itself does not force a choice or alter tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—lasting peace—is declared early, but escalation is atmospheric, not causal. Delegates soften because the mood shifts, not because Elian risks or forfeits anything tangible. No visible price is paid on the page; tension plateaus rather than tightens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of redemption emerges through imagery rather than dramatized moral calculus. The clipboard’s ritual weight is asserted but never tested; the ending’s hope feels thematic rather than earned. Subtext is present but muted—no charged silence or gesture carries the weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical, consistent, and tuned to Elian’s fatigue. Phrases like “operatively gentle hands” and “slow dance of celestial bodies” create texture. Occasional elevated diction (“poignant reminder”) edges toward register drift but stays within tolerable lyric range.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is fluid and rhythmic; however, mild paraphrase loops (“price of redemption” restated) and stock phrases (“ancient terrace… testament to countless negotiations”) dilute density. No major artifacts, yet compression could be tighter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade>
<comment>The premise—peace broker on a mythic terrace—leans familiar; the ebony clipboard as ritual talisman offers a fresh inflection, but its mechanics remain vague. Emotional specificity is high, yet the plot arc could transplant unchanged to another setting.</comment>
