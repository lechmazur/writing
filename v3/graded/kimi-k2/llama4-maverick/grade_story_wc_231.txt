<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Kael’s interiority is abstracted; no contradictory impulse ever collides with an embodied choice. The one discernible action (lifting the wilted boutonnière) is reactive and carries no visible cost. His final “burden” is delivered in expository summary, undermining earned stasis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Closure lands on image (Kael holding flower) but the decisive change is asserted, not dramatized: “he knew that he would have to investigate.” The lack of visible cost reads as ellipsis rather than Resonant Reconfiguration. Accumulative/textural lens chosen; escalation relies on repeated atmospheric swirls rather than narrowing stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.9</grade>
<comment>Mist and salt arrive in vivid pulses, but they never materially confine or empower a choice. The dock stays decorative; the lighthouse functions only as thematic echo. No environmental detail is weaponized into tactics at closure.</comment>

<grade>5.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—decode stranger’s gesture—never translates into concrete risk or trade-off. Pressure neither tightens nor deepens; the stranger walks away intact. The story mistakes twilight hush for escalating stakes.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Borrowed-memory premise glimmers thematically, woven through lighthouse legend and Kael’s musing. Final image hints that memory itself is weight, but theme remains mostly stated in reflective summary rather than reweighted by image.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>6.1</grade>
<comment>Voice stays consistent—lyrical, melancholic—yet drifts into syntactic monotony (“The mist continued... that seemed to...”). POV never flexes under emotional pressure; phrases cycle without perceptual variation. Filter-verb density remains high.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>5.7</grade>
<comment>Prose leans on atmospheric fillers (“seemed to echo,” “felt the weight”) that pad rather than propel. Figurative language occasionally blooms, but stock images—mist curls, sentinel lighthouse—clutter final lines without accruing charge.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Eccentric‐lighthouse + memory‐harboring tower is a clever remix, but borrowed-memory angle is thematic folklore rather than fresh conceit. Edelweiss key is quietly original yet underexploited. Risk stays safely tonal, never structural.</comment>
