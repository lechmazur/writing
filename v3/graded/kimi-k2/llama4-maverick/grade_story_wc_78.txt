<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Prophet’s interiority is lyrical but abstract; no contradictory impulse surfaces in scene. Motivation (“turn obstacles into instruments”) is stated, not dramatized through micro-choices. Final stance crystallizes as Charged Poise, yet the cost is atmospheric rather than embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern density and cadence shift reweight the stake. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—music fuses with night, orchard drifts to sleep—but the felt cost is diffuse. Orientation is clear within 120 words; no causality break.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setting is lush, selective, and filtered through prophet’s synesthetic perception. Driftwood circle and orchard constrain movement and supply resonant surfaces; final image recharges the motif. Micro-setting (mallet, branches) functions as extension of body and choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transmuting landscape into music—signaled early. Escalation is textural: density of tones increases until silence becomes palpable. No concrete trade-off or loss is dramatized; pressure remains atmospheric rather than option-narrowing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of transmutation emerges through sensory particulars rather than statement. Final silence reweights prior euphony, offering non-literal answer to how art negotiates impermanence. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers credibly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is consistent, lyric, and perceptually specific—“the driftwood circle creaking gently beneath her feet.” Rhythm modulates with emotional swell; no head-hopping. Compression and elision are taught early and paid off in closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is vivid yet occasionally overwritten—“restless euphony,” “tiny, shining jewel suspended”—creating minor density drag. No loops or scaffold; syntax varies. Metaphors cohere within dream-logic; clarity never breaks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Premise of orchard-orchestra afloat at sea is fresh and non-obvious. Tropes of mystic seer and synesthetic art are transformed through tactile specificity. Risk-taking (lyric accumulative structure) heightens resonance without obscuring closure.</comment>
