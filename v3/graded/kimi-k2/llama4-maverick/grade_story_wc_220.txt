<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Kael’s embodied memories and twitching nose give interior texture, and Lyra’s riddle-solving beat lands with concrete agency, yet their partnership stays largely symbolic—final image shows belonging but without contradictions actively costing either character.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Single continuous scene, 600-800 words, closure achieved via Resonant Reconfiguration—final spring-side tableau crystallizes meaning and shared purpose; causality is gentle Accumulative/Textural, held intact without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Scrapyard atmosphere saturates action without stalling it; the wax-orb, the tanker shade, and spring’s shimmer serve as micro-settings that guide and constrain choices—objects and place shape the final hushed image.</comment>

<grade>7.5</grade>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Resilience vs desolation theme emerges through image, not label; final glow of wax orb quietly reweights “waste” into promise, earning resonance without sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Consistent close-third canine perception—Kael’s sniffing nostrils, jaw-grip, ear-scratch—gives vivid POV texture; lyric cadence modulates with terrain without slipping into exposition.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Clean, sensory compression—“creosote and ash” vs “tiny miracle”—and only two brief redundant stems; momentum stays intact, no figurative muddle at exit.</comment>

<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Post-apocalyptic salvage quest is shop-worn, but fresh tilt of ex-corpser bloodhound with preserved autumn leaf gives specific emotional engine and earns place.</comment>
