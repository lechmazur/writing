<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Eli’s interiority is specific—“creeping normality noticer” is shown through her scanning gaze and ritual placement of objects—but the final beat of “forever changed” is asserted rather than embodied; no contradictory impulse is dramatized in the climax, so the cost feels abstract.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the house’s aliveness is newly legible and Eli’s stance toward it is crystallized. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of hush and object placement tightens toward the charged image—yet the causal chain from shard to revelation is more associative than driven.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The bay, shop, and house perimeter are sketched with selective sensory detail; the orris root shard functions as micro-setting that constrains Eli’s ritual. Spatial choreography is clean, but the environment never actively resists or limits her, keeping the score just below the 9-band gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding why some houses feel alive—is signaled early and deepens through the ritual. One meaningful tightening occurs when the shard amplifies perception, but the cost is conceptual rather than viscerally felt, capping the escalation just above the 8-band threshold.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of sanctifying space through attentive displacement emerges organically from Eli’s actions; the final image of the house as “living, breathing entity” reweights earlier motifs without moralizing. Subtext is carried in gesture and object-choice, though the epiphany edges toward summary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet controlled, with a perceptual signature attuned to subtle shifts—“daydreaming with a soft, ethereal glow.” Syntax modulates with emotional rise; no head-hopping or register drift. Dialogue is minimal but natural when present.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; occasional soft phrases (“inexplicable connection,” “forever changed”) dilute precision. No loops or mixed metaphors, yet a few elevated abstractions keep it from the 9-band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The fusion of perfumery, ritual object-placement, and architectural animism feels fresh; the “shard of hush” concept is specific rather than gimmicky. Risk is moderate—quiet lyric rather than structural daring—but the synthesis is memorable.</comment>
