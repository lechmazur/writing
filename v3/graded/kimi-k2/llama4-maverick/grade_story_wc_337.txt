<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Interiority is evocative (“lucid unrest,” “quiet disturbance”) but stays abstract; no contradictory impulses collide in-scene. Motivation to “ground restless spirits” is declared early and reiterated rather than tested; the final renunciation is gentle but not visibly costly. Embodied emotion is limited to breathing and hand movements; no genuine struggle or flaw complicates the task.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: silence thickens, colors intensify, spirits disperse in a single cadence shift. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Earned Stasis—as the restorer accepts perpetual return to the craft; cost is the accumulated silence she now carries. Orientation is immediate; no causality breaks. One transition (walking away) is within scope.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prism sanctuary, starlight, and the net create a tactile micro-setting; the net’s fibers literally constrain her tactics. Sensory selection is biased toward hush and luminescence, mirroring interior state. Spatial choreography is coherent; the sanctuary’s glow charges the final image as the tapestry needle vibrates with residual energy.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—freeing spirits—signaled early. Escalation is textural: each untied knot thins the hush until the final release narrows her future to perpetual return. Agency is continuous, renunciatory; cost is the silence she now bears. No external reversals, but the deepening pattern suffices under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</question><comment>Theme of silence as both burden and balm emerges through action and image rather than statement. Subtext lies in the needle’s residual vibration and the restorer’s “lucid unrest.” Final image reframes earlier motifs without moralizing. Complexity is present but leans toward the lyrical rather than the morally ambiguous.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</question><comment>Voice is hushed, rhythmic, and consistent; perceptual signature favors luminescence and texture. Syntax elongates then compresses to mirror the work’s slow tempo. No dialogue; free-indirect style is clean. Occasional elevated diction (“exhume,” “palpable”) fits the mythic register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</question><comment>Prose is lush yet disciplined; no loops or scaffold. Metaphors (“velvety stillness,” “kaleidoscope of colors”) are coherent and purposeful. Rhythm modulates with scene needs. Minor filter-verb clusters (“seemed to”) are voice-motivated and do not stall momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</question><comment>Premise—restorer freeing spirits through net-unraveling—is fresh, synthesizing craft ritual with ghost lore. Specificity of the prism sanctuary and tapestry needle prevents generic drift. Risk lies in quiet lyricism; it pays off in the charged final image. No close echoes of famous scenes.</comment>
