<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The druid’s motivation is stated but never tested; interiority drifts into abstraction (“warlike serenity”) rather than embodied contradiction. No micro-choice under pressure reveals hierarchy of values. The frozen figure functions as exposition, not crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Closure is a thematic epiphany (“mirrors show the soul”) rather than a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost. Causal chain is loose: the seed never activates, the expanding circles remain metaphor, and the mirror cracks without altering live options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Swirling orchard vortex is atmospherically rich but static; it never constrains movement or choice. Spatial choreography is vague—distance to the frozen figure, ground texture, tree positions blur. Sensory detail is vivid yet ornamental rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Stakes are declared (“discover what mirrors don’t show”) but never sharpened; no escalating trade-off or irreversible cost appears. The frozen confession releases information without forcing a new tactic. Pressure plateaus rather than tightens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Theme of hidden truth versus reflection emerges implicitly, yet the final articulation drifts toward pronouncement. Subtext is present but flattened by repeated explicit mentions of “what mirrors don’t show.” Complexity is gestured at rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Voice is consistent and lyrical, with some rhythmic control, but diction occasionally slips into generic epic cadence (“malevolent energy,” “forsaken place”). Perceptual signature is present but not sharply individuated; the druid’s worldview remains archetypal.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean and readable, yet loops of near-synonyms (“swirling,” “twisted,” “writhing”) and stock phrases (“heavy with the scent”) dilute density. No line-level artifact blocks clarity, but compression is modest.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of druidic quest and mirror metaphysics is fresh in outline, but execution leans on familiar dark-fantasy tropes without transformative specificity. Risk is moderate; conceptually intriguing but not yet inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
