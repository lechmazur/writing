<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Interiority is evocative—"tactile reminder," "hopeful melancholy"—but the tutor’s choices remain observational; no decisive micro-choice alters tactics. The exile is felt as mood, not as a crucible forcing a visible trade-off. Closure is a mood shift, not an earned renunciation with cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Closure is a lyrical mood crystallization (Charged Poise) rather than a Decisive Change; the lens is Accumulative/Textural and holds, but the cost is atmospheric, not legible on the page. Orientation is clear by 120 words, yet causality is loose—no because/therefore linkage tightens options. The ending reconfigures meaning but without a felt forfeiture.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Twilight magnetic nexus is vividly rendered—"mystical glow," "otherworldly energy"—and the basalt dent recurs as tactile anchor. However, setting never materially constrains choice; it amplifies mood rather than limiting tactics. Micro-setting (bench, stone) is specific but ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Stakes are abstract: "uncover a new truth," "beauty in the difficult." Pressure is atmospheric, not incremental; no tightening beat narrows options or exacts a visible price. The conflict is internal and static, lacking a catalytic test.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of finding beauty in difficulty emerges through image and silence rather than statement, but its articulation remains general. Subtext is present yet thin; the final image reweights earlier motifs but without surprising depth. Avoids overt moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Voice is consistent, lyrical, and reflective; diction ("eclipsed covenant," "magnetic nexus") creates texture without register drift. Perceptual signature is strong—silence translated into language—but compression is light, allowing some repetition. No dialogue to test voice distinctness.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is fluid and rhythmic, but loops ("the tutor felt...") and near-paraphrase clusters dull momentum. Metaphors are coherent yet occasionally generic ("stars shone brighter"). No artifact touches the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Premise of exiled chess tutor decoding silence at a magnetic nexus is fresh, but the execution leans on familiar lyric tropes. Specificity of chess pedagogy is underused; the synthesis feels promising yet not fully realized. Risk is moderate, coherence intact.</comment>
