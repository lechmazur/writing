<question>1</question>
<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Aria’s memory-tasting gift and gentle-rebel stance are clearly motivated, yet interior depth stays mostly summary: “flavors of joy, sorrow, longing danced on her palate” tells rather than dramatizes contradiction under pressure. A credible renunciation occurs—she foregoes nostalgic safety for new growth—but the cost is soft-landed by lyric affirmation rather than embodied loss.</comment>

<question>2</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>The plot traces an Accumulative/Textural arc: vignettes of preparation cumulatively charge the greenhouse until the alignment reweights everything. Closure is a Charged Poise (“new story was growing”) with conceptual rather than visceral cost; the lens holds but could be more taut.</comment>

<question>3</question>
<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The greenhouse is rendered with textured decay and fragrant specificity—“rusted metal beams corroded by time”—and ultimately houses the sprout that constrains the closer choice, satisfying the micro-setting bar.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake is Aria’s gentle rebellion against decay through creation; pressure rises elegantly via the celestial tide and seed’s imminent sprout. Cost is suggested—“a testament to beauty forged from the ruins”—but stays symbolic rather than sharp. One tightening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>6.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of rebirth and memory cuisine evolves gracefully through sensory returns, but late summarizing (“her craft was not just about cooking but about healing”) edges toward overt statement. Subtext is present but doesn’t fully trust silence.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person privative slips elegantly via synesthetic focus: the prose tastes the past in textures. Syntax and diction stay lush without clogging momentum; only intermittent drifting toward elevated exposition mildly dilutes immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Craft is lyrical and readable, but metaphor clusters (“a symphony of tastes and textures”) verge on overwritten during climax, and phrases like “key to her craft” edge cliché. Minor rhythm sways keep it slightly short of effortless.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Memory-chef premise is fresh, and the celestial-greenhouse fusion is particular and uncanny. While “taste memory” has scattered precedents, the convergence with astronomical synaptic gardening lands as singular in execution. Risk taken and mostly rewarded.</comment>
