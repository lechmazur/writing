<question>1</question><grade>7.4</question><comment>Akira’s grief-as-investigation is embodied: the heartbeat count pulses under her skin and the porcelain shard becomes a literal artifact of transience. Interiority shows simultaneous fascination and terror toward death; however, the “wisdom from failure” shift lands more stated than dramatized.</comment>

<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration: the final letting-go of the shard crystallizes a stance rather than fixes a plot. The causal chain wobbles—how spilled ink translates to code is hand-waved—but the final image satisfies under an Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<grade>8.0</question>
<comment>The observatory, snow, and porcelain shard feel lived-in and constrain choices: the silence after static is a resource; the shard’s physical edge presses Akira’s palm. Setting is vivid yet never over-described; one more tactile constraint would have lifted it higher.</comment>

<grade>7.3</question>
<comment>Dominant stake—fetch wisdom from a failed life—stays legible. Pressure builds as Akira shifts from deciphering patterns to accepting the ghost’s residue, but the escalation is gentle rather than narrowing; the felt price is interior (peace) rather than palpable loss.</comment>

<grade>8.7</question>
<comment>Theme of transience vs digital permanence emerges through imagery without moralizing. The porcelain shard reappearing at the end carries a reweighted echo, recharging the question of legacy. Nearly avoids the final-paragraph echo penalty only on the strength of restraint.</comment>

<grade>8.6</question>
<comment>Lyrical third-person close control fits Akira’s obsessive interior mode; rhythm breathes under pressure without descending into monotony. Compression is intentional: sentence length compresses as heartbeat counts shorten, propelling forward motion.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.9</question>
<comment>Most sentences advance; occasional density slips (“as if it held the essence of...”) flirt with overwriting but remain within voice. Punctuation and verb strength are excellent under lyric mode. One minor scaffold redundancy: “solace...solace.”</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.0</question>
<comment>The fusion of digital-ghost myth with grief-and-ink divination is distinctive. Transforms familiar images (snow, death certificate) into charged micro-objects without gimmickry. Could push even further into specificity of the code fragment itself.</comment>
