<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lena’s obsession is vivid, but her interiority drifts into summary (“she became convinced”) rather than embodied contradiction; the final realization that she sought the void left by her own loss is strong, yet the cost is more asserted than dramatized on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of 4-1-5-9 tightens until the reveal that files were archived, not deleted. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing with felt absence, though the cost is more conceptual than visceral.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Archive is evoked with dust, servers, and metadata, but the micro-setting never physically constrains Lena’s choices; the “echo of forgotten songs” is atmospheric rather than tactical. Still, sensory selection is purposeful and consistent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—uncover what happened to the missing employees—escalates via the recurring numbers and the warning “They’re watching.” The tightening is intellectual rather than visceral; the cost is the haunting absence, but it’s more stated than shown.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of digital ghosts and personal void emerges organically through pattern and absence; the ending reframes the search as self-confrontation without moralizing. Resonant, but the emotional aftereffect could cut deeper.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Voice is consistent, with a cool, archival detachment that suits the POV; compression and elision are purposeful. Occasional drift toward elevated diction (“digital detritus”) slightly dilutes immediacy but remains coherent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; minor loops (“haunting sense of absence” echoed) and a few stock phrases (“shiver run down her spine”) keep it from the top band. No artifacts touch the closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The fusion of corporate archive, cold-case SF, and personal grief feels fresh; the 4-1-5-9 pattern and “Echo-1” patch are specific rather than generic. A bolder risk—e.g., deeper embodiment of the archive’s physicality—could push higher.</comment>
