<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The sentimentalist’s interiority is consistently voiced, but choices remain abstract—no micro-choice alters tactics or forecloses a path with visible cost. The gear and sonar serve as props rather than crucibles. The final “vanishing” is a mood beat, not an earned renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final image crystallizes the burden of sharing light without fire, reweighting earlier motifs. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of image and cadence shift carry the cost. No causality break, though agency is diffuse.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The nebula garden is rendered with lush, selective sensory detail that filters through the POV’s cosmic preoccupation. Spatial anchors are clear early; the “quiet sigh of falling petals” recharges the final image. Environment constrains only atmospherically, not tactically, keeping it just shy of 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—transmit cosmic beauty without destructive fire—is declared early and held. Pressure tightens via image accumulation rather than choice; no on-page reversal or trade-off narrows options. Cost is conceptual, felt only in the final hush.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of gentle illumination versus destructive passion emerges through recurring imagery rather than statement. The final “troubling serenity” reweights prior motifs without moralizing. Subtext is present but leans on cosmic grandeur, not interpersonal friction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric, consistent, and textured; diction stays within the elevated register of an otherworldly observer. No dialogue; no POV drift. Rhythm modulates with the nebula’s drift, though occasional syntactic loops dull propulsion.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is often luminous, but stacked cosmic metaphors create mild density drag. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks. Final cadence lands cleanly; earlier sentences could lose 5–7 words without loss.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Cosmic garden + anti-fire enlightenment is a fresh synthesis, avoiding typical pyrotechnic climaxes. Risk lies in quiet lyricism; it pays off in the final hush. Some phrasing edges toward familiar cosmic awe, keeping it under 8.5.</comment>
