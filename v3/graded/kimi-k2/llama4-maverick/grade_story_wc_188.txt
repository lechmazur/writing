<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority is specific (“ambient awareness that guided her design process”), but her choices remain observational until the closing minutes, muting internal contradiction and micro­-choice under pressure; the Charged Poise lands but cost is inferred rather than dramatized on the page, so full 8.8 gate miss.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/T extural lens holds; closure as Resonant Reconfiguration is legible—mood shift from “weight of hopelessness” to crystallized optimism—but causality leans on serendipity rather than tightening choice; cost is softly atmospheric, not pinned to a single beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Lantern glow, bloom pigments, and spinner arc all constrain sight-lines and fuel imagery for fireworks sketches; micro-setting is tactile and selective, satisfying 8.0+ gate. The mosaic tile itself functions as an object constraint, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Dominate stake defying “gravity of hopelessness” is early and clear; single deepening through mosaic note triggers stance crystallization with atmospheric cost. Escalation stays coherent under Accumulative/T extural lens.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>6.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from particulars—flame rhythms morphing into sky art—yet final paragraph voices the thematic statement in near-prompt language (“final testament to the power of inspiration”), incurring a −0.5 hit for mild thematic echo.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Free-indirect lyricism matches Lira’s designer perception; rhythm modulates with internal cadence, no POV drift or register collision; subtle voice distinction maintained under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.6</question>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with scene pace; sentence variety strong, though occasional elegant variation edges toward lyrical surplus without obscuring clarity. No scaffolding loops detected.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Fireworks artist who converts street fire-spinning into aerial bloom is fresh; synthesis feels organic, though conceptual arc stays modest for 8.8+ tier.</comment>
