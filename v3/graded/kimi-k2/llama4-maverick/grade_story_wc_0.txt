<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Maria’s interiority is textured—her scientific lens filters every perception—but the story leans on summary rather than dramatized contradiction; no moment of irreversible choice under pressure surfaces, so the arc feels observational rather than crucible-tested.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a quiet Conceptual Repricing: the greenhouse becomes a laboratory of humility, the cost a permanent epistemic limit. Causality is Accumulative/Textural—dust patterns reweight meaning—held cleanly to the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The storm-damaged greenhouse is evoked with selective sensory detail (damp earth, grimy panes) that constrains movement and attention; the butterfly-wing slide functions as micro-setting, charging the final image with iridescent constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding gradual change—tightens once when Maria recognizes decay’s creative role, but the escalation is contemplative, not tactical; no irreversible choice or visible price is dramatized on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the tension between destruction and generative decay; the butterfly-wing dust becomes a non-literal answer, reweighting the premise without moralizing. Subtext operates in silence and image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays close to Maria’s scientific perceptual signature; diction is precise, rhythms modulate with her reverence. No dialogue appears, so voice coherence rests on filtered observation and remains consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; occasional abstract nouns (“epistemic humility”) edge toward academic register but stay within Maria’s lexicon. No loops or mixed metaphors mar the closing cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>The fusion of astrophysics with post-flood ecology feels fresh; the neutron-star lens reframes decay without gimmickry. Specificity of dust patterns and greenhouse ruin anchors universals in lived detail.</comment>
