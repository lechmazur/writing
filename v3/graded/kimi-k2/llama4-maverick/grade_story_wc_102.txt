<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Aria’s interiority is evocative but drifts into abstract “unused love” therapy-speak; the pilgrim’s ember-eyes remain archetype rather than person. The final stance crystallizes, yet the cost is only asserted, not dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Aria’s stance reconfigures, but the lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of breath and blossom—not causal. Orientation is clear by 120 words; no causality break, yet the pilgrim’s exit feels like convenient fade.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The twilight viaduct is lush, selective, and mirrored in Aria’s breathing; wisteria glow charges the final image. Micro-setting (pendant, railing) constrains gesture, but the city beyond stays postcard.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“find where unused love is stored”—is signaled early. One tightening: breathwork surfaces stored love. Cost is conceptual (love now flows) but not visibly paid; pressure deepens rather than narrows options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of compassion as self-source emerges through image, not statement. Final reprise of wisteria dancers reweights earlier blossoms. Avoids moralizing, but “love you seek is within” edges toward echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Lyric third-person limited stays coherent; perceptual signature filters world through Aria’s camera-obscura gaze. Rhythm modulates with breath cadence; no head-hop. Dialogue is minimal but voice-apt.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose is sensuous yet disciplined; occasional perfume-heavy lines (“ethereal dancers”) flirt with purple. No loops or scaffold, but “foggy lucidity” is repeated without reweight. Read-aloud rhythm holds.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Camera-obscura artist + Kwan Yin tear + pilgrim of sparks is fresh synthesis; avoids stock urban-fantasy. Risk lies in near-mystical overlay, but specificity of breath-pattern keeps it from cliché.</comment>
