<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The noticer’s interiority is evocative but remains largely observational; her “tenuous absolution” is stated rather than dramatized through a decisive micro-choice. The gardener’s presence supplies gentle pressure, yet the relationship never crystallizes into a crucible that forces a visible cost or stance shift. The final smile feels like a soft echo rather than earned stasis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a quiet Charged Poise—the noticer’s gratitude and promise to return reconfigure her stance with a felt, if subtle, cost of leaving the sanctuary. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: repeated visits and sensory layering tighten the emotional cadence. Orientation is clear within the first 120 words; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The tea house and courtyard are rendered with selective, sensory precision; vines and weathered wood constrain movement and mood. Yet no object or micro-setting actively narrows the final choice—the bread almost does, but its agency is retrospective. Vivid, but not fully instrumental at the end.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding the sacred in the ordinary—remains more thematic than viscerally tested. Pressure accumulates through repeated visits and seasonal shift, but no single beat forces a trade-off or visible forfeiture. The tightening is atmospheric rather than option-narrowing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically from the juxtaposition of vanished bakery, guerrilla gardening, and tenuous absolution. The final image of the noticer disappearing into fading light offers a resonant, non-moralizing answer. Subtext is present but occasionally drifts toward gentle abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical, consistent, and filtered through the noticer’s perceptual bias—selective noticing of scent, texture, and silence. Syntax modulates with emotional intensity; no head-hopping or register drift. Dialogue is minimal but unobtrusive.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; occasional soft loops (“sense of peace that lingered…”) are minor. Metaphors stay coherent; no purple drift. Final paragraph leans slightly explanatory, dulling the last image’s edge.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>The fusion of guerrilla gardening, vanished bakery, and creeping normality feels fresh and specific. Tropes of secret sanctuaries and absolution are transformed through sensory texture and quiet stakes. Risk is modest but coherent.</comment>
