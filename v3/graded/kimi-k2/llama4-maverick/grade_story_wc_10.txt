<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Interiority is embodied and consistent; survivor’s need to translate silence into music drives every micro-choice. The final nod to “rectify” shows earned collaboration, but the cost feels abstract rather than viscerally paid. Relationship with Eli is sketched more through parallel focus than crucible pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (frost, hum, sunrise light) thickens until the silent “symphony” crystallizes. Closure is a Charged Poise—the music now carried inside her—yet the felt cost is more conceptual than tangible. Orientation is swift and stable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Winterglass conservatory is vivid, selective, and causally active: temperature differential, light spectrum, and plant response all shape the creative process. The space itself becomes a resonant chamber that charges the final image of carried music. Micro-setting detail constrains choice without clutter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—translating silence into shareable music—tightens through iterative calibration of frequencies against heat-mapped emotion. One clear deepening beat: their joint adjustment to “rectify” narrows options to a perfected silence. Cost is present but understated.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of finding marvel in silence emerges organically from iterative craft rather than statement. Final image of music carried into the frosty world offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. Subtext in Eli’s silent gaze and plant “listening” enriches the idea.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with rhythmic control matching the tuning-fork vibrations. POV stays tightly focalized; no head-hop. Occasional elevated diction (“unshaken marvels”) edges toward register drift but remains consistent with survivor’s reflective stance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose is clean, propulsive, and information-dense; sensory details multitask. One paraphrase loop (“music they created together…music had become a part”) mildly dulls momentum. No mixed metaphors or scaffolding in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Premise of composing silence via tactile vibration and emotion-mapping is fresh yet inevitable. Tropes of post-apocalyptic art-making are transformed through specific conservatory constraints. Risk-taking in silent “symphony” pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
