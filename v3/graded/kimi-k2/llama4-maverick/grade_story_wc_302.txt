<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Vivid sensuality and tactile interiority anchor the veiled dreamer, but choices are guided more by symbol than driven stakes; the cyclical-watch motif constrains tactics only marginally.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as quiet reverie rather than decisive change—lovely, but lacks visible cost from the inferred lens; cause-and-effect linkage is aesthetic, not causal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>The glowing library enchants and pressures sensory narrowing; mist–luminescence pairing guides micro-moves, yet macro-environment does not materially alter final option space.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade>
<comment>Central stake—finding the mythical library—stays abstract; no tightening turn forces a trade-off or deepens cost on the page; pressure is lyrical rather than intensifying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of unspoken truth resonates through accumulation of journals and whispers, ending reweights content quietly; however, moral is implicit and lacks sharp conceptual repricing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Signature texture—long lyrical sentences breathing with incantation—coheres throughout; compression under pressure is acceptable, but occasional register drift into “ethereal” cliché peeks through.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Rhythmic, dense prose delights ear and carries information; occasional overwrought metaphors (e.g. “truth just beyond the veil of reality”) mildly dull precision without breaking clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Synthesizes familiar quest-of-mist motifs into a fresh mood-texture experience; specific cipher device and journal conceit are memorable but remain ornament rather than structural pivot.</comment>
