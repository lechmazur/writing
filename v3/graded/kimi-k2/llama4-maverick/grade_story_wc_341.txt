<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Lyra’s interiority is vivid and embodied, but her motives remain largely observational; no decisive micro-choice alters tactics or forecloses a path with visible cost. The mentor memory deepens texture yet does not force a present-tense trade-off. Closure is a mood shift rather than an earned renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: lyrical density and cadence shift memorialize the storm. Closure is a Charged Poise—“sense of spooled wholeness”—but the cost is atmospheric rather than a concrete forfeiture or reconfiguration of options. Orientation is clear early; no causality break, yet stakes feel internal and low-temperature.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Sky-gondola micro-setting is tactile—brass telescope, panoramic windows, fading light—and filters perception. Environment constrains only by mood; it does not physically limit choices or charge the final image with a price. Sensory specificity is strong, but constraint function is mild.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—memorializing the storm and proving empty spaces remember—is signaled early. Pressure is lyrical, not causal; no tightening choice narrows options or exacts a visible price. Escalation is tonal deepening rather than actionable conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme of memory-as-wholeness emerges through image and reflection rather than statement. Final telescope gaze reweights earlier motifs, offering quiet resonance without moralizing. Subtext is present but leans toward poetic abstraction rather than sharpened irony or moral cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical, consistent, and perceptually specific—“dusty starlight tone” modulates with emotional pressure. No dialogue; internal monologue avoids filter-verb clutter. Rhythm and diction serve the accumulative design; minor drift toward elevated register is voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is fluid and image-rich, with rhythmic variation and minimal scaffold. Occasional soft loops (“As the night wore on…”) and gentle abstraction slightly dilute propulsion. No mixed metaphors or line-level artifacts in the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Cloud-categorization-by-emotion and “spooled wholeness” offer fresh conceptual angles, but the piece leans on lyrical mood rather than transformative risk. Specificity of meteorological inheritance and brass telescope lends memorability; premise is not radically re-imagined, yet execution feels personal.</comment>
