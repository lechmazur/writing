<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lyra’s claustrophobia is stated but never embodied in breath, pulse, or spatial panic; the “prudently adventurous” label is repeated rather than dramatized. Interiority drifts into abstract lyricism (“burning need,” “wistful rebellion”) instead of concrete contradiction under pressure. The final insight is declared, not earned by prior micro-choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the “vital key” becomes an insight, reweighting the quest. Causal chain is thin—organ music guides, crystal reveals—but the spatial mutiny is asserted rather than shown. Cost is implied (“leave this magical place”) yet not dramatized on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is rich—damp earth, stone, starlight—and the crystal-as-organ source is vivid. However, the “shadowed nexus” remains a vague container; no environmental detail constrains Lyra’s final choice. Micro-setting (compass, crystal) is more specific than the tunnels themselves.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—uncover the lost key—is signaled early. Pressure escalates via the organ’s pull and the crystal’s awakening, but the tightening is asserted rather than felt; Lyra’s agency is largely observational. No visible price is extracted before the insight.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of transformation through discovery emerges implicitly from the crystal’s awakening. The “fallow period” motif returns in the final paragraph, reweighted by new vitality. Yet the insight is delivered in summary, muting resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is lush, consistent, and atmospheric; sensory detail is filtered through Lyra’s awe. Occasional elevated diction (“inky blackness,” “spatial mutiny”) edges toward purple but stays within lyric mode. No dialogue to test distinction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is fluid and rhythmic, with strong sensory specificity. Minor loops—“the music seemed,” “Lyra felt”—and stacked modifiers slightly dilute propulsion. No clarity issues at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Fusion of church-organ-as-guide and crystal-as-archive feels fresh; the “spatial mutiny” concept is evocative but under-realized. Risk lies in lyric excess rather than structural daring; still, the synthesis avoids cliché.</comment>
