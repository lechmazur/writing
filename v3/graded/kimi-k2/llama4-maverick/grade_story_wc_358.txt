<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Interiority is competent—gloves, pouch, shiver—but micro-choices remain observational; no contradictory impulse is dramatized. The final “determination” is asserted, not earned by a visible cost. Patch functions as emblem rather than decision catalyst. Character reads as diligent archetype rather than individual under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure is a soft Charged Poise: she exits the labyrinth “one step closer,” but the cost is only implied. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of wind notes and container geometry—but the final reconfiguration lacks a felt forfeiture. Orientation is clear; no causality breaks, yet no decisive pivot either.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Container maze is vividly sketched—“towering labyrinth,” “creaking in the breeze”—and the wind eddies serve as micro-setting that alters her survey. Spatial choreography is coherent; the orange sunset charges the final image. However, the environment never physically constrains her next move; it remains backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understand the crash to prevent recurrence—is signaled early. Pressure tightens via accumulating wind data, but the turn is informational, not actionable; no option is foreclosed on the page. Cost is deferred to future action, not dramatized here.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Theme of foresight emerges from iterative observation rather than statement. Subtext is present in the silence and the patch-as-relic, yet the final paragraph edges toward overt lesson: “lessons were learned.” Complexity is hinted but not fully embraced.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Voice is consistent, professional, slightly cool; perceptual signature favors tactile detail (“rust and saltwater”) and procedural rhythm. No dialogue, no POV drift. Compression is purposeful; occasional stock phrasing (“shiver run down her spine”) slightly flattens texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense. Occasional scaffold—“the investigator felt a sense of clarity wash over her”—but no loops or mixed metaphors. Sensory selection is disciplined. Minor register drift toward abstract nouns (“cultivation of foresight”) keeps it from the 8-band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Premise of forensic wind-mapping in a post-crisis port is fresh, yet the execution hews to familiar investigative beats. The patch-as-memory-object is evocative but not transformed. Risk is moderate; no structural daring beyond accumulative texture.</comment>
