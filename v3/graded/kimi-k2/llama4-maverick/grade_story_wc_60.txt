<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Aria’s interiority is vivid (“defiant hush,” “sidereal patience”) and her embodied choices (kneeling, brushing dust, opening the box) align with motive. Yet the internal contradiction—skeptic vs believer—remains asserted rather than dramatized in scene; no moment shows her doubt colliding with wonder. The final vow of guardianship is earned by the causal chain but the cost feels generalized rather than personally staked.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the stained glass box is opened, memories released, fountains stir—an unmistakable Decisive Change with felt civic cost. Causal linkage holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each breadcrumb tightens the pattern until the final image reweights the city’s future. Orientation is secure by line 4; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>“City of forgotten fountains” is more epithet than lived environment; nevertheless the dry basins, dusty streets, and hidden chamber ground the quest. The geese motif recurs to charge the doorway, satisfying micro-setting use. Still, the fountains only awaken off-stage; they do not physically constrain Aria’s final choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—liberate trapped memories—is signaled early and tightened once when the glass shards confirm the path. Agency is present but low-grade; Aria follows rather than tests the trail. The cost (responsibility of guardianship) is declared rather than dramatized on the page, capping escalation below the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of memory as civic soul emerges organically through the quest and the fountains’ revival. Subtext is carried by image (shards, geese carvings) rather than statement. Final paragraph edges toward thematic echo (“Aria…would be their voice”) but stops short of overt moralizing, preserving resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly latched to Aria’s perceptions; diction (“luminous skeptic,” “sidereal patience”) creates a distinct lyric texture. Rhythm modulates with pressure—long cadences for patience, clipped fragments (“She knelt…”) at discovery. No POV leakage or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and image-rich; sentences advance story or atmosphere without scaffold. Occasional elevated phrasing (“kaleidoscope of images and emotions”) skirts overwriting but remains anchored in POV. No loops, no mixed metaphors; punctuation and tense are clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Familiar quest arc is refreshed by the memory-fountain conceit and the sidereal-patience trait. Geese-as-breadcrumbs offers a non-obvious linkage between migration and memory. While the city’s rebirth is archetypal, the specific fusion of stained glass, fountains, and guardianship feels particular to this telling.</comment>
