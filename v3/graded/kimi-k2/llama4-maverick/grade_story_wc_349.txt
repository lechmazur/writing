<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Ember’s curiosity and restraint are believable, but the interiority drifts into abstract self-diagnosis (“mindfully scattered,” “sense of connection”) rather than embodied contradiction. No micro-choice after the incise-hesitation shows a visible cost; the renunciation is purely internal and reads as epiphany rather than crucible. The “clean slate vendor” label never informs a decision on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Ember returns the bottle, now hearing the library’s “ethereal music,” a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost—she forfeits immediate knowledge for guardianship. Causality under Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of attention (quantifying absence) thickens atmosphere until meaning crystallizes. Orientation is clear by word 60; no lens ambiguity. Minor time-line wobble: “first opening day” lull stretches without clock or customer intrusion, but this does not breach closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Glass orchard library is vividly anchored—refracting light, lattice, crystals—yet remains backdrop; it never physically constrains Ember’s movement or tool choice. Bottle’s shifting moonlight is micro-setting that charges the final image, satisfying 9+ gate. Selective sensory detail (soft diffused light, gentle swirling clouds) mirrors internal calm without cataloguing.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—guardianship vs. discovery—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once: incise urge versus vendor creed. The refusal forecloses the path but the price is only conceptual (“she would never see the world in the same way”); no tangible loss or external consequence is dramatized, keeping cost legible but light.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of stories residing in silence and structure emerges through image rather than statement. Final image of attuned heart reweights prior material without moral. Whispered phrase “glimmering parole” is thematic echo spoken by narrative, not character, costing −0.4; still, ambiguity lingers productively.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Ember; perceptual signature is calm, analytical, slightly reverent. Syntax lengthens during reflection, shortens at incise hesitation, mirroring breath. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk zero. Occasional loftiness (“mindfully scattered”) edges toward template cadence but remains consistent with librarian-poet persona.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical yet lean; no loops or scaffold. Mixed metaphor risk in “glass orchard… refracting… latticework and glittering crystals” resolves on re-read. Information density high; each sentence advances atmosphere or interiority. One register drift: “quantifying absence” slips into academic diction, but phrase is brief and motivated.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Floating glass library and bottled moonlight feel fresh, but core arc—curious guardian resists tampering with artifact—maps neatly to “mystical shopkeeper” template. Specificity of “quantifying absence” as method and the library’s musical respiration add idiosyncratic lift. Transformation present: bottle’s untouched glow reweights silence as narrative source, preventing swap-out.</comment>
