<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Kaelin’s mechanically warm hands and obsession with sideways time are vivid, but her interiority drifts into abstract wonder rather than contradictory impulse; the final “reluctance” is asserted, not dramatized with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing—time does move sideways—yet the cost is only “tingling” hands; lens is Accumulative/Textural, pattern taught early, but the sideways jump feels more scenic than causally earned.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Station, simulator, and alien twilight are rendered with selective sensory detail; the simulator chamber becomes a micro-setting that constrains the final touch, though spatial choreography during the jump is vague.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove sideways time—is signaled early; pressure tightens when the nexus forms, but escalation is driven by the machine, not Kaelin’s choice; cost is conceptual rather than viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Theme of hidden temporal layers emerges through image rather than statement; final awe is earned, yet the “universe full of mysteries” edges toward generic profundity, blunting resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Voice is consistent, with a calm, precise diction suited to a mechanic; occasional lyrical lifts (“icy warmth”) are purposeful. No dialogue, so no voice contamination; perceptual signature is clear.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense, but suffers from light scaffold (“the world around her dissolved…”) and a few stock phrases (“kaleidoscope of colors”) that dull the peak beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Combines hard-SF repair work with lyric time-slip; the sideways-time twist feels fresh, though the winged-creature metaphor is familiar. Specificity of the simulator’s holographic mechanics helps offset trope echoes.</comment>
