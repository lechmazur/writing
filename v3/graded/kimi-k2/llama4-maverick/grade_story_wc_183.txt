<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Lyra’s motivation to find the Garden is stated early and her “blissfully aberrant” gift is shown guiding her pattern-seeking, but interiority drifts into summary (“she felt a thrill,” “she knew”) rather than embodied contradiction; the final peace arrives without a visible renunciation or cost that would foreclose a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—Lyra reaches the Garden and redefines it as “a state of mind”—but the shift is asserted rather than dramatized with on-page cost; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds, yet the tightening beat is soft, more mood than irreversible change.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>The fog-shrouded carnival ship is evoked with sensory precision (“scent of decay,” “rickety rollercoasters”) and functions as a metaphorical crucible for memory; however, the Garden itself appears only as a postcard image, not constraining the final choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—find the Garden—remains abstract; pressure rises via thickening fog and merging memories, but no single beat forces a trade-off or visible forfeiture, so escalation is atmospheric rather than causal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</question>
<comment>The theme of memory’s fragility emerges through the ship’s decay and Lyra’s immersion in stories, but the final paragraph’s explicit redefinition of the Garden edges toward thematic statement rather than earned resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</question>
<comment>Voice is lyrical and consistent, with a perceptual signature attuned to pattern and scent; occasional filter phrases (“she felt,” “she realized”) dilute immediacy, yet the rhythm sustains a dreamlike cohesion.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</question>
<comment>Prose is generally clean and evocative, but repetitive scaffolding (“she began to,” “she knew”) and stacked abstractions (“fragility of human memory”) slacken momentum; no artifact touches the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</question>
<comment>The carnival-ship-as-memory-archive is a fresh synthesis, and the Garden reframed as mental state avoids cliché, though the core quest structure remains familiar; risk-taking is moderate but coherent.</comment>
