<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid—hands chiseling while “turmoil within” pulses—but the shift from grief to insight is narrated rather than dramatized; the mentor’s spectral nod is the only external pressure, so the final “shape of collective grief” feels more declared than earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: dusk thickens, butterflies arrive, ribbon unrolls, and the greenhouse’s lunar glow crystallizes the reconfiguration. Closure is a Charged Poise—grief reweighted by beauty—yet the cost (accepting loss as cyclical) is only implicitly felt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The greenhouse’s mist, scent, and lunar sheen are selective and POV-filtered; the headstone and ribbon act as micro-settings that anchor memory. The final butterfly cluster charges the image, but the environment never actively constrains her choice—she simply sits in it.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding grief’s shape—is signaled early and deepens as butterflies gather, but escalation is atmospheric, not causal; no option is foreclosed, no price visibly paid. The tightening is a cadence shift, not a decision.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of grief-as-cycle emerges through butterfly migration and ribbon ritual, avoiding explicit moral. The mentor’s poem reprise offers resonance, yet the insight remains slightly abstract—more felt than tested.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical, controlled, and consistent; sensory diction (“serene gloom,” “thundering calm”) modulates with emotional intensity. No dialogue, so no voice leakage; POV stays tightly interior.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is fluid and read-aloud ready, with rhythmic variation and strong verbs. Occasional soft phrases (“gentle stream,” “soft whisper”) flirt with cliché but never stall momentum; no loops or mixed metaphors.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Fusion of gravestone craft, spectral mentorship, and butterfly migration feels fresh; the greenhouse-as-mausoleum twist is specific and memorable. The concept risks sentimentality but lands on earned quiet.</comment>
