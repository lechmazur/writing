<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Emilia’s interiority is vivid and embodied, but her contradictory impulses remain largely summarized rather than dramatized in scene; the “forgiving skeptic” trait is asserted rather than tested under pressure. The final resolve to turn mistakes into constellations is announced rather than earned through a visible micro-choice that costs her something on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—Emilia exits the garden with clarified purpose—but the cost is only implied, not felt. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern holds, yet the tightening beat (picking up the tooth) is underplayed and the final cadence shift is gentle rather than charged.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>The secret garden is rendered with selective, sensory detail that mirrors Emilia’s mood, but it never materially constrains her choices; the tooth functions as micro-setting yet its physical properties don’t limit or enable action. Atmosphere is strong, but the 9+ gate (environment constraining choice) is not met.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—making sense of past trauma and finding new purpose—is signaled early and revisited, yet pressure stays largely reflective; no single beat narrows options or exacts a visible price. Escalation is emotional rather than situational, and the final shift feels more epiphanic than costly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of transmuting flaws into beauty emerges organically from imagery and Emilia’s vocation, avoiding overt statement. The final image of the glowing tooth offers a resonant, non-literal answer, though the conceptual cost remains gentle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical, consistent, and filtered through Emilia’s perceptual bias; free-indirect style is clean. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing,” “dynamic balance”) momentarily lifts out of her plausible lexicon, but the slip is minor.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is fluid and image-rich, but suffers from light scaffold—repetitive sentence stems (“As she…”) and near-paraphrase loops that dull momentum. No artifact touches the closure beat, so the cap is not triggered.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Familiar motifs (secret garden, magical token) are refreshed through the bone-setting metaphor and the notion of “turning mistakes into constellations,” creating a specific synthesis. The risk is moderate but coherent; the piece avoids gimmickry.</comment>
