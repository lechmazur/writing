<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The summoner’s calm determination is sketched (calm breathing, graceful hands), but interiority stays broad; choice-points—releasing the wing, entering silence—are ritual gestures rather than nuanced decisions. We are told motive instead of seeing it wrestled; passivity dominates. Earned stasis lands, yet feels pre-ordained.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: silence thickens line by line, reweighting the prophecy into static. Closure as Charged Poise—the glowing wing drifts away—costs the summoner their vigilance; hush is achieved. Causality intact, if lightweight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The nocturnal haven is lovingly rendered (bloom scent, brook murmur), but its sensory specificity transfers into constraining silence that envelops choice. The micro-setting mattered; final image recharges via water’s quiet onward motion, tightening the cosmic/earthly thread.</question>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Stakes—prevent prophecy imbalance—are declared early yet never met with on-page danger; summoner’s task resolves itself through meditative action. Still, pressure of silence holds, so beat functions. No tangible reversal.</question>
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Theme of silence vs. prophecy emerges via accretion, not sermon. The tranquil blaze of the ending reframes the night without overt moralizing, offering a resonant non-literal answer to imbalance. Effective, though abstract.</question>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Lyric third-person voice is rich (terrestrially cosmic, tranquil blaze) and remains stable. Elisions (mapping silence) are taught early then paid in the closure drift. Sentence rhythm breathes with intensity, creating charged poise.</question>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elegant, image-dense prose is loop-free, rhythmic, and lucid. Sparse scaffolding; every sentence advances atmosphere or silence. Occasional elevated diction veers close to purple, yet fits the incantatory tone.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Mythic premise of coder-prophecy meets origami-spell mapping is fresh and specific; silence-as-geometry feels inevitable. Gains from quiet synthesis of ritual tech without cliché. Lacks deeper risk, but resonates.</question>
