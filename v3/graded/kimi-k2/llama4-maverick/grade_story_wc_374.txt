<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Aria’s luminous skepticism is asserted rather than dramatized; her only micro-choice is following the vibrating ring. The final “surge of understanding” is an unearned epiphany, lacking embodied contradiction or visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Closure is a CR image (cosmic connection) but arrives via coincidence—the stranger appears exactly when the ring pulses—rather than because/therefore linkage. Orientation is clear early, yet the drive lens shifts from causal to situational without teaching the pattern.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Lavender bluff and aurora are vividly rendered and filter through Aria’s sensory priorities; however, they never constrain her choice or charge the final image, keeping the score below 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>5.7</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—“why some people carry weather”—is declared but never tested; pressure does not tighten. The stranger’s appearance resolves tension by coincidence, not agency, so no visible cost is paid.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>6.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of science versus mysticism is present but articulated in summary (“a world that was both wondrous and explainable”). The final image gestures toward synthesis yet lacks the concrete reweighting needed for 8+ resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical, consistent, and tuned to Aria’s perceptual bias; sensory diction (“sweet scent of blooming lavender,” “spectral light”) is character-specific. Compression and rhythm hold under pressure, though occasional poetic loops slow momentum.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is lush yet mostly disciplined; one paraphrase loop (“world around her seemed…”) and a few stacked modifiers slightly dull immediacy. No artifacts touch the closure beat, so 9+ remains possible.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>The fusion of ecological fantasy with sensory science is fresh, and the “forest elections” conceit is specific. Risk-taking is moderate; the mystical compass premise could swap with any talisman without breaking the arc, capping the score below 9.</comment>
