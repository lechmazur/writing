<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Aria’s interiority is evocative but abstract; the contradiction between her healing gift and the sorrow she channels is stated rather than embodied. No micro-choice under pressure is dramatized—she simply “raises the shard” and speaks. The apparition’s emergence feels externally driven, not compelled by Aria’s specific flaw or decision. Closure arrives as mood, not as earned renunciation or change.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Closure is a lyric mood-shift rather than a legible Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration; the “weight lifting” is asserted, not shown. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—patterned imagery and rising spirit song—but the final image does not reweight the premise with felt cost. Orientation is adequate by 120 words, yet causality between shard, window, and apparition remains fuzzy.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The mangrove labyrinth is lush, sensorily specific, and threaded through action; moonlight and fungi constrain visibility and healing. The suspended windowpane functions as micro-setting that focuses the climax. Spirit voices supply texture but do not materially alter tactics. Overall, environment enriches mood yet stops short of forcing a choice.</comment>

<grade>6.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—uncovering truth behind unsent letters—is declared early but remains abstract; pressure escalates atmospherically, not through narrowed options. No visible cost is extracted from Aria; the apparition dissipates without forcing her to relinquish anything. Escalation is textural (spirit crescendo) rather than causal.</comment>

<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Theme of unspoken regret emerges organically from letters and spirits; no explicit moralizing. Final image of “space where an apology waits” offers quiet resonance. Yet theme is more asserted by symbol than reweighted by action; ambiguity is present but not sharpened by a costly choice.</comment>

<grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical, consistent, and filtered through Aria’s somber perception; sensory diction is precise. Occasional elevated phrasing (“primordial aroma that resonated deeply”) edges toward purple but stays within tolerable bounds. No dialogue to test naturalism; internal monologue is coherent.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is fluid and rhythmic, with strong sensory specificity. A few near-repetitions (“twisted roots…twisted branches”) and stacked modifiers (“fierce and tender”) slightly dilute impact. No scaffolding or filter-verb clusters in peak beats. Overall clarity and momentum remain high.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of gothic medium, mangrove spirits, and unsent letters; avoids stock tropes. The shard-as-channel and moon-healing trait add idiosyncratic texture. Risk is moderate—lyric accumulation over causal plot—but the piece commits to its mood. Not transformative, yet memorable.</comment>
