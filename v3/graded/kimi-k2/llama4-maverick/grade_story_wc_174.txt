<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Amaranth's desire to challenge narrative ethics remains abstract; no concrete beat shows the cost of that desire on her choices. Interiority is more mood than contradiction; the puppet-show experiments are reported, not dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>A single continuous scene in the dome with clear anchors. Causality is loose: the plan reverses structure, yet the reversal itself is deferred offstage; closure is a future promise rather than a tangible before/after reweighting on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dome gains texture through selective sensory cues—“ghostly sentinel,” “meteor hush”—that modulate with Amaranth’s calm. No prop or architectural element constrains a final tactic; the campfire stick returns in satchel only as talisman, not lever.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Stakes are abstract—“audiences will question truth”—never embodied in a live test within the scene. Pressure is static; the only tightening is narrative intent, not on-page cost or narrowing of options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Ethics of storytelling emerges through imagery (surveillance turned sanctuary) rather than lecture. Subtext is modest; the piece avoids overt moralizing, yet the thematic insight never crystallizes into a charged final stance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Lyrical, compressed voice suits the meditative mode; perceptual signature is character-bound. No dialogue, no POV drift; syntax remains stable, though occasional poetic stacks (“once-pulsing heart now still as stone”) risk faint overwriting.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythm varied; occasional scaffold such as “As she... / As the...” repetition cycles lightly without muddling causality. No closure artifacts observed.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>The abandoned surveillance dome repurposed as creative cell is fresh; yet reversions of classic forms stay conceptual, not enacted. Risk is modest; specificity stays within safe margins of literary convention.</comment>
