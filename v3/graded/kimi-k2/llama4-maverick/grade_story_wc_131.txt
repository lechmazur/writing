<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is textured and embodied (“fingers stained with grime and ink”), but the dweller’s contradictory impulses remain muted; the final choice to “become visible” is declared rather than dramatized with visible cost, so the arc feels gently asserted rather than earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise in the final image of the dweller “hidden in plain sight” with a “beacon” heart—but the cost is only implied, not felt on the page; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds, yet the tightening beat is soft.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Library is evoked with selective, sensory detail (“scent of old books and dust,” “sapphire hush”) that filters through the dweller’s priorities; the tape-reel fragment later constrains the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“to become visible”—is signaled early and revisited, but pressure never tightens; the dweller’s agency is observational, and no on-page trade-off or loss sharpens the arc.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of unseen caretaking emerges organically from the dweller’s actions; the final image reweights the premise without moralizing, though the conceptual cost remains gentle rather than piercing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is consistent, lyrical, and perceptually specific (“soft clinking of tools…soothing melody”); syntactic rhythm modulates with emotional beats, and no POV leakage occurs.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean and rhythmic, with only minor scaffold (“the dweller smiled, their heart full”) and no loops touching closure; figurative language is purposeful, though occasional elevated diction edges toward the generic.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>The “kindly methodical crawl-space guardian” trope is refreshed through tactile specificity and the ferromagnetic tape as memory talisman; the synthesis feels inevitable, though the premise itself is familiar.</comment>
