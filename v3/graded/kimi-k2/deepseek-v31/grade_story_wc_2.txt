<comment>Lira’s paradox—the “uncertainly certain” stance—embodies the internal contradiction required; her micro-choice to buy on the third Sunday and her ultimate improvisation under the waterfall dramatize a credible shift. Yet the grandfather line slips in as backstory and the greenhouse vendor glides like stock archetype (“eyes like cracked porcelain”), nudging her from a full 8+.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands in scene: final tick-tock reconfigures Lira’s worldview and carries felt cost—the rigidity she burns to reach it. The causal chain holds admiral → compass → greenhouse → waterfall clock under an Accumulative/Textural lens; coincidence becomes pattern is paid off when the compass warms and spins at the end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Sweat-damp greenhouse and mist-coated rocks supply tactile specificity that constrains movement and tools; the phosphorescent pool and seized brass disc return in the final image to charge meaning. Minor spatial wobble: we never learn exact ceiling height or echo physics, but the micro-setting of her hands and the spire of rock is lucid at the point of decision.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—renouncing certainty in planning—tightens the moment she swaps “detailed itinerary” for “tools to improvise.” Escalation is single-point but sufficient: the still water, then the roar; the frozen hands, then the shuddering tick. Cost—the lost precision, the numb fingers—is visible and forecloses the “perfect solution” forever.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme flowers from particulars: brass compass → broken waterfall clock → spinning needle that now measures timing not time. No abstract moralizing, yet the resonance that time itself becomes relational, not mechanical, is earned on the page. A slight dip: the grandfather proverb nudges toward thematic echo, though the final image largely absorbs it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Distinct, tactile internal voice—“heavy with purpose,” “silent rebuke”—remains consistent. POV modesty respects Lira’s tinkerer’s lexicon; no cinematic omniscience intrudes. Compression is purposeful: “mist coated her skin and the ancient rocks” glides rather than loops.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Rhythm accelerates with the fall of water from “whisper” to “roar”; every sentence carries dual weight (sense + progress). No line-level artifacts—scaffold loops, mixed metaphors, or filter-verb clusters—obscure the closing tick-tock. Only a tiny over-modifying glint—“impossible grandeur”—but forgivable at climax.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fusing broken-clock repair with subterranean waterfalls and a non-clock compass yields a fresh, non-obvious synthesis. The transformation risks ornate but lands inevitable in hindsight because the mechanism of “measuring timing” rethreads every earlier image. A minor dock for “admiral’s lost compass rose” drifting close to fantasy market trope.</comment>
