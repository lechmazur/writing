<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s loneliness and secret-keeping are embodied; her embodied shivers under gravitational pockets and fierce need to grasp the one lost memory reveal a consistent, vulnerable interior. Motivation tightens steadily until the exhumed memory delivers both love and grief—renunciation is credible, earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands via Earned Stasis: Elara’s refusal to hoard all memories crystallizes with palpable relief on “the weight was finally, blessedly, gone.” Lens is Causal, each beat pushing her deeper under gravity’s literal and metaphoric drag until choice forecloses accumulation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The salt cathedral constrains breath, movement, and light; the chamber literally reconfigures the final image when the crystal shell cracks and memories spill. Sensory specifics—bitter coffee sludge, sharp air, gleam—are filtered through Elara’s task, never touristic.</comment>

<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Stakes (recover a single erased love) are singular, personal, and tighten under physical gravity that escalates with descent. Agency is continuous; every choice (drink, read, descend, pick) pays visible cost. No reversal is needed—only deepening—until the last crack of salt delivers the decisive loss and the gift.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme—grief, forgetting, and the ethics of remembrance—remains implicit. The salt tomb quietly debates whether erasure is mercy or amputation; the final refusal to hoard memories reprises the whale as vessel and offers a wordless ethical answer without sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is luminous, salt-sharp, yet intimate. Rhythm accelerates with breathless gravity spikes then softens at closure. Perception stays anchored to Elara’s lantern and aching limbs; diction (salt-crust, sludge, bleed-light) remains character-bound.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops, tight density. Every sentence layers sensory or causative pressure; e.g., “her body grew heavy, her arms like stone” compresses literal and emotional weight without cliché. Final line resolves by image rather than explanation, satisfying propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The whale-memorial-gravity axis reframes loss into a living archive; the memory-geological crossover feels inevitable only now. The conceit (memories crystallized as pressed flowers) risks twee yet earns through consistent rule logic and intimate cost.</comment>
