<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is embodied and consistent; her “infinite patience” is dramatized through deliberate footfalls and the fork’s measured strikes. The final stance—accepting an eternal memory rather than full resurrection—carries visible cost and is foreshadowed by her earlier recognition of “discordant shiver.” No contradictory impulses are shown in-scene, so the 9+ quick test is narrowly missed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the town’s “perfect, eternal memory” is earned by Elara’s rhythmic labor and the archway’s visible firming. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each footstep and fork-strike layers density until the final cadence shift reweights the stake. Cost is legible in the line “not as it was, but as it needed to be.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The cobblestones, archway, and fork function as micro-settings that constrain every choice; the fork’s vibration literally diagnoses the town’s “bones.” Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (“thin morning light,” “discordant shiver”). The final image of the glowing archway recharges earlier stakes, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—preventing Elysium’s erasure—is signaled early and tightened through each fork-strike. The meaningful deepening occurs when the square’s “schism” answers back with shimmering echoes, narrowing options to acceptance of memory rather than full revival. The cost is felt in the final line’s renunciation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the tension between restoration and acceptance; the story refrains from moralizing. The final image reweights the premise: balance is not resurrection but a “perfect, eternal memory.” Subtext operates in the silent ballet of echoes, never explained.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with rhythmic control that mirrors Elara’s tuning (“Tap-step. Hum-step. Pause-step.”). Perceptual signature is consistent—sound and vibration dominate her noticing. No head-hopping; POV modesty is maintained.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. Figurative language is purposeful (“stone dropped into a still pond of quiet”). No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. The final paragraph’s cadence crystallizes the closure image without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The premise—reviving a town through sonic archaeology—is fresh and fully committed to. The tuning fork as diagnostic tool and the town’s response as “echoes of its own soul” transform familiar ghost-town tropes. The synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
