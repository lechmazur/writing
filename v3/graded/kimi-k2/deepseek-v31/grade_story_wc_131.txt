<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is embodied and specific; her tactile navigation of the library and the ghost-memory moment reveal contradictory impulses (duty vs. self-erasure). The final choice—to leave the box openly—earns her “visibility” through prior causality and carries a quiet cost (permanent anonymity). No second character on page, so relationship crucible waived.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara’s act reweights her lifelong invisibility into a charged poise. Causal chain (blackout → conduit search → fragment → hidden cache → public placement) holds under a Causal lens; cost is the irreversible surrender of personal recognition. Orientation anchored by line 3; no drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Library crawl-space and dawn light are filtered through Elara’s practiced touch and urgency; the tape fragment and sealed box function as micro-settings that constrain her final choice. Sensory detail is selective (lemon candy, pipe tobacco) and purposeful, charging the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preservation vs. revelation—tightens once when Elara decides exposure outweighs secrecy. Escalation is causal: each discovery narrows her options until the final act forecloses her anonymity. Cost is legible in the last line’s sparrow chirp breaking the hush.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of visibility-through-service emerges organically from Elara’s actions; no explicit moralizing. The Finch legacy reweights the library’s mythos without didacticism, and the final image of unseen agency resonates beyond the page.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, tactile, and consistent; syntax mirrors Elara’s methodical patience under pressure. No dialogue, so no voice convergence. Free indirect style stays clean; lemon/tobacco scent flash is a sharp perceptual signature.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and propulsive; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language (“sapphire hush,” “faltering heartbeat”) is sparse and purposeful, never clogging high-pressure beats. Sentence variety supports momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: a crawl-space archivist who weaponizes anonymity to restore a founder’s disgrace. The ghost-memory conceit is grounded in obsolete tech and grief, transforming a familiar “hidden truth” plot into a meditation on absolution without recognition.</comment>
