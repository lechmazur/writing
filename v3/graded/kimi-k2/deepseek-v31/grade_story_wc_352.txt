<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Elara’s prism-minded POV stays vivid—data fractured, synesthetic flare—and her internal calculus powers each move (“her stomach lurched…”). Motivation glints early yet intensifies only when inverted gravity re-signals the page’s cipher, not from within prior pressure. Embodied cost is felt in the final surrender to sentinel duty, but internal contradiction and self-deception remain underplayed, preventing the 9+ tier. Micro-choices are present, though the moment of planting the seed in herself reads slightly predetermined rather than tortured by prior flaws.</comment>

<comment>Closure satisfies the Accumulative/Textural lens: the final image crystallizes a reconfiguration—the grotto returns to normal, Elara departs irreversibly changed, seeds activated. Because/therefore linkage is sound except for a mild ellipsis between contact with pods and automatic absorption of the key—motivation feels inferred rather than micro-negotiated. Cost is embodied in the phrase “She would not hide them away… now awake,” fulfilling the felt-price gate. Overall, a clean but slightly compressed shift lands safely within elite band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The grotto’s mist, serpentine paths, stone “teeth,” and inverted ceiling-floor reversal are sharply drawn, filtered through Elara’s scientist-archivist gaze. Gravity inversion is tactile: “pebbles shivered… down became up.” Sensory economy is admirable—no excess tours—while the same setting simultaneously constrains tactical choices after inversion. The grotto’s rule change is both atmosphere and pressure, satisfying the 9+ quick test but capped at 8.9 by the minor genericism of “clinging mist.”</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Central conflict—retrieval before gravity rights itself—is stated early, stakes time-locked. Escalation pivots on environmental constraint rather than layered reversals: each corridor turn under altered orientation narrows Elara’s physical and interpretive space. One meaningful tightening occurs when gravity weakens and seeds relinquish, narrowing to the singular beat: claim or lose. Cost is implicit in lifelong vigilance yet registers as foreboding rather than visceral paid price, holding just shy of 8.8 threshold.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</question>
<comment>Thematic resonance emerges from image progression—doodle, inversion, seeds—rather than exposition. “The world was sleeping…” subtly reframes knowledge as defense instead of hoard; final image of Elara walking while seeds glow inside her mind offers conceptual repricing without sermon. Ambiguity around the nature of the coming “sleep” enriches without obfuscating. Near 8.9 but slightly undercut by the allegorical undertone of “vigilance seeds,” which skirts archetypal trope.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Archival diction (“spectral truths… clandestinely luminous”) remains anchored to a scientific observer’s lens, modulating under pressure from curiosity to solemnity. Sentence rhythm flexes: longer compound sentences for data sifting, then crisp fragments during motion. No dialogue appears, so voice coherence is judged purely through internal narration, which succeeds in perceptual specificity. Final blaze feels inevitable without overt metaphoric overkill. Only restrained by faint shimmer of self-conscious lyric height.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</question>
<comment>Prose clips along with high density—“gravity inverts for an hour… shimmering veil of pressure”—avoid redundancy and scaffold. Only micro-stumble arises in the looped phrase “latent blaze… ignited fully” which revisits the fire motif within two sentences. Otherwise, tight noun-verb pairings propel motion; inversion logistics stay spatially legible. Minor over-elaboration at the edges prevents a cleaner 8.6.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</question>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: archives as prisms, inverted gravity as practical puzzle-mechanism, seeds as consciousness defenses—these elements braid in a way unseen in mainstream short fiction. Gravity inversion catalyzing deciphering reads surprising yet inevitable in hindsight. The concept commits fully; no retreat to generic moral. Small deduction (−0.1) for allegorical sheen that hints at familiar “chosen guardian” arc, but uniqueness is strong.</comment>
