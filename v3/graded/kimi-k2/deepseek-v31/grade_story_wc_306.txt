<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—professional mask vs. nascent conscience—drives the final refusal; the embodied shift from “sincerely insincere smile” to “protected vulnerability” is credible and costly. Client’s flicker of doubt supplies external pressure, but his arc is sketched rather than dramatized, limiting relationship crucible impact. Mirror shard’s fall registers as forfeiture, sealing the earned stasis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elara’s unhooking of the shard crystallizes a stance that forecloses the lucrative path. Causal chain—chimes’ warning → recognition of client’s doubt → refusal—holds cleanly. Cost is visible in the shard left on stone and the unsaid forfeited fee.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lighthouse, wind, and chimes are filtered through Elara’s professional ear; the anxious staccato melody directly triggers her pivot. Final image of the shard against weathered stone reweights the setting as site of moral reckoning. Micro-setting suffices, though broader maritime detail is minimal.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether Elara will sell absolution—tightens when she sees the client’s uncertainty. One decisive tightening: she asks the mirror question instead of delivering the purchased certainty. Cost is the lost contract and the exposed self-doubt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of commodified conscience vs. unmarketable nuance emerges through action and object rather than statement. Final image of the abandoned shard offers non-literal resonance: truth cannot be bought or reflected on demand. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Voice is controlled, slightly cool, matching a professional deceiver; syntax tightens under pressure (“died in her throat”). Distinct perceptual signature in wind-chime language. Dialogue minimal but subtextual; client’s smooth intrusion contrasts effectively.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense without clutter. Occasional elevated diction (“sincerely insincere charm”) is earned by context. No loops or scaffold; final paragraph cadence mirrors the chimes’ softening.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Premise of “conscience for hire” is familiar, but the wind-chime semaphore and hollow mirror shard give it fresh sensory texture. Refusal beat feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risk is moderate; specificity of tools and setting prevents template feel.</comment>
