<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyra’s interior conflict—control vs organic flow—is rooted in her craft and embodied in the flickering star; the contradictory impulses resolve into earned stasis as she abandons containment for guided growth. Micro-choice (tracing the spiral, adjusting emissions) aligns motive with action; the visible cost (hollow flicker to resonant glow) crystallizes on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is Accumulative/Textural: the nautilus spiral reconfigures the story’s method, the star’s hum reweights the premise. Causality chain—spiral guidance leads to pulsed energy without paradox—maintains coherence, one tight turning, no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The Ember Nexus, nautilus-shell-as-tool, and cooling copper coils materially constrain Lyra’s maneuvers and charge the final glow. Spatial anchors are precise (humming orbs, Kael leaning close); sensory palette (cool fossil vs luminous heat) is selective, purposeful, avoids static postcard.</comment>

<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Single dominant stake—crystallize the density of presence—tightens once when Lyra pivots from stasis to flow, paid with tangible energy and heart-rate hum. No external antagonist required; spiral logic supplies coherent pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically from spiral = growth vs perfect frozen moment; resonance is crystallized by the star’s rhythmic beat, not asserted. Subtextual whisper “a moment has a pulse” guides Lyra’s shift without thesis-labeling.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Narrative voice is distinct: scientific lexicon blended with lyrical exactitude (“condensed essence of light and time”). Psychic distance and diction stay within alchemist-POV limits; Kael’s whisper carries natural indirection and personal intimacy.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, dense. No looped scaffold or synonym stacks. Metaphors precise; vehicles align with in-story physics. Only hairline slip: “her mind began to whirl” leans on stock phrasing, but the paragraph redeems itself with kinetic immediacy.</comment>

<grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis—nautilus shell as algorithm for stellar containment—transforms both object and vocation. Spiral logic replaces brute-force stasis, resulting in a non-obvious yet inevitable climax. Risks taken (alchemical science-fantasy, lyrical mode) pay off without obscurity.</comment>
