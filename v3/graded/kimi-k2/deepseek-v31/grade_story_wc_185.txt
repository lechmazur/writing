<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kaelyn’s interiority is vivid—her fingertips “listen,” her will “coaxes”—and her motivation (restore the caves’ quiet) is embodied in every micro-choice. The final kneel and recognition of silence as “shape of aftermath” earns a credible renunciation with felt cost. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, so the 9+ quick test is narrowly missed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the bloom of hush unfurls with visible cost—Kaelyn breathless on her knees, the stone now a “new permanent star.” Accumulative/Textural lens holds; each beat layers density until the cadence shift in the final paragraph reweights the premise. No causality breaks; orientation is anchored by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The harmonic caves shift from “hammered repose” to “settled, profound peace,” constraining tactics (she must work within their wounded silence). The echo chamber stone’s glow and the drip of water are micro-settings that charge the final image. One hairline slip: “somewhere in the distance” is vaguer than the rest.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—restore silence—is signaled early and tightened when Kaelyn redirects the stone’s scream. The cost is legible: her exhaustion and the irreversible transformation of violent energy into stillness. Agency drives every beat; no coincidence resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: silence not as absence but as alchemized aftermath. The bloom of hush reweights prior chaos without moralizing. Final image of the stone as “new permanent star” offers non-literal resonance that reconfigures meaning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is tactile and lyrical—“gently luminous disc,” “velvety and complete”—yet stays within Kaelyn’s perceptual range. Syntax modulates with pressure: longer sentences during coaxing, short fragments at release. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence advances atmosphere or action. No loops, mixed metaphors, or scaffold. One minor filter-verb cluster (“she could hear”) in the penultimate paragraph keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of ice-fractal acoustics, mapkeeper craft, and energy-being aftermath feels inevitable yet fresh. Risky lyric compression pays off in the bloom of hush. No derivative echoes; the premise is transformed through Kaelyn’s specific labor.</comment>
