<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is precise and embodied; the drawer-pull micro-choice crystallizes her shift from guilt to shared responsibility. Kael’s shame is shown through gesture and silence, not labels. The final renunciation lands with visible cost—both leave the token behind—earning the closure under the Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single-scene structure holds; moon-phase constraint is taught early and paid off in the 72-breath window. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the drawer pull placed on the table reweights the past and forecloses self-recrimination. Causality remains intact; no orientation drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Storm-worn parapet and clinging mist are filtered through Elara’s wary perception; the neutral ground’s hostility tightens the exchange window. The drawer pull functions as micro-setting, its brass chill anchoring memory and choice. Environment constrains tactics and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—salvaging Kael and the lesson—is signaled in paragraph two. Pressure tightens once: the moonlit bridge narrows options to seventy-two breaths. Cost is felt when both abandon the token; no coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of shared responsibility emerges from the drawer pull’s journey from cell wall to table; no moralizing statement intrudes. The final image reweights the premise: mechanisms once feared become understood, then released. Ambiguity lingers without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elara; perceptual signature is spare, wind-scoured, wary. Syntax tightens under pressure—“seventy-two breaths”—then widens in the quiet tent. Dialogue is minimal but carries subtext; no register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is selective—“furrowed hush” once, earned. Sentences advance both atmosphere and interior motion. Clean mechanics; no mixed metaphors.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Familiar prisoner-exchange frame is refreshed by the drawer-pull focal object and moon-phase choreography. The synthesis feels inevitable: lock becomes key becomes discard. Specificity of neutral mist and brass artifact grounds the trope in lived detail.</comment>
