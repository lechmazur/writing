<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas’s grief-rooted motive is embodied in every micro-choice; the leaf-blower-as-orchestra is specific and character-revealing. Interior contradiction—violent tenderness—drives each sonic gesture. The final walk toward his wife’s laugh earns the shift from isolation to shared tending with visible cost (voice gone, fuel spent).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each layered drone and shredded lullaby increases density until the silence after the stall reconfigures meaning. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—laughter returning via the same acoustics that carried grief—felt cost is the spent engine and Silas’s emptied voice. Orientation anchored by “mouth of the echo chamber tunnel” within first 50 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The tunnel’s perfect cylinder is not backdrop but instrument; its acoustic law dictates tactics and outcome. Sensory selection narrows to wind, vibration, and the dying engine’s cough, mirroring interior depletion. The pull-cord handle reappears as charged key, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore laughter—signaled in paragraph one. Escalation is textural: each sonic layer intensifies grief’s weight until the silence reframes it. Cost is the spent fuel and Silas’s broken voice; laughter’s return is earned, not coincidental.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from action: grief transmuted through violent sound into something fertile. Subtext lives in the machine’s roar carrying unsaid apologies. Final image of walking “toward a beginning” offers resonant, non-moral answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is tactile, grief-soaked, precise: “ragged, broken thing” for voice, “waterlogged” for laughter. Syntax lengthens and compresses with sonic pressure. No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains Silas’s throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is propulsive and dense: “macerate the stark, sharp-edged memory” does triple duty—image, action, theme. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is sparse under peak pressure. Rhythm accelerates with engine revs and breathes in the hush after stall.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Leaf-blower requiem in abandoned transit tunnel is fresh, never gimmicky. The transformation of power-tool into grief instrument feels inevitable. Specificity of acoustic composting yields a non-obvious catharsis.</comment>
