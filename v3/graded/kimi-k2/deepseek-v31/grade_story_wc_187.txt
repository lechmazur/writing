<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyra’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“her heart a drum against the silence”), but the final self-conjecture arrives more as epiphany than earned contradiction; no prior beat shows her doubting the archive’s purpose, so the renunciation feels slightly unmoored.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Lyra’s realization that identity is the act of looking reweights the premise with felt cost—she accepts unreadability. Accumulative/Textural lens holds; fog-solidification pattern taught early and paid off in the final grey twilight.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stormlit observatory and crystalline pillars are not mere backdrop; their shifting light and final occlusion constrain Lyra’s last act of reading. The pearlescent shell literally seals choice, charging the ending image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—completing the final record while facing erasure—tightens once when fog solidifies. Agency is renunciation rather than reversal; cost is the irreversible loss of audience, legible in the last shadow measurement.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of identity-as-witness emerges organically from Lyra’s final stance; no moralizing, only the resonant image of her own shadow being “exactly enough.” Ambiguity lingers without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with a perceptual signature attuned to light, silence, and geometry. Syntax modulates with emotional pressure; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; occasional poetic layering (“droplet clinging…captured murmur”) risks overwriting yet stays legible. No loops or scaffold; rhythm breathes with scene needs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fog-becoming-solid as literal tomb is a fresh, non-obvious twist on apocalypse; crystalline memory-pillars and shadow-reading feel inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
