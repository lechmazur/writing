<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zephyr’s quiet obsession is embodied in her daily ritual and the final climb; the contradiction between stillness and necessary motion is dramatized, not stated. Interiority is concrete (“her muscles trembling”) and the cost—abandoning her lifelong stillness—is felt on the page. No secondary character on page, so relationship bullets are waived. The earned renunciation of her original goal lands with visible price.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Zephyr’s stance toward movement crystallizes in the final image of “perfect, foundational silence.” Causal chain—lost pulse → birds’ flight → fissure → release—holds without gaps. Cost is legible in her physical effort and the irreversible shift in her philosophy. Lens is Causal; every beat is a because/therefore linkage.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The bone-tower canyon is not backdrop; its acoustic properties and the unstable spire directly constrain tactics and enable the climax. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Zephyr’s skimmer priorities. The arrowhead and the fissure function as micro-setting that charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restoring navigable sound—is signaled early and tightened when the pulse is trapped. Escalation is one coherent arc: discord → recognition → intervention → release. The tightening choice (to move, to pry) narrows her lifelong path of stillness and carries visible cost. No coincidence resolves the conflict; the birds only reveal what Zephyr must act upon.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of connection versus isolation emerges from the concrete crisis of a trapped resonance; no explicit statement. The final silence reweights the premise: stillness is not absence but source. Subtext operates in the birds’ flight and the arrowhead’s dual role as tool and tone. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in the cost of her new understanding.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, lyrical yet precise; perceptual signature is that of a listener (“the canyon’s mood”). Syntax modulates with pressure—longer cadences in reflection, clipped fragments during the levering. No dialogue, so dialogue bullets are waived. POV remains tightly anchored; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; figurative language is purposeful and never muddles causality. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Sentence variety supports momentum; paragraph cuts are purposeful. The final image lands with crystalline clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The sonic-cartography premise is fresh and fully committed to; the bone-canyon and skimmer culture feel inevitable, not contrived. Tropes of “chosen tool” and “journey of understanding” are transformed through acoustic science and embodied listening. The synthesis of birds-as-data and silence-as-source is non-obvious yet earned. Risky stillness-to-motion inversion heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
