<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s quiet desperation is embodied in tactile micro-choices (hand on curved wall, vial trembling) and his interior contradiction—yearning to be heard yet refusing to shout—drives every beat. The final kneel and empty vial crystallize a renunciation that costs him certainty, earning the closure. Minor slip: “boy really” leans label, not earned contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the fleet’s silent turn reweights the premise that intent can outrun voice, and the cost is Elias’s spent vial and lingering doubt. Causal lens holds: every beat (heat break → concoction → release → course change) links by therefore. No orientation debt; lighthouse, time, and POV are anchored by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The cobalt tower, pre-dawn chill, and restless sea are filtered through Elias’s urgent bias; the vial itself becomes micro-setting that constrains the final choice. Sensory selection (moonflower scent, iron gallery) narrows under crisis. One slip: “screaming tenderness” is vivid but slightly self-conscious.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will the fleet heed the silent warning—tightens once when Elias releases the vial; the cost is the irreversible emptying of his only tool. Pressure escalates under causal lens: heat wave ends → tide shifts → rocks loom → intent must travel. No external reversals, but internal stakes rise palpably.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: the quiet potency of care over coercion. The moonflower scent and empty cork reprise with new weight, reframing earlier images. No moralizing; the final image (sun on his face) answers the thematic question by lived experience. Slight risk of sentimentality is averted by the lingering tremor in his hand.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, modulating from hushed awe to breathless release. Syntax mirrors Elias’s pulse: long, winding sentences under tension, then clipped fragments at the turn. No POV leakage; perceptual signature is consistent and specific to a solitary keeper’s heightened senses.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; every line advances stakes or atmosphere. Figurative language is selective (“screaming tenderness” is the only indulgence). No loops, no scaffold, no filter-verb stacks. One near-repeat: “he felt” appears twice in adjacent clauses but does not stall momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The premise—transmitting warnings via distilled intention—feels fresh yet grounded in tactile ritual. Specificity of moonflower scent and cobalt paint transforms a familiar lighthouse tale. The final reconfiguration is inevitable in hindsight yet non-obvious at the outset. Minor deduction for faint echo of “whispers vs. shouts” trope.</comment>
