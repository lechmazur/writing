<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s meticulous nature and artistic lens are embodied in her noticing cracks-as-arrows and translating sound into visual scores; the interior contradiction between order and chaos is dramatized when she chooses the largest door, trading her maps for the library. The cost—loss of her former life—is legible in the final tremor. Yet the “fortress” motivation is asserted more than dramatized before the vault scene, keeping the score just below the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern density (arrows, mist, constellations) tightens until the punch-keyhole fit crystallizes choice. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—she steps into the library, maps foreclosed, new charting ahead; the cost is felt in her trembling certainty. Orientation is anchored within 120 words; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The starlit vault and mist membrane are rendered with sensory economy; the brass punch’s glint off invisible seams turns setting into tool that constrains choice. Mist, cracks, and constellations all recur with shifted meaning, charging the final image. A hairline slip: “cathedral of quiet mystery” edges toward overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—trade certainty for unspoken truths—is signaled early. Escalation is one deepening: city guides → vault reveals doors → library demands lifetime commitment. Cost is visible in the trembling step across the threshold. Agency remains hers; coincidence only complicates.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of cartography versus lived mystery emerges through concrete choices: mapping cracks versus walking them, cataloguing stars versus entering their library. The final image reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext is carried by objects (punch, arrows) and silence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elara’s perceptual signature—patterns, measurements, watercolor metaphors. Syntax modulates with pressure: longer lyrical lines in calm moments, clipped fragments as she squeezes the punch. No POV leakage or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and motion. Minor scaffold: “thick and cool” mist curls is a near-redundant pair; “frantic drum against her ribs” is a mild cliché. No loops obscure closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The route-mapper who maps the unmappable, the phantom punch as key to a library of silence—synthesis feels inevitable yet fresh. Risk in the lyric vault pays off by reconfiguring stakes. No close echoes of famous scenes.</comment>
