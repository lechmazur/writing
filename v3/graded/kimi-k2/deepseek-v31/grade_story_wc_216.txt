<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Interiority is rich and embodied; Leo’s tactile obsession with the shard contradictorily fuses loss and hope. The final recognition beat hinges on his prior actions and shared frailty, achieving Earned Stasis that forecloses the path of solitary time-keeping. No therapy-speak or stock traits mar the emotional texture.</comment>

<comment>Closure manifests as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the shard’s touch creates Charged Poise between two people, re-weighting time from measured absence to felt connection. Causality is textured (Accumulative/Textural lens): accumulation of silent daily thumb-flicks prepares the shard’s groove; the moment she reads, the texture retroactively becomes conduit. Cost is embodied in the shard remaining exchanged, time now unmeasurable yet shared.</comment>

<comment>The emerald silo works as micro-setting: its curved silence becomes a resonant chamber that amplifies the “pregnant quiet.” The shard’s tactile coolness doubles as both prop and atmospheric sensor. Spatial choreography stays coherent; no white-room drift.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—understanding time’s texture—steadily intensifies from daily thumb ritual to public vulnerability at the table. One decisive tightening: the young woman’s recognition re-weights the mission from lone archive to communal sensation. Cost is tacit but felt: Leo renounces sole custody of the shard.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges implicitly: the impossibility of measuring time yields to the possibility of sharing its residue. The ceramic shard becomes non-allegorical totem whose glaze carries collective memory. Final line crystallizes this without moralizing: connectivity itself becomes texture.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</question>
<comment>Voice is restrained yet sensory—“emerald silo,” “dust stall”—anchored in Leo’s percussive interior. Occasional compression (“pregnant quiet”) is consistent and taught early. Dialogue brief, subtextual; the woman’s single paragraph carries different cadences, distinguishing voices appropriately.</comment>

<comment>Prose stays rhythmic without loops; images (“rust-streaked relic,” “smooth and cold”) layered with economic density. No filler beats or purple overgrowth. Final sentence lands clean, no scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</question>
<comment>A fresh synthesis of post-upheaval temporal melancholia and tactile archaeology; the shard-as-hour concept could belong to no other story. Everyday yard-sale frame reframes metaphysics without gimmickry. Risky quietness succeeds.</comment>
