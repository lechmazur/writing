<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas’s interiority is vivid—his “curator of absence” stance and habit of reading gaps are specific and embodied. The borrowed-memory conceit is dramatized through sensory bleed (“second skin”), not summary. Final transfer of the flower to the woman crystallizes his role as witness with visible cost: he relinquishes the quest-object. Minor slip: the woman’s arrival feels slightly convenient, muting the flaw-driven mistake requirement.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the Edelweiss’s meaning is repriced from mystery to navigational beacon, and Silas’s stance shifts from investigator to witness. Causal chain holds—each twilight descent tightens the question until the woman supplies the missing context. Cost is legible in the final image: Silas hands over the flower, closing his investigation. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of nightly vigil → revelation → reweighting is coherent.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Opal dock, tower, and mist are rendered with selective sensory detail that guides choice: the dock’s gleam lures Silas nightly, the tower isolates. The Edelweiss itself functions as micro-setting, constraining interpretation until the woman re-anchors it. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible moves. Environment charges the final image when the dock becomes the stage for transfer.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decode the stranger’s gesture—is signaled early and tightens each twilight. Escalation is accretive: each absence-observation adds interpretive weight until the woman’s arrival forces crystallization. Cost is the forfeiture of the quest-object and the emotional surcharge of shared memory. No reversal, but deepening suffices under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of devotion-as-navigation emerges organically from Edelweiss’s journey and the failing composer’s final act. Subtext operates in gestures: the flower, the nightly vigil, the silent hand-off. Final image reweights prior motifs without moralizing—love persists even through dissolution. Complexity is honored: suicide reframed as pilgrimage, not redemption.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with rhythmic control (“softly persistent reason for being”). Perceptual signature is Silas’s gap-reading lens; no head-hop. Compression taught early (“curator of absence”) and paid off in closure. Dialogue minimal but subtextual: “You found him” carries entire backstory.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is selective (“milky, internal light”). No loops or scaffold. Sentence rhythm modulates with emotional pressure—short clauses under final transfer. One near-mixed metaphor (“white star against the dark wool”) is minor and does not cloud closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise—lighthouse keeper decoding a suicide via alpine flower—feels fresh and inevitable. Borrowed-memory device and opal dock transform familiar grief narrative into something uncanny. Specificity of Edelweiss as navigational beacon is non-obvious yet earned. Risk in lyric compression pays off without clarity loss.</comment>
