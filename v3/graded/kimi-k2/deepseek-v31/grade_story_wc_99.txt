<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Kaelen’s regret is embodied (the “cerulean regret” washing over him) and his interior contradiction—wanting to speak yet shaping trees instead—drives the micro-choice to follow the lace. The final renunciation (silence woven into bonsai) is earned and carries visible cost. Elara’s slow speech is shown once but never tested under pressure, so her role remains observational.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the compass stills, the regret diffuses, and Kaelen’s stance toward his father crystallizes in the bonsai. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—patterned breathing with the lace reweights the emotional stake. Cost is legible in the final image: “a permanent, silent testament.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The islet’s salt air and wet stone anchor early; the compass and lace function as micro-settings that constrain action. The bonsai pot becomes the charged final object. While vivid, the broader geography is sketched rather than tactically used, capping the score just below 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—diffusing regret to find wordless apology—is signaled early and tightened once through the lace-guided ritual. The single meaningful intensification (needle spinning then stilling) narrows options to silent shaping. Cost is felt in the relinquishing of speech.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of wordless forgiveness emerges organically from the ritual; the final image of “the soft hue of peace” in a branch answers the central question without moralizing. Subtext in Elara’s silence and the compass’s stillness deepens resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays close to Kaelen’s sensory filter; diction (“cerulean regret,” “rhythmically placid”) is character-specific. Rhythm modulates with pressure—short clauses during the ritual, longer cadences in reflection. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, vivid, and propulsive; figurative language is selective and purposeful. No loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated diction (“luminous grey of a dawn horizon”) fits the lyrical mode without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The ghost-compass that points to memory rather than north, and the lace-as-manual, synthesize familiar tropes into a fresh emotional engine. The risk of wordless closure pays off; the concept feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
