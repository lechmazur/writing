<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—her sculptor’s eye reframes geology as intention—but the “perpetually learning” trait is asserted more than dramatized until the final carve. The blank slide gift hints at future cost yet lacks immediate contradiction or embodied price. Still, her micro-choices under the arch feel inevitable and character-rooted.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the driftwood buttress knits the seam, storm loses malice, and Elara receives the next blank slide—cost is the unending guardianship. Causal chain holds: slide vision → reimagining → carving → repair. One clean transition from van to arch; orientation anchored by 120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Storm-tossed archway is not backdrop but antagonist; its fracture lines literally diagram decay and guide the carving. Driftwood’s “iron-hard” grain and the turbine-hum wind supply tactile constraints that shape the final sculpture. Sensory hierarchy stays sculptor-centric, never tourist-catalog.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“the way is closing”—is signaled early and tightened when Elara realizes the storm is tearing the seam. One decisive escalation: she must carve now or lose both worlds. Cost is visible in the blank slide’s implicit future burden.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of creation as repair emerges organically from action; no moralizing. The driftwood buttress literalizes “scaffolding complexity with simplicity,” and the final blank slide reweights the premise: guardianship is iterative, never finished. Resonance lingers without tidy moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is sculptor-specific: “finding whales in gnarled wood,” “physics of faith.” Rhythm modulates with pressure—longer cadences in reflection, clipped fragments during carving. No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains consistent and charged.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is lean yet textured; every sentence advances image or stakes. No loops or scaffold. Metaphors (“petrified leviathan,” “sea-smoothed glass”) are precise and earned. Final paragraph crystallizes without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Familiar portal-fantasy bones are remade through driftwood craft and lantern-slide historiography. The alliance across centuries feels inevitable yet fresh because the repair method is tactile, not spell-casting. Risky compression at 750 words pays off.</comment>
