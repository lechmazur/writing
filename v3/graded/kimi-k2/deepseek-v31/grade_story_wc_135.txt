<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s exile-driven need to “compile fragments into meaning” is embodied in her tactile handling of the valve and her measured public revelation; the final crystallization of deliberate sabotage is earned by her reactive-visionary trait and costs her the safety of silence. Interiority is specific (“salt-tang…familiar ghost”) and her micro-choice to accuse the old rulers carries visible social risk. The only minor slip is a touch of explanatory phrasing (“she realized…”) that slightly abstracts the moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the crowd’s silent hand-to-valve gesture reweights the memorial and Elara’s exile in one charged image. Causal linkage holds—each staggered disclosure tightens social pressure until the sabotage insight snaps the past into present. Cost is legible in the hush “deeper than the absence of the trumpet’s call.” No orientation drift; the single-scene frame is clean.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The rain-scrubbed harbor of bone-color stone is not backdrop but pressure: the wet quays force careful footing, the memorial’s angles become legible code, the puddles mirror both sky and skepticism. Sensory selection is filtered through Elara’s archivist gaze—she notices inscription angles and salt corrosion before faces. The valve itself functions as micro-setting, constraining the final communal gesture.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth versus civic amnesia—is signaled in paragraph one and escalates through each disclosure beat. The sabotage revelation narrows Elara’s options from “reveal” to “accuse,” with social ostracism the visible price. One meaningful tightening suffices; the crowd’s hush crystallizes the cost without external rescue.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the tension between preservation and suppression; the valve’s silence becomes the city’s guilty heartbeat. No moralizing—truth’s cost is shown in the old woman’s tears and the communal hand-to-brass gesture. The final image reweights the memorial from monument to evidence without a stated lesson.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise—“the harbor was the color of bone”—with perceptual signature rooted in Elara’s archival sensorium. Syntax modulates: longer cadences for reflection, clipped fragments under revelation pressure. No POV leakage; the single POV holds. Dialogue is minimal but natural when it appears.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers sensory, historical, and emotional information. Figurative language is selective (“sky scrubbed clean”) and never muddles causality. No loops or scaffold; rhythm breathes with the beats. Minor elevated diction (“compiled meaning”) is consistent with Elara’s scholarly interior.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The premise—an archivist of maritime absences piecing truth from a single brass valve—feels fresh and inevitable. Familiar tropes (exile returns, buried civic guilt) are transformed through tactile specificity and the reactive-visionary trait. The final communal gesture is a quiet inversion of the expected triumphant trumpet blast.</comment>
