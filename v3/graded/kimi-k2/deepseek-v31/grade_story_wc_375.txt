<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority vivid— “charcoal-stained fingers” and “etched onto the back of his eyelids” embody the mnemonic curse and guilt. Micro-choice: hurling the strongbox— raw frustration manifests flaw that later keys the transformation. However, the shift from servant-artist to self-originating creator occurs largely in summarizing awe rather than a beat of risky choice under pressure; the final kneel is felt, less “paid” in immediate action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Causal lens: discovery of key → estate → cave → torn painting forms a “because/therefore” chain. Closure: tearing the portrait to turn the key is a DC that rewrites the rule-set— no longer “replication” but “creation.” Cost is explicit— the canvas slit literally kills a past self-image, felt as “sorrow that recognizes the conquered night.” One minor ellipsis: the cave’s magical source is introduced late without prior cue, but it is paid off at the instant of light burst.</comment>

<comment>“Forgotten estate on the city’s edge” and “crumbling stairs” orient spatially; crystal walls flare “from sorrowful blue to vibrant gold,” functioning as transformative catalyst. The easel and living crystal wall are objects that constrain the final act— only their surface can receive prismatic energy— meeting the environment-as-constraint test.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: whether Alistair will remain a copyist or pay the price to become an originator. Escalates from mundane commission to irreversible act— tearing the portrait— which forecloses the replication path. Cost material: shredding his own early work severs past income/identity, felt on the page. Agency sustains; no deus ex machina.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme crystallizes without overt thesis: memory as both gift and prison; creation born of the ashes of replicated faces. Final image — charcoal fingers “stained not with charcoal, but with color” — provides nonliteral repricing. Sorrow is preserved as “dawn that knows the night,” avoiding moral tidy-up while affirming the cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Alistair’s perceptual signature is precise and painterly— light “pours from the cave, not into it.” Variation in cadence mirrors emotion: short fragments when rage hurls the box, lengthening into lyrical awe. Compression of reflection is taught early — “ten thousand faces” collapsing into one original dream — maintaining coherence at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</question>
<comment>Sentence rhythm swings from clipped impatience to luminous sweep, mirroring beats. Figurative language is selective— crystals as “living”— and stays apt. Minor loop: “last echo of laughter faded” appears twice for thematic mirror and is allowed by pattern. No mechanical fillers obscure the decisive image.</comment>

<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The mnemonic curse as engine for both imprisonment and eventual genesis is a fresh twist on the tortured-artist trope. Crystal cavern as buried creative Id, activated by violence against his own portrait, feels inevitable yet unexampled. Specificity of detail (“faces he could never forget,” the tarnish on the key) prevents template drift.</comment>
