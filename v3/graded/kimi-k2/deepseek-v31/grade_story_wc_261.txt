<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Aveline’s contradictory impulse—seeking closure yet compelled to reopen wounds—drives every beat, from the ivy’s memory to the bandage choice. Interiority is embodied (phantom limb, throb, shaking) and never diagnostic. The final micro-choice to unwrap the bandage is earned by the tunneling revelation and carries visible cost (pain + knowledge). One slip: the “closure seeker” label is voiced once, not dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the scar is re-read from “book of the wound” to “seal of the knit,” with felt cost (pain sharpened by absence). Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density increases via ivy memory, coffee ring, hourglass, all re-weighted in the final image. Orientation is clear by line 3; no causality break. Minor ellipsis in “tunnel” transition is taught by plant-sense and paid off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The tower room, ivy pot, hourglass, and bandaged arm form a micro-setting that constrains every move; the dawn light charges the final image. Sensory selection is POV-filtered (cold tea ring, meteor hush). Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions. Setting does not reach 9 because it never physically blocks an option—only frames perception.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: learn the true story in her scar. Pressure tightens once: the tunnel reveals the miracle is gone, forcing re-evaluation. Cost is visceral (pain, shaking) and conceptual (absence). Agency is attention that forecloses the old reading. No external antagonist needed; coincidence (displaced miracle) complicates rather than resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges: scars are not narratives of damage but of imperfect healing. Subtext in the ivy’s “tiny, personal miracle” reweights the premise without statement. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers (where is the displaced miracle now?). Final image of unwrapping crystallizes theme through action, not assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct: lyrical compression, sensory precision, plant-whisper migraine. Rhythm modulates with stress (long sentences for anesthesia fade, short bursts for revelation). No head-hopping; POV stays locked. Non-standard grammar (susurrus of root and tendril) is taught early and consistent. Dialogue absent; none required.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet clear; every line advances character, image, or atmosphere. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Figurative language is controlled (meteor hush, phantom limb). Opening and closing lines anchor voice and re-charge motif. One near-repeat—“strange, wounded sapling” / “strange, concentrated hurt”—but the echo serves pattern.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: plant-telepathy as medical memory retrieval, scars as seals, displaced miracle as literal absence. Tropes (tower recovery, hourglass timer) are transformed through embodied stakes. Specificity anchors universals; no derivative echo. Risk in tunneling memory of one’s own surgery pays off with earned dread.</comment>
