<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s wilting trait is embodied early and constrains every public move; the interior contradiction between thirst for truth and bodily fragility drives the descent. The final choice—to drink and grow—earns its cost through prior bodily collapse and the plumber’s confession. Only the plumber’s single line keeps this from 9+, as the relationship pressure is minimal.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the dried oasis is redefined as a drought of honesty, and Elara’s growth reconfigures the city’s stakes. Causal chain—map → descent → plumber’s candor → spring—holds without gaps. The zinc fragment’s mandate pays off in the final beat, sealing the lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The greenhouse tiers, toxic sky, and subterranean root-vents are vivid yet selective; the cavern of voices becomes a living setting that charges the final image. Micro-setting (glass studio, warped floorboard) constrains early action. Only the brief plumber scene keeps it from 9+.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—truth as survival—tightens when each lie physically weakens Elara. The plumber’s admission is the single pressure spike that enables the final choice; cost is visible in her prior collapse. No second reversal, but the deepening suffices for this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the spring’s literalized metaphor: words are water, lies are poison. The final image of drinking truth offers a resonant, non-moral answer. No late thesis; ambiguity lingers about what Elara will do next.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with calligrapher’s perceptual signature—“delicate character,” “ochre haze.” Rhythm modulates under stress: short clauses during wilting, longer cadences at the spring. No POV drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence layers sensory, emotional, and world detail. No loops or mixed metaphors. The final paragraph’s cadence shift—“She drank deeply, and for the first time… she grew”—lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The wilting mechanic and the spring of spoken words synthesize into a fresh, inevitable myth. Risky concept held with disciplined specificity; removing any core image breaks the logic.</comment>
