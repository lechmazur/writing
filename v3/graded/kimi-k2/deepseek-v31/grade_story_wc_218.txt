<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—defying death by inviting in death-like stone—is subtly rendered through micro-choices (wrapping copper, feeling stone breathe). The final stance crystallizes with lived cost (orchard remodeled beyond her lifespan), although we lose tactile interiority after the pivotal touch.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative lens held; a single deepening suffices: the orchard’s gradual vibration-response tightens options until Elara stands in an orchard suddenly grown new arches she cannot cross again. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where the stone literally outlives the architect—cost felt through her death announcement one paragraph later.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Copper thread, stone vibration, scent of star-flowers congeal into pressure—these elements actively constrict choice rather than adorn. The orchard itself becomes the final tool: elevated pathways deny her future use, sealing the cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake signalled at word 17 (“six months”). Single tightening: death-clock drives the wire-garden gambit; the cost is her remaining lifespan transmuted into orchard harmony. Agency remains systematic and deliberate—no coincidences resolve anything, only resonance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—respect not conquest—emerges from the mechanics of listening to stone, not didacticism. Final shift reweights death from defeat into perpetual conversation: “understanding is eternal” carries genuine conceptual cost absent sermonizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Reverent, understated lyricism mirrors the protagonist’s “gently systematic” temperament; slight variation in cadence under pressure keeps voice distinct. One small register wobble (“acute urgency”) is offset by tight interior texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The prose is mostly clean and propulsive, but two compressed metaphors in rapid succession—“cold stone in my pocket” followed immediately by “botanical diary...a lifetime’s work”—cause minute collision. Elsewhere, syntactic pacing modulates smoothly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Remodel-through-resonance premise reframes ecological listening into architectural language; the integration of sentient geology with mortal illness feels inevitable, not contrived. Risky quiet ending pays off in conceptual reweighting.</comment>
