<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her shift from “closed tomb” to “gardener of meaning” is earned through the telescope vision. The micro-choice to place the stencil and look is decisive, with visible cost (accepting grief as fertile soil). No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, so the 9+ quick test is narrowly missed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the telescope image reweights her craft and forecloses nihilism. Causal chain—stencil → telescope → indigo curtain → reframed grief—holds under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Cost is legible in the final line’s “ashes of the old.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The domed observatory, brass telescope, and ozone-scented air are specific and atmospheric. The “curtains of intention” function as micro-setting that constrains perception and charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether grief will remain void or become generative—is signaled early and tightened through each origami clue. The telescope beat forces a trade-off: accept pain as material or stay paralyzed. Cost is visible in the phrase “ashes of the old.”</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of alchemizing loss into living art emerges organically from the telescope vision. The final image of “chart a new constellation from the ashes” offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. Subtext in the “genuinely artificial” line reweights the premise elegantly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with controlled rhythm (“cool and still, smelling of ozone and old paper”). Perceptual signature is consistent; no head-hopping. Compression in the origami sequence is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; each sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Figurative language is selective and purposeful (“curtains of intention” is taught and recharged).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The mourning-jewelry craft fused with cosmic interior astronomy feels fresh and inevitable. The “genuinely artificial” paradox transforms a familiar grief arc into something specific and memorable. Risky speculative element is fully integrated without gimmickry.</comment>
