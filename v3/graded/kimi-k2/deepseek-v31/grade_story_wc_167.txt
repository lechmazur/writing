<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elian’s interiority is embodied and specific—“stone and rings in his mind” carries motive and contradiction. The moment his motivation pivots from defeat to urgency is visible in his fingers picking up glass. One micro-choice (soldering not as connection but as “channeling light”) marks the shift and carries visible cost: the window is no longer illustration but instrument—stakes now bind artist and viewer.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the final ray floods the prism atrium, proving the new stance—art now “a lens.” Causal linkage holds: the thrown pebble → rings pattern → glazier self-diagnosis → altered glazing → completed window under pressure of approaching dawn. Cost is felt in the phrase “before everything shifted,” externalizing the port’s arrival as unstoppable consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question>
<grade>8.7</grade><comment>Bay, mist, pier planks, prism lattice are used tactically: the bay provides the mirror for rings, the mist diffuses the closing beam, atrium becomes a physical prism the light must pass through. A single descriptive excess—the tourist-like “slow brightening” phrase—keeps it just shy of 8.8+.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—artist’s crisis of meaning vs. looming industrial change—sharpens in one beat: “window sat accusingly on his bench.” Escalation tightens when dawn deadline (“first true ray... broke the horizon”) forces irrevocable beveling choice. Cost is the very window that cannot now be altered; consequence is social as the new civic symbol will refract future eyes.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges not from thesis but from craft: glass-as-instrument reweights daily labor from “illustrate” to “create rings in consciousness.” Final image—“a lens... thrown into the world”—serves as a conceptual repricing of art itself; no moral is stated, but the reader feels the social cost as the pre-industrial moment vanishes.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>9.0</grade><comment>The glassworker’s perceptual signature—metallurgical verbs (“beveled and sealed”), optics language (“clarity, prism, refraction”)—is maintained through lyric cadence. No dialogue to trip the voice; no head-hop. Final line’s sonic repetition (“before everything shifted”) lands as an intentional knell.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.6</grade><comment>Almost no artifacts; only one near-mismatch in “spectral bands of color,” where bands already implies colors. Sentences vary, compress background, propel without scaffold. No mixed metaphors in closure beat; final “dazzling shower” earns its place via light physics.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.9</question><comment>Takes the familiar trope of “artist with crisis” and transforms it through occupational specificity: glaze angles and refraction angles replace generic angst. The industrial port expansion looming beyond the bay feels new under this crafts-gaze. One fresh inflection: “noctilucent reckonings” arriving not from sky but from water—physics instead of transcendence.</comment>
