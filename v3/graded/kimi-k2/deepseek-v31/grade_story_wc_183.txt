<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—grief vs. the need to keep Idris alive through story—are embodied in her micro-choices (clutching the swatch, reading aloud). The final renunciation of leaving the ship is earned and carries visible cost: she accepts eternal custodianship of memory.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara’s realization that the ship itself is the garden reweights every prior beat. Causal chain—swatch → journal → reinterpretation of ship—holds without contradiction. Cost is palpable in her acceptance of lifelong anchorage.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The fog-shrouded carnival ship is not backdrop; its rusted calliope and flaking paint constrain movement and later become the literal garden. Sensory specificity (salt, popcorn, creaking wood) is filtered through Elara’s biased perception, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—recover Idris—tightens when the journal reframes the quest from retrieval to stewardship. One decisive deepening: the ship is not prison but vessel. Price is paid on-page: she forgoes escape to become keeper of forgotten names.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: memory as active curation versus passive loss. Subtext resides in objects (swatch, carousel horse) that shift meaning without exposition. Final image of reading aloud offers non-literal answer—grief transmuted into guardianship.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct, lyrically compressed, and consistent under pressure (“blissfully aberrant laugh”). Focalization remains tight; perceptual signature colors every detail. Patterned elision (“memories alter”) is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. Figurative language is selective (“fog was a spongy, gray wall”) and never clutters high-pressure beats. Zero loops or scaffold; rhythm modulates with emotional intensity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Familiar motifs (abandoned carnival, lost twin) are transformed through the garden-as-narrative conceit. Specificity of emerald swatch as signature color and the ship as living text feels inevitable. Risky lyric structure pays off in resonant closure.</comment>
