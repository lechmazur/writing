<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s credibly curious trait is dramatized through tactile micro-choices—fusing wire to rope, resisting the brass lever—culminating in a renunciation that costs her the safety of easy alarm. Interiority is embodied (“the silence into her very bones”) rather than labeled. The final hand on the still rope crystallizes earned stasis with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the bell’s lone toll reweights the entire premise, proving listening trumps noise. Causal chain—glue dries → rope vibrates → bell speaks—holds under a Causal lens. Cost is legible in the untouched switch and the storm’s diverted but still-real danger.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The windblown sanctuary, brass dials, and cathedral bell are not backdrop but instruments that constrain tactics; the bell’s bronze voice literally replaces the electric siren. Sensory selection narrows under pressure (“wind fell utterly still”). Final image of the rope and storm turning charges the setting with conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—listen vs. alarm—tightens once when barometric data screams yet silence prevails. Escalation is causal: conflicting readings → glue dries → rope tremor → bell tolls. The price is the un-pulled switch and the moral burden of trusting one’s ear over the crowd’s safety.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: reverence over reflexive fear. The bell’s single note reframes the entire conflict without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture—hand on rope, untouched lever—and in the storm’s unheard turn, offering a resonant, non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with rhythmic control that breathes with tension (“a tremor that travelled up the rope”). Perceptual signature is Elara’s: atmospheric whispers, brass needles, bronze truth. No head-hopping; compression is taught early and paid off in the final toll.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is clean, vivid, propulsive. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances stakes or atmosphere. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful (“fragile as a snowflake”). Final paragraph’s cadence mirrors the bell’s single, perfect note.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The storm-siren-tester who refuses to sound the siren is a fresh inversion; the bell-as-barometer is an organic, non-obvious synthesis. Risk lies in quiet climax, yet it heightens coherence. Specificity of conductive paste and solstice hush anchors universals.</comment>
