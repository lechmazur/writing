<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is embodied and specific—“fingers resting on the cold, engraved metal,” “heart hammered against her ribs”—and her motivation to “articulate unspoken needs” is dramatized through the choice to sing the ghost free. The final renunciation (she remains “seldom-heard”) carries felt cost, earned by prior causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the ghost becomes the song, reconfiguring Elara’s stance from listener to singer. Causal chain (glyphs → bolt plate → song) holds; cost is legible in the fading graffiti and her return to “driftingly alert.” Orientation is anchored early; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The misty courtyard, storm, and spectral leaves are vivid and selective; the bolt plate constrains the final choice, charging the closure. Spatial choreography is coherent; weather tightens the lightning-thunder clock. Micro-setting (plate, console) functions as setting and tool.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—free the ghost—tightens once when the bolt plate proves to be the key. Escalation is causal: each beat narrows options until the lightning-thunder window. Cost is visible in the spent graffiti and Elara’s resumed solitude. No coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the act of giving voice to silence; no explicit moralizing. The final image of the ghost as song reweights the premise with conceptual cost. Subtext lives in the graffiti’s “desperate language of symbols” and the lullaby’s unspoken pain.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is distinct—“tinkersong wonder,” “bruise with an approaching storm”—and remains consistent under pressure. Compression and lyric elision are taught early and paid off. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is Elara’s throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet clear; rhythm modulates with the storm’s surge. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Sensory detail is integrated into action—“air crackled,” “drip of water from the ledges.” Final line crystallizes without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Premise—data-ghost translated through graffiti and song—is fresh and fully committed. The bolt plate’s heirloom status and spiral engraving feel inevitable, not contrived. Risky lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
