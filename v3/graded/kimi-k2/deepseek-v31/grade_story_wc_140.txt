<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Protagonist's drive (“not to reclaim but discover texture of memory”) is consistent; interiority vivid without clichés. Final resolve—to bear witness without a name—earned by prior choices and carries felt cost: “keeper of the silence” in last paragraph crystallizes renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure achieved via steady-texture escalation: container label reweights the whole mosaic from anecdotal absences to systemic erasure. Final beat—“keeper of the silence”—is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) under accumulative lens; cost palpable as he accepts permanent erasure. Orientation clean at the top.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Setting breathes: “narrow, rust-canaled paths” and tidal choreography ground every move. Containers and salt haze constrain navigation and timing; the label object becomes micro-setting charging the ending. Exquisite port-specific idiom (“freighter”, “bills of lading”) is organic, never brochure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—archiving vanishings—tightens when the label converts random absences into deliberate erasure pattern. Tide-low moment at bedrock makes time an active antagonist; choice to carry the label into shipping office is a confrontation that costs anonymity and confirms the invisible war. Cost tracked on page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from accumulation rather than assertion: systematic disappearance of individuals as hidden tariff on commerce. Final image indicts consumer flow without ever stating it—“proof they had been here.” Ambiguity earned, resonance sharp; no late moralizing break.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</question>
<comment>Voice is spectral yet concrete: “hollow spaces where histories had been scraped away” teaches the perceptual filter. Syntax shifts with tidal ebb and flow. Dialogue scant but purposeful: crane operator’s “Probably jumped” lands like gull cry. POV remains single, no head-hop.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</question>
<comment>Precision without ornament: “salt-haze glowed orange … seal oddly pristine” packs sight, mood, hint of menace. No loops or scaffold; each sentence adds density. Metaphor disciplined; rhythm undulates akin to tides. Typos/absent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</question>
<comment>Containerized port as memory catacomb and erased clerk as ghost archivist synthesizes familiar noir and shipping jargon into singular vision. Transformation evident: the empty bunk and peeled poison label would fail in any other setting; specificity is destiny. Credible risk pays off.</question>
