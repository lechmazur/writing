<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—her grief is embodied in the “sharp stone in her gut” and the “mantle of leaden stars.” The contradiction between her gift to heal others and her inability to heal herself is dramatized in the present choice to write the star-story. The final act of writing is earned by the dream revelation and carries visible cost: she must shoulder the burden she has decoded.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the dream reconfigures the inscription puzzle from static map to living clock, and Elara’s decision to write the narrative reweights the stakes from private despair to communal vigil. The causal chain—telegram clue → failed attempts → lucid dream → telescope verification → writing—holds without gaps. Cost is legible in the closing image of “shared burdens” and the quiet solstice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The observatory’s “silent brass telescopes” and “cold, thin air” are filtered through Elara’s professional priorities; the telegram and daylily petals function as micro-setting objects that constrain her next move. The temple dream-space is spatially coherent and mirrors the sky-clock logic. Sensory selection narrows under crisis: ozone, old paper, and the softening darkness outside the dome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—decode the inscriptions to honor her mentor and avert panic—is signaled early. Pressure tightens when the dream reveals the living syntax of variable stars, forcing Elara to shift from academic decoding to communal storytelling. The cost is the emotional weight of broadcasting a ten-thousand-year dimming; agency remains hers throughout.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of shared vigil emerges organically from the temple’s warning and Elara’s final act of narrative healing. The star’s decay becomes a metaphor for collective endurance rather than apocalypse. Subtext operates in the telegram’s cryptic line and the daylily’s fragile persistence. The ending offers a resonant, non-moralizing image of “shared burdens” crystallized in her quiet solstice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with a perceptual signature tuned to astronomical detail—“star-flecked night,” “luminary decay.” Syntax modulates with emotional intensity; dream dialogue is wind-like and indirect. No head-hopping; POV remains tightly anchored to Elara. The prose’s texture mirrors her dual role as scientist and healer.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense: “The temple columns are not a map of the sky, but a clock synchronized to it.” No loops or scaffold; figurative language is selective and purposeful. Sentence variety supports momentum; paragraph cuts are tight. Minor elevated diction (“luminary decay”) is justified by Elara’s scholarly lens.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of lucid dreaming, variable-star syntax, and communal warning feels fresh and inevitable. The temple-as-observatory twist reweights familiar tropes of ancient prophecy. Specificity—daylily petals, telegram paper, ozone scent—anchors the concept. Risk in blending hard astronomy with dream logic pays off without obscuring clarity.</comment>
