<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is precise—his method of “projecting presence” is dramatized through sensory detail and micro-choice. The Countess’s grief is embodied in her posture and milky gaze; her revelation about the carpet thread crystallizes a shared value. The final smile is earned, showing a credible shift from isolation to acknowledged place. No contradictory impulses are staged in scene, so the 9+ quick test is narrowly missed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the Countess’s stance toward her own absence shifts from sealed grief to grateful recognition, cost paid in the rain-spotted stone and the blank page Elias now fills. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each sensory layer (crisp leaves, mineral rain, carpet thread) deepens the emotional map until the final image reweights the premise. Orientation is anchored within 120 words; no causality breaks. One tightening suffices.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The garden’s autumn decay is not backdrop; its skeletal birch and skittering leaves mirror the Countess’s emotional bareness and physically host the carpet-thread revelation. Weather (first cold raindrops) forces the interview’s end and marks the cost. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions. The carpet itself functions as micro-setting that constrains the Countess’s memory and Elias’s task.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Elias must earn the Countess’s truth to complete his living obituary—tightens once when the carpet anecdote is offered. Agency is shared: her disclosure and his receptive silence foreclose further isolation. Cost is felt in the rain’s interruption and the blank page awaiting words. No external reversals are needed; the deepening of mutual recognition suffices under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: every life is a single thread whose loss unravels the whole tapestry. The carpet anecdote reweights this idea at closure without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture—the leaf landing between them, the faint smile. The final image (notebook open to rain) offers a non-literal answer: healing is the act of witnessing before severance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is restrained, elegiac, and consistent; perceptual signature filters every detail through Elias’s vocation of noticing. Syntax modulates with emotional pressure—long lyrical sentences contract into the spare “He simply waited.” No head-hopping; POV remains locked. Dialogue is minimal yet subtext-rich: “You are good at your lonely craft” carries both praise and self-accusation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet limpid; each sentence layers image and emotion without clutter. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Figurative language is selective—“gravel drive that crunched like old bones”—and never overwhelms. Rhythm breathes with the scene: longer descriptive passages yield to the quiet final cadence. Clean mechanics throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The premise—obituaries for the living—is fresh and fully inhabited. The carpet-thread metaphor transforms a familiar grief narrative into a meditation on indispensability. Specificity of the fading palace carpet and the northern light anchors universals. Risk is taken in the quiet, anti-dramatic closure, yet it lands with undeniable emotional cost.</comment>
