<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—her “spiralingly calm” trait is embodied in micro-choices like opening shutters with “infinite patience.” Motivation (teach darkness the value of stars) is dramatized when she shifts from reflecting sunlight to weaving starlight, showing cost in the faint dying light. The flaw of silent isolation is accepted rather than cured, creating Earned Stasis. Minor: her empathy remains more asserted than contradicted on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: nightly ritual accumulates until pattern break when darkness swells. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration—darkness “embraced the woven stars,” reconfiguring the canal’s luminosity with felt cost (Elara’s lifelong vigil now doubled). Orientation is immediate; causality holds under lyric compression. One transition (sunset → starlight) is seamless.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>“Cobalt dock after rain” is not backdrop but resource: puddles catch sky shards, shutters filter light, canal surface becomes canvas. The dental mirror and boathouse slats physically constrain how light can be angled, shaping tactics. Weather’s wet stone scent and mirror’s worn handle are tactile. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from dock to water.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: keep formless sorrow from feeding on fear. Escalation is a single decisive intensification—darkness swells, light patterns unravel. Agency: Elara renounces easy reflection for empathic projection, paying with the risk of total darkness. Cost is visible in the “profound quiet” and doubled nightly labor.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through action: compassion for the void rather than conquest. The mirrored sky below becomes a non-literal answer—darkness learns to value stars by being gifted them. Subtext lives in silence and watery reflections. Final image reweights premise without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise: “shattered piece of the sky,” “shutter-harp.” Perceptual signature is Elara’s synesthetic attention to light and texture. Syntax spirals in long cadences that match her calm, then tightens during the crisis. No head-hopping; POV remains intimate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid: “luminous tapestry upon the canal’s darkening surface” does triple duty (image, stakes, theme). No loops or scaffold. Metaphors are coherent—mirror as loom, stars as jewels. Rhythm modulates with pressure; final paragraph slows to crystalline stillness.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: canal guardian armed only with a dental mirror and empathy. Darkness as sentient sorrow is not battled but befriended. Risky choice to withhold dialogue and rely on lyric pattern pays off in resonant closure. Premise feels inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
