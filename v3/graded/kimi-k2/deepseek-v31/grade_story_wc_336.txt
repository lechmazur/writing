<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—“calloused feet,” “artist’s hands”—but the final beat of self-sacrifice is slightly abstract; the cost is felt more as lyric assertion than bodily consequence. Motivation is clear and intensifies, yet the contradiction between preserving color and draining herself of it could be sharper in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer adds density until the final image reweights the premise. Closure lands as Charged Poise—the seed hums, world flashes—visible cost is the grayness she accepts within herself. Orientation is immediate; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The parapet, mist, and orchard are filtered through Elara’s pruning gaze; the moss-slick stones literally ground her stance. Environment constrains the ritual space and supplies the “green, gold, silver” palette she harvests. Micro-setting doubles as tool.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve wonder—tightens once: rational grafts fail, so she risks her own essence. Escalation is a single deepening under Accumulative lens; the cost is her draining vitality, legible in “effort was immense…weakened.” No false reversals.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges from action: creativity as both gift and wound. The final image—seed warm with stolen color—reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext lives in the silence between waterfall roar and her fading breath.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise; perceptual signature—“roar was not a noise…a great white sound”—is sustained. Syntax modulates with fatigue, tightening at climax. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; figurative language clusters only in the ritual beat where pattern is taught. No loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated diction (“succor”) is earned by mythic register.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: orchard pruner as color-weaving shaman. The heirloom seed trope is transformed into a vessel for conceptual cost. Risky lyric compression pays off in final image.</comment>
