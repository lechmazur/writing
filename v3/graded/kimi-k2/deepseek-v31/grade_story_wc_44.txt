<question>1</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Elara’s quiet, deliberate compulsion is embodied in her careful handling of relics and persistent questioning; the interior tension between scholarly curiosity and personal grief quietly intensifies. One pivotal micro-choice—inserting the key—earns the decisive first contact with the automaton and forecloses her former purely academic stance.</comment>

<question>2</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Causality is tight: the spoons’ bend creates a causal chain—shadows invert at noon, key awakens automaton, fragments must be re-interpreted. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the world self-corrects in a flash, not explained by a place or fight, but by a process made legible in the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The nocturnal observatory isn’t scenery; its low sun and dim star-charts physically determine the shadow puzzle and the automaton’s calibration. Micro-setting details—thin cold air, star-globe with hidden key—become tools that pressure how Elara works and what she can retrieve.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—where shadows invert—intensifies as Elara pieces fragments under a diminishing clock toward noon. A single decisive tightening occurs when her reconstructed loop forces the automaton’s final projection, re-weighting prior stakes from “find a place” to “understand the mending process.”</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The theme of self-repairing reality emerges from concrete rune math and spoon angles; the ending’s non-literal answer—shadows are inverted and renewed—offers a charged, quiet reconfiguration without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The perceptual signature is precise-rune-wrought, internal monologue tightened under breath-starved air, and any compression (e.g., “lens, periods, blackout”) pays off in the final flash. No head-hopping; POV sticks to embodied Elara under escalating pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Most sentences advance plot or character; rhythm breathes between careful observation and sudden clockwork dissonance. Only brief filter-verb clusters around “she understood” don’t dull propulsion; no loops obscure causality.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The spoon-bent shadows and clockwork automaton form a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of relic fantasy and quiet cosmology. Risky inversion of classic quest (no location, only process) lands inevitable and earned with clear cost.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Elara’s decisions drive every turn: refusing haste, inserting the key, piecing fragments; her renunciation of pure academia shapes stakes. Deduction for two brief reflective blocks that do not alter present tactics.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>The silver key appears early in prophecy, enables the automaton, and returns in the final beat as the literal trigger of the crystallized projection; specificity prevents swapping for any other key.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The sealed awakening concept actively constrains choices—each edit to the automaton’s memory closes another logical loop; it is not theme-only but a mechanic that re-configures what data is legible.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Her quietly deliberate trait shows in careful key insertion and silent cataloging of aftermath, forcing a slower, more costly reconstruction path when haste might have risked foreknowledge loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Relearning the automaton’s language is not swappable; it is the only means by which the solution “shadows invert” is derived. The action channels the bulk of rising pressure into the ending.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Closing loops is the required arbitration method: each runic closure edits another layer of data; mechanics are taught and matter, but one beat’s mechanics are slightly summary rather than fully dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>The floating observatory’s low sun and star-globe pressure choices by forcing shadow angles necessary for the projection; description beyond visual is succinct yet causally tied to outcome.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>“After spoons bend reality” tightens choices—time stutters, noon draws; yet the clock’s influence is mostly backdrop rather than directly gating tactical moves measured page-by-page.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Budding interest evolves into desperate need as each rune restores possibility; friction between “find where shadows go” and the cost of fractured knowledge is dramatized on the page.</comment>
