<comment>Characterization is precise through "albino tracker with pink-rimmed eyes" and tactile patience, yet Silas’ emotional arc leans toward intellectual epiphany rather than internal contradiction; the serene anger does not visibly fracture under pressure and the micro-choice to pour water is more discovery than sacrifice. The Earned Stasis lands gently, but the felt cost is soft because the anger disappears rather than being paid. Still, specific sensory embodiment and distinct priorities earn high mid-band.</comment>

<comment>Closure unit is a Conceptual Repricing: the veil-revelation that reality is layered ink reconfigures meaning and is charged with the drone's erasure as visible price. Drive lens is hybrid—situational pressure forces stance crystallization and density accumulates. Causality holds; every act—staying behind, diluting, watching—leads inevitably to the unmoved acceptance. No orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Sandstone grooves, spilled ink catching moonlight, wind-carved mesa all work as micro-setting that literally shapes choice: only this porous ground and this lunar angle enable the message to rise. Environment constrains both medium and message, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—"why time slows in crisis"—is signaled early and escalates through intensified ink vision; agency shapes the deepening: protagonist actively dilutes ink to force further revelation. Cost is the drone’s erasure and, more abstractly, the irreversible shift in Silas’s perception, but it is intellectual rather than visceral, keeping the mid-band high.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of perceptual time dilation emerges organically via concrete imagery and the drone’s unmaking; only one moment of near-abstraction—"consciously wild"—is brief enough to avoid preachiness. The ending reweights reality without moralizing, inviting layered re-readings.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Voice is restrained, tactile, desert-attuned: prose mirrors tracking attention and slow pulse. Diction favors specific, elemental nouns (“shard of obsidian,” “ozone scent”), and rhythmic control heightens the quiet epiphany without overwriting.</question>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</question>
<comment>Clean, high-density lines carry scent, texture, and sound without clutter; metaphors are precise and internally consistent—ink as temporal solvent—never mixed. One minor flourish ("phantom dance of light and shadow") is earned. No filter-verb chains or paraphrase loops.</question>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</question>
<comment>The synthesis—ink as collapsing reality layer, drone as sacrificial recorder—feels specific and inevitable in hindsight. The eclipse aftermath setting and tracker POV create fresh footing for a classic wonder-through-mini-science frame. No borrowed tropes or over-familiar sequences.</question>
