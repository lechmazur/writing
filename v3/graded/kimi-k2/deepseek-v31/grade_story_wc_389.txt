<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Cassian’s interiority is vivid—his loneliness, thrill, and final resolve are embodied in trembling hands and gritted oaths. The variant-allegiance conflict is dramatized through the live choice between Aerie and prophet, not summarized. The cost of renouncing the Aerie is felt in the storm’s energy drain and the momentary blackout. Only the Aerie’s voice is off-stage, so relationship crucible is absent, capping the score.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Decisive Change: Cassian amplifies the prophet’s frequency, breaking the storm and his exile. Causal lens holds—every beat is “because/therefore” linked, from first clear transmission to final spectrum burst. Cost is explicit: “everything went dark and silent” before the pure tone. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The cobalt portico is not mere backdrop; it channels lightning into brass mechanisms and finally refracts the new sun, charging the closure image. Micro-setting (console, tubes, pliers) constrains Cassian’s precise, minute adjustments under pressure. Weather evolves from lashing storm to parting clouds, causally linked to his act. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—he hears static others dismiss.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—truth versus control—is signaled early and tightened once: the Aerie’s offer versus the prophet’s path. Cassian’s agency drives the escalation; his choice to amplify the prophet forecloses return to the Aerie. Cost is the storm’s energy drain and the risk of total failure. No coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of choosing understanding over control emerges from Cassian’s embodied struggle, never stated. The cobalt prism’s spectrum reweights the premise: dawn shaped by ancient shadows, not force. Subtext in the prophet’s verse carries the cost of solitude. Final image offers resonant, non-moralizing answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct—lyric, precise, storm-tuned. Syntax tightens under pressure: “He poured every volt…” Perceptual signature filters all detail through Cassian’s radio-listener ear. No head-hopping; POV remains locked. Prophet’s diction is otherworldly yet legible, contrasting with Aerie’s clipped command.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence advances stakes or atmosphere. Figurative language is selective—“lightning strike a momentary sun”—and never muddles causality. No loops or scaffold; rhythm accelerates with storm. Minor elevated diction (“nexus of brass and hope”) is voice-motivated and brief.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: weather-prophet via antique radio, exile atop cloud-piercing peak. Tropes—lonely genius, storm climax—are transformed through tactile radio work and cobalt refraction. Risky amplification of ghost transmission pays off in earned dawn. Specificity anchors universals; story would collapse if relocated.</comment>
