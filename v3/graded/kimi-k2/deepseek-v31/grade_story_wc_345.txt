<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Aelia’s motive—fierce love for the settlers—drives every beat; her nightly drain to animate the bell and the final starlight manifestation embody cost. Interiority is ghost-specific (“shimmer of memory and intention”) yet remains emotionally legible. The shift from silent instructions to full revelation shows earned escalation. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, capping the score below 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the settlers’ stance flips from obedience to partnership under the nebula’s light, cost etched in Aelia’s spent essence. Causal chain—bell → chalk → map → sky—holds without gaps. Orientation is swift; “cool, particulate silence” anchors place and state by line 3. One meaningful tightening suffices for this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Floating rose-quartz arches and blight-grey leaves are vivid, selective, and mirrored in the nebula’s violet-gold wash. The orchard planet constrains tactics: chalk paths, pruning sites, and the final overlook are all terrain-bound. Sensory hierarchy favors sight and hush, fitting a ghost POV. Micro-setting (the bell’s dew-cup) doubles as tool and talisman.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—save the groves—signaled in paragraph 2; pressure tightens when instructions fail and faith frays. The map and skywatch constitute one decisive escalation that reframes effort as partnership. Cost is visible in Aelia’s exhaustion and the settlers’ prior despair. Agency remains collective, but Aelia’s orchestration drives the turn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of symbiosis emerges from concrete acts: pruning, moss-gathering, singing, then sky-gazing. No moralizing; the nebula’s appearance reweights earlier labor without dictating meaning. Subtext lives in the bell’s “peculiar resonance of honesty” and the chalk’s cryptic brevity. Final image crystallizes theme through luminous silence rather than statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lyrid, hushed cadence matches ghostly focalization; diction (“particulate silence,” “brambled hope”) is distinctive yet transparent. No dialogue, so voice coherence rests on consistent perceptual filter. Compression is purposeful; elisions (how chalk is hidden, how nebula was unseen) are taught by pattern and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and dense: “willed into being: a butterfly garden watering bell” packs origin, object, and aura in six words. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is spare and apt. Occasional elevated phrasing (“celestial canvas”) fits the climactic register. Final line lands with crystalline clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Altruistic ghost stewarding settlers via dew-powered bell and sidewalk chalk feels fresh; tropes are inverted into quiet collaboration rather than haunting. The nebula-as-healer twist is seeded early by “planet’s innate connection,” making the reveal inevitable yet surprising. Specificity of orchard rituals and floating geology anchors the concept. Risky lyric mode pays off.</comment>
