<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her shift from passive witness to active healer is earned through the rupture’s pressure and the swan’s instruction. The cost—her renunciation of pure neutrality—is legible in the final fold. Minor: “crumbling peace” is repeated without fresh embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: she chooses to filter rather than block, accepting perpetual guardianship. Causal chain (hum → descent → swan map → filter) holds; cost is the fragile peace she must now maintain. One micro-turn suffices.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Library-catacombs and obsidian refuge are tactile, atmospheric, and constrain movement; the river’s silence literally becomes the healing agent. Micro-setting (origami swan) charges the final image. No orientation drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve regenerative silence—is signaled early and tightened by the hum’s intrusion. Escalation is one deepening: the breach forces her from witness to healer. Cost is the loss of absolute neutrality.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of observation vs. intervention emerges organically; the swan’s re-fold embodies the shift without moralizing. Final image reweights the premise: silence now demands active stewardship. Subtext in “she had judged an action necessary” lands cleanly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with perceptual signature rooted in archival stillness. Syntax modulates under pressure: longer cadences collapse into short, urgent clauses during the healing beat. No POV leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is selective and purposeful. No loops or scaffold. Minor register drift in “conceptual ecosystem” but does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: origami as geomantic map, silence as active force. Premise feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric compression pays off in the final fold.</comment>
