<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyra’s shift from passive survival to active justice is embodied in micro-choices—scratching the frost, climbing the rim—each with tactile cost. Interiority stays concrete: “her artist’s muscles relearning the grammar of ascent.” The final resolve is earned because the ledger and message rewire her hierarchy of values on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: frost reveals ledger → ledger points to relay → relay yields message → message compels broadcast. Closure is a decisive change—she will “fashion a lens” and “amplify a signal”—with the cost of abandoning her hard-won quiet. No orientation drift; anchors are clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The canyon’s “immense, ancient silence” is not backdrop but acoustic tool she will use to “amplify a signal.” Frost patterns and relay compartment are micro-settings that constrain discovery and later tactics. Sensory detail is selective—charcoal dust, brittle morning—filtered through her glass-artist eye.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—uncover why she was targeted—tightens when the message reveals ecological stakes far larger than personal revenge. One clear escalation: from quiet endurance to public revelation, with the climb and the relay acting as physical price. Agency drives every turn; coincidence only reveals, never rescues.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of “revelation through ruin” emerges from the fused ledger and the unsent plea, not from authorial commentary. Final image—artist becoming “architect of justice”—reweights the scorched testament from private scar to public beacon. Subtext in the silence that will soon carry her signal.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is glass-artist precise: “coaxed light from silica,” “grammar of ascent.” Compression is purposeful; no filler. POV stays tight; no head-hop. Rhythm modulates with exertion—short clauses during the climb, longer cadence in reflection—without losing clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, vivid, propulsive. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances. Figurative language is sparse and apt—“drifting resonance solidified into a singular, clear note.” No mixed metaphors or register drift. Final line lands with crystalline snap.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Familiar revenge-to-reckoning arc is retooled through glass-artist optics and ecological stakes. The frost-inked ledger is a fresh forensic device; the canyon silence repurposed as broadcast medium. Specificity of craft and toxin detail makes the premise non-generic. Risky compression pays off.</comment>
