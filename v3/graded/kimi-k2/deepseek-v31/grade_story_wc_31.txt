<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Silas’s obsession with “the color of sound” is vivid and embodied; the glass-bell memory anchors motive. His dive sequence shows micro-choices under pressure (securing lantern, wading, three dives) that escalate risk. The final realization reweights his lifelong quest with felt cost—he abandons the search for a perfect note and accepts a luminous substitute. Interiority stays concrete, though a touch more contradiction mid-dive could sharpen the 8+ band.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the vow’s line reframes the premise—love is light, not sound—reweighting Silas’s quest. Causal chain holds: bell memory → nightly listening → meteor hush → green-gold lure → key → vow → color of love. One clean transition (surface–dive–surface–dive) fits 600–800 word scope. No orientation drift; anchors clear by line 3. Cost is legible: he surfaces changed, the old obsession foreclosed.</comment>

<comment>Setting is selective and sensory: salt-cold water, silt-clouded porthole, algae-lit spines. The sunken library constrains action—door forced ajar, sealed drawer—directly enabling the key’s use. Sky-lantern release doubles light on black water, charging the final image. Micro-setting (brass key tag) becomes compass and closure object. No white-room syndrome; spatial choreography tracks cleanly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—discover the color of sound—tightens when the green-gold glow reframes it as love’s light. One meaningful deepening: the vow reweights the quest from auditory to luminous. Agency is active: three dives, drawer opened, realization claimed. Cost is visible—he leaves the pier changed, old obsession paid off. Coincidence (key fits drawer) complicates, does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: the inadequacy of sound to hold love, the sufficiency of light. Subtext in the vow’s final line reconfigures meaning without moralizing. Recurrent image—green-gold glow—shifts from lure to answer. No thematic drift; complexity preserved. Resonant, non-literal closure satisfies 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise; perceptual signature (“small, swaying suns,” “meteor hush”) is consistent. Syntax modulates with pressure—short clauses during dives, longer cadences on surfacing. No POV leakage or register drift. Dialogue absent; internal monologue stays character-bound. Final paragraph crystallizes tone without overwriting.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; each sentence advances image or choice. Figurative language is purposeful (“cathedral of water and knowledge”) and paid off. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Minor filter-verb cluster mid-dive (“he dipped… he pushed…”) slightly dulls immediacy, but clarity intact. Rhythm breathes with scene needs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise—color of sound discovered as bioluminescent vow—feels fresh yet inevitable. Synthesis of sunken library, meteor hush, and lantern release is non-obvious and fully committed. No derivative echoes. Risk in lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Specificity of brass tag and algae glow anchors universals.</comment>
