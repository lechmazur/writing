<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is textured and specific; contradictory impulses (“quiet observer” vs “urgent activist”) clash in real time and drive the final, irreversible choice. The quiet solitude/integrity arc earns an Earned Stasis that lands with vivid cost—loss of personal peace for wider truth. Minor slips in emotional symmetry but no template blandness.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal chain (shadowing → pigeon → encrypted data send-off) is tight, legible, and propulsive; each move narrows options until release of the bird locks the new reality. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration with poetic but concrete cost carved on the page. Single-scene scope handled cleanly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The courtyard’s dusk micro-setting pressures choices: high wall shapes secrecy, pigeon return route. Occasional lapse into postcard filler, yet the gravel, leg of the bird, and hushed sky carry tactile specificity that recurs at the end. Not indispensable, but purposefully constrained.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“quarantine lie”—escalates steadily: pigeon’s revelation tightens options, Elara’s data transmission reweights consequences. No multiple reversals, but the single pivot feels earned and costly under the inferred causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Thematic through-line—integrity vs complicity in solitude—emerges through choices and images without moralizing. The final truth flight offers a non-literal, resonant answer that deepens what before felt like private precision.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Distinct POV lens of meteorologist skepticism in lyric cadence. No dialogue on page, so lesser comparison; internal voice is restrained and tense without template descriptors.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Strong rhythmic variation, high information density, zero loops or scaffold. Two minor ornamental flourishes (“geometric space of raked gravel…”) but never blur urgency.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Classic “meteorologist exposes mining cover-up” premise rendered fresh through seamless lateral deduction and quiet moral rebellion. Specific paranoia about pressure sensors feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
