<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara’s obsession to quantify feeling is vividly embodied; every micro-choice tracks to her flaw. The borrowed-personality habit is dramatized twice: grafting archivist despair and, in the final strobe, the realization that all grafts leave only hollowness. The cost is undeniable: she weeps at the zero-sum of her borrowed selfhood. Internal contradiction stays in scene rather than summary.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Chosen lens: Accumulative/Textural. Rising data-density in transposed experiences tightens until she finally turns the fragment inward. Closure is Earned Stasis: her path to external measurement is foreclosed—her loneliness will never be solved—displayed in the final image of the topaz-lit halo sliding away as she weeps, a felt, irreducible cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>The topaz-lit antique press, ink odor, marble scent of the archive, and star-gap sky are specific and sensory. Late reprise of “vanishing stars” recharges the closure image. The halo fragment serves as micro-setting anchor that constrains her tactile arc. Spatial positions and temporal cues remain coherent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: the cost of understanding emotion mathematically. Escalation is density increase—each empathy swap drains agency further. Final turn costs belief that data can resolve her solitude; renunciation lands on page with physical fragment drop and tears. Stake remains visceral and narrow throughout.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Theme of quantifying versus inhabiting emotion emerges from plot rather than dictum. No final paragraph moralizing; closing fragment halo reweights premise without statement. Complexity—the beauty yet uselessness of “perfect mathematics”—endures in felt image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice is distinct, sensory-anchored, and remains with POV without head-hop. Syntax and diction mirror Elara’s precision-crafter mindset. Repetition of oil-blackened/humming/cold-crescent refrains teaches pattern early and pays off in echo. No register dissonance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Vivid, dense compression: “a neat column of grief tallied like a debt” performs double duty (metaphor plus ledger motif). Rhythm accelerates under halo pressure then softens into image closure. Zero loops or scaffold detected. Occasional elevated word choices stay anchored in Elara’s technic lexicon.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Transposing empathy into literal swap device avoids trope clichés via precise mechanics and visceral cost. Premise feels original against star-vanishing cosmology backdrop. Emotional specificity to Elara’s lonely quantification makes premise impossible to transpose to another name without loss. No echo of famous lines.</question>
