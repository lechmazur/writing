<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s curiosity is rooted and believable, her tactile engagement with objects reveals agency and interiority, and her final renunciation—restoring the locket to the chest—bears visible weight. Yet the absence of second-person pressure or relationship crucible prevents exploitation of deeper contradictions; the interior tension is single-thread rather than braided, stopping just short of exceptional complexity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens—progressive density of pattern and object—holds cleanly from opening chess tick to locket click, narrowing the stake into crystallized Charged Poise (“closing the locket, the metal cool against her palm”). Cost is legible and coherent in time and causality without drift or reversal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Set anchors early and specific: velveteen gloom, cobalt silo, starlight beam, all tactile. The chest and tapestry directly constrain choices (decoding border threads, handling case). Minor slip: the silo functions more as evocative chamber than active spatial obstacle during the untangle beat, so misses the higher band gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“shape of intentions”—begins quiet, intensifies through tactile deciphering of object-history, narrows to single irrevocable choice: keep or return king-laden locket. Progression is incremental, not escalatory; the cost is conceptually felt but slightly abstract, keeping it shy of 8.0+ clarity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Theme is unstated: memory as both inheritance and burden, love as strategic sacrifice. The tapestry-image and chess king crystallize the question without sermonizing. Resonant reconfiguration is earned, but the conceptual cost feels oblique rather than sharp—sufficient for high band, just beneath the apex.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Voice maintains hushed lyric tension, tactile and selective; every perceptual detail is filtered through Elara’s gardener eye (“dust motes dancing in a single, slender beam”). No drift in diction or register; rhythm breathes with scene pressure. Looming danger: a few soft abstract echoes drift into cliché (“metallic taste of anticipation”), preventing the 9.0+ gate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Syntax is disciplined and varied; sentences layer information cleanly, no redundant scaffolding. Metaphor is precise and unobtrusive. Minor density surplus in adjectival stacking on mood descriptors (“soft velvety gloom, chilled air”), mildly diluting propulsion—caps at 8.5, no further deduction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</question>
<comment>Chess-time metaphor married to graveyard keeper’s grief gambit feels organic, non-clichéd. The stitched tapestry cipher is fresh; the silo’s cobalt echo repurposed into memory-vessel. Only near-familiar “keeper vs blithe gardener” archetype knocks it from absolute ceiling.</comment>
