<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Orin’s fixation on preserving fading memory is clear and emotionally embodied, visible each dawn as he sets out with the cart. Internal contradiction—romantic collector vs. reluctant medium—flashes when the box’s empty bell redefines “salvage” from record to resurrection; however, the shift is narrated more than dramatized, lowering full conviction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens consistently: each micro-quest to “trap” sound thickens texture until the jarred lullaby releases a charged silence that reweights the meaning of salvage. Closure lands as Earned Stasis—harmony is restored but cost is visible in the final “harmonized under the rising moon.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sand-scoured shipwreck loft and dawn whistle are sharply etched; the salt air and creaking beams physically dictate quiet movement and frame the final release of the song. Sensory specifics steer choices (stealth in drifts, low lamp over box) and charge the ending image.</comment>

<comment>Single clear stake—prevent the erasure of one grandmother’s song—intensifies when Orin discovers the box does not play, forcing redefinition of what counts as preservation. Cost is legible: months of visits, the fragility of Miss Elara’s voice, the final sealed moment of sound.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme that memory is an act now rather than a record surfaces organically; the shift from mechanical music to human breath embodies it without moralizing. The jarred yet unsung lullaby invites reader reappraisal of what survives time.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Filtered, sensory-laced diction—“salt-thick whisper,” “feral loft,” “faded velvet hollow”—remains in Orin’s idiom throughout. Voice is specific, consistent, and quietly melodic; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Lyric compression occasionally drifts toward ornament (“lonesome splendor,” “pale, thin gruel sky”) but never clouds cause/effect; rhythm mirrors hush of wind and measured footsteps. No mechanical loops or over-stacked metaphors in beats that matter.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>“Sound in jars” device is fresh without gimmickry, and translating a silent box into a human-sung lullaby converts trope of broken heirloom into living inheritance. The risk is modest but fully inhabited; specific coastal minutiae keep it from drifting into generic folkloric.</comment>
