<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Ash’s interiority is embodied (“hollow inheritance,” “turbulent searching”) and his final micro-choice—closing the satchel—forecloses the circular path with visible cost. The old man’s presence supplies relational pressure that alters Ash’s stance. Motivation is consistent and intensifies to the renunciation. Minor: the “polished calm” label is echoed rather than dramatized in Ash.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: Ash seeks → finds markers → hears story → renounces. Closure is Earned Stasis: the clasp’s “sharp and final” sound marks the decisive refusal with felt cost. Orientation is anchored by 120 words. One micro-turn suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The circus train’s decay (“sun-bleached,” “corroded”) constrains movement and supplies the territorial markers that catalyze the final insight. Light and rust mirror internal erosion. Micro-setting (the sleeper car’s rotting wood) is tactile and choice-shaping.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</question><comment>Dominant stake—break the inherited circle—is signaled early and tightened when the old man reveals the partner’s betrayal. The tightening forces Ash’s renunciation with visible cost (abandoning the path). One coherent escalation under causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of circular fate emerges from the father’s story and Ash’s embodied refusal; no explicit moralizing. The worthless money and territorial marks reweight from promise to trap. Final image of leaving the train offers resonant, non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Voice is consistent, lyrical but grounded in Ash’s perceptual bias. Syntax modulates with emotional rise. Dialogue from the old man carries gravelly idiom distinct from Ash’s interior cadence. No head-hop; POV modesty intact.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and rhythmic; selective sensory detail advances atmosphere without clutter. One minor loop: “polished calm” repeated without fresh embodiment. Otherwise clean, vivid, propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Familiar outlaw-legacy frame is refreshed by the circus-train micro-setting and the foreign-currency twist. Specificity of territorial carvings and worthless bills creates fresh inflection. No close echoes; transformation test passes.</comment>
