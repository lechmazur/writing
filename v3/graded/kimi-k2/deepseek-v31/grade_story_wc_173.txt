<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority—“a sharp, cold thing within her”—grounds her motivation to reject a gilded fate; the bodily poetic is shown via deliberate micro-moves that cost her viscerally. Minor abstraction in “terrifying quiet of a blank page” edges diagnostic without eroding felt cost. Earned renunciation lands with a true smile.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>One smooth causal thread: prism arrival → probe → untangle → final tug dissolves enchantment and releases her own alternate self. Closure achieves Charged Poise: she stands in aftermath with cost legible in “faint, undeniable beginning of a true smile.” Orientation tight by 100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Silver courtyard and suspended snowflakes create tactile micro-setting that alters stance: crunchless snow, breath-held hush, prism threads brushing teeth. Final dissolution into ordinary snowfall anchors the after-cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Single dominant stake: break harmonic conformity. Each untangled thread intensifies pressure; Elara’s bodily conduit role is visceral (“shuddered through her own body”). Agency drives reversal; price is felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme of reclaimed silence emerges organically via concrete labor of dismantling a literal lullaby. Final smile provides non-explicit answer; no late sermons. Slight risk of overt resonance label in “alarm of serenity,” but subtext sustains it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lush yet precise lyricism—"luminous threads," "frozen star"—reflects Elara’s practiced poise. Syntax modulates in service: slow unfolding toward final clean wind-sound. No head-hop.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>High density without scaffold, but occasional poetic surplus (“shock, cold and clear”) slightly dilutes impact. Propulsion strong; sentence rhythm breathes with action. Filter verbs minimal.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Synthesis: courtesan-as-revolutionary is fresh, non-trope prism sanctuary doubles memory engine. The idea that each surrendered vocation must literally be unwound is an inventive image system that locks to theme.</comment>
