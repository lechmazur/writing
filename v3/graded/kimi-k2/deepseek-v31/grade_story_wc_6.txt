<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (daughter of arsonist turned firefighter) is embodied in tactile micro-choices—selecting obsidian, threading coin—so motive stays visceral. The final act of “listening to the music she made from the silence he left” crystallizes a renunciation with visible emotional cost. Minor slip: “quiet obsession” edges toward diagnostic label-speak, but the embodied grafting overrides it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the hum of the scar reweights the entire premise under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality holds—every graft beat accumulates to the final sound that reconfigures meaning. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored within 120 words. Cost is legible in the “memory of fire” vibration through her bones.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Obsidian lagoon, black sand, and driftwood shards are not backdrop; they are surgical tools that constrain graft choices and charge the final image. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—volcanic grit under fingernails, kelp-drift hush—mirroring internal state without overt symbolism. One micro-setting slip: “kelp-drift peace” is slightly generic, but the lagoon’s mirror-sky specificity compensates.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“to prove that scars can sing”—is tested through each graft; the final hum is the earned tightening that forecloses the path of mere remembrance. Pressure escalates via accumulative density of materials and memory rather than causal reversals. Cost is felt in the audible fracture/healing resonance. No external antagonist needed; internal pressure suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of unyielding compassion emerges from the act of grafting broken fragments rather than abstract statement. The final hum is a non-literal answer to “can scars sing?”—a conceptual repricing that reweights every prior image. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in whether the song heals or merely acknowledges damage.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is distinct—precise, tactile, slightly lapidary—matching the protagonist’s surgical attention. Syntax modulates with pressure: longer reflective cadences contract into clipped tool-action sentences. No POV drift; perceptual signature remains consistent. Minor elevation in diction (“kelp-drift peace”) but within tolerable lyric range.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence advances image or choice. Figurative language is selective—obsidian “volcanic embrace,” “memory of fire”—and paid off in the final hum. No loops or scaffold. One mixed metaphor risk: “memory of fire” as sound, but the synesthetic effect is earned by prior sensory layering.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise of arsonist’s daughter turned firefighter who sculpts scars into song is fresh, grounded in specific material choices. The grafting ritual transforms a familiar redemption arc into tactile alchemy. Risky lyric compression pays off: the final hum feels inevitable yet non-obvious. No derivative echoes.</comment>
