<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elias’s motivation is clear and consistent; the interiority is modest but embodied in the clenched brass box and purposeful stride. The micro-choice to hand over the locket is credible and alters the relational state. However, Maeve’s interiority is reported rather than dramatized, and the final “friendship kindled” feels slightly tidy given the brief interaction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the locket’s return reweights both characters’ social positions and reconfigures Maeve’s unrecognized labor. The Causal lens holds—Elias’s decision to seek Maeve because of her program notes drives the scene. The cost is felt in Elias’s soft admission of dependence on her work. Minor deduction for Maeve’s quick acceptance, which blunts the emotional price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Setting is anchored early (salt-tinged air, solar lamps) and filters through Elias’s cargo-broker eye. The library’s open windows and starlight subtly guide the choice to linger and talk. The locket functions as micro-setting, constraining the moment of vulnerability. While vivid, the environment does not actively constrain tactics beyond mood.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—Elias’s need to acknowledge Maeve’s labor—is signaled early and tightened when he risks exposing his own gratitude. One clear turn: the locket exchange crystallizes the shift from anonymity to recognition. Cost is present but soft; no tangible loss is dramatized. Coincidence of the misaddressed envelope slightly dilutes agency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of silent contribution emerges organically through Maeve’s unpaid labor and Elias’s belated recognition. Subtext in the locket’s return suggests reciprocity across generations. Final conversation avoids moralizing, letting the image of shared music carry resonance. Slight thematic echo in “kindness is never small” is borderline overt.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is consistent, restrained, and freighted with maritime diction (“salt-tinged,” “cargo broker”). Dialogue between Elias and Maeve carries polite subtext; their lexicons differ subtly. Rhythm modulates from brisk stride to quiet library hush. No POV drift or filter-verb clutter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; each sentence advances image or motive. No loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated diction (“celestial light,” “conceptual repricing”) fits Elias’s reflective turn. One mixed metaphor—“music of their conversation a new symphony”—is minor.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Premise refreshes the familiar “unsung hero” trope by embedding it in maritime brokerage and archival labor. Specificity of program-note writing and misdelivered locket feels fresh. Risk is modest; the arc is linear and recognizable. The transformation test passes—swap the occupations and the emotional engine collapses.</comment>
