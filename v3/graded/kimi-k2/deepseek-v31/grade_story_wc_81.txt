<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Silas’ tranquil perception drives every beat—he hears the blackout settle, infers the stamp code via stillness, and endures solid darkness to earn the truth. Interior contradiction (yearning for order vs. relic honesty) is embodied in micro-choices rather than told. Final renunciation of official history costs him isolation, meeting earned-stasis closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal ladder: blackout failure forces blackout silence → silence sharpens perception → stamp grooves become map → vault discovery unlocks charter → charter rewrites founders’ myth. Closure (charter with matching stamp blot) happens on-page with irrefutable conceptual cost. Drive lens (accumulative density) held throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Library pressure, dripping water, and the iron door’s groan constrain pace and route; the vault’s sealed air supplies the final proof. Micro-setting—charter page’s ink blot—functions as both constraint and key. Atmosphere charges the ending image rather than decorating it.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove the lie—escalates from ledger suspicion to physical charter confirmation; each narrowing choice (dead shelf → stamp vault) raises cost. Agency narrows options; coincidence complicates but never rescues. Final reveal’s social price (founders shaved down) is legible and irreversible.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: modest seal vs. ornate myth decoded through concrete artifacts. Final image—true blot beside stamp—offers resonant, non-moralizing reweighting of civic pride. Subtext lives in gesture: the historic forgery discovered in profound, reclaimed silence beneath power’s glare.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Consistent calm-perceptual voice in free-indirect style; syntactic rhythm matches the pressure-calm pattern—short acoustic beats under blackout echo long expository loops when decoding. No dialogue required; interiority remains character-specific and stakes-driven without therapy speak.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops; every clause does multiple jobs. Density high—“pressure-heavy hush,” “dappled resolve”—without figurative clash. Final sentence’s parallel of blot and stamp crystallizes cause and meaning with exact, felt specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of detective noir within submerged archive; ornate myth vs. humble seal re-inflects classical myth-making critique. Risky blackout-inside-blackout structure lands coherence at closure, making the lie prettier than truth—yet still true.</comment>
