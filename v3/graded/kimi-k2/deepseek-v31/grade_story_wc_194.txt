<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lysander’s contradictory silence—both listener and destroyer—is embodied in every measured gesture, the crank’s resistance a felt extension of his flaw. Interior conflict crystalizes in the moment he neither speeds nor halts the handle under the grandfather’s appalling confession, yet the slight reserve toward high band stems from limited on-page choice variety within the compressed scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The recessional plot—finding the crank → turning the room into medium → receiving the spectral confession—is propelled by a causal chain kept taut until the final Earned Stasis. Closure lands as Lysander lets the handle fall still, a mute acceptance that forecloses any future re-ignorance he once possessed, its cost visible in the absolute silence that replaces music.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The sepia reading room’s dust, golden shadows, and decaying leather constrain visibility and amplify paranoia, while the gramophone itself is recharged as micro-setting—its brass socket and vacant grooves guiding the exact arc needed for standing-wave ritual. At closure the grime-veiled room becomes a physical archive of inherited culpability, hardening the score just shy of 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—uncover the family lie—escalates through tightening sensory interference: the hiss thickens to hum then voice. The single, irreversible moment of hearing covertly re-weights the entire estate and Lysander’s future. A slightly nebulous quantification of what “lying built” keeps it a hair below elite escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: inheritance as pathology rather than crime. The final image—“a bridge that can never be uncrossed”—reverages the initial yawn/light motif into a conceptual repricing of guilt. No direct meta sermon occurs, but the piece edges 8.9 off a speck of moral sketchiness around the passive verb “was taken.”</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Narrative voice is hushed, archaic, selectively attentive; phrases like “eloquently silent” or “architecture of regret” feel authentically Lysander’s, not imposed lyric patina. Compression achieves laconic southern-gothic cadence with no head-hop; minor syntactic sprawl in single descriptive stack nudges it just under perfection.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Few syntactic loops, high density—lines carry atmospheric, sensory, and thematic freight simultaneously. Occasional decorative qualifier pairings (“dust and decaying leather,” “tragic error…generational guilt”) slow without derailing. The prose remains luminous and propulsive; closure beat is mercifully free of flourish.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The conceit of playing an empty record to extract a spectral family confession by resonant acoustic ritual is arresting yet inevitable once physics is seeded. Combines Gothic and hard-sci tech without gimmickry; singular image inherits prior tradition yet feels entirely original.</comment>
