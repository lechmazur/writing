<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Leo’s interiority is vivid—grief embodied in “luminous torment” and the tactile folding of memory. The contradictory impulse to descend physically while “ascending” spiritually crystallizes his arc. Micro-choice of surrendering soul-fragment for the gem shows cost. Only Keeper’s dialogue feels generic, slightly diluting relationship pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the lantern’s blue glow reweights grief into peace with visible cost (lost soul-fragment). Causal chain—silence → basilica → gem → crane → lantern—holds without gaps. Orientation anchored by line 3. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; cadence shift in final paragraph earns stasis.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Glass basilica, volcanic-glass panes, and tea-garden steam are selective, sensorily rich, and tied to stakes. Basilica’s lens constrains the dream-recording choice; lantern’s glow reprises setting as final image. Spatial choreography clean; no white-room drift. Micro-setting (crane inside lantern) charges closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—transform grief into living memorial—signaled early. Escalation: silence → soul-cost → fragility risk → luminous peace. One decisive tightening: choosing to pay soul-fragment. Cost legible on page (“take a piece of your soul”). Agency drives every beat; no coincidence resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of transmuting loss into light emerges through concrete action, never stated. Final image of projected shadow-dance offers non-literal answer: grief given wings, not erased. Subtext in folding—“each crease a goodbye”—carries emotional truth without moralizing. Resonant ambiguity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with rhythmic control (“folded his grief into the form of a crane”). Perceptual signature—lantern-maker’s attention to light, thinness, fragility—remains consistent. No head-hopping; POV modesty intact. Minor elevation in Keeper’s speech feels slightly expository but brief.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and emotion. No loops or scaffold. Metaphors disciplined—“twilight regret” color, “luminous torment” refrain—serve theme. Final paragraph’s cadence shift mirrors emotional lift. One typo: “project-ed” hyphen unnecessary but minor.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses lantern craft, dream-recording, and origami grief into fresh synthesis. Transformation test fails if elements swapped; specificity anchors invention. Risk in lyric compression pays off: closure legible, stakes heightened. No derivative echoes; vision feels singular.</comment>
