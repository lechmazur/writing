<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s desire to share light without fire is clear and embodied in tactile micro-choices; the internal contradiction between solitude and outreach is present but not pushed to crisis. The final renunciation—leaving rather than proclaiming—earns its cost through the grandmother’s memory and the grotto’s changed light, yet the arc remains gentle rather than wrenching.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the grotto’s breathing light crystallizes the new stance of quiet sharing. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each polishing pass deepens the glow until the space itself reweights the premise. Cost is felt in the shift from watcher to giver, sealed by the pocketed secret.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The serpentine grotto, mist, and sea glass form a micro-setting that constrains every beat: darkness demands touch, dampness slows polishing, the curved walls trap and amplify the revealed light. Sensory selection is POV-filtered and purposeful; the grotto’s final gleam charges the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to share light without fire—tightens through the polishing sequence; each pass narrows the option of spectacle and deepens the cost of quiet dissemination. One meaningful intensification: the moment the glass begins to breathe reconfigures tactics and forecloses the torch-bearing path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: stillness as luminous offering versus fire as consuming shout. The sea glass’s shift from opaque fragment to breathing beacon reweights the grandmother’s teaching without moralizing. Final image of pocketed glow invites contemplation rather than assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with rhythmic control that mirrors the meditative polishing. Perceptual signature is consistent: Elara’s noticing favors texture, temperature, and reflected light. No head-hopping; free indirect style stays clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and propulsive; each sentence layers image or stakes. Occasional elevated diction (“zephyr bloom tone”) risks register drift but remains within Elara’s contemplative lexicon. No loops or scaffold; sensory detail is integrated into action.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Familiar quest for inner light is refreshed through the tactile inversion—polishing not to create but to reveal. The sea-glass-as-stillness-pearl is a fresh synthesis; risk is modest but coherence is high.</comment>
