<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s survivor-cynicism and “poke the bear” streak are embodied in every micro-choice; the refusal to offer herself and the pivot to the bolt feel earned. Interior contradiction (“virtuously mischievous” vs trauma) is dramatized, not labeled. Cost is visible in the sliced sleeve and the diamond she must now live with. Only the grandmother whisper feels slightly expository.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the quantum promise is satisfied, the farm is safe, but the diamond’s existence reweights every future choice. Causal chain (text → hum → crystallizing air → bolt → diamond) is tight under a Causal lens. No orientation drift; anchors clear by 120 words. Cost is legible in the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The bioluminescent cavern is not backdrop; its humidity, glow, and filtration system directly enable the bolt’s presence and the pressure release. Spatial choreography is clean—Elara scrambles, unscrews, holds aloft. Sensory selection narrows to the slicing facets and the hum, mirroring rising stakes. The bolt-as-micro-setting constrains the final choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“translate pressure or be consumed”—is signaled early and tightened once: from personal survival to offering the bolt. Escalation is causal and legible; agency remains with Elara. No coincidence resolves; the bolt’s prior existence pays off. Visible cost: sliced skin, diamond she cannot ignore.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of consent versus coercion emerges through action: the pyramid-scheme echo reframed as a cosmic bargain. The diamond reframes “value” itself. No moralizing; resonance is in the image. Ambiguity lingers—was this another scheme or genuine transcendence—without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Voice is textured, slightly sardonic survivor-speak (“virtuously mischievous,” “gem-cut into a million pieces”). Compression and elision are purposeful; no head-hop. Syntax tightens under pressure—short clauses during crystallization. Perceptual signature is consistent and character-bound.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and propulsive; every sentence advances. No loops, no mixed metaphors. Sensory verbs are strong (“sliced,” “screamed,” “compressed”). Minor filter-verb cluster (“she understood”) is brief and voice-motivated. Final image is crystal-clear.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: pyramid-scheme trauma meets quantum physics in a fungal cave. The submarine bolt repurposed as sacrificial anode is non-obvious yet inevitable. Risky concept commits fully; no retreat to metaphor. Transformation test passes—story collapses if any element is swapped.</comment>
