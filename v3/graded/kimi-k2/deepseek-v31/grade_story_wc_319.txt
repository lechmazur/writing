<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—yearning for home vs. duty to guard—drives every beat; the pendant’s warmth and final coldness embody her shift from feral exile to conversant guardian. Micro-choice to “push the concept of the garden’s heart” against the seam is specific, embodied, and costly (pendant consumed). Homesickness remains palpable yet is sublimated into earned stasis. No secondary character on page, so relationship bullets waived.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each image thickens the garden’s arrested decay until the final cadence shift reweights the stake. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—seam vanishes with soft sigh, pendant spent, Elara’s stance crystallized. Causality intact: pendant warmth → perceptual tuning → seam mending. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Frozen garden, mist, and crystalline hedges are not backdrop but active pressure: cold slows thought, mist blurs time, marble fauns frame the seam. Pendant and bench function as micro-settings that constrain posture and choice. Final image of “held breath” recharges every prior sensory layer. Environment shapes tactics and final image—meets 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: preserve the garden vs. escape home. One tightening: seam appears → choice to mend, not cross. Cost is explicit—pendant extinguished, homesickness prolonged. Pressure coherent under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of “befriending uncertainty” emerges through concrete particulars: discarded pendant, sleeping buds, seam’s sigh. No moralizing; final silence reweights earlier feral isolation into companionable quiet. Ambiguity lingers—cultist still loose—yet feels purposeful.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is ink-stained librarian: “rustle of pages,” “non-Euclidean stacks.” Syntax lengthens with dream logic, then tightens at seam. Perceptual signature consistent—Elara reads the garden like text. No dialogue, so dialogue bullets waived.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet limpid: “razor-thin lines separating existence from void.” No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Metaphors precise—no mixed vehicles. Final “soft sigh” lands with earned cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: librarian as feral guardian, garden as open-air codex, waiting as active re-stitching of reality. Pendant’s warmth-to-cold arc feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric compression pays off in closure image.</comment>
