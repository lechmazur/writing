<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lysander’s interiority is precise and embodied; his “quiet proclamations” and tactile reading of star-dust sigils reveal a consistent, idiosyncratic mind. The client’s fear is shown through gesture and silence rather than labels. The final beat—her tear and the ribbon’s demotion to mere cloth—earns a credible renunciation with visible cost. Only the client’s voice remains slightly generic, preventing 9.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the client’s inherited shame is re-priced into grief-love, and the lock of hair loses its talismanic power. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each lyrical beat thickens the emotional density until the final cadence shift. Orientation is swift; the shop’s phasing is taught early and paid off in the shimmering nexus image. Cost is unmistakable in the client’s tear and Lysander’s extinguished lamp.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The “narrow crevice between a bakery and a bank” grounds space economically; starlight refracted through dust motes becomes a functional map that guides the ritual. The ribbon’s texture and faded dye recur as tactile anchors. Only the cosmic timeframe remains slightly abstract, keeping it from 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—freeing the idea trapped by fear—is signaled in paragraph one and tightened when the story of sacrificed love collapses the client’s fixed past. The single deepening (grief reframed as persevering love) narrows her options and exacts an emotional price. Agency is hers: she pays the tear, not Lysander. No reversals are needed; the pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the ribbon’s re-weighting: legacy is not verdict but resilient love. Subtext lives in gesture—the tear, the lamp’s extinction—never in exposition. The final image of Lysander waiting in star-hush offers a non-literal answer: liberation is perpetual listening. No moral is stated; resonance lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is hushed, starlit, and precise: “dust motes dancing above the cobblestones” teaches the pattern of reading marginalia. Syntax modulates with pressure—long lyrical coils contract into “The key is not for the hair.” No head-hopping; focalization stays locked to Lysander’s perceptual signature. Dialogue is sparse but subtextual: “Watch” carries the entire ritual.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable; each sentence layers image and function. No loops or scaffold; “a container for things too potent for the light” compresses theme and character in one stroke. Metaphors stay coherent—starlight as map, grief as persevering love. Minor elevation in diction (“creed,” “nexus”) fits the locksmith’s arcane vocation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The locksmith who picks meanings, not locks, is a fresh synthesis; star-dust sigils as keys transform a familiar magical-realist frame. Risk lies in the quiet, lyric mode—no spectacle—yet the payoff is emotionally specific. The ribbon’s shift from heirloom to ordinary cloth feels inevitable in hindsight. Nothing could be swapped without breaking the final resonance.</comment>
