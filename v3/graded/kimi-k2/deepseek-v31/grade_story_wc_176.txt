<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s regret and vocation are embodied in tactile micro-choices (tracing holes, re-knotting rope); the final “snowmelt ardor” is earned by prior struggle and visible cost. Interiority stays concrete, though the forgiveness backstory is slightly abstract. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, so the 9+ quick test is not fully met.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the bronze card crystallizes memory and reweights the stake. Causal chain—failed recording → sanctum → rope lens → bronze echo—holds without gaps. Cost is legible in the line “her heart brimming with a feeling beyond relief.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ice geode, aurora, and rope function as micro-setting that constrains tactics; the rope literally focuses light to save the mold. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered. One notch below 9+ only because the aurora’s physics remains lightly magical rather than materially grounded.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve the choir’s memory—is signaled early and tightened when the card crumbles; the rope intervention narrows options to one last chance. Cost is felt in the wax’s fragility and the irreversible unweaving of the relic. Agency drives every beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of memory-as-survival emerges through action and object; the bronze fossil answers the question “how do we keep the dead singing?” without moralizing. Final image reweights the rope from ornament to instrument, achieving quiet resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with rhythmic control (“a fossil of a song”). POV remains tightly anchored to Elara’s perceptions; no head-hop. Occasional elevated diction (“snowmelt ardor”) is earned by emotional crest.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet clear; every sentence advances image or action. No loops or mixed metaphors. Minor scaffold in “she had done it” could be trimmed, but it does not dull the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The rope-as-lens is a fresh, inevitable synthesis of setting and tool; the lost-wax transcription of a silent melody feels wholly new yet grounded. Risky lyric compression pays off in the final auroral flare.</comment>
