<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Contradictory need (quantify mercy) + physical compulsion collide; final disengaging of strap is embodiment of mercy enacted. Cost paid in pain & defiance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: strap-off → new variable appears. Closure is earned reconfiguration, cost staked in body’s remaining pain. One micro-turn inside single scene suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>UV forest & mask strap function as micro-setting constraining stance; proprioception counts. Light and weight feed closure rather than mere backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single stake—prove mercy—tightens as algorithms resist. One escalatory beat: removing strap forces a new algorithmic term. Cost paid on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of mercy emerges from concrete act, not label. Final image reframes pain as usable choice; resonance without sermon. One hairline slip in “mathematics of mercy” phrasing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is crystalline, pain-textured, lyric; compression teaches its pattern. Rhythm tightens under tension. No leaks or intrusions.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Syntactic density and figurative clarity both achieved. Zero loops, zero scaffold. Some purple risk mitigated by purpose; “pain-bright shadows” justified.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: bio-coded penance forest interrogation survivor seeking mercy algebra. Strap as repurposed torture tech transformed to trigger of grace.</comment>
