<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Nereus’s calm is embodied in micro-choices—still hands, measured breaths—yet the interior contradiction (yearning vs. stoicism) stays implicit. The final renunciation—accepting the goddess’s grief into his own chest—carries visible cost and is earned by prior harmonic discipline. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible waived. One reflective block (goddess backstory) is brief and cues present tactics.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the echo settles in Nereus’s soul, reweighting his calm into charged poise. Causal chain holds—zigzag path → spike resonance → voiced silence—each step narrowing options under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation anchored by 120 words; no drift. Cost is legible in the final image: “anchored by a understood grief.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sound Wave Garden is rendered through sensory hierarchy—salt-stained wood, star-dusted water, crystallized chord arches—each detail constraining navigation. The rail spike and boat function as micro-setting that alters tactics. Final image of constellations “finding their way home” recharges the opening disarray. No white-room syndrome; spatial choreography clean.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—capture the goddess’s echo—signaled early. Escalation is one deepening: from gentle hum to feral lullaby, forcing Nereus to adapt via harmonic counter-song. Spike and silence method are persistent constraints that shape tactics. Cost is the echo lodging in his chest, foreclosing prior emotional neutrality.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of bearing another’s grief emerges through action, not statement. The goddess’s sorrow is never labeled; it is enacted in the tear-shaped void. Final image reweights the premise: calm is no longer detachment but vessel-hood. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in “understood grief.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is distinct—salt-stained, star-dusted diction mirrors Nereus’s vocation and cosmic scale. Rhythm modulates with pressure: longer cadences in calm, clipped fragments during spike resonance. No dialogue, so naturalism waived. POV remains tight; no head-hopping. Final line crystallizes voice and theme.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet clear: “shimmering hedges of solidified melody” does triple sensory work. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances. Metaphors stay coherent—sound as architecture, silence as projectile. One minor register lift (“conceptual repricing” not in POV lexicon) but does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses mythic and acoustic physics in a way that feels inevitable: goddess’s tear as primordial echo, fisher as harmonic medium. Rail spike repurposed from anchor to liberator is a fresh inflection. Risky lyric compression pays off in closure. No derivative echoes; specificity anchors universals.</comment>
