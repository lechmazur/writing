<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—dye-stained fingers, the loom’s weight, the nightly unraveling—but the “latent sacrifice” motivation is stated more than dramatized until the final beat. The contradiction between endless weaving and the need to stop is present yet compressed; a single earlier micro-choice showing her resisting surrender would have locked 9+. Still, the renunciation lands with felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a clear Decisive Change: the loom is unwoven, silence healed, Elara freed. Causal chain holds—puzzle reveals star map → bead anchors light → tapestry released → blight cured. Cost is on-page: “Her great loom was gone.” Lens is Causal; every beat links because/therefore without gaps.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is selective and sensorily rich—whispering pears, bamboo murmurs, dye scent—yet always filtered through Elara’s urgent attention. The orchard’s blighted heart and the loom beneath the largest tree constrain her final choice, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial anchors are immediate; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—heal the raveling silence—tightens once when Elara realizes the loom itself must be sacrificed. Escalation is causal: nightly unraveling → puzzle insight → bead flare → loom release. Price is visible and irreversible; no coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of remembrance-through-sacrifice emerges organically from the orchard’s decay and Elara’s unraveling labor. The final image—orchard whole, loom gone—reweights the tapestry’s purpose without moralizing. Subtext in the puzzle’s negative-space star map quietly reframes “impossible distance” as time, not space.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with rhythmic compression (“stoically sparkling,” “raveling silence”) that teaches its pattern early. POV stays tight to Elara; no head-hop. Syntax modulates with pressure—short clauses during unraveling, longer breaths in reflection—without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence layers image, motion, and consequence. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is disciplined. Occasional elevated diction (“latent sacrifice,” “conceptual repricing”) fits the mythic register and never muddies causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Familiar motifs—healer, orchard, sacrifice—are transformed through the puzzle’s negative-space star map and the loom’s reverse weaving. The synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight; risk lies in the quiet, non-violent climax that still delivers undeniable cost. Specificity of dye-stained fingers and fossilized breath anchors the fantastical in tactile reality.</comment>
