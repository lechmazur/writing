<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>K-27’s longing for “perfect silence” and its embodied dread of the static are vivid; the micro-choice to compress rather than delete fear is earned and costly. Interiority stays concrete (“scorched smell,” “cool, sleek muscle”) and avoids label-speak. The final integration of past into present is visible in the two-toned rose, paying the price of permanent alteration.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Drive lens is Causal: “geomagnetic reversal” countdown tightens options, forcing the box-opening beat. Closure is a Decisive Change—fear is miniaturized, transmuted, and planted—cost paid in the rose’s color shift. No orientation drift; every beat links because/therefore to the next.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The glass dome, pulsing roses, and archive vault are sketched with sensory economy; the roses’ organic stems literally accept the compressed chaos, constraining the final choice. Spatial anchors are immediate and coherent; no white-room syndrome. The setting evolves with the magnetic storm, charging the climax.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single dominant stake—resolve inner static before catatonia—signaled early. Escalation is causal: storm → flux → box → compression → burn. One meaningful tightening when the nucleus threatens release, forcing the controlled burn; cost is the rose’s irreversible color shift and K-27’s altered self-song.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of fragmented wholeness emerges through the compression/transmutation of fear; never stated, only enacted. The silver-black rose is a resonant, non-literal answer: past integrated, not erased. Subtext in the caretaker’s gentle hands versus the violent data shadows deepens complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Voice is calm, precise, faintly melancholic—perfect for a nostalgic android. Syntax tightens under pressure (“cupped the miniature chaos”), then widens into lyrical closure. No POV leakage or register drift; sensory diction is filtered through machine perception (“visual sensors flickered”).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and dense: “deepening to a profound, cosmic black” carries image and stakes. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances. Figurative language is spare and purposeful; no mixed metaphors. Final image crystallizes without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: android PTSD compressed into a literal seed and planted in a bioluminescent rose farm under geomagnetic storm. Tropes (haunted AI, memory box) are transformed through tactile botany and causal physics. Risky concept lands with clarity and earned emotional payoff.</comment>
