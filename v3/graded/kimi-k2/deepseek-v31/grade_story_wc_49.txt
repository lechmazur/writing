<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—oil-smudged fingers, pocket gears, inherited duty—but her contradictory impulses remain off-stage; the shift from “hope failing” to effortless song feels externally driven rather than wrestled from inner conflict. The cost of restoring the vine is aesthetic, not personal; she ends whole, not changed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the vine’s resurrection and golden storytelling reconfigure meaning (Resonant Reconfiguration) under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is soft—moon alignment triggers memory—but the pattern of silence→song→light is taught early and paid off. No orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The arbor’s hush, dew, and moon-filtered canopy are selective and sensory; the brass sphere and withered vine function as micro-settings that constrain choice. Final image of moonlight-threaded history charges the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore the Heart-Vine—signaled early. Pressure tightens once: silence → song → light. Agency is Elara’s decision to sing, but the moon provides the decisive energy; cost is off-loaded to the celestial rather than extracted from her.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of “remembering as healing” emerges organically from song and light; no moralizing. The golden stories reweight the premise, showing history as living tissue. Subtext is carried by image, not statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet grounded in tactile detail (“brass sphere covered in resonant forks”). Rhythm modulates with pressure—sparse at despair, swelling with song. No dialogue, but internal monologue stays character-specific.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, vivid, and propulsive; occasional elevated phrasing (“luminous, impossible orange”) fits the mythic register. No loops or scaffold. One mixed metaphor—“rest its heavy brow upon the world”—does not obscure clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of steampunk tinkerer and living myth; the brass echo-catcher is not mere ornament but the conduit for ancestral song. Risk lies in the soft causality, yet the lyric payoff justifies the choice.</comment>
