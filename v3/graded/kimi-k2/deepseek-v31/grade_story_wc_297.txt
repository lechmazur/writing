<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyra’s interiority is vivid—scars, root-tether, and dread/hope duality all embodied—but the final “anchor” beat feels slightly abstract; the cost is legible yet not viscerally paid on the page, keeping it just shy of 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Lyra’s stance shifts from prisoner to conductor under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The eclipse, clipping, and scar-linkage pattern is taught early and paid off; only a hairline slip in the causal clarity of the covenant’s new terms prevents 9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The cobalt glade is not mere backdrop; its stones, roots, and scarlet shadow constrain movement and charge the final image. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered, meeting the 9+ gate, but one moment of slightly generic “world dreams bleeding in” caps it at 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding the intersection—tightens via the glowing path and the self-inflicted cut. Pressure escalates under the Accumulative lens; the cost is visible yet slightly diffuse, keeping it just below the 8.8+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of bondage-as-connection emerges organically from scar, root, and eclipse imagery. Final image reframes covenant without moralizing; resonance is strong, but a whisper of abstract “anchor” keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lush yet disciplined, with rhythmic control that accelerates under pressure. Distinct perceptual signature—“bark-like whorls,” “silent symphony”—and no head-hopping; compression and elision are taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and musical, almost every line doing double duty. One mixed metaphor (“symphony of fear and wonder”) and a faint loop of “silent” slightly dull the peak, but no artifact touches closure; high-band craft.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Familiar tropes—chosen one, land-pact—are transformed through tactile scar-circuitry and eclipse geometry. The synthesis feels inevitable; risk in lyric density heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, earning the bonus.</comment>
