<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Ayla's interior contradiction—yearning for connection yet fleeing conflict—is embodied in her tactile attention to tide-pools and the cicada. The micro-choice to return with the object reconfigures the relationship under pressure, earning the softened détente. Kael’s single line of dialogue carries the cost of remembered vulnerability, making the shift legible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the cicada’s return crystallizes the continuum between master and apprentice, foreclosing rupture. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each sensory layer thickens until the final image reweights the argument into shared legacy. Cost is the unspoken fear of obsolescence now visible in Kael’s softened stance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Starlight fracturing on water, grotto stone’s cool dampness, and the cicada’s translucence are filtered through Ayla’s chronicler gaze, constraining her shift from isolation to re-engagement. The miniature tidal-pool clock anchors temporal texture without clutter. Final image of the cicada in open palm charges the closing beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preservation of generational knowledge versus personal discovery—tightens when the cicada reappears, forcing Ayla to test her tangential method on Kael. Escalation is one deepening, not multiple reversals; the cost is the emotional risk of reopening dialogue after harsh words.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of time as textured tapestry emerges from concrete particulars: cicada dormancy, tidal micro-deaths, Kael’s younger self. No explicit moralizing; the final image of shared artifact quietly reframes conflict into continuity. Subtext in Kael’s single line carries decades of fear and tenderness.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with rhythmic modulation under starlight and salt. Perceptual signature—"each ripple a tiny clock ticking"—is character-specific. Compression in the vision sequence is taught early by Ayla’s tangential habit and paid off in the slowed-time overlay.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and sensorily dense; no loops or scaffold. “Starlight fractured on the water’s surface” does double sensory-temporal work. Final paragraph’s cadence shift—short declaratives after long lyric swell—mirrors the détente without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Familiar mentor/apprentice rift is refreshed by the cicada’s marine displacement and the chronicler’s microscopic lens on time. The tidal-pool-as-clock conceit feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risk lies in quiet lyricism rather than spectacle; coherence never wavers.</comment>
