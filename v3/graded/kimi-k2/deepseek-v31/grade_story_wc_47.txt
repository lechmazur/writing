<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (amber burn, shame texture); Elara’s contradiction between hiding and yearning to repossess her story is present on the page. Minor slip: the phrase “grafting new meaning” edges toward label-speak at the critical beat. Still, the final hand-opening gesture is earned and specific.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly via Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara proffering the pendant rewrites its meaning, cost felt as she reclaims her exposed words. Drive lens steady (Accumulative/Textural): every image (drip pattern, moss texture, pendant weight) thickens until the final beat reweights perception. One short orientation drift early: “data center” and “moss garden” fuse believably, anchor arrived before micro turn.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Environment (data-moss hall) constrains the choices: seclusion enables the scene and the drip pattern literally carves the map Elara sees. Sensory hierarchy reflects her watchful state—silent servers, emerald vines, honeyed drip rhythms—each detail filters POV bias and charges the final hush. No spatial drift.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Stake (reclaim agency over words once viral) tightens after Kael reminds her the world has moved on, forcing the pendant proffer. Escalation is one-step but meaningful; viral shame recedes as living memory emerges, carrying clear relational cost. Agency remains Elara’s; no outside rescue.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: private trauma transmuted into self-chosen artifact, the bee no longer trapped but preserved flight. Subtext between Kael and Elara is carried in offered objects rather than dialogue, earning quiet resonance without moral tag.</comment>

<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is precise, textured, lyric but lucid (“honeyed hush,” “faint footfall”). Syntax breathes with emotional cadence—compressed when she clutches the pendant, looser under the drip pattern. No head-hop; focalization locked throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Every sentence pulls double duty: “moss-choked servers” plants both decay and potential. No loop or filler verb stacks. Final image line is clean, luminous: the hush “healing the broken frequencies” performs its metaphor without collapsing under weight.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Post-apocalyptic nature-reclaim data center is familiar frame, yet focus on exposed digital confession and the pendant’s re-weighting is fresh emotional lens. Integration of viral shame with ancient amber micro-world creates specific, non-obvious synthesis.</comment>
