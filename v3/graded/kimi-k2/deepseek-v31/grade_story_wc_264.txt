<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—guardian who won’t sleep versus tender cultivator—plays vibrantly through micro-choices (hand on clock, coaxing the scream). Final renunciation of violence in favor of harmonic charm earns Ended Stasis with palpable cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/lyric lens: density of glowing flora, archive flickers, freeze-frame images tighten toward the closing lullaby. Closure is a Charged Poise: chess-clock brass re-reflects the now-smoother dune glow, reconfiguring meaning without a word.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Bioluminescent meadow, sand-light pulse, and tactile chess-clock brass constrain each step—proximity to glowing stalks dictates stealth, heatless flora reflects inner chill, brass weight steadies focus. Final image recharged by flora’s lullaby.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—archive’s fragile lullaby memory—escalates from volatile threat to stabilized ember via causal pressure (harmonized probability, not brute force). One tightening suffices; cost visible as quiet extinct-forest song integrated into dune.</comment>
<question>5</question>
<grade>9.0
</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: garden blooming atop extinction, fragmented lullaby becoming whole. No moralizing; final image reweights premise—memory’s horror integrated, not erased—achieving non-literal conceptual repricing.</comment>
<question>6</question>
<grade>8.7
</grade>
<comment>Distinct perceptual signature in sensorial filtering—electric-blue afterburn dimmed by cold sand pulse—and rhythmic variance under lyric pressure. Any elision is pattern-taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question>
<grade>8.8
</grade>
<comment>High information density and syntactic propulsion; zero loops/filter-verb stacks. Vivid concrete nouns and verbs (“glowing stalks sway”, “glass sword brave”) avoid over-telling. No overwriting in peak beats.</comment>

<grade>9.2
</grade>
<comment>Synthesis of post-apocalyptic freight guard with quantum archivist feels inevitable; transformation test passed—swap names and premise breaks. Fractured-lullaby tone charges ending without gimmickry; risk distinction +0.4.</comment>
