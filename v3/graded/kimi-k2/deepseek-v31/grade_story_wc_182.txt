<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Silas’s interiority is specific—his linguist’s toolkit guides every micro-choice; the final breath-negotiation crystallizes his arc with visible cost. Elara’s presence is thin but sufficient to pressure his stance. Motivation remains coherent, flaws acknowledged. No diagnostic label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the Library’s silence reweights the rescue mission and Silas’s quest under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality holds—each beat of silence-mapping tightens stakes. Cost is legible in the predator’s exclusion and the forfeiture of conventional victory.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The mountain-bookstore’s mycelial shelves and photosynthetic ink constrain navigation and tactics; the heartwood chamber’s void charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; sensory selection mirrors urgency. Setting evolves causally with events.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—rescue Elara and reach the Library—tightens through each silent step. Agency is exercised in the breath-negotiation that forecloses violence. One deepening turn suffices; cost is felt in the Library’s emptiness.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: knowledge as absence, rescue through renunciation of noise. Final image of “mistakes not repeated” offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture and silence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Voice is consistent, textured, and perceptually specific to a linguist’s ear. Syntax modulates with pressure; no head-hopping. Dialogue is minimal but natural when present.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and propulsive; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is selective and coherent. High information density without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Premise synthesizes familiar tropes (lost library, time predator) through the fresh lens of negative-space linguistics. The breath-negotiation is non-obvious yet inevitable. Specificity anchors universals; risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
