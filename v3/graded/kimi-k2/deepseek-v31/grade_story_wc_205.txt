<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Kaelen’s solitary grief and poetic compulsion are embodied in every gesture—covering mirrors, cradling the shard—so interiority stays concrete. The final renunciation (solitary victory) is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: “sole citizen… grieving heir.” No contradictory impulses on stage, yet the arc feels complete.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the shard’s reweighted meaning reconfigures Kaelen’s world and isolates him. Causal chain (storm → revelation → poem-proof) is tight; no orientation drift. Cost is legible in the final image: “a perfect, lonely star.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Baroque asteroid and velvet-draped mirrors constrain action and mood; the shard itself functions as micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered. Spatial choreography remains clean.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove the civilization’s artistic soul—tightens once when the poem becomes the proof, foreclosing all other evidentiary paths. Agency is Kaelen’s alone; cost is the irreversible solitude that follows.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the shard’s refraction: art as civilizational soul versus war. Final image of the lone shard reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext is carried by gesture and silence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct—lyric, lapidary, mournful—and stays consistent under pressure. Syntax and diction mirror Kaelen’s poetic mind; no register drift. Perceptual signature is selective and biased toward luminance and sorrow.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is disciplined and purposeful. No loops or scaffold. Rhythm modulates with storm and revelation. Occasional elevated diction is justified by POV.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: defunct revolutionary turned lone archaeologist-poet on a baroque asteroid. Time-as-visible-threads and mirror-covering ritual are non-obvious yet coherent. Risk-taking (lyric proof via poem) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
