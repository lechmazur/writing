<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elara’s desire to “find the thread” becomes concrete interiority—paper, nest, studio work—yet the leap from vague quest to specific installation is more a lyrical epiphany than a friction-tested choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure arrives through the sculpture’s public revelation: the spiral and dissolved letters crystallize cost in pilgrims’ reactions, foreclosing Elara’s private hoard in favor of an offering. The Accumulate → Reconfigure arc holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The lotus temple and pond never impose hard physics, yet the wet-earth scent and post-storm mist charge the final image; the nest as micro-setting becomes active material.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Stakes pivot from internal disconnection to a public act of exposure; the shift is signaled, intensifies visibly as she sands fragments into pulp, and paid for in the eyes of the pilgrims.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</question><comment>Thread/connection motif is carried by objects—paper, spiral, water—rather than explicit proclamation; the ending asks what a common voice sounds like without dictating an answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Free-indirect lyric voice is consistent; “prismatic quiet,” “inevitably whimsical,” and sensory particularity belong to Elara’s tuned ear.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Precise detail—“iridescent shells from the pond’s edge embedded into the surface”—anchors the prose without purple overload; no loops or stock metaphors mar the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The love-letter-gone-sculpture conceit is fresh enough, and the nested spiral’s infinite loop feels inevitable, but the piece leans on familiar art-as-catharsis archetype.</comment>
