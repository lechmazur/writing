<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is precise—her needle pauses, her hum syncs with flame, her choice to guide rather than surrender the chart shows contradictory impulses in scene. Prince Kaelen’s shift from arrogance to sharp understanding is embodied in his changed gait. The cost—her continued exposure—remains felt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because the Duke moves tonight, Elara must misdirect Kaelen; therefore she teaches him to listen to silence and isolate the captain. Closure is a Charged Poise—Kaelen exits with quiet purpose, Elara resumes stitching, both paths now foreclosed and dangerous.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The eternal candle’s flame is not mere décor; its spectral illumination and flicker guide Elara’s tactics and Kaelen’s lesson. Cobalt arches and autumn decay supply tactile pressure; the observatory’s spiral staircase stages the single entrance beat. Micro-setting (needle, thread, flame) constrains every choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—thwart the coup—tightens when Kaelen arrives; Elara escalates by shifting from passive chart-keeper to active strategist. One decisive tightening: she reframes the problem from direct confrontation to subversion via the wine-loving captain. Cost is the heightened risk to herself.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges: wisdom disguised as foolishness reweights power. Subtext lives in the spectral threads and the silence between footsteps. Final image—her resumed stitching—resonates as both endurance and trap, no moral stated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elara’s perceptual filter; sensory bias (spectral threads, scent of decay) is character-specific. Prince’s dialogue is spare, urgent, distinct from her measured cadence. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “the thick, echoed silence, hollow and waiting” layers atmosphere and stakes. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances. Metaphors (stellar threads as conspiracies) remain coherent and grounded.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: embroidery as espionage, star-maps as political code. The eternal candle’s spectral light enabling hidden truths is a non-obvious constraint. Risky choice to withhold direct chart pays off—tactics pivot to adjacent sabotage, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
