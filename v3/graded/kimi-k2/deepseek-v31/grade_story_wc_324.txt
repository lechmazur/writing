<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s curiosity is dramatized in how she “listens past the obvious sorrows” and the active kneeling at the bench; interiority remains character-specific and embodied. The final whispered assurance is earned by her prior actions and costs her composure, a credible renunciation foreclosing her usual observational stance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear accumulative/textural drive: each beat adds density—mist, pulses, bench—until the lullaby resolves into silent static, an earned Resonant Reconfiguration. Spatial anchoring is immediate; no causality breaks. Closure lands with felt cost: Elara’s promise absorbs the last energy, refiguring the atrium from yearning to hush.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The mist-slick marble, broken glass dome, and bougainvillea bench are tactile and constrain movement and signal. They modulate light and sound, directly affecting Elara’s sensor sweep and the final moonbeam. Environment shapes tactics, but micro-detail could sharpen proximity to bench to cross 9.0.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—completion and relay of a love that can no longer speak—escalates through every tightening static hiss until the final sustained tone dissolves. One decisive intensification suffices; coincidental discovery does not resolve, only narrows options to single act of assurance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through action—the mother’s lullaby becomes a last pulse of protection—and ends in a reweighted hush without moralizing. Emotional resonance arrives via the Polaroid’s glow and static’s silence, not authorial summary; subtext carries ambiguity and cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice remains lyric, sensory, and selective—“faint and faltering, like a moth beating against a windowpane.” Syntax modulates with pressure; long winding clauses slow into terse whisper. No head-hopping; percetual signature is constant throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose layers detail with economy—“slow condensation onto the marble floor”—and no loops or filter chains. No mixed metaphors; rhythm varies freely with the pulses. Final beat crystallizes without overwriting; minor word re-use in “static” could tighten, but not intrusive.</comment>
<question>8</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The contact-tracer-for-hearts conceit plus “decades-old hearing aid” is a specific, non-obvious synthesis. Echoes of grief-relay stories exist, yet the lullaby-laden stethoscope Polaroid reweights into a quiet technological séance. Risk lands without obscuring clarity.</comment>
