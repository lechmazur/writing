<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“grief felt like a discordant note”), but the decisive turn—choosing fluidity over rigidity—leans on a single epiphanic beat rather than a chain of micro-choices; the cost is implied rather than dramatized on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly with a Resonant Reconfiguration: the empty chrysalis reweighted from loss to possibility. Causal linkage holds under Accumulative/Textural lens; the foam insight is the single deepening that reweights the stake. Cost is felt in the phrase “he would call Lena,” acknowledging relational repair still unpaid.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Setting is selective and purposeful: the braided ravine’s “constant division and reunion” mirrors the thematic question. The limestone shelf and river foam act as micro-settings that directly enable the insight; however, the ravine itself does not physically constrain the final choice, keeping it just shy of 9-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—translating separation into connection—tightens once via the foam insight. Escalation is a single intensification under Accumulative lens; the cost is conceptual (abandoning rigid design) and relational (facing Lena). No redundant reversals; pressure remains coherent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the polymer/foam contrast: rigidity versus fluidity as modes of repair. The chrysalis motif returns reweighted without overt statement. Final image (“empty vessel was full of possibility”) offers a non-literal, resonant answer to the central question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct and symphonic, sustained through metaphoric diction (“symphony in his mind began anew”). POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Compression and patterned elision are purposeful and paid off at closure. Minor register drift toward lyrical abstraction is consistent with the character’s mindset.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is controlled. One mixed metaphor (“wilderness of his failure”) is minor. High-band craft supports closure without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise—polymer chemist seeking atonement via natural foam architecture—is fresh and specific. Synthesis of grief, science, and landscape feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk in lyrical mode pays off; no derivative echoes.</comment>
