<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority is embodied and specific; the crystallization reflex externalizes fear without label-speak. Motivation (transform scar into story) drives every beat and culminates in a visible cost—her arm’s amber lattice. The micro-choice to hold breath reframes childhood superstition into mature technique, earning the final stillness.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single-scene arc under Accumulative/Textural lens: tension tightens through density of sensation and crystalline imagery. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—the scar becomes a glowing rune—whose cost is legible in the translucent flesh. Orientation anchors by line 3; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Floating basalt platform, steam column, and tea cup form a micro-setting that constrains movement and frames the ritual. Sensory selection (petrichor, grassy tea, obsidian inkstone) is filtered through Elara’s scholarly priorities. The scar-as-river metaphor charges the final image; environment mirrors internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—pass the rite without crystallizing—tightens when the childhood reflex threatens failure. One decisive deepening: the held breath suspends external pressure and crystallizes internal resolve. Cost is the irreversible alteration of her arm; agency drives the turn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of rewriting personal history emerges from concrete action: tracing the scar re-weights its meaning from shame to resilience. Subtext resides in the amber lattice preserving “a moment of courage.” Final image offers non-literal answer—scar as map, not wound—without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited remains stable; perceptual signature is scholarly, tactile, storm-tinged. Syntax lengthens under calm, compresses during the held breath, mirroring pulse. No dialogue, so voice coherence is judged via internal texture—clean, specific, uncluttered.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid; each sentence advances image or intent. Figurative language (steam column, amber lattice) is precise and pattern-taught. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Rhythm modulates with breath-hold tension; final line lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Familiar scar-transformation arc is refreshed by crystalline biology and runic scholarship. Held-breath time-stop subverts cliché by becoming a disciplined focus rather than literal magic. Specificity of obsidian inkstone and crow-quill tool roots the fantasy in tactile reality.</comment>
