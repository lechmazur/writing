<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lysander’s calm-inventive trait is embodied in tactile micro-choices (counting sundial lines, palming the holder) and the final renunciation of violence; the cost—exposure to Vorlag—lands on the page. Interiority is specific, not diagnostic. Minor slip: “singular and pure” motivation is asserted rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: blackout → balcony → sundial → symbols → harmonic hum. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Vorlag’s stance shift crystallizes the revolution’s ignition with felt social cost. Orientation is immediate; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Twilight blackout and bronze rail as micro-setting constrain visibility and acoustics, guiding Lysander’s stealth etching. The fort’s “metallic bones” return in the harmonic payoff. One generic phrase—“obsidian monolith”—keeps it from 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—ignite silent revolution—tightens when Vorlag appears; Lysander’s wager on her hesitation narrows options and risks capture. Cost is legible in the moment of exposure. No escalation slack.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of light-as-commons emerges through action and object, not statement. Final image of shimmering symbols reweights the cradle myth from hoarded relic to shared spark. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity in Vorlag’s “hope” lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is controlled, tactile, and slightly archaic without purple drift. Distinct perceptual signature—“luminous fort,” “iron bones”—anchors POV. Dialogue minimal but subtextual; no head-hop.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and information-dense; every sentence advances. One mixed metaphor—“cradle of sparks…hammered into being”—barely grazes clarity. No loops or scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Transforms familiar “guardian betrays vault” trope via acoustic revolution and sun-steel quill. Specificity of sundial code and harmonic sleeper network feels inevitable yet fresh. Risky quiet climax pays off.</comment>
