<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is specific—“shadow-laced,” “calmly intuitive”—and her shift from static guardian to active intervener is embodied in the orchard descent and mobilization scene. Kael’s fear and courage are shown through stumbling, frost-laced breath, and the shard he carries, not labels. The final image of the fragment as “symbol of a future chosen” crystallizes her earned change with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara’s duty expands from local peacekeeping to proactive intervention, foreclosing her former isolation with the cost of leaving the orchard. Causal chain holds—Kael’s arrival triggers the mirror quest which yields the avalanche map which saves the village. One transition (cliff → town → village) is clean and motivated.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>“Lighthouse orchard above shifting ice floes” is vivid, selective, and immediately grounds stakes; the orchard’s light and the grinding floes constrain every choice. The salt-bleached town and vintage store of mirrors are tactile, lived-in, and each mirror’s glimpse reweights the shard’s meaning. Environment directly shapes tactics—barricades, diversion channels—charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prevent the avalanche—signaled in Kael’s first plea. Escalation tightens once: from passive watch to active mobilization, with the cost of Elara’s altered oath. Agency is hers: she chooses to leave the orchard, weave the visions, and lead the village. No coincidence resolves; the avalanche is diverted by human effort.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of dynamic peace emerges from action, not assertion: peace as intervention rather than stasis. Subtext in the shard’s evolution from “silent scream” to “symbol of a future chosen” reframes loss into agency. Final image quietly reweights the premise without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is consistent, lyrical yet precise—“shadow-laced,” “salt-bleached,” “prismatic light.” POV remains anchored to Elara; no head-hop. Dialogue is sparse but natural (“They said you could help”) and advances plot. Syntax modulates with urgency—short clauses during the avalanche, longer reflective ones at the end.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, vivid, propulsive. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances story or atmosphere. Figurative language is selective—“jagged edges catching the low sun”—and never muddles clarity. Rhythm accelerates during the crisis and breathes at the close.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Familiar quest arc is refreshed by the mirror-gathering mechanic and the orchard-lighthouse setting. The shard’s reconstitution via reflection rather than repair is a fresh, inevitable twist. Specificity of place and character voice prevents generic feel.</comment>
