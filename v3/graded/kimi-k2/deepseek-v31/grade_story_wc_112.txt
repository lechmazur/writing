<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Aris’s obsession is embodied in tactile micro-choices (brass lever, disengaging wrist) and Vesh’s shift from icy doubt to raw discovery is credible; the cost—Vesh’s worldview shattered—is felt in the final image. Interior contradiction is present but compressed; more embodied tension before the lever pull would lift this to 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the holographic avian’s gaze reweights the premise, and the cost is Vesh’s irreversible loss of linear certainty. Causal linkage holds under Accumulative/Textural lens; each projection layer deepens pattern until the final sideways glance. Minor drift: orientation could be tighter in first 120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The aviary’s loam-and-pollen scent and dusk-lit nexus constrain choices—proximity to sleeping birds limits sound, the orb’s glow guides attention. Micro-setting (nest, lever, orb) functions as extension of character stakes. Final image of dormant grey orb recharges earlier shimmer, meeting 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—proving time’s lateral motion—tightens through each projection shift; the ghost-egg → adult avian → mirrored selves sequence escalates under Accumulative lens. Cost crystallizes when Vesh halts Aris’s reversal, trading safety for knowledge. One clear tightening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges sideways: the story enacts its thesis rather than stating it. The avian’s gaze offers non-literal answer—time’s pool includes watchers who watch back—without moralizing. Subtext in Vesh’s warming skepticism and Aris’s restrained triumph deepens resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Aris’s “steady hum” against life-support thrum, Vesh’s “icy warmth” captured in clipped diction. Rhythm modulates with tension—short breaths during the gaze, longer cadence in aftermath. No head-hopping; POV stays anchored.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet textured: “mechanically warm glow,” “ghost-song bleeding.” No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Minor register elevation in “conceptual repricing” moment is earned by context.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: temporal mechanics explored through xenobiology lab and avian metaphor, not tech expo. The sideways-time concept is embodied rather than explained, transforming familiar “time machine” trope into lived epistemic rupture. Risky choice to end on quiet image pays off.</comment>
