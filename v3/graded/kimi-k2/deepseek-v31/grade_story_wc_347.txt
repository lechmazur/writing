<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Kaelen’s reluctant caretaker persona is sketched cleanly and embodied (finger brushing the withered nut), but the woman is a reactive passenger rather than a crucible. Interior contradiction between duty and fatigue is present yet never pushed to compel a costly micro-choice beyond the initial “curse” and sprint. Earned stasis and visible price land more in the concept (closing the labyrinth forever) than on his flesh. Voice flirts with stock beats (“I’m not here to hurt you”).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The causal chain is tight: wrong turn → dislodged stone → blueprint reveals mechanical cause → nut key fits → birds reconfigure route. Closure gives Decisive Change (labyrinth now lit and safe) with visible cost (the ancient device is no longer secret; caretaker role ends). Lens holds causal; one minor stretch—how the blueprint alone tells him the nut is a key—but it resolves within scene logic.</comment>

<comment>Frost-tight stone halls, whispers from gorse, and bronze gears scraping wall are all vivid and POV-coded. Micro-setting (pedestal, copper wings) constrains his final choice and reweights the sky as lit path. Missing anchor on year or country feels intentional. One slip: “graceless beauty” told rather than shown.</comment>

<comment>Early stake—getting the traveler out before frost—is simple, pressing, and reiterated. Mid-scene the pressure tightens: finding the blueprint raises possibility of mastering the labyrinth, risking exposure of secret. Single decisive turn is using the nut/key once he understands it will change paths forever. Cost is conceptual (loss of ancient secrecy) rather than visceral, limiting reach into high 8-band.</comment>

<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Theme of caretaker versus inherited burden threads without overt statement. “Caretaker” label is literal then reweighted when he chooses to share the labyrinth’s safety. Subtext of machines repurposed from guards to guides grows from discovered blueprint and earns resonance. Final line avoids moralizing but risks drifting toward neatness; graceless beauty re-priced as shared light works.</comment>

<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited remains locked on Kaelen; no head-hop. Prose is dense, textured—“gnarled, whispering trees,” “sharp-beaked mechanical birds”—without purple overload. Dialogue is sparse, slightly expository, but fits exhausted mode. One false echo in spoken line about “map isn’t in the stone” but voice rebounds quickly.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Clean rhythm, high density; every sentence does at least two jobs. One near-chunk of adjective stacking early (“whispering trees clung… stone passages carved”) passes because it seeds atmosphere. Minor template cadence on repeated “The bird… the bird…” is contained and not at climax. No artifacts touch closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The mechanic-bird-labyrinth concept is intriguing, blueprint twist gives fresh engineering layer to an ancient maze. Not fully unexplored territory but synthesized through singular setting detail. Risk comes via choosing to share rather than guard—the unexpected benevolent pivot feels earned within its mythic microcosm.</comment>
