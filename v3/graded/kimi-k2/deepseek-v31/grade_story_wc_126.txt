<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Kaelin’s stubborn interiority (“quiet, stubborn force”) and embodied ritual choice (bow still, eyes closed) earn her renunciation of melody for listening; the bowl’s generational weight and her acoustic gift visibly cost her the safety of silence and foreclose nostalgic retreat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the single sustained note reweights the chronic hush from void to chorus, cost paid in exposure to grief; Accumulative/Textural lens holds as pattern of density increase; orientation anchored by quay, dome, bench within 120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Greenhouse glass, rust-weeping iron, salt-tolerant fruit, and floating bowl constrain every move; the submerged orchard’s acoustic chamber physically shapes the climax; spatial choreography from quay to bench to water tracks cleanly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—answering the silence—tightens when the single note risks unleashing unbearable echoes; the bowl’s tremor marks visible price; no external coincidence resolves; agency is her endurance of the chorus.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of beauty in the unfinished emerges from the literal unfurling of trapped sound; no moralizing; final image of bowl quivering on ripples reweights silence as living archive rather than absence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Lyric compression (“acoustical texture of absence”) and rhythmic control under pressure; perceptual signature filters every detail through Kaelin’s auditory bias; no POV drift; diction remains salt-rimed and precise.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere simultaneously; no loops or scaffold; figurative language disciplined to one or two per beat; final line crystallizes without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of post-catastrophe elegy and acoustic ritual; bowl-as-listener and greenhouse-as-resonator feel inevitable yet non-obvious; risk in quiet lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
