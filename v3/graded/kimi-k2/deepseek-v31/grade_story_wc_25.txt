<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—her tactile worry over the coin, her gait tuned for stealth—but the Port Master’s sudden comprehension feels slightly granted rather than wrested from embodied cost. The antique key’s meaning is asserted more than dramatized, muting the final micro-choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the whispered “Here” reconfigures power without a shout, and the storm’s blackout supplies undeniable cost. Causal chain is tight—geomagnetic chaos → silence → whisper test—though the key’s payoff is more symbolic than causal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The rust-grid breathes through Elara’s body—wet asphalt, serial-number north, storm-light on steel—each detail filtering her choices. The container plaza’s acoustics directly enable the whisper’s success, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes—“whispers beat shouts”—are signaled early and tightened when the Port Master appears lost; the whispered coin is the decisive, costly act. One clear escalation suffices under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the tension between noise and nuance; the final image of the key in her open hand reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext in footstep listening and whispered metal carries the argument.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is tactile and rhythmic—“the labyrinth breathed”—with perceptual signature in dents, serial numbers, and cadence of steps. No head-hopping; compression under storm pressure is purposeful and legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet textured: “razor of sound that sliced neatly through the storm’s static.” No loops or mixed metaphors; every sentence advances atmosphere or tactic. Final image crystallizes without clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The premise—navigating by footstep acoustics during a geomagnetic storm—feels fresh and inevitable. Risk in quiet climax is fully committed; no derivative scaffolding.</comment>
