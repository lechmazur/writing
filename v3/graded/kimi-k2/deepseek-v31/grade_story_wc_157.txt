<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—her “fierce and private thing” and the embodied tremor in her shaking hand—but the final beat leans on summary (“she poured in the memory…”) rather than dramatized contradiction, keeping her from the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The causal chain is tight: warning → decision → gourd-shake → reality-warp. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with visible cost—the agents’ confusion and the broken meters—under a Causal lens held throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The greenhouse is no postcard; its glass panes “shimmering like liquid” and beetles’ wings rattling in symphonious response actively constrain the warp and charge the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Dominant stake—protect the language—tightens when the kale-squash-rosemary warning forecloses escape. The warp is a decisive, costly escalation that narrows options to “incomprehensible” safety.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of untaxable thought emerges through the gourd’s re-weighting: rebellion rendered invisible by its own conceptual static. The final image of “a garden growing wild and free” offers non-literal resonance without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is lush yet precise—“brass gears whirring,” “candidly cryptic”—with rhythmic control that accelerates into the warp. No head-hopping; perceptual signature stays rooted in Elara’s selective attention.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is propulsive and dense; only minor scaffold (“the effort was immense, a silent scream”) slightly dulls the peak beat. Otherwise zero loops, strong verbs, and sensory economy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The premise—taxed thoughts and botanical cryptography—feels fresh, synthesized through specific horticultural code and a gourd-rattle reality warp. Risky conceptual leap lands coherently, earning the high band.</comment>
