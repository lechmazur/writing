<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her thumb on the button, the grief mapped as non-Euclidean space—but the “physics of letting go” is stated more than dramatized until the final beat, keeping the contradiction from fully igniting in-scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the laser re-aimed from ceiling to datapad crystallizes the shift from defense to permeability. The causal chain (intrusion → insight → code rewrite) is tight, and the cost—abandoning the old firewall paradigm—is legible in the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The fungal farm’s bioluminescent glow is not mere backdrop; its living permeability mirrors and enables Elara’s conceptual breakthrough, charging the final image when dawn’s first birdsong is “swallowed by the soft, living light.”</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—how to respond to the elegant intrusion—escalates cleanly from threat to key, tightening once when Elara redefines breach as learning. The cost is conceptual rather than visceral, but still legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: security as living tissue, not wall. The mushrooms’ silent nutrient-sharing becomes the non-literal answer to “letting go,” reweighted in the final moment without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is precise, sensorily weighted, and consistent; the prose modulates from hushed awe to crystalline focus, mirroring Elara’s shift from grief-mapping to code-flow. No head-hop or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Line-level craft is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is selective (“subterranean galaxy,” “quiet wildfire”) and never clutters the closure beat. No loops or scaffold detected.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of cybersecurity, mycology, and grief is fresh and inevitable; the discarded code returning as evolved stranger is a non-obvious twist that feels earned, heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
