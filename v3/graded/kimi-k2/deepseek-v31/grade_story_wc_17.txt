<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her “curse” of perception is dramatized through the scream in the wall and the physical weight of the negative. The final choice—to testify rather than merely record—earns its cost from prior beats. One minor slip: “the weight of his legacy’s burden settled on her shoulders” edges toward label-speak before the embodied reaction rescues it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the community’s shared memory reframes the past and forecloses repetition. Causal chain holds: discovery of diary → negative → scream → testimony, each beat tightening the ethical vise. No orientation debt; spatial anchors are clear within 120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Blackwood Manor’s ivy-choked corridor and fireplace debris are tactile and selective; the negative itself becomes micro-setting that constrains the final projection. The scream baked into plaster charges the climax. One missed opportunity: the eastern forest’s “hunger” is named but never presses a choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—bearing witness to complicity—escalates from private curiosity to communal reckoning. The single decisive tightening occurs when Elara shifts from mapping to testifying, paying the cost of shared burden. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of inherited guilt emerges through the negative’s reprise and the daughter’s futile fire, never sermonized. Final image—projected frames and communal silence—offers resonant, non-moralizing answer to “what walls dream.” Complexity lingers: no redemption offered, only vigilance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with perceptual signature (“listener of stone,” “echo was not a whisper, but a scream”). Rhythm modulates with pressure; no head-hopping. Compression in the climax—“She gave them the glimpse”—is taught early and pays off cleanly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</question>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and thematic work. No loops or scaffold. One mixed metaphor—“mantle of complicit knowledge”—is minor and does not cloud closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</question>
<comment>Premise of “echo cartography” feels fresh and inevitable; the negative’s transformation from evidence to communal mirror is a non-obvious synthesis. Specificity of the daughter’s diary and the champagne toast grounds the concept. Risky lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
