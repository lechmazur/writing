<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is precise and embodied—her “shielded openness” and “listening with her eyes” are vivid. The shift from passive observation to empathetic action (whispering gratitude) is earned and costly. Minor: the empathy trait is stated more than dramatized until the final beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the seam opens, the known/unknown converse, and Elara’s stance crystallizes with felt cost (she sits, holding silence). Causal chain—shadow discrepancy → keystone shift → whisper → stair—holds cleanly. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The vault’s rain-scoured stone, oculus light, and floor-crack are tactile and constrain every move. The miniature henge recharges the setting in the final chamber, making the environment an active participant. One notch off perfection only because the fresco ceiling fades to backdrop after introduction.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—interpret silence—tightens when the shadow discrepancy forces a choice: force or empathize. The whispered word is the decisive, costly act that forecloses brute-force entry. Escalation is single but sufficient; cost is the surrender of control.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of listening-as-creation emerges through concrete beats: the map’s tear becomes threshold, silence becomes collaborator. Final image of Elara “holding its silent, patient gaze” offers non-literal, resonant answer without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet disciplined, with a cartographer’s precision—“grainy, bleached by time” vs “crisp, capturing the low afternoon light.” Perceptual signature is consistent; no head-hop. Compression in final paragraph is purposeful and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and dense—each sentence advances image or stakes. No loops or mixed metaphors. Minor scaffold in “not loud, but felt through the soles of her boots” could trim two words, but it doesn’t dull closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The conceit of cartographing silence, the micro-shadow discrepancy as key, and the henge-as-listening-device are fresh syntheses. Risky lyric structure pays off; transformation test passes—swap any element and the story collapses.</comment>
