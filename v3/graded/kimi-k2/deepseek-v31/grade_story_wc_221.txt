<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aris’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the shift from nostalgic paralysis to active cartographer is earned through the compass-glint beat. The contradiction between exile and privilege is dramatized in micro-choices (drawing remembered skies vs. mapping the nebula). Cost is felt: he forfeits the comfort of memory for the risk of the unknown. Minor slip: “confusion into exploration” is stated rather than fully embodied until the final paragraph.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the final image of charcoal scratching on parchment crystallizes his new vocation and forecloses return to Earth. Causal chain holds: compass glint → glimpse → redefinition of purpose. Time-dilation premise is taught early and paid off in the nebula reveal. Cost is legible—“he would sketch every magnificent second” commits him to perpetual solitude.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The observation deck is rendered through sensory selectivity—cool glass, frail worklight, echoed silence—each constraining his choices. The gilded compass functions as micro-setting that charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; no white-room drift. One minor efficiency: “corpse” and “tarnished” edge toward stock descriptors.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—find purpose in exile—tightens when the nebula glimpse redefines “true north.” Escalation is accumulative: silence accumulates texture until it becomes potential. Agency is preserved; the discovery is triggered by his deliberate act of drawing. Cost is visible: perpetual solitude as cartographer of deep time.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of orientation emerges organically from the compass, the act of mapping, and the nebula’s hidden structure. No explicit moralizing; the final image reweights the premise without statement. Subtext operates in the silence and the glint of gold. Complexity is honored: exile is both curse and instrument.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with rhythmic control under pressure (“soft scratch of charcoal on paper, a tiny noise defiant”). Perceptual signature is distinct: the temporal stretch filters every observation. No POV leakage or register drift. Compression and elision are purposeful and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; every sentence advances atmosphere or character. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Figurative language is sparse and exact—“time was no longer a river but a sluggish sea.” Final cadence slows to match the crystallized stance. Clean mechanics.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise of solitary cartographer of deep time is fresh; tropes of isolation and stargazing are transformed through the time-dilation constraint. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking (lyric accumulative structure) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. No derivative echoes.</comment>
