<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Leo’s silence isn’t a gimmick: it forces interior contradiction, embodied emotion, and a final martyrdom-smile that locks renunciation with cost; the stalled throat nerve is dramatized through choice, not exposition.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Story follows a tight Causal lens: handprint recognition → cost of silence → bolt restoration as decisive change; closure lands on a resonant reconfiguration (earned stasis with visible cost).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Cobalt fortress is never backdrop snow globe; the dormant piano, spiral stair, and bolt function as environment-tools that pressure Leo’s final stance; every object constrains tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Conflict pivots on one stake—safety bought with silence—and escalates via Leo’s increasing internal resistance; each stair-grip tightens stakes until quiet resistance shatters the premise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Question “what is the cost of safety” is woven under scene tension, not stated; theme crystallizes when Leo’s silent chord re-prices safety as complicity with a frostbitten glow of defiance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is consistent lyric mode: select sensory cutbacks, minimalist but character-particular; free-indirect style glides from chandelier dust to throat warmth without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rhythm modulates from hushed cataloging to a suspended, ragged final beat; zero loops or template cadence; metaphoric density laser-focused on bolt / silence linkage.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Frostbitten hope as tone is original synthesis; cold as agency, silence as rebellion; final anti-concordance line reprises opener with inverted valence, forging inevitable closure.</comment>
