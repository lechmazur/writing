<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elian’s interiority is embodied and specific—his skin “drinking languages” and the compass ring’s warmth anchor motive. The final absorption beat crystallizes a credible renunciation: he chooses to carry the map inside rather than draw it, a visible cost. Minor slip: the “quiet blaze” label edges toward diagnostic shorthand, but the embodied fire in his chest rescues it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer thickens until the stillpoint reweights the premise. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—the ring points inward, the forest’s hum becomes “a familiar language,” and the cost is the irreversible internalization of sorrow. No orientation drift; anchors are clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The ultrasonic forest is not backdrop but pressure system: the hum guides every footfall and the clearing’s silence forces the final choice. Micro-setting (the petrified tree) constrains the closure beat. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—touch and vibration over sight.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—navigate the forest’s sorrow—is signaled early and tightened by the narrowing musical trail. One decisive intensification: the ring’s flare at the tree forecloses retreat. Cost is the emotional flood Elian absorbs; it alters his future craft.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the fusion of mapmaker and cartographer of the soul; no explicit moralizing. The final image of the ring pointing inward reweights the premise without statement. Subtext lives in the silence after the last note.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is tactile, lyrical, and consistent: “seething hum,” “frozen dew,” “cold heat.” Perceptual signature is Elian’s skin-reading world; no POV leakage. Rhythm modulates with pressure—long sentences in transit, clipped fragments at the stillpoint.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful—“quiet blaze” risks purple but is earned by context. High information density: “the metal drank its fill of the silence” compresses action, emotion, and closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise of a blind mapmaker who maps emotions via touch is fresh and fully committed. The ultrasonic forest and compass ring are not gimmicks but integral instruments. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
