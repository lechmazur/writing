<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Eliza’s interiority is embodied and specific; her “expectantly resigned” stance is dramatized through micro-choices (hand on zither, isolating voices). Leo’s unlearning hatred is shown via tonal shift rather than label-speak. The final renunciation—program ends, moment persists—earns its cost on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each subtraction of voices tightens the sonic braid until the final chord reweights the stake. Closure is a Charged Poise—the resonant silence after the chord—whose cost is the program’s erasure. No orientation drift; anchors set by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Velvet library and autumn light are filtered through Eliza’s selective attention; the zither rosette constrains her pedagogy and reappears in the final metaphor. Micro-setting (body, breath) functions as environment under pressure. Spatial choreography is clean; no white-room gaps.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—program’s cancellation—signaled in paragraph 2. Escalation is textural: each subtraction of voices intensifies the cost of loss. Leo’s softened tone is the decisive tightening that proves harmony possible just as the path closes. Agency remains with Eliza’s method.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of vanishing arts emerges from the concrete stakes and the final resonant silence; no moralizing. Subtext lives in Leo’s reluctant breath and the shared chord. The ending reweights the rosette metaphor without stating a thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays close to Eliza’s perceptual signature; diction is lyrical yet disciplined. Rhythm modulates with scene pressure—longer sentences in reflection, clipped fragments during vocal drills. No POV leakage or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is selective and purposeful. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Sensory detail is filtered through Eliza’s priorities; every sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. Final image crystallizes without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Familiar premise—arts cut, teacher’s last rehearsal—is transformed through the subtraction method and the zither rosette metaphor. Specificity of choral pedagogy and Leo’s guarded tenor give fresh texture. Risk lies in the quiet lyric mode, paid off by the resonant closure.</comment>
