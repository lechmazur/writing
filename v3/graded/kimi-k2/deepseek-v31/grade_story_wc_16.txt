<grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Elara’s contradictory drive—“careful exuberance”—is embodied through micro-choices: tilting the cracked inkwell, recognizing the sigil, feeling the personal stakes in her “heart hammering.” The renunciation of revenge and acceptance of silence as consequence create an earned endurance. Motivation is clear and rooted, tied to mentor-relationship stakes on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question>
<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara realizes the Dirge is a vow, not a lament—a shift that re-weights the meaning of silence and the promise to Alaric. The shift is dramatized, cost felt in the irrevocable absence of direct reconciliation under the Charged Poise lens. Orientation is anchored early; lens remains accumulative/textural.</comment>

<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Archive setting is selective: silent canyons, dawn light on the desk, the cracked glass inkwell functioning as micro-setting that constrains her discovery. Sensory economy supports stakes; no exposition clutter. Spatial anchors are coherent.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—restoring trust after silence—is signaled early and tightens through the stalled translation. The final revelation acts as deepening, not reversal. No external force rescues; coincidence serves reveal but does not solve. One persistent cost: silence remains.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of witnessing vs mourning is discovered through translation act itself; nothing restated. Subtext runs through the glass flaw, the vow, the “interconnected promises” of language and partnership. Final image (Alaric appearing, no words) crystallizes theme without moralizing.</comment>

<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Lyrid, restrained voice matches Elara’s scholarly urgency: “symphony of truth… conductor… unsnarl.” Syntax modulates under pressure; no clichés. POV filters observations through her idiom alone.</comment>

<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm drives momentum: “the fragile grammatical structures a tangled knot…” Figurative language is spare and exact. Early glass image reappears with shifted meaning—no redundancy—high density.</comment>

<grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: a translation crisis framed as symphonic testimony and a relationship restored without spoken apologies. Uses Kitharan vow as non-literal pivot rather than genre puzzle-solver.</comment>
