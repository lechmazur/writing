<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—precision vs. sentiment—drives every beat; the micro-choice to paint the flame instead of fight is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost (loss of pure detachment). The grandmother memory is brief, anchored to present cue, and tilts her stance. No slips touch closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because she seeks synthesis, therefore she studies the flock; because she grasps the pattern, therefore she redirects the raptor. Closure is a crystallized Charged Poise—the crystal now embodies the harmony she sought, with the felt cost of abandoning sterile objectivity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The kaleidoscopic waterfall and orchard constrain tactics (light needed for crystal, flock uses waterfall as escape); the frozen dew crystal itself becomes the micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—obtain crystal before transformation—is signaled early and tightened by the raptor’s arrival. Escalation is causal: each beat narrows options until the flame signal is the only viable tactic. Cost is legible: she risks the crystal and her self-concept.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme (harmony of logic and intuition) emerges from the flock’s emergent intelligence and her tactical flame; no explicit statement. Final image of the crystal reflecting both fire and birds offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights the premise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct—precise alchemical diction laced with restrained wonder. Perceptual signature is consistent; no head-hop. Rhythm modulates with pressure: longer sentences in calm, staccato bursts during attack. No register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, vivid, and propulsive; figurative language is sparse and purposeful. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Sentence variety supports momentum; opening and closing lines are sharp and resonant.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: alchemy meets emergent swarm intelligence. The flock-as-organism trope is transformed through Elara’s precise flame signal. Risky choice to resolve conflict via pattern rather than violence pays off and deepens theme.</comment>
