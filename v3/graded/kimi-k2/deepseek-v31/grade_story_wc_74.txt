<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elara’s alternating insomnia-night vs muted-day perception feels lived in; her unresolved creative paralysis and later decision to write on the glass carry visible, embodied cost, tying the character flaw to the climax.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>One continuous rooftop scene cleanly meets the form; causal daydream mechanism taught early and paid off at closure under the Accumulative/Textural lens; final saffron-crocus reprise is a crisp Resonant Reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The greenhouse’s alternating layers of grime and refracted moonbeams surface as material pressure: they silently constrain visibility and later scatter the script across walls, constraining the miracle and coating the city below.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Creative constipation escalates to literal inscription on glass; the saffron stripe recalls the first alley moment, tightening moral stakes around mutual recognition and kindness remembered, all traceable to prior choices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Kindness as remembered debt becomes the central re-pricing; the waxing moon’s glow reweights it as public witness, proving that anonymous good deeds leave etched consequences—subtle but undeniable.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyrical, painter-observed prose delivers rhythmic variation—grit on glass, crocus petals—modulated by sleepless pacing; no head-hopping; final hush crystallizes in charged image.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Metaphors of “saffron quiet” and “moonlight glyphs” are vivid yet purposeful; clunky patches minimal; final line’s quiet refraction holds clear poise without dilution.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elevates the familiar idea of strangers-remember to literal proof via glowing script; the crocus reprise is non-obvious, emerging from earlier saffron and moon mechanics, powering a genuine conceptual flip.</comment>
