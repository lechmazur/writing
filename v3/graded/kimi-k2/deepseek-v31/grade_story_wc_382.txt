<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory drive—yearning to decode the building yet clinging to polite fictions—plays out in embodied micro-choices (ascending, accepting the seal). The final acceptance of custodianship carries visible cost: she is left alone, seal in hand, the old tongue now hers to keep alive.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the ghost’s revelation reweights every prior lesson, and Elara’s new role is crystallized in the meteor-lit garden. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each weekly tea thickened pattern until the sky itself broke it. Cost is legible in the fading custodian and the silence that now belongs to her.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The rooftop garden is not backdrop but living lexicon: soil scent guides her first step inside, parched autumn stalks mirror the thinning lies, and the meteor shower finally burns away the veil. The seal’s bronze weight anchors the final image, constraining her to permanence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—learning the building’s language—tightens when the tutor’s identity collapses into the very grammar she sought. One decisive intensification: the meteor shower strips the agreed-upon lies, forcing her to speak the next sentence alone. Cost is the custodian’s dissolution and her solitary succession.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: language as covenant between living and built, truth traded for guardianship. The final image—Elara holding the seal beneath falling stars—reweights every prior lesson without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: is she inheritor or prisoner?</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is precise, lyrical, and consistent: “papery rustle of a thing,” “lintels and cornices as verbs and nouns.” Compression and patterned elision (“Weeks bled into months”) are taught early and paid off in the meteor-lit dissolution. No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains Elara’s throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers sensory and symbolic work. No loops or scaffold, no mixed metaphors. The final cadence—“the silent language of every beam and brick now fluent in her mind”—lands clean, crystallizing the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The conceit—ghost linguist teaching a living woman the grammar of architecture—feels inevitable yet fresh. Transformation test fails if names or places change: the building itself is character, the seal is covenant, the meteor shower is punctuation. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
