<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses (confidence in uncertainty vs. panic at Kappa-7’s noise) play out in micro-choices like scratching ones and zeroes or smearing blood. The final renunciation—accepting the anomaly as the signal—earns its cost through prior failed calibrations. One slip: “confidently uncertain” is stated more than dramatized until late.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the gravitational weirdness *is* the message, reweighting every prior “mistake” into calibration. Causal lens holds: each failed seed logically sets up the next interpretive move. Cost is legible in the blood-pricked thumb and the irrevocable reconfiguration of her listening stance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The anomaly’s warped physics (“up felt diagonal and light curved in lazy arcs”) is not backdrop but active antagonist, constraining every tactic. The dried pen and notebook shrink the cosmos to tactile scale, anchoring disorientation. One minor drift: “rogue gravitational anomaly, designated Kappa-7” reads like dossier rather than lived perception.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—extract meaning from noise—is signaled early and tightened when Elara shifts from fighting the pull to reading it. The single decisive turn (reconfiguring power to listen for gravitational signature) narrows options and carries visible cost: fried equipment, spent power, blood ink. No escalation slack.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: failure as necessary instrument of knowledge. The pen’s resurrection with blood reweights it from relic to stylus of understanding, a resonant image that reframes all prior “wrong seeds.” No moralizing—just the quiet, alien equation streaming in.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is precise, scientific yet lyrical, mirroring a signal interpreter’s perceptual bias. Syntax tightens under stress (“She had to unbend her own thinking”) and relaxes into wonder at the end. No POV leakage; every sensory filter is Elara’s.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and propulsive; each sentence advances either data or emotion. Occasional elevated diction (“terraforming microbes,” “conceptual repricing”) fits the POV’s professional lexicon. One paraphrase loop—“she realized… she understood”—dulls the peak by a hair.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The gravitational anomaly as *message* is a fresh synthesis of hard-SF premise with epistemic theme. The pen’s blood-ink resurrection feels inevitable yet surprising, transforming a sentimental token into an instrument of discovery. Risky structure—reviewing logs by hand—pays off by making chaos legible.</comment>
