<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Silas’s interiority is vivid—his “quiet rebellion” in dock labor and the “mental severing” as he rows are embodied and specific. The longing unlocked by the scrimshaw and the bone-deep whale-call create credible, contradictory impulses. The final renunciation of the old world carries visible cost: he drops the map-scrimshaw and turns his back on Aethelburgh. Minor: the “combative tenderness” label is slightly diagnostic rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Silas forecloses return by stepping onto the island and dropping the scrimshaw, with felt cost (“finally free”). Causal chain—scrimshaw → call → island → renunciation—holds cleanly under a Causal lens. Orientation is anchored early; no teleporting props. One micro-turn (island solidifies) is allowed and tightens stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dock, skiff, pebble beach, and moonlit bay are sketched with selective sensory economy. The scrimshaw and whale serve as micro-settings that constrain choice (he cannot reach the island without the call). Salt, cold stone, and “deep time” charge the final image. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from dock to skiff to shore.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—freedom versus duty—signals early and tightens once: the island’s appearance forces the choice to row or remain. Escalation is driven by Silas’s agency (each oar-stroke detaches another layer). Cost is visible: loss of dock identity and safety. No coincidence resolves; the whale merely witnesses.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of suppressed identity versus authentic self emerges organically through action and image; no explicit moralizing. The disappearing island reweights the premise as a haven for those who answer the call, a conceptual repricing of “violence impossible” world. Final image of turning his back offers non-literal resonance. “Combative tenderness” is slightly stated but mostly earned by the whale’s gentle eye and Silas’s fierce protectiveness.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Silas’s perceptual signature: “fluid economy of motion,” “marrow of his bones,” “smelling of salt and cold stone.” Syntax modulates with emotional rise—short, rhythmic strokes mirror rowing. No head-hopping; voice remains consistent. Minor elevation in diction (“sublittoral fringe”) fits the lyrical register.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet textured: “screech of metal the only violence left” is precise and resonant. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances. Metaphors are controlled and coherent. Rhythm accelerates naturally during the row. One near-redundant phrase—“profound, resonant longing”—is forgivable amid otherwise high density.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Pacified world + whale-call island is a fresh synthesis of quiet dystopia and mythic quest. Scrimshaw as both map and key feels inevitable in hindsight. Specificity of dock labor and spectral island grounds the fantastical. No close echoes of famous scenes; transformation test passes—plot would collapse if elements were generic.</comment>
