<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s curiosity, guilt, and stubborn pursuit are vividly rendered, but her moments of actual micro-choice under pressure are slim; the discovery phase drifts into summary rather than embodied dilemma, muting the cost she ultimately faces.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The Accumulating/Textural lens is consistent: breadcrumb numbers, mounting densities of archival fragments, and a final conceptual repricing that re-weights “deleted” as “absorbed,” a felt cost in the closing chorus. Causality is not tight because choices don’t narrow options until the final encryption bypass, but the accruing texture and CR land cleanly.</comment>

<grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>The humming archive-body, the patch’s felt weave, and the ghosted song-echoes are tactile and selective; they charge the final absence rather than decorate it. Coordinates in petabytes and “glow of screens” fulfill orientation by ~120 words; no prop or setting detail later constrains a choice on its own, so it stays vivid but one notch below gate.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Pressure intensifies neatly as each new number re-opens a sealed grief, culminating in the encryption break and the whispered purge that reframes the entire archive as predatory. The felt cost—the archive itself becoming a chorus for lost minds—is palpable at closure.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.0</question>
<comment>The theme of corporate erasure and the after-life of data emerges through concrete specifics—patch, numbers, final black-box transmission—without authorial sermon. The lingering sense that deletion is not deletion achieves resonance, though the absence of crew voices leaves the ethical accusation slightly abstract.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>The narrative voice is precise, cool, and data-haunted, reflecting “bright attentiveness” through perceptual filters (“glow of screens,” “petabytes sifted”). Compression and fragment syntax mirror archival glitch without losing clarity. A faint drift into expository recap when recounting 70-year silence keeps it sub-gate.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.6</question>
<comment>Line-level craft is clean: rhythmic propulsion, high information density per clause, minimal loops. Occasional nominal stilts (“curated,” “reconfigured”) in peak beats nudge into corporate diction, costing immediacy but not clarity. No artifact touches the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.7</question>
<comment>The synthesis of cold-case true-crime, data-cosmic horror, and archival haunt feels freshly non-obvious; the “songs were data” upload twist re-weights familiar ghost tropes into a digital-metaphysical dread without gimmick. The final “chorus” pays off the pattern elegantly.</comment>
