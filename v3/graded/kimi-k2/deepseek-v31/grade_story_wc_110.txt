<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Anya’s interiority is precise—her “need to understand” and later mercy are embodied in micro-choices (lens use, incinerator). The final renunciation carries visible cost: she forfeits archival duty and accepts a quieter, riskier peace. One slip: the manager’s off-stage presence softens the relational crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: burning the logbook crystallizes a new stance—mercy over fact—with felt cost. Causal chain (curiosity → discovery → incineration) holds under Accumulative/Textural lens; the archive’s hush deepens rather than merely ends. Orientation is clean by line 5.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The archive’s “hushed corridors” and rain-slick crystal forecourt are filtered through Anya’s solitude, guiding her final exit. The projector lens functions as micro-setting, constraining perception and choice. Sensory economy is tight; only the rain and lens starbursts earn page time.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—truth vs mercy—tightens once when the hidden ledger is decoded. Escalation is one deepening: the cost of concealment becomes real when Anya chooses fire. No reversals needed; the single crystallizing choice suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the tension between archival truth and human compassion; no moral is stated. The final image of the lens holding “purer, kinder light” reweights the premise without sermon. Subtext lives in silence and ash.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is quiet, precise, slightly cool—perfect for a registrar who trusts silence. Syntax lengthens under reflection, tightens during discovery. No dialogue, yet internal cadence carries subtext. Distinct perceptual signature: “tiny percussion in the overwhelming silence.”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and dense: “sheeting against the crystalline panels” does triple duty. No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances. One near-purple phrase—“alien artifact”—is earned by context.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The archive-as-mausoleum conceit is fresh, and the lens-as-truth-metaphor evolves rather than decorates. The mercy-over-record choice feels non-obvious yet inevitable. Risk is quiet but real; no gimmicks.</comment>
