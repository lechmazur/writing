<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses—dread vs. hope, secrecy vs. duty—are dramatized in the descent and whistle-blow. The final choice is earned by prior pattern study and carries visible communal cost. A hairline slip: “quietly driven” is asserted more than shown in early beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: gate closure → resource dread → fracture → descent → whistle turn. Closure is a decisive change with felt cost—the city’s horizon tilts, futures foreclosed. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 3. One micro-turn suffices.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is tactile and constraining: salt glare, shell grooves, cool heart-chamber. The turtle-body itself becomes instrument, charging the final image. Micro-setting (reed whistle as key) meets 9+ gate. A single sensory cliché (“blinding dawn”) keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—city survival via course change—signaled early and tightened by fracture. Agency is Elara’s descent and whistle; cost is collective terror and irreversible heading. Escalation causal, one meaningful tightening sufficient.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of forgotten literacy emerges organically from pattern-reading and whistle act. Final image reweights watchers from threat to invitation without moralizing. Subtext in “dread fused with purpose” lands cleanly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise; perceptual signature filters every detail through cartographer’s pattern-seeking gaze. Syntax modulates with pressure—long spiraling sentences inside the shell, clipped emergence at dawn. No head-hop or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers map, body, and emotion. One mixed metaphor (“dread washed in sun”) and a near-loop (“slow, ceaseless migration”) are minor artifacts that do not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Transforms familiar lost-city trope into living-turtle cartography; whistle-as-key and shell-as-instrument feel inevitable in hindsight. Specificity of calcium spirals and salt flats anchors the fantastical. Risky descent into turtle heart pays off with coherent closure.</comment>
