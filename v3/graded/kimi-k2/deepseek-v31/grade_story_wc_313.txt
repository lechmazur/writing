<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s interior contradiction—keeper vs. citizen—drives the final reversal; embodied emotion in the sip and shrine placement shows cost. Motivation shifts from erasure to witness with felt consequence. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible waived.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the shrine crystallizes options for the bulldozer crews, foreclosing Elias’s original erasure plan with visible cost. Causal chain (photograph trail → memory → choice) holds under Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation anchored by dusk and ridge within 120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Midnight ridgeway, wind chime, and bottle function as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered; the valley’s scarred basin mirrors Elias’s internal state without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to erase or preserve memory—tightens once when Elias swaps destruction for witness. Agency drives the shift; cost is the forfeiture of solitary control. Pressure accumulates via photograph trail and looming bulldozers.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of memory vs. erasure emerges organically from Elias’s choices; the shrine reweights the premise without moralizing. Final image offers non-literal answer: stories left for others to bury or see. Subtext in silence and sapphire sip carries resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, lyrical yet grounded in Elias’s perceptual signature (“precisely humane economy”). No dialogue; internal texture stays coherent. Patterned elision (e.g., “mirrored hush”) is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and propulsive; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language serves pressure, not ornament. Sentence variety mirrors emotional cadence; no artifacts in closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Resurfaced ghost town as memory pilgrimage feels fresh; photograph trail transforms familiar trope. Risk in quiet ending heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specificity of “Valley’s Heart” liqueur and wind chime grounds universals.</comment>
