<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her pulse offered to the mirage is a concrete, costly micro-choice. The contradiction between her calm and the life-force sacrifice is dramatized in scene, not summarized. No stock labels or therapy-speak intrude. The earned stasis—return of the heartbeat and quiet disappearance—carries visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the mirror’s projection of “what could be” reweights reality for three bell peals, then dissolves, leaving the conceptual cost of lost possibility. Causal chain is tight—coded lullaby → droplet key → borrowed heartbeat → mirror persuasion. Orientation is anchored by the prism parapet within 120 words. No plot amnesia or soft resets.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The prism parapet is not mere backdrop; its crystalline droplets are literal pigment and anchor, constraining how Elara can paint with light. Sensory specificity (wet stone, jasmine, spectral tears) is filtered through her selective attention. Spatial choreography holds as she turns the garden toward the gallery window. Weather and refractive physics affect the action beat-by-beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—persuade mirrors to show possibility—is signaled early and tested by the ticking bell countdown. Escalation is one continuous tightening: mirage wavers → heartbeat anchor → mirror projection → dissolution under bell toll. Agency is Elara’s throughout; luck never rescues. The visible cost is her own life-force, altering tactics and foreclosing further attempts tonight.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of “possibility versus reflection” emerges from the concrete act of painting with light and the final mirror image; no direct statement intrudes. Subtext operates in the silence after the last bell, where the vanished garden lingers as conceptual cost. The borrowed heartbeat literalizes the price of imagined futures. Final image reweights the premise without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric close third stays locked to Elara’s perceptual lens; no head-hopping. Syntax and diction (“spectral tears,” “nascent evening”) reflect her artistic sensibility without purple drift. Compression is purposeful—entire arc in ~750 words. Rhythm modulates with pressure: longer cadences in calm, clipped fragments during bell strikes.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet limpid; each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and causal information. No paraphrase loops or scaffold. Metaphors (“spectral tears,” “dusky harmony”) are precise and internally consistent. Line-level propulsion accelerates into the bell sequence without overwriting. Final line resolves by image, not exposition.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The “mirage painter who trades in possibilities” is a fresh synthesis; the heartbeat-as-pigment device is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Tropes of magical art and urban fantasy are transformed through tactile specificity and conceptual cost. Risky structural compression pays off: entire arc in one escalating beat. No derivative echoes or gimmicks.</comment>
