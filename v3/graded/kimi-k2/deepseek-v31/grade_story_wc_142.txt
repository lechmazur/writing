<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rio’s interiority is vivid, embodied, and contradictory: her “humming mix of hopeful desperation” is shown through micro-choices (accepting the chip, painting the maze, pocketing the stone). Dual allegiance is dramatized in scene, not summarized. The final smile is earned because the bridge tactic has been seeded by earlier beats. Only a hairline slip: the net-mender’s dialogue is slightly expository.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the city’s future is not blocked but channeled, and the cost is the irrevocable loss of the old guild hall’s purity. Causal chain—chip → graffiti → recognition → hybrid plan—holds cleanly. Lens is Causal: each beat narrows options until the final bridge crystallizes. No orientation debt; transitions are legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The raft-carnival is tactile: “neon lights…fried dough and saltwater” filtered through Rio’s sensory dampening. Micro-setting (the Leaky Hull’s counter, the rust-stained wall) constrains her movements and tool use. The foundation stone chip is a charged micro-object that physically anchors past and future. Spatial choreography is flawless; no floating rooms.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—navigate gentrification without losing soul—is signaled early and tightened when surveyors arrive tomorrow. Escalation is one meaningful deepening: from covert graffiti to public negotiation. Cost is explicit: the guild hall will never be “only ours” again. Agency remains Rio’s throughout; coincidence does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from concrete acts: the maze-painting reclaims space without denying change. Subtext lives in the chip’s silent hand-off and the net-mender’s casual tone. Final image of “dancing upon new currents” reweights the premise without moralizing. Complexity is preserved: privatization is not evil, just inevitable and negotiable.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct: sensory filtering, orderly-yet-intuitive diction (“catalog of systems and connections that felt, rather than calculated”). Rhythm modulates with pressure—short efficient clauses during painting, longer reflective cadence at water’s edge. No head-hopping; net-mender’s speech is differentiated by idiom and hesitancy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is taut, vivid, and propulsive. No loops, no scaffold. Metaphors (“culture shock absorber,” “humming mix”) are precise and character-rooted. Sentence variety supports momentum; paragraph cuts are purposeful. Only minor register drift in “modernized future she couldn’t envision,” but it fits reflective beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Floating gentrifying carnival is fresh synthesis; graffiti as community organizing tool feels inevitable in hindsight. Specificity—trio of waves, star for net-menders—prevents generic “resistance art.” Risk is taken by refusing a defeat/victory binary; payoff is the hybrid future. No close echoes of famous scenes.</comment>
