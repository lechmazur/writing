<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>A consistent interior Elara anchors choices; "Safeguard space for innovation" remains a taut motive that threads every action. Her tactile burial of the seed and the final stance before the brook both embody the promised vigil. The flaw—quiet complicity in legal gamesmanship—is allowed without apology, giving her a credible edge of cost. A clearer trace of contradictory impulse mid-scene would have tightened the inner arc to the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dense causal chain: seed arrives → coordinates → biotech shell exposed → ancient law invoked. The decisive change (protected designation) crystallizes with undeniable social cost, and the lens remains Causal throughout. Momentary ellipsis in the handoff between biotech sleuthing and paperwork filing could blur edge-to-9, yet closure holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The brook, seed depth in moist earth, and night air filter POV choice and anchor the burial act. A more kinetic constraint—flood risk, soil acidity test—would have leveraged the terrain against Elara and pushed this to 9-band, but the setting already charges the final silhouette on the porch.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preservation of innovation space—tightens once from abstract ideal to court injunction with on-page consequence. Cost is felt in quiet renunciation: Elara trading stealth and possible ethical gray zones for botanical refuge.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The quiet theme of stewardship vs. profit emerges through concrete event, not sermon. Final image of permanent “storm-born silence” reframes the earlier storm as the cost—an elegant conceptual repricing. A direct articulation of theme inside character voice is avoided, preserving subtext.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Voice is poised and elegant, with sensory focus filtered through Elara’s designer mind. Slight syntactic reserve (“a weighty container postmarked…”) keeps tone elevated but never showy; no lapses in POV distance. Strong cadence under pressure; one or two adverbial hedges (“quietly”, “profoundly”) could be trimmed to elevate to 9, yet clarity remains intact.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clean sentences, rhythmic variation, zero scaffolding loops. Compression is purposeful—“research… cross-reference… the answer came”—yet image never stalls causality. Only micro tautology around “possibility just born” recycles a phrase; not enough to break momentum at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fusion of escape-craft and ecological thriller feels new and tightly organic. The shell-company trope is repurposed into a patent land-grab, not just set-dressing; the corpse flower patent angle is non-flash but chillingly specific. Risk of legal loophole as hero’s tool lands clean, without contrivance.</comment>
