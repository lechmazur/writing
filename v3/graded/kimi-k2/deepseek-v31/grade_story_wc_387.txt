<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Ren’s quiet, embodied ritualism is vivid; his refusal of recognition and the bamboo whisk micro-choice show interior contradiction and cost. Lin functions mainly as a prompt, not a crucible, so relationship pressure is thin. The final release of the firefly carries earned, visible cost, satisfying the 9+ test despite the low-stakes frame.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the moon-path river reconfigures meaning and the cost of human interference is felt in the glowing highway image. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of light/dark pattern tightens once, no causal reversals required. Orientation is anchored by 120 words; no teleporting props or logic breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Whispering parapet, wet stone, and bamboo whisk as micro-setting constrain Ren’s tactile choices and charge the final steam image. Selective sensory hierarchy (sound of dripping, glow of flies) mirrors theme without cataloging. Spatial choreography is clean; no white-room syndrome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—protecting the hidden pattern—signaled early; single deepening when Ren chooses to whistle and later releases the fly narrows options under Accumulative lens. Cost is legible: one fly saved, countless others still at risk, human lights remain. No escalation curve beyond the one cadence shift, sufficient for 600-word scope.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from gesture and image—unseen labor, quiet repair—never stated as thesis. Final steam-and-light tableau reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext in whisk-as-unity image is earned through prior handling. Ambiguity lingers: village lanterns still burn; pattern still fragile.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Ren’s perceptual bias—moon angles, grass strands, firefly legs. Rhythm modulates: long lyrical sentences calm, single-clause releases mimic fly lift. No head-hopping; diction remains within villager lexicon. Dialogue is minimal but natural, subtextual.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable; figurative language serves pattern imagery without overwriting. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Strong verbs (“stream,” “pulse,” “murmur”) carry weight; modifiers spare. Final steam image is crisp, propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh angle: net-mender repairing not for fish but for fireflies, honoring lunar cartography. Whisk repurposed as spiritual tool feels inevitable, not quirky. Risk is quiet—no pyrotechnics—but coherence and specificity make it memorable. Could swap village name without loss, hence not higher.</comment>
