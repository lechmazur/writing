<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Eli’s interior contradiction—prophetic power vs. weary guilt—drives every beat; the micro-choice to risk Lena’s autonomy for her “transposition” carries visible cost in his lowered binoculars and enigmatic resignation. Lena remains off-stage, so relationship crucible is N/A; Eli’s self-interrogation is vivid but slightly generalized in the final paragraph, keeping it just below 8.8.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each beat (fortune → lighthouse signal → Lena’s boat) links by clear therefore logic. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Eli’s conductor stance crystallizes with the felt cost of forever remaining the silent witness. One minor ellipsis: how the microdot message reaches the lamp is skimmed, but the pattern is taught early enough to waive.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The flour-dusted room, soy-saturated air, and rain-streaked window ground POV bias; the lighthouse beam as charged object constrains Eli’s final action and reconfigures meaning. Spatial choreography across water is coherent; sensory selection narrows under urgency. Slight over-reliance on visual; other senses underused.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Eli’s moral gamble to redirect Lena’s life—tightens once when he commits to the lighthouse signal. Cost is legible: he forfeits anonymity and accepts lifelong solitude. Escalation is single but sufficient under causal lens; coincidence (Lena noticing the pattern) is allowed to complicate, not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of quiet, unasked-for intervention emerges from concrete particulars; the final image of Eli lowering the binoculars offers a non-literal answer about the ethics of “help.” Subtext in the fortune’s wording and the lighthouse Morse-like pulse avoids moralizing. One soft echo—“familiar enigma” twice—barely audible.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Eli’s synesthetic metaphors (“new, hopeful note in the night’s symphony”) and sensory bias create a consistent interior texture. Compression and elision (e.g., the microdot loading) are taught early and paid off. No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates cleanly with tension.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and information-dense; figurative language is selective and purposeful. One minor loop—“familiar enigma” repeated—does not dull closure. No filter-verb stacks or mixed metaphors under pressure. Final paragraph could trim one scaffolding clause to reach 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</question>
<comment>The fortune-cookie-prophet trope is transformed through Eli’s reluctant conductor stance and Cold-War microdot tech, creating a fresh synthesis. Specificity of soy-scented clothes and three-legged-dog anecdote grounds the premise. Risky quiet ending pays off with earned melancholy; no close echoes of famous scenes.</comment>
