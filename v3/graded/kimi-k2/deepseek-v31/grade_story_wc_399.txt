<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The Line Walker’s motive—preserve the echo of wisdom—drives every micro-choice; his peripheral-vision method embodies the interior contradiction of needing to see without looking. Embodied tension in the static prickle and the will-driven dune shift shows emotion in action. The final renunciation (letting the pearl sink) costs him the clearing and the prophet’s truth, earned by prior tactics. Secondary character (prophet) applies direct pressure that alters the relationship state by the end.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each beat tightens because/therefore links—peripheral sight reveals shimmer → consecrate → prophet arrives → dune shift → sealing. Closure is a Decisive Change: the pavilion’s echo is physically removed, foreclosing further debate. Cost is legible in the final image of the pearl vanishing beneath sand. Orientation anchors who/where/when within first 100 words; no drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Marble columns’ hum, heat-haze shimmer, and kinetic parapet are vivid, selective, and constrain tactics: the parapet’s gears literally shift the dune. Micro-setting (warm sand under hand) charges the final sealing. Sensory hierarchy narrows to skin prickle and distant saddle-creak under rising pressure. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from pavilion to clearing to sinking pearl.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve whispered wisdom against single deafening truth—is signaled in paragraph one. Escalation tightens once: prophet’s arrival threatens to collapse the clearing; Line Walker’s agency (dune shift + sealing) forecloses the prophet’s path at visible cost (loss of the clearing itself). No coincidence resolves; all turns stem from protagonist tactics under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: tension between pluralistic wisdom and absolute truth. Subtext in the prophet’s “honest condescension” and the Line Walker’s refusal to look directly. Final image of the sealed pearl offers non-literal answer—some truths must be preserved by burial, not broadcast. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers about whether burial is triumph or defeat.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: “peripheral awareness” governs syntax and rhythm; sentences elongate during soft focus, tighten during consecration. Voice stays within POV lexicon; no head-hop. Dialogue sparse, subtext-rich: “You tidy up miracles into little boxes” carries condescension and thematic weight. Prose texture mirrors the character’s method—oblique, precise, never direct.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High information density: “kinetic parapet” and “veil was thin” do double duty as world-rule and metaphor. Rhythm modulates with pressure; no loops or scaffold. Metaphors are clean—no mixed vehicles. Final sentence crystallizes without overwriting. Clean grammar and pronoun tracking throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: desert mechanics as living archive, peripheral vision as ritual technology. Tropes of prophet vs guardian inverted—prophet is abrasive yet honest, guardian preserves uncertainty. Risk in quiet, non-violent resolution pays off; closure feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Specificity of “murmuring pavilion” and “kinetic parapet” anchors universals.</comment>
