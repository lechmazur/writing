<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses (logic vs. longing) play out in micro-choices like placing the glass eyes on the mosaic. The final renunciation—accepting the unsolvable—earns its cost through prior struggle. A hairline slip: “undefined loss” is named rather than dramatized, blunting the flaw’s edge.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each beat layers density until the glass-eye overlay reconfigures the mosaic’s meaning. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise—where the orchard’s “quiet, enduring life” reframes ambiguous loss. Cost is legible in the relinquishment of certainty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The cavern orchard is not backdrop but active constraint: dripping stalactites sustain the fungi, the petrified trees embody the stake. Micro-setting (mosaic stone) literally guides the final insight. One minor drift: “false moon” is introduced late without cue, but it does not disturb closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—quantify ambiguous loss—tightens once: the glass-eye overlay forces Elara to abandon the quest for a numeric answer. The price is the surrender of her original goal, visible in the soft glow of the eyes left on the stone. Pressure is coherent under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: the geometry of resilience is shown, not told, through the mosaic’s reassembly. Final image of “constant, gentle rhythm of persistence” reweights the premise without moralizing. No thematic drift; complexity is honored.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is mathematically precise yet lyric, mirroring Elara’s mind. Syntax modulates with pressure—short clauses under revelation, longer cadences in reflection. No POV leakage; perceptual signature is consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid; every sentence advances atmosphere or insight. No loops or scaffold. One near-miss: “slow, aching ambiguity” flirts with label-speak but is immediately grounded in the keeper’s embodied grief.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: mathematics of emotion reframed as geometry of absence. The glass-eye device transforms a familiar epiphany into inevitable insight. Risky lyric compression pays off in the final reconfiguration.</comment>
