<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Elara’s interiority is rich and specific—embodied in her heightened perception—while the moment she “opened her mouth and sang” carries a felt renunciation. A faint abstract tinge (“her life was one of quiet service”) costs some immediacy.</comment>

<question>2</question>
<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Closure lands cleanly as Earned Stasis: the choice to stay and sing carries permanent self-surrender. Causal chain: seashell → nexus → recognition of heritage → irrevocable embrace of duty. No orientation drift; time, place, and POV are anchored by the starlit fissure.</comment>

<question>3</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The stone arches, starlit ceiling, and acoustic properties constrain every movement and echo, shaping the climax by literally amplifying her voice. Sensory selectivity mirrors her auditory focus—canyon walls “whisper” and stone “remembers,” never generic.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.7</question>
<comment>Dominant stake is clear: understand why voices persist or vanish. Tightening occurs when the Nexus shows echoes are deliberate commemorations—knowledge that forecloses the possibility of ignoring the calling. Agency is hers: she steps forward and sings.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>9.0</question>
<comment>Theme of remembrance vs. oblivion arises wholly from the echo mechanics; final reprise (“until every stone remembered”) reframes earlier navigation-songs as sacred record. No authorial sermon—resonance is carried by image alone.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet anchored in Elara’s sensory precision; compression and rhythmic variation sustain momentum. “Her song became one with the universe’s secret song” risks a shimmer of abstraction but the closing image reattaches to the stone.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm modulates with breathless clarity; figurative language is rare, concentrated, and earned. No paraphrase loops or register drift beyond one mild echo of “history layered within each reflected note” in proximity to “histories and emotions”. </comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>9.5</grade>
<comment>The fusion of acoustics, geological memory, and inherited custodianship feels organic and non-derivative; every trope (prophetic shell, secret nexus) is transformed through character-specific acoustical mythology. Bold conceptual commitment without gimmickry.</comment>
