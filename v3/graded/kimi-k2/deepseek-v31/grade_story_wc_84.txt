<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her “perpetually surprised” face is re-weighted in the final awe—but her shift from contract to sacred duty is asserted more than dramatized; no contradictory impulse is staged mid-scene, so the change feels lightly earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the harmonic “song” reweights the entire quest from data to felt belonging. Causal chain (chip→gap→frequency) is tight; cost is the irreversible shift in Elara’s perception—felt but could be sharper on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Observatory’s decay and telescope mechanics are sensuously specific and constrain every move; the brass bar and projected star trails directly enable the climax. Light/dust imagery threads through beats, charging the final image without overwriting.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“decode the frequency of belonging”—is signaled early and tightened once when the telescope pivots downward, foreclosing the aerial/drone path. Cost is conceptual (loss of prior certainty) rather than visceral, but legible under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of severed planetary harmony emerges through concrete objects (chip as tuning fork) and final sensory inversion; no moralizing. The ending’s non-literal “song” reweights earlier star maps without explicit statement, leaving resonant ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is precise, tactile, and drone-pilot specific—“three kilometers up,” “celestial slowness.” Rhythm modulates with pressure; no head-hop. Compression in the final paragraph is purposeful and pays off the taught pattern of synesthetic shift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is clean, vivid, and propulsive; figurative language is selective (“slow-motion fireworks”). One minor loop—“brilliant dimness” twice—doesn’t dull momentum. High information density with no filter-verb clusters.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of obsolete tech (type matrix) and cosmic resonance; the drone-pilot POV reframes astrophysical belonging as somatic listening. Risky inversion of telescope from sky to floor pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
