<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—career skeptic vs. secret believer—drives every beat; the tactile habit of thumb on shell and the micro-choice to bow the cello embody her pivot. Late-life urgency is palpable, yet the “gloomy cheerfulness” label edges toward diagnostic shorthand, capping the score just below 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each object (compass, shell, cello) layers density until the final hum reconfigures meaning. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—Elara’s lifelong stance inverted—with the felt cost of her remaining days now pledged to retelling. No causality breaks; ellipsis between bow-stroke and cosmic flood is taught by the shell’s prior glow.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The observatory’s dust-choked dome and the cello’s single string act as micro-settings that constrain action; the open dome literally gathers the Signal. Sensory detail is selective—dust on tears, bone-deep hum—anchoring POV. While vivid, the cliff itself is generic backdrop, keeping the score below 9.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decode the Signal—tightens when the hum becomes an alien archive, forcing Elara to renounce debunking. The cost is the burden of final-days testimony; escalation is one decisive intensification under Accumulative lens. Agency is clear: her bow-stroke triggers the irreversible revelation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: the universe tells stories, not riddles. The cello’s shift from mute wood to cosmic receiver reweights every prior myth-busted case without moralizing. Subtext in the shell’s star-paint and Leo’s remembered voice carries the emotional aftereffect.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is distinct—precise, skeptical, yet lyric when describing resonance. Free-indirect style stays clean; no head-hop. Occasional elevated diction (“profound satisfaction,” “celestial body has a hum”) slightly overshoots Elara’s pragmatic lexicon under pressure, preventing 9+.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; no loops or scaffold. One mixed metaphor—“gloomy cheerfulness”—is minor. Sentence variety propels the final cadence shift from dust to cosmic hush.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The myth-buster who must become myth-keeper is a fresh inversion; the cello-shell receiver feels inevitable yet wholly new. Specificity of the binary-star ocean and bone-resonant archive grounds the wonder. Risk in cosmic scope at micro-length pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
