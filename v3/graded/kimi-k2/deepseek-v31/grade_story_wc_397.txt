<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the shift from pain-erased to hyper-sensitive is dramatized through tactile work and the parasol tip. Motivation evolves credibly from seeking death to seeking the sound of endings, but the final beat of “freedom” feels slightly abstract—cost is implied rather than viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the ice-shelf sigh reconfigures Elara’s stance, turning the parasol tip from relic to talisman. Accumulative/Textural lens holds; each shard (clinic, trawling, blizzard) layers texture until the final cadence shift. One transition (clinic→boat) is legible and taught early.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Drift-ice marina and storm-bound boat are rendered with selective sensory detail that constrains action—cold, wind, groaning hull. The parasol tip functions as micro-setting/object, charging the final image. Spatial choreography remains coherent across shards.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“learn the sound of approaching endings”—is signaled early and tightened by each beat: parasol tip (small ending), blizzard (large ending). Agency is attention/renunciation rather than overt action; cost is conceptual but legible in the final silence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: endings as quiet state-changes, not cataclysms. Subtext resides in the parasol’s journey and the ice’s sigh; no moralizing. Final image reweights prior material without explicit statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice is consistent, with perceptual signature (“windborne solace,” “drift-ice marina of the mind”). Syntax modulates with pressure; no head-hopping. Compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet clear; figurative language is purposeful and pattern-taught. No loops or scaffold. Rhythm breathes with scene needs; final paragraph achieves charged poise without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Euthanasia-tourist premise is transformed through post-procedure sensory awakening and volunteer debris-trawling. Synthesis feels inevitable; risk in quiet lyric closure pays off. No derivative echoes.</comment>
