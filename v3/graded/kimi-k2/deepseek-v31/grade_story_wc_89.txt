<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Alaric’s interiority is embodied and specific—his paradoxical steadiness under moonlight, the weight of the fortune in his palm—but the bond with Kael is told more than dramatized; we feel the loss yet never see the living friendship under pressure. The final choice to step into memory is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: memory → spices → rift → altered past → remade present. Closure is a decisive change with felt cost—timeline splinters, Alaric is “remade,” Kael coalesces. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Orchard, moonlight, oldest tree, and spices are vivid and selective; the tree’s fruit “shone like captured stars” charges the final image when Kael re-forms there. Micro-setting (fortune slip, spice pouch) constrains choice and texture.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reforge bond beyond death—signaled early. Escalation: spices ignite memory, rift opens, past is altered, timeline re-knits. Cost is legible: Alaric is “remade,” implying irreversible self-change.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of “past as doorway” emerges organically through action; fortune reweights from regret to agency. Final image of Kael coalescing offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet grounded; perceptual signature filters moonlight, scent, and memory through Alaric’s quiet urgency. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; figurative language (“silver fire,” “river of time”) is purposeful and paid off. No loops or scaffold; rhythm modulates with beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Familiar time-rewind trope is transformed by sensory alchemy and beast-whisperer vocation; spices as mnemonic catalyst feel fresh. Risky second-person memory dive lands cleanly.</comment>
