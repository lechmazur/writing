<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elian’s quiet need to “learn the rhythm of repair” is embodied in tactile micro-choices—sifting gears, uncapping moonlight—but interior contradiction is thin; the final alignment feels inevitable rather than wrested from genuine struggle. Cost is present yet abstract (a degree of warmth, a settled memory), not dramatized on his body or future. Still, the motive stays coherent and drives every beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the orrery’s turn reconfigures time itself, the cost a subtle thaw in the perpetual morning. Causal chain (prophecy → eclipse oil → moon-shadow gear) holds; no orientation debt. One meaningful tightening—uncapping the vial—suffices under the Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The frozen library’s cold paper scent and crystalline dust are filtered through Elian’s locksmith gaze; the hall of mirrors multiplies his failures and then his harmony, constraining tactics by forcing visual confrontation with error. Final warmth bleeding through ice recharges the opening chill with earned change.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“a stutter in time itself”—is signaled early and tightened by each failed gear until the moonlight vial offers the single viable path. Agency remains high; coincidence never rescues. Cost is conceptual (time restored, personal solitude intact) rather than visceral, slightly softening the felt price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme of repair-as-alignment emerges from concrete action: gears, mirrors, moonlight. The final image—distant morning finally arriving—reweights the driftwood nostalgia from loss to quiet memory without moralizing. Subtext operates in silence and mirrored multiplicity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is hushed, precise, slightly archaic—“driftwood nostalgia,” “crystal cathedral”—matching the librarian-locksmith who works only during eclipses. Syntax lengthens in calm, shortens under pressure; no head-hopping or register drift. Distinct perceptual signature throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet textured: “shower of crystalline dust,” “soft hush of a distant morning.” No loops, no mixed metaphors. Information density high; each sentence advances image or choice. Minor elevation in diction stays within Elian’s artisanal lexicon.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Familiar tropes—prophecy, frozen library, hall of mirrors—are transformed through the locksmith’s tactile craft and eclipse-specific moonlight. The synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight; no close echoes of famous scenes. Quiet risk in choosing alignment over spectacle pays off.</comment>
