<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas’s interiority is vivid and embodied—his “tranquilly perceptive” nature is dramatized through micro-choices like leaving water for the farmer-ghost. The final renunciation (accepting lifelong silence as caretaker) is earned and carries visible cost. Minor slip: the woman-ghost’s urgency is slightly abstract, muting the stakes of her plea.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the stained-glass box becomes a “silent sermon,” crystallizing Silas’s new covenant. Causality is Accumulative/Textural—each ghostly interaction layers density until the box reweights the premise. Cost is legible in the final image of perpetual vigilance. No orientation drift; lens holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The beekeeping oasis is tactile—dust, rot, cool glass—yet never catalogued. The stained-glass box functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: its panels force Silas to accept custodianship. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered. One minor spatial vagueness: “beside the window” could track cleaner.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserve unspoken stories—tightens when the woman-ghost’s gaze pressures Silas to decipher the box. Escalation is one deepening, not multiple reversals, fitting the Accumulative lens. Cost is felt in the final stance of endless guardianship. Ghostly urgency could be sharper to push higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of stewardship versus speech emerges through image and silence; the box’s final placement is a non-literal answer to “how does memory survive?” Subtext in ghost gestures avoids moralizing. Final resonance is earned, not asserted. No thematic drift.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is hushed, lyrical, consistent with a recluse who “preferred silence.” Syntax modulates with emotional pressure—long sentences for contemplation, fragments for discovery. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is distinct. One near-cliché (“stubborn patch of green defiance”) barely grazes the texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and dense—each sentence advances story or atmosphere. No loops or scaffold. Figurative language is spare and purposeful. One mixed metaphor (“pressure against Silas’s calm”) is minor and doesn’t cloud closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Post-apocalyptic beekeeper tending ghosts via stained-glass confessions is fresh, yet inevitable in hindsight. The covenant concept reconfigures familiar tropes into a quiet elegy. Risk-taking (entire plot carried by silence and implication) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
