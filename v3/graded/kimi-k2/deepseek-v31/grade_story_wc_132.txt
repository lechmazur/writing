<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aris’s interior contradiction—control vs surrender—is embodied in micro-choices (opening vents, turning off systems) and culminates in visible renunciation. The shift from data tablet to blank screen carries felt cost. Minor slip: “reluctant metamorphosis” is named rather than dramatized in body.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Aris forsakes predictive modeling for participatory witnessing, cost legible in the dark tablet and redesigned nursery. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—storm density reweights stakes until the final image of leaf under glass crystallizes the reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Greenhouse, storm, and linden leaf constrain every choice; mossy trellis trembles with anticipation, charging the final sketch. Sensory hierarchy (ozone, wet earth) filters through Aris’s botanist gaze. One hairline slip: “half a mile away” is an unmotivated precision.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will Aris master or join plant behavior—tightens when he disables control systems; storm pressure forces stance crystallization. Cost is visible: loss of predictive certainty, blank tablet. No reversals needed; single deepening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: control vs dialogue, data vs presence. Linden leaf’s journey from anomaly to testament reweights the premise without moralizing. Final image offers resonant non-literal answer—leaf under glass as archive of surrender.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature—botanical precision, measured syntax, storm-lit lyricism—remains coherent. No dialogue; interior voice modulates with pressure. Occasional elevated diction (“circuitously sincere”) slightly strains register but reads intentional.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, high-density; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is selective and purposeful (“dark bruise against the grey sky”). One mixed metaphor—“root taking hold” inside man—barely grazes closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: plant behavior as epistemology, storm as pedagogy. Avoids eco-parable cliché by grounding stakes in one man’s method. Risky quiet ending pays off; transformation test passes—story would collapse without this specific nursery and storm.</comment>
