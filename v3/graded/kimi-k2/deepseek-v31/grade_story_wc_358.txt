<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vale’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her pulse quickens, her boots echo, her fingers brush the patch—yet the “cultivate foresight” motive is asserted more than dramatized until the final transmission. The contradictory impulse (observe vs. intervene) is present but compressed; the cost of staying to transmit is felt but not fully foreshadowed by prior micro-choices. Still, her perceptual signature is sharp and consistent.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The causal chain is tight: silence → wind anomaly → patch → recognition of engineered convergence → frantic transmission. Closure lands as a Decisive Change: Vale pivots from observer to active disruptor, with the cost of standing alone in the “quiet storm.” One minor ellipsis—how she instantly knows counter-frequency tactics—keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The port’s steel labyrinth is rendered with tactile specificity—damp asphalt, strobing shadows, vacuum-straight dust streams—and the clearing’s “knot of absolute calm” becomes the charged micro-setting that constrains her final stance. Spatial choreography is clean; the environment actively shapes tactics. Could use one more sensory layer (smell, temperature) for 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prevent a city-scale recreation of the Arcadia crash—is signaled by the patch and escalates through each beat. The tightening occurs when Vale realizes the port is being “pulled into being” and chooses to transmit countermeasures; the cost is her exposure to the nascent event. Pressure is coherent and causally driven.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of foresight-as-intervention emerges organically from the investigator’s arc; the patch reweights from clue to symbolic anchor without overt statement. Subtext in the disciplined air and disciplined silence resonates. Final image of her words as “the only weapon” crystallizes the theme without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is precise, slightly clinical, matching an investigator’s perceptual bias; diction like “hazy precision” and “physics of doom” is controlled and purposeful. No dialogue, so no register drift. Rhythm accelerates under pressure; final paragraph’s cadence mirrors the pulsing shimmer. One near-repeat—“cultivate foresight in action” twice—dulls the edge slightly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and propulsive; sentences advance multiple functions. Occasional elevated phrasing (“temporally, drawing echoes”) risks register drift but stays within Vale’s trained lexicon. No loops or scaffold; one mixed metaphor—“void and a plenum”—is minor. High information density maintained.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The premise—an accident investigator discovering a port being engineered into a past crash—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The Arcadia patch as seed-object is a sharp, non-obvious device. Risky temporal mechanics are handled without exposition dumps. Specificity of the steel labyrinth and disciplined air grounds the speculative element.</comment>
