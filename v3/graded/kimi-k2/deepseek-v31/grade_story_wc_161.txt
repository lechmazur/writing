<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—her need to hide versus her need to transmit—are embodied in the meteorite ritual and the final release of Argos. The forged past and the real stone create a credible internal fracture that charges every micro-choice. The shift from self-protection to sacrificial transmission is earned and costly. Only the pigeon’s interiority is asserted rather than shown, a minor slip.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Argos’s flight crystallizes Elara’s new stance, foreclosing her hiding forever. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each dust-mote reading and paper echo layers density until the final image reweights the premise. Causality is tight: the tipped meteorite triggers the folio, which triggers the pigeon release. Cost is legible in her cracked whisper and the vanishing bird.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The attic’s decaying paper air and single skylight beam are selective, sensory, and purposeful; they constrain the balancing ritual and later spotlight the folio. Spatial choreography is clean—meteorite, eagle, books, cage all track. The setting quietly mirrors internal rot and eventual flight. It does not quite constrain the final choice, capping it below 9.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve or release the lost songs—is signaled early and tightens once when the folio appears. The pressure deepens through Accumulative density rather than causal reversals, forcing a visible trade-off: safety versus transmission. The cost is felt when Argos disappears. One meaningful intensification suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of preservation versus transmission emerges organically from paper, pigeons, and meteorite; no direct statement intrudes. The final image of the vanishing bird reweights the earlier balancing act into a quiet Conceptual Repricing: equilibrium now means letting go. Subtext in the ribboned folio and cracked voice carries the emotional aftereffect without sentimentality.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded, with a perceptual signature attuned to dust motes, glue scent, and the cold weight of Mars rock. Syntax modulates with emotional intensity—long, breath-held sentences during balancing, then clipped release. No head-hopping; POV remains tightly interior. Only the pigeon’s “understanding” eye edges toward ventriloquism.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; each sentence layers scent, texture, or motion without redundancy. Figurative language is selective—“frantic galaxy of dust motes” teaches the pattern and pays off. No loops, scaffold, or register drift. The final paragraph’s cadence mirrors the bird’s lift, achieving rhythmic closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of meteorite-as-touchstone, pigeon-post-as-memory, and attic-as-cocoon feels inevitable yet fresh. The transformation of “balance” from literal stone act to existential stance is non-obvious and earned. Specificity—Mars chip, rice-paper scroll, brass eagle—anchors universals. Risk in quiet lyricism heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
