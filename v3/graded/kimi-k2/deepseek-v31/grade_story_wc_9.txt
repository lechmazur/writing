<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory hunger to recover lost time while stealing every second she chases is embodied in micro-gesture (trembling hands, breath-sip of starlight). The birth trauma is the engine—every card flip and ink swirl is shadow-cost: absence from her infant. Interiority feels lived-in (“each second… a particle of sand lost”).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density intensifies as the cracked saucer evolves from conduit of regret into window of recovered memory, reweighting the premise with visible cost. Resolution is Earned Stasis—the choice to unfasten the lock and embrace “all that ever would be” forecloses escape to the time-cavern she sought.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The glade, the saucer, the tattoo-map, the air itself—all function as micro-settings that press choices. The cloud’s “choking beauty” literally robs breath (physical cost) and the saucer’s fracture shifts from wound to mirror, charging final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—retrieving stolen moments—escalates via Elara’s agency: refusing the cosmic repentance repository, choosing the intimate one. Cost: recognition that the “lost” time became the world she feared to leave. One tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of accumulated micro-moments versus abstract redemption emerges non-literal in final tableau: “all the lost moments… enriching its choking beauty.” The birthday tablecloth memory rebirth is earned via lived grief, no moralising.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Controlled lyric third-person that flirts with poetry but never loses coherence; perceptual signature consistent (“onyx-ink cartomancer… permanent map”). Syntax modulates with emotional tides—long coils of clause under regret, tighter fragments under revelation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm flows without loops; dense sensory verbs carry double duty. Zero scaffold; rare modifiers feel precise: “choking beauty,” “inky river.” No metaphors contradict physical logic.</comment>
<question>8</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Cartomantic time-harvesting cloudscape plus hand-traced ancestral cloth is fresh synthesis. Avoids fortune-teller trope clichés; intimate motherhood lens defamiliarizes lofty quest. Risk pays without obscuring clarity.</comment>
