<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the bookmark ritual and glass-blowing monologue reveal contradictory impulses (guilt vs creation). The final renunciation is earned and carries visible cost. Minor slip: “weighty lightness” edges toward label-speak at the climax.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: thawing ice and bookmark abandonment form a charged poise that reweights the premise. Closure lands on-page with felt cost (“she did not look back”). Orientation is clear by 120 words; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Control-room decay is rendered through selective sensory detail (drip, groan, shatter) that mirrors internal thaw. The melting ice constrains timing and charges the final image. Micro-setting (bookmark on console) functions as anchor and pivot.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—craft safe zones while shedding guilt—tightens once via bookmark abandonment. Pressure escalates as melt accelerates, forcing the choice. Cost is legible: relinquishing token and past. One meaningful turn suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of renewal-through-renunciation emerges organically from glass spheres and thawing ruin. Final image reweights prior guilt without moralizing. Subtext in bookmark’s frayed edges and ice shards resonates cleanly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct lyric texture—measured cadence, glassblower’s perceptual bias—remains consistent. Dramatic monologue fits solitary ritual; no head-hopping. Minor register drift in “赋予 weight” phrase, but forgivable under experimental tolerance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is lean and rhythmic; figurative language is sparse and purposeful. No loops or scaffold. One mixed metaphor (“chorus for what was beginning”) near end, but clarity intact. High density without clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: post-catastrophe glassblower using thaw as kiln and absolution. Bookmark-as-guilt-token and spheres-as-micro-sanctuaries feel inevitable. Risk-taking (solitary monologue, lyric mode) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
