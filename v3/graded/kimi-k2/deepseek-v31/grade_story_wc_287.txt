<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is embodied and specific; the lockmaster’s gauge as inherited trowel anchors motive and micro-choices. The “wistfully pragmatic” stance is dramatized through the aeration ritual and mirror-lighting, not stated. A credible renunciation (the petal’s end → new blooming) closes the arc with felt cost. Minor slip: Mr. Gable’s and Mrs. Lin’s interior shifts are inferred rather than embodied, keeping score just below 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single-scene structure under Accumulative/Textural lens: each mirrored beam tightens the communal hush into shared possibility. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—rose death transmuted into collective light—cost legible in the “quivering hush” now “full of potential.” Orientation and causality are clean; no lens drift. One micro-turn (petal drop → light bridge) suffices.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fire-escape micro-kingdom, moonlit harbor, and mirrored shard are selective and purposeful; each constrains Elara’s tactics. The gauge-tooth as micro-setting tool and the mirrored fragment as light-bridge charge the final image. Sensory economy favors tactile and visual immediacy without cataloging. Slight over-reliance on visual keeps it from 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: transform communal gloom into shared light. Pressure escalates via rhythmic aeration and successive mirror flashes; each act narrows the option to retreat. Cost is the irrevocable loss of the rose and the exposure of her perch. Agency is continuous; coincidence absent. Could be sharper if one neighbor’s reaction carried higher stakes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of quiet defiance through micro-beauty emerges from action and image, never asserted. Subtext lives in the mirrored beams and the lockmaster’s gauge repurposed for life. Final image reweights the rose’s death into communal blooming without moralizing. Avoids tidy binaries; ambiguity lingers in the harbor’s indifference.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited is stable; perceptual signature is tactile and horticultural. Syntax mirrors the “oars in water” cadence during aeration. No dialogue, so voice coherence rests on interior texture, which holds. Occasional elevated diction (“luminous harbor,” “crimson sigh”) slightly dilutes the grounded POV.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; figurative language is disciplined. No loops, no scaffold. Sentence rhythm modulates with task: longer for reflection, clipped for action. One mixed metaphor—“sheet of shimmering mercury under the moon”—is minor. High information ratio; every line advances image or motive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: lockmaster’s gauge as gardener’s trowel and key to human locks. Rose-petal death → light-bridge transformation feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Specificity of fire-escape micro-garden and mirrored shard resists generic uplift. Risk in quiet lyricism pays off; no derivative echo.</comment>
