<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias’s contradictory impulses—self-loathing versus the need to matter—are embodied in the pillbox ritual and the choice to vouchsafe. The burned face as credential is a sharp status lever with the runner. Final renunciation of ghosthood is earned and costly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each beat tightens because/therefore links from spotting the cipher to the climactic decision to record it on the pillbox. Closure is a decisive change—Elias steps back into the game—with the felt cost of exposure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mist, bluff, and melting snow are not backdrop; they dictate stealth, visibility, and the cipher’s mortality. The pillbox micro-setting becomes the final recording surface, charging the last image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether Elias will risk his remnant life for a stranger’s warning—escalates cleanly. The snow-cipher’s imminent erasure tightens the screw; vouchsafing is the irreversible act that forecloses anonymity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of “fixing what’s broken” emerges through action: the pillbox repurposed, the burned man reclaiming agency. Final image reframes courage as choice, not place, without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is weathered, precise, and tactile—“silver hush,” “waxy, sculpted testament.” Free indirect style stays locked to Elias’s damaged sensorium; dialogue is sparse but subtext-laden.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet lyrical; no loops or scaffold. Metaphors serve pressure—“mist coiling like tame serpents” mirrors Elias’s wary control. Rhythm accelerates naturally down the slope.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The snow-cipher as disposable dead-drop feels fresh; the burned spy’s redemption arc is inverted—he saves another, not himself. Specificity of pillbox powder as recording medium is ingenious.</comment>
