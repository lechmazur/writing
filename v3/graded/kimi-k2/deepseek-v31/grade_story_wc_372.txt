<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Elara’s motivation and interiority remain steady—too steady. The slide catalyzes discovery, but her stance never cracks or pivots under pressure; no new knowledge rewrites her hierarchy of values, only reaffirms them. The result feels like competent stewardship rather than character revelation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Causal chain exists (slide–measure–vision–insight) yet resolves without a decisive alteration or felt renunciation; the library’s resurrection remains potential rather than performed. Closure lands as conceptual repricing—a hopeful re-labeling of stasis—missing the acute cost that would push this toward publishable impact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The crystalline spires, frostbite air, and resonant light filter gorgeously through Elara’s perception. Crucially, the reimagined Great Hall and the slide’s internal geometry physically reconfigure stakes (“a recipe for resurrection”), proving the setting is not mere wallpaper.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>A single dominant stake—retrieve meaning before oblivion—is clear early, and the slide discovery delivers a visible pivot. However, the tightening is more intellectual revelation than visceral forfeiture; the price paid is oblique (slide depletion) and doesn’t recalibrate Elara’s next action on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme coheres organically around preservation as rekindling custodianship rather than archiving; no moralizing line intrudes. The luminous vows silently reprice all foregoing entropy, turning decay into dormant agency. An earned, resonant answer—no tidy epiphany needed.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited remains crystalline, never seeping beyond Elara’s ken. Syntax flexes with deliberate rhythm—“quartz hush,” “velvet-wrapped parcel”—yet avoids purple drift. Voice stays taut, precise, and character-particular; one hairline slip in filter verbs (“she knew”) barely grazes the final cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose sparkles: high density, no paraphrase loops, varied cadences. The sole minor scaffold appears in three contiguous sentences beginning with “She...” during the resonator beat, but momentum sustains. Overall, ear test succeeds; a single cosmetic flaw keeps it shy of the 9+ quick gate.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The crystalline guardian archive and love-powered beacon concept feel fresh, marrying cosmic scale to intimate caretaking. Transformation is intrinsic: a trope of lost knowledge becomes a trope of dormant heart. Risk resides in the quiet reversal rather than sensational twist, and it lands with clear, cohesive payoff.</comment>
