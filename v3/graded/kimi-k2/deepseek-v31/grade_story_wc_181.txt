<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s bewilderment is embodied (shaking hands, locking the door) and her decisive micro-choice to press the shell to her temple launches the inciting beat. The internal conflict between archival duty and forbidden curiosity rotates on concrete action. Motivation survives the brief page length, though external behavior is mostly limited to one spatial leash.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds—because/therefore chain from bathroom lock → astral orchard → lineage inheritance. Closure offers a Decisive Change: Elara steps toward forging a new bloodline, cost is the instant breaking of archival mandate. No orientation errors land within the 600-word window.</comment>
<question>3</grade>7.9</grade><comment>Asteroid orchard is evoked in compressed but vivid sensory bursts; the micro-setting constrains her sole action (astro-navigation mapping). Smoke-vacuum perfume and galaxy-fruit fill the body-as-setting slot. Strong specificity without excess word budget.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8</4.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—inherit orchard ownership—escalates when Elara discovers she is now the active heir, cost is immediate professional ruin. No extra reversals needed; a single turn suffices in this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of forbidden knowledge is rendered via concrete discovery, not preaching. The final astral blossom image serves non-literal reconfiguration without moralizing. Some reader reflection invited but well-earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice is reliably first-person, rhythm tightens under pressure (“roaring symphony”), elision taught early. Bathroom self-dialogue stays within lexicon; no filter verbs stall momentum.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density (“cosmic genesis”) fits lyric mode. Avoids purple overload; sensory compression supports propulsion. Metaphors stay coherent under vault-level light.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Pistachio shell → cosmos syntheses is specific, non-obvious. Fresh twist is pistachio shell as vessel for orchard memory. Risk of lyric-compression heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
