<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s skeptical drive is embodied in every micro-choice—measuring, resisting, then re-calibrating after the amber anomaly. The shift from data-hunger to acceptance of ineffable release is earned through the walk itself, not stated. Cost is visible: she abandons the safety of pure skepticism. Interiority stays concrete, never lapses into therapy-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the tower is inert, the pilgrimage is the message. Causal linkage—each footfall rewrites her stance—holds under Accumulative/Textural lens. The final image of her turning back down the same path crystallizes the before/after with felt cost: she now carries the amber, not as specimen but as grace. No orientation drift; anchors are clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The rainwashed tower, bronze-quiet air, and pollen-dusted footprints are filtered through Elara’s scientific gaze, constraining her readings and later her emotional shift. The fly amber functions as micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-biased; no static cataloguing. Spatial choreography is clean; the path’s coil is tracked consistently.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding the chemistry of homecoming—tightens when data converge on the tower’s inertness, forcing a conceptual reversal. Escalation is one deepening under Accumulative lens: each sensory input layers until release is the only remaining option. Cost is the forfeiture of her former epistemological armor. Agency remains hers; coincidence never rescues.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of release versus stasis emerges from the amber metaphor and the pilgrimage pattern; no explicit moralizing. Subtext in the woman’s gentle question and Elara’s silent answer carries the weight. Final image reweights the premise: homecoming is internal surrender, not arrival. Complexity is preserved—she remains a scientist, merely retooled.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Voice is crisp, analytical yet lyric, matching Elara’s perceptual signature: “bronze quiet,” “chemistry of letting go.” Compression is purposeful; no filler. Dialogue is minimal but subtext-rich. POV stays tight; no head-hop or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, information-dense. Metaphors are precise and integrated (“fossilized moment”). No loops, scaffold, or mixed vehicles. Sentence variety supports the breathing arc of ascent and descent. Clean mechanics.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: first-contact story reframed as secular pilgrimage whose only technology is mindfulness. The amber’s reprise feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risky inversion—aliens offer grief ritual, not transcendence—pays off. Specificity throughout prevents trope drift.</comment>
