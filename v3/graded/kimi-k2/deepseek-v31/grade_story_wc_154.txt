<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—precise silence vs fragile faith—grounds every beat; the coral moment crystallizes motive and cost. PTSD as prison is embodied, not labeled. The final renunciation (old wound grafted with new meaning) is earned by the coral pattern and Kaito beat. Minor: “shrewdly innocent” stays verbal, never tripping a visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: coral pattern taught early, reweighted at closure. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration—charged poise of “grafted with new, quiet meaning” carries felt cost. One clean shard transition (OR → memory → OR) stays legible. No orientation drift; anchors land within 120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mist atrium, OR chill, coral fragment—all constrain choice and reappear in the final image. Sensory selection (bleach, damp marble, porous weight) is POV-filtered and purposeful. Spatial coherence holds across shards. Environment never stalls momentum; it guides hand-to-pocket and memory trigger.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can terror be given shape and thus loosened? Pressure tightens once—coral pattern moves from Kaito’s cast to surgical map, narrowing options to experimental surgery. Cost is the irreversible neural graft; price is legible in the “quiet silence” that replaces paralyzing charge. No false escalation; single deepening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges: translation as re-mapping trauma; coral as lexicon. Subtext lives in gesture—child tracing coral, adult offering it back. Final image reweights the premise without moralizing. No thematic drift; every motif returns charged.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; “slow, cold tide” and “lotus-hearted ache” teach the pattern early. Syntax modulates with depth of anesthesia. No head-hopping; focalization stays locked to Elara. Compression (“her final sight…”) is purposeful and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or pressure. Figurative language is sparse, never muddled. High information density: “neural lightning” compresses PTSD physiology. Final paragraph breathes, matching post-surgical calm. Clean mechanics throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Premise—child’s cast as encryption key for adult brain surgery—is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Coral fractal as neural map synthesizes biology and trauma translation. Specificity (Pacific conflict zone, brain coral) grounds universals. Risky structure (anesthetic frame + memory shard) heightens meaning without gimmickry.</comment>
