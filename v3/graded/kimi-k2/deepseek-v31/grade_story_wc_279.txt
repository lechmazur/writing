<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses—whimsy vs. despair—play out in the tactile act of sweeping sand and pressing the tile. The final renunciation (scattering the mandala) is earned by the sonic epiphany and carries visible cost. Minor slip: the philosopher’s pressure is more thematic foil than crucible, so relationship dynamics remain under-used.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the emergent song reweights the Unlearning from void to possibility, with the cost of permanent uncertainty. Causal chain holds—tile discovery → sonic revelation → mandala release—under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is swift; no teleporting props.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The grotto’s mist, curved walls, and residual tile energy constrain every choice and charge the final sonic image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (“faded lilac,” “wet stone”). Micro-setting (tile fragment) functions as setting extension that alters acoustics and stakes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—find meaning amid collapse—is signaled early and tightened when the hush congeals into listenable pattern. One decisive intensification: tile activation turns silence into polyphonic pressure, forcing Elara’s renunciation. Cost is conceptual but legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: meaning is relational, temporary, made from fragments. No moralizing; the final image of scattered sand and new whisper carries non-literal resonance. Subtext in the philosopher’s aborted argument and Elara’s wordless “Listen” deepens complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet grounded in Elara’s perceptual quirks (“permanent rainbow” fingers, “faded lilac” mist). Syntax modulates with pressure—long, fluid sentences in calm, clipped fragments at the sonic climax. No head-hopping; POV remains intimate and consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet clear; each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and conceptual work. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is purposeful. Minor elevated diction (“confluence,” “resonant hum”) fits the heightened moment without register drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: chalk artist + Unlearning + whispering grotto yields a non-obvious meditation on impermanence as generative. The tile fragment’s acoustic payoff feels inevitable yet surprising. Risky lyric compression pays off without obscuring closure.</comment>
