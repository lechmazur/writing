<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is precise—her “thistled calm” is embodied in the tactile ritual of copying scores—but the leap from passive listener to active transmitter is slightly under-dramatized; we see the crystallized motivation (“teach the dust”) more than the moment it crystallizes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the final broadcast reweights the premise from famine to quiet revolution, cost paid in nightly vigil and the irreversible shift from copyist to author. Causal chain holds under Accumulative/Textural lens—each cloaking session layers density until the dust “speaks.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The “ember alcove” and radio glow anchor every beat; the conservatory’s mist and crumbling brick supply the dust, constraining where she can search. Micro-setting (slate, velvet pouch) doubles as tool and talisman, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore story to a silenced world—tightens through each cloaking session; the cost is time, secrecy, and the irrevocable shift in identity. One clear deepening: the dust’s first whispered tale proves the tactic viable, foreclosing retreat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of quiet resistance emerges from the accretion of small acts; the final broadcast reframes silence not as absence but as fertile ground. No moralizing—just the charged image of green glow and luminous dust seeding the night.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is restrained, exact, mirroring a copyist’s precision; sensory filter favors texture over spectacle. Rhythm modulates with tension—static hiss, hummed cello—without head-hop or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet textured; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language (“luminous dust drinks the light”) is sparse, purposeful, and paid off. Line-level craft supports momentum without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Familiar post-apocalyptic famine trope is inverted: the savior is a meticulous copyist using obsolete tech and poetic dust. The synthesis feels inevitable—lyrics as map, cloaking as pedagogy—yet non-obvious.</comment>
