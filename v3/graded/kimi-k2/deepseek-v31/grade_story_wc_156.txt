<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s curiosity and “methodically playful” trait are embodied in tactile choices—angling the nickel, decoding the dome—yet her interiority stays surface-level; the final renunciation (“traded certainty”) is earned but the cost feels abstract rather than viscerally personal.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the single pure note crystallizes curiosity over certainty with conceptual cost. Causal chain (coin → mural → dome) is tight; only the off-stage carver weakens full agency.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The seashell conservatory and sound-wave garden are vivid, selective, and directly constrain tactics (angled echoes unlock layers). Micro-setting of the nickel-as-tool charges the final image; no orientation drift.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—curiosity vs. certainty—tightens through each acoustic discovery; the final note forecloses the restoration path. Pressure is coherent but external (carver’s puzzle) more than internally compelled.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: knowledge as living inquiry versus dead certainty. Subtext in the nickel’s spiral ear and the mural’s hidden score avoids moralizing; final image reweights premise without statement.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited voice is consistent, with lyrical compression that teaches its pattern early. Sensory diction (“powdered ghosts,” “low thrum”) is character-filtered; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and propulsive; figurative language is purposeful, never muddled. Occasional poetic lift (“perpetual, low symphony”) risks overwriting but stays controlled; no loops or artifacts.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Acoustic archaeology via carved coin and sonic fresco is fresh, non-obvious, and fully committed. Risk-taking in structure (sound-as-plot) heightens stakes without gimmickry; transformation test passed.</comment>
