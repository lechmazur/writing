<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kaelen’s interiority is vivid—his “bones” registering the ice’s wrongness—and his micro-choice to listen rather than force the horn shows earned growth. The final quiet triumph carries visible cost: the sunset’s extinction and the tower’s groan. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, so the 9+ quick test is narrowly missed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the ice’s silence is a felt, conceptual cost under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality holds—each adjustment to the horn tightens the sonic weave until the ice “clicks” into rest. No orientation debt; anchors are clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina is not backdrop; its groans and shifting plates physically constrain Kaelen’s tactics and charge the final image of “soft, clicking harmony.” Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered. One hairline slip: “fleshly ethereal” momentarily lifts register above the rest.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—protect the artifact by stilling the ice—is signaled early and escalates through one decisive tightening: the shift from aggressive command to harmonic joining. The price is the sunset’s death and the tower’s strain. Agency drives every beat; coincidence never rescues.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of sonic absolution emerges organically from the ice’s “ancient cold” and Kaelen’s engineered empathy. The final image reweights the premise: silence is not absence but a shared song. No moralizing; resonance is earned through embodied struggle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is distinct—precise engineering diction braided with lyrical perception (“azure engineer’s coat,” “fleshly ethereal”). Rhythm modulates with pressure; no head-hopping. One minor cadence echo (“groaned…groaned”) but it serves pattern.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is lean yet textured; every sentence advances stakes or atmosphere. No loops, no mixed metaphors. One elevated phrase (“fleshly ethereal”) momentarily jars but does not obscure the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The fusion of cryogenic engineering with sonic mysticism feels inevitable and fresh. The “crypt keeper’s key” repurposed as tuning fork for silence is a non-obvious synthesis that reconfigures genre expectations without gimmickry.</comment>
