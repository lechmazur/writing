<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority shows authentic, layered motives—the search for truth as both obsession and self-examination—and his final crystallizing realization is emotionally earned. Voice is distinct, but secondary setting cues limit relationship interplay. Overall depth strong for single POV.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure satisfies lens test: a single, earned shift from “seeking legend” to “being summoned,” paid for with the tapestry image. Cause-effect is tight; late sun-cue reveals could be signaled earlier to strengthen causal linkage. Orientation clear within 120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>“Twilight barge canal,” body-object details (sundial to tapestry), and sensory restraint create a micro-setting that pressures action without ornamental excess. Some spatial anchors (warehouse jut, crippled oak) feel inserted rather than lived-in.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—understanding truth—escalates cleanly from folktale myth to personal revelation. One credible tightening: tapestry reconfigures identity. Stakes concrete but mostly interior, lacking overt opposition beyond self-deception.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of truth as architecture of lies emerges via mirrored tapestry, never moralized. Subtext in “call answered across centuries” offers resonant, non-literal answer that reweights preceding material with serene but total shock.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Narrative voice maintains lyrical, contemplative rhythm under pressure. Sentence cadence mirrors water’s drag and dawning clarity without head-hop or register drift. Occasional abstract phrasing (“punctured universe”) edges purple.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is fluid, vivid, and dense without redundancy. Minor figurative flourishes (“tea-colored water”) verge on ornament; filter-verb stacks few. Clean mechanics; paragraphs build pace toward final image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Weaving legend seeker summoned by the very fabric is a fresh, specific synthesis of mythic trope and intimate identity. Risk taken in circular structure (tapestry shows seeker) feels inevitable only in hindsight.</comment>
