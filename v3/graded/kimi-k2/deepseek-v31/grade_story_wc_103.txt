<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—her tactile obsession with “grain of time” anchors motive—but the mother’s reappearance feels slightly under-motivated; we don’t see Elara weigh cost before the final act. The embodied emotion (trowel shock, fragment burn) is strong, yet the mother remains a symbol more than a person, limiting relational crucible impact.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the folded-time knot is unpicked and mother steps into present—an earned Decisive Change with conceptual cost (photos turn to dust). Causal chain holds: fragment triggers vision → geometry insight → recalibration → reunion. One minor ellipsis: how the “re-calculation” actually alters physical space is elided, but pattern coherence survives.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Living bridge is tactile—woven trees, silent river, quaking leaves—yet never overwhelms word count. The garden’s geometry literally constrains the climax: Elara must “re-calculate the space around the memory.” Micro-setting (halo fragment as lens) doubles as tool and setting pivot. Sensory selection skews visual, but urgency narrows perception appropriately.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—free mother from temporal fold—is signaled early and tightened once: the looped memory becomes the stitch Elara must unpick. Agency drives escalation (pruning → discovery → calculation → disintegration). Cost is conceptual (dissolving photographs, accepting non-linear time) rather than visceral, but still legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges implicitly: time as textured, tactile surface rather than line. The maze-as-map metaphor reweights from puzzle to living diagram without overt statement. Final image—mother’s warm hand—resonates as non-literal answer to “texture of time.” Subtext operates through gesture (dust of photographs) rather than exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise; “quaking reverie” tone sustained via sensory diction (“scent of freshly-cut yew”). No dialogue, so no register drift. Compression in temporal jumps is taught early and paid off. Occasional elevated phrasing (“hyperbolic pressures”) fits Elara’s designer intellect without jarring.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; sentences layer action, image, and concept. Minor loop risk in repeated “time isn’t linear” variants, but spaced enough to avoid monotony. Strong verbs (“flung,” “unbent”) carry momentum. One mixed metaphor—“swallow the afternoon sun”—but clarity survives. No line-level artifacts near closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: hedge-maze designer + hyperbolic time geometry + living architecture. Tropes (lost parent, magical artifact) are transformed through Elara’s professional lens. Risky non-linear resolution feels inevitable in hindsight. Specificity of “fading photographs as calibrations” elevates premise beyond generic portal fantasy.</comment>
