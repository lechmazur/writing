<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s quiet obsession is credibly embodied—her fingertip lexicon-touch, the climb, the shard held aloft—but interior contradiction is muted; we feel her wonder more than her struggle, so the earned cost reads gentle rather than wrenching.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the chandelier’s archive is re-weighted from tomb to seed-vault, cost felt in Elara’s solitary testimony. Causal chain (shard → fractured sequences → testimony) holds; orientation is immediate and transitions are clean.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Shadowed library at dawn is sketched with selective sensory economy; the chandelier and shard act as micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove language still grows—tightens once when Elara decides to testify; cost is the exposure of her lifelong isolation to an indifferent world. Pressure escalates via the crystal’s revelation rather than external opposition.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: meaning resides in the interstices, not the lexicon. Final image of layered voices reframes prior material without moralizing; ambiguity lingers about whether the world will listen.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is hushed, scholarly, slightly archaic—apt for a reticent lexicographer. Syntax modulates with awe; no head-hopping. Occasional elevated diction (“profound weathered innocence”) risks register drift but stays within Elara’s plausible range.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is lean and lyrical; no loops or scaffold. Metaphors (“fossil record of collective thought”) are purposeful and coherent. Minor density spike in chandelier exposition, but momentum never stalls.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Premise—chandelier as living sound-archive—feels fresh yet inevitable. Risky lyric compression pays off; specificity of the shard’s acoustic property anchors the fantastical in tactile reality.</comment>
