<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her fixation on night-blooming flowers is dramatized through tactile work and postcard handling. The final shift from loneliness to gratitude is earned by the cathedral epiphany and postcard re-reading. One minor slip: “quietly driven intensity” is label-speak that could be shown earlier.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each beat layers sensory density until the sunbeam catalyzes the hidden diagram, reconfiguring Elara’s stance. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—she reinvents the mural and re-weights the postcards with gratitude. Cost is felt in the relinquishing of her old solitude.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is selective and purposeful: the amber pavilion’s light, the cathedral’s dusty shafts, and the melting snow all constrain visibility and timing. The moon-sap diagram etched in glass becomes the micro-setting that charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—why flowers bloom unseen—tightens when the cathedral light reveals the moon’s gravitational coaxing. One decisive intensification: the diagram forces Elara to reinterpret her grandmother’s silence and her own isolation. Cost is the emotional labor of that reinterpretation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of hidden, loving forces emerges organically from the moon-sap diagram and postcard stamps. Final image—nocturnal flower turning toward the moon—offers a non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext in the postcards’ “smudged maps” quietly reframes absence as care.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise; perceptual signature filters every detail through Elara’s chromatic sensitivity. Syntax modulates with emotional rise—long, breath-held sentences before the sunbeam, shorter pulses afterward. No POV drift or register clash.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is patterned and paid off (“umbral tenderness” returns in closure). No loops or scaffold. One near-miss: “kaleidoscope of unspent color” edges purple but is anchored in character vocation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: astronomical botany meets filial longing via stained-glass secret. The moon-sap diagram is a non-obvious hinge that feels inevitable after the postcards’ exotic blooms. Risky lyric compression succeeds without clarity loss.</comment>
