<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—grief vs resolve—are embodied in the fork’s vibration and the color blooms; her micro-choice to press the fork to the glass crystallizes her arc with visible cost (the surrender of sound for visual music).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single-scene causal arc: because she survives silence, therefore she invents a resonator, therefore she translates silence into visible harmony. Closure is a decisive change—she reconfigures the frost into a “visual symphony” with felt cost: she forfeits audible music forever.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Winterglass Conservatory is not backdrop; its crystalline panels are the instrument Elara plays. The frost’s harmonic rearrangement under the fork’s touch makes the setting an active constraint and the final resonating surface.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—turn silence into music—tightens when early attempts yield only noise-made-visible. The fork-glass fusion is a single, irreversible escalation that forecloses the path of audible sound and crystallizes the new form.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: trauma transmuted into art without literalizing “healing.” The final image of frost singing in gold patterns offers a non-moral, resonant answer—silence itself becomes the medium, not the enemy.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is tactile, spare, and sensor-driven; the perceptual signature favors texture over sound. Compression like “felt note and colored by grateful awe” keeps psychic distance tight and lyrical without drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid; no loops or scaffold. Metaphors (“fractal gardens,” “lace-like patterns”) are precise and tied to the glass instrument. Rhythm accelerates into the final harmonic transformation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Premise—post-sound world where silence is sculpted into visual music—is fresh yet inevitable. The tuning fork as silent conductor and the frost as score feel like the only possible tools for this exact character.</comment>
