<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Felix’s resilient positivity is embodied in action—calming passengers, seizing the hourglass, broadcasting will. Interiority is concrete (“he understood…with sudden instinctual clarity”) and the final smile carries the cost of permanent solitude. Motivation escalates from reassurance to ontological repair, earned by prior causal beats. Only a slight surplus of summary keeps it from 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the restored skyline and oblivious passengers crystallize the cost of Felix’s unseen guardianship. Causal lens holds—every beat (lurch → perception of timelines → hourglass → radio broadcast) is a because/therefore linkage. The final image reweights the premise without exposition. No orientation debt; disorientation is functional.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The spectral grotto is rendered through Felix’s bodily disorientation and the hourglass’s starlit glow; the empty bulbs later anchor time itself. Sensory selection narrows under crisis (“salt-tinged air,” “blinding starlight vanished”). Micro-setting (hourglass, radio handset) constrains the decisive act. One hairline slip: “cavern of impossible dimensions” edges toward the generic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prevent un-writing of passengers—is signaled early and tightened by each sideways tick of the clocks. Agency is Felix’s radio broadcast that forecloses all other timelines; the cost is his eternal vigilance. Escalation is one coherent pressure wave under the causal lens. No reversals needed; one decisive intensification suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the collision of permanence (the ferry’s endless loop) and transience (passengers’ oblivion). Subtext lives in Felix’s silent smile and the empty hourglass—time’s measure replaced by duty. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: all moments are simultaneous and fragile. No moralizing; complexity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is distinct—salt-creased, work-worn, yet lyric when reality bends (“grey river of suits and tired eyes”). Syntax tightens under pressure: “He had to act as a keel.” No head-hopping; POV stays locked to Felix. Occasional elevated diction (“spectral grotto”) is earned by the cosmic stakes.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and propulsive; every sentence advances image or choice. No loops or scaffold. Metaphors are precise (“threads tangling here, now”). Rhythm modulates with crisis—short clauses during the lurch, longer cadences in the aftermath. One minor filter verb cluster mid-broadcast keeps it from 9.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The sideways-running clocks and ontological ferry rescue invert familiar portal tropes through Felix’s grounded labor. The hourglass as time-anchor and the radio as metaphysical keel are fresh syntheses. Risky cosmic stakes stay tethered to tactile deckhand detail. The final image feels inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
