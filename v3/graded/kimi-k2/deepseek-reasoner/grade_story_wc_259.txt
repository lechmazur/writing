<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—hunger for knowledge vs. psychic self-preservation—are dramatized in her zig-zag navigation and the veil’s failure. The embodied cost (grief-joy shards) is palpable, and her final acceptance reads as earned renunciation of innocence. Minor slack: the “burning compulsion” is asserted rather than shown in early beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the prism redefined from monument to tuning fork reweights the entire quest. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern avoidance escalates emotional density until the final cadence shift. Orientation is swift; no causal breaks. Cost is legible in the line “Her anguish melted into a serene, joyful sorrow.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Selective sensory detail (saffron veil, bronze prism, dust of longing) is filtered through Elara’s historian bias. The archive’s reactive geometry and the prism’s twilight resonance constrain tactics and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; no white-room drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will Elara reach and survive the Heart-Space—tightens via the archive’s pattern trap. Each zig-zag choice forecloses easier paths; the final revelation exacts the price of innocence. Escalation is steady under the Accumulative lens; no coincidences resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: history as living wound rather than record. The prism’s redefinition and the Khelathrans’ dissolution offer resonant, non-moralizing insight into collective memory. No late thesis statements; ambiguity lingers productively.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Distinct lyric texture—controlled cadence, sensory specificity, historian’s diction—remains coherent under psychic pressure. No POV leakage or filter-verb clutter. The voice modulates from anxious to rapt without register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High information density with rhythmic variation; figurative language is purposeful (“geometric ache,” “atoms of nostalgia”). No loops or mixed metaphors. Minor scaffold: “steady, unpredictable” appears twice without added pressure—barely perceptible.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of memory-as-matter and civilization-as-tuning-fork feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric structure pays off in closure. No derivative echoes; the emotional specificity of Khelathra’s dissolution is non-generic.</comment>
