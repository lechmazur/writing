<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s grief-stricken guidance and Leo’s reluctant stewardship crystallise in the final moment of recognition; however, her inner contradiction—protective venom vs spectral self-erasure—leans more toward summary than embodied scene. One hairline slip: the interiority in “lovingly venomous precision” is a label not an enactment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The causal thread—veiled haunting ⟶ corrected tending ⟶ bead transfer ⟶ remembrance—flows cleanly and culminates in a resonant reconfiguration: the orchard lights up as Elara dissolves, Leo now forecloseable guardian. Cost is visible sentence: “The emptiness was gone, replaced by … the warm weight … ” Immediate, publishable closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Silver-barked equation-trees and black silent snow root the dream-logic immediately; the greenhouse itself tightens choice by constraining cultivation methods. One minor overreach—“endless night” drifts slightly generic compared to “softly glowing, crystalline equations”—but otherwise selects sensory detail surgically.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Single dominant stake—orchard salvation through remembered love—tightens decisively once Leo accepts the bead, foreclosing retreat from stewardship. One escalatory beat: touching bead floods him with cost. No coincidence resolves; pressure coheres under causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Debt, grief, and renewal resonate through concrete particulars—bead, orchard, veil—without once spelling out “forgiveness” or “atonement”. Final dissolution image refracts the love story into radiant orchard light, achieving non-literal thematic answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is elegant, sentence-rhythm varied, with slight lyric tilt. Small diction hiccup “lovingly venomous precision” feels editorial; otherwise prose texture sustains spectral chill and urgency throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Nearly all lines advance; only “softly glowing crystalline equations” risks slight adjective stacking, not severe. Clarity and momentum remain sharp through haunting, climax, release.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Ghost-bride + alchemical orchard + starlight trees is bold synthesis that feels inevitable, not novelty for its own sake. Fresh inflection: memory-grown equations literalised as fruit. No derivative drift.</comment>
