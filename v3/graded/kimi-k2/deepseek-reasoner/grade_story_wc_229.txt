<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the vial cork and beckoning gesture crystallize her quiet-versus-loud credo. The keeper’s single shout supplies external pressure, but he remains off-stage, so relationship crucible is thin. The final beat—cobalt beam purifying intent—earns her stance with visible cost (fatigue, risk of failure). One contradictory impulse (duty vs. whispered faith) plays out in scene, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the lighthouse’s new cobalt beam reweights its function from warning to welcome, cost paid in the lens stutter and Elara’s exhaustion. Causal chain—scent → beckon → cork drop → mechanism surge—holds under Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no drift. One meaningful tightening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The lantern room, Fresnel lens, and dawn mist are rendered with selective sensory economy; cobalt light later constrains choice by becoming the medium of intent. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions. Micro-setting (vial cork) functions as charged object. Environment guides the final image, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove whispers can guide—signaled early. Pressure tightens when the lens stalls, forcing Elara’s silent gesture to carry real navigational weight. Cost is the risk of blackout and the keeper’s wrath. Escalation is one decisive intensification under Accumulative lens; no reversals needed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: quiet intent outperforms brute volume. Subtext lives in scent, gesture, and color shift rather than statement. Final cobalt beam offers non-literal answer—tenderness as navigational force—without moralizing. No thematic echo in final paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elara; perceptual signature is scented, tactile, and synesthetic. Syntax modulates with fatigue and wonder. No head-hopping. Dialogue is minimal but voice-true: keeper’s shouted “garbled mess” contrasts Elara’s silence. Rhythm accelerates during lens surge.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet lyrical; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language (“screaming tenderness”) is earned by context. High information density—each sentence advances image or intent. No mixed metaphors or register drift. Final paragraph crystallizes without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Familiar lighthouse setting is re-angled through synesthetic intent-transmission and cobalt color shift. Transformation test: story would collapse without Elara’s whispered-physics premise. Specificity of scent, cork, and beam keeps it from template territory. Risky lyric compression pays off.</comment>
