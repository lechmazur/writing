<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s insomnia and methodical hope are embodied in tactile micro-choices (climbing iron stairs, guiding visions). The final renunciation—realizing she only needed to give light, not prove anything—earns rest with visible cost: her vigil ends, canvas complete. Interior contradiction (hope vs. exhaustion) stays active in scene. No second on-page character, so relationship crucible waived.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each night’s session layers luminous memories until the full-moon canvas crystallizes a Resonant Reconfiguration—strangers recognize their own inherited kindness, city air “less choked.” Causality is lyrical accumulation rather than because/therefore; closure lands with felt cost as Elara’s insomnia resolves. Orientation anchored by line 3; no drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Rooftop greenhouse, smog, and moonlight are filtered through Elara’s exhausted perception; the moon-tipped brush itself becomes micro-setting that constrains every artistic choice. Final image of shared recognition re-weights the greenhouse’s “saffron quiet.” Selective sensory detail (silver filaments drinking light) supports atmosphere without clutter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—proving kindness is remembered—tightens when Elara shifts from proof to revelation; cost is her sleepless vigil and the blank canvas that must be filled. One meaningful deepening under Accumulative lens: accumulation of memories narrows her goal to curation rather than persuasion. No external antagonist needed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from concrete acts: inherited compassion encoded in blood and half-remembered stories. Final silence among strangers offers non-literal answer—kindness was never lost, only sleeping. No moralizing; resonance arises from specificity of sailor, clerk, bread-giver. Ambiguity lingers without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Distinct perceptual signature: “bleary hues of exhaustion,” “saffron quiet,” rhythmic control that mirrors insomnia. POV remains tight; no head-hopping. Compression in final paragraph (“thick with a saffron quiet”) teaches the pattern and pays off. Dialogue minimal but natural when it appears.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid; figurative language disciplined to high-pressure beats (“ghostly script of lost languages”). No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Occasional elevated diction (“profoundly quiet”) fits Elara’s painterly interiority. Final cadence shift earned.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: insomnia as curatorial vigil, moon-tipped brush as memory conduit, kindness as latent genetic text. Premise feels inevitable in hindsight; risk of sentimentality avoided through concrete particulars. No derivative echoes; transformation test passed.</comment>
