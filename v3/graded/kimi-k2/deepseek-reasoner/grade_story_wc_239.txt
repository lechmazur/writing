<comment>Elara’s interiority glints with precise contradiction—dictionary as “anchor against drifting tides” while she drifts inward—but emotions remain slightly abstract (“purpose, carved into her very being”). The earned price is implicit (cosmic balance preserved), yet embodied physicality is spare; micro-choice hierarchy is visible in her spiral-guided speech.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</degree>
<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: silence deepens under spiral pressure until the hush “settles into the stones.” Decisive reconfiguration lands in last paragraph—“library preserved for another aeon”—with conceptual cost replacing causal break; all beats spiral inward. Orientation anchors (temple, Chamber) arrive early; no teleporting props.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Chamber’s frozen orreries, “stone shelves and papyrus scrolls,” constrain her spiral path physically and symbolically; dictionary-as-micro-setting alters her final recitation and recharges closure. Sensory economy is apt—brass, paper, silence—but spatial choreography is minimal; “spectral heart” leans toward abstraction.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Single dominant stake—prevent cosmic tear—tightens once via spiral recitation that blurs Order/Chaos edges under accumulating pressure. Agency manifests as speech acts that narrow options to negotiated synthesis; felt cost is metaphysical, legible in “new balance settle into the stones.” Coincidence absent.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme—truth as negotiated synthesis of opposites—emerges from spiral image and word etymologies, never sermonized. Ambiguity preserved: spiral is ongoing, no tidy moral. Final conceptual repricing elevates theme without explicit statement; subtext in “resounding hush” lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Voice sustains lyrical compression (“wanderingly exact precision”) without head-hopping; perceptual signature is archaic, precise, slightly cosmic. Rhythm swells and subsides with spiral beats; dictionary entry syntax modulates emotion.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Line-level craft is clean, no loops, but metaphors flirt with near-abstraction (“drifting tides of forgotten languages”) in high beats. Density high: each sentence advances meaning; no scaffold. Register consistent; few strong verbs keep propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fusion of cosmology, lexicography, and spiral metaphor feels fresh and inevitable. Premise resists easy paraphrase; dictionary-as-arbiter transcends mere motif. Risk in ontological stakes pays; transformation anchored by repeated “spiral” image.</comment>
