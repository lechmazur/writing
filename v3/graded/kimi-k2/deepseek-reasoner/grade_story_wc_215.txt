<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas’s interiority is embodied and specific—his “quiet, stubborn thing” and “mute eloquence” reveal motive without label-speak. The micro-choice to kneel and offer silent understanding crystallizes his arc and carries visible cost (the covenant’s completion absorbs him). Ghost-woman and ghost-bees exert pressure, but they are not second on-page characters, so relationship crucible is N/A. The only drag is a brief “he understood their purpose” summary that could be dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of ghost-bee dances and light pulses tighten until the stained-glass heart reseals. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—ghosts fade into dawn light, covenant fulfilled, Silas left in “tranquil, perceptive silence.” Cost is legible in the final image: the oasis now truly silent, his purpose absorbed. Orientation is anchored early; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The oasis is rendered through tactile detail—“weathered white hives,” “gritty sand,” “dead lavender”—all filtered by Silas’s beekeeper eye. The stained-glass box becomes micro-setting that constrains the final choice; its colored light literally charges the closing image. Spatial choreography is clean; no white-room drift. One minor slip: “second moon” is mentioned once without prior world-rule cue, but it does not affect closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve unspoken weight—is signaled in paragraph one. Escalation is accretive: ghost-bees’ agitation → woman’s gaze → box’s glow, each beat tightening the pressure to act. Agency is renunciation/acceptance rather than combat; the cost is the absorption of the ghosts and the silence that follows. No external reversals, but the single deepening is sufficient for length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of unspoken covenant emerges from concrete particulars—bees, glass, light—never abstract assertion. The final image reweights the premise: silence is no longer absence but fulfilled promise. Subtext in the woman’s gaze and the bees’ dance carries the plea without dialogue. No moralizing; resonance lingers in the charged quiet.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise—“pale and shimmering,” “thick as honey”—with rhythmic control that modulates under pressure. POV stays locked in Silas; no head-hop. Compression is taught early (“astonished recluse”) and paid off in the final “astonished… silence.” No dialogue, so no register clash. Distinct perceptual signature throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; sentences advance multiple jobs—“the colored light… set the dead earth… ablaze” shows setting, stakes, and wonder in one stroke. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is selective. One mixed metaphor—“ruptured… tear… poured out”—is minor and early, not near closure. Clean mechanics.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Post-apocalyptic beekeeper tending ghost-bees via stained-glass covenant is fresh synthesis. The transformation of the box from broken promise to seamless heart feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. No close echoes; specificity anchors universals.</comment>
