<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“fingers stained with the ghosts of a hundred rainbows”), but her socially-perceptive trait is asserted more than dramatized; the final interjection is elegant yet feels slightly convenient because the tile’s agency supersedes hers. No contradictory impulses are staged in-scene; the arc is more emblematic than individuated.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Conceptual Repricing: the mandala reweights “meaning” from singular truth to relational fragments, and the hush’s cost is felt. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density and cadence shift rather than causal chain—held to the final image. One minor drift: the strangers’ arrival is slightly convenient pressure rather than earned.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The grotto’s mist, tiles, and sand are selective and purposeful; the whispering tile constrains the final choice and charges the image. Spatial choreography is coherent; the environment guides action without static exposition. Atmosphere modulates from lilac unease to dawn-like possibility, mirroring internal stakes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“discover meaning in the mess”—is signaled early and tightened when the strangers’ conflict threatens to ignite the unease. Elara’s agency is subtle (tap of the tile) but decisive; the hush absorbs the tension and forecloses further argument. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral, slightly softening the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: meaning resides in broken fragments’ relationships, not monolithic truth. Subtext operates through silence, pattern, and hush rather than statement. Final image of dawn-colored unease offers resonant non-literal answer. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers productively.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays close to Elara’s perceptual signature; diction is lyrical yet controlled (“lilac unease,” “ghosts of a hundred rainbows”). No head-hopping; strangers’ dialogue is brief but tonally distinct. Compression and patterned elision serve the accumulative lens without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; metaphors are fresh and coherent. Minor loop risk in “misty anxiety” and “soft echoes” but offset by rhythmic variation. No artifacts in closure beat. Strong nouns/verbs, minimal scaffolding. Final line crystallizes without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Transforms familiar “artist brings peace” trope through sand-mandala-as-map-of-chaos and hush-as-active-force. Whispering tile and emergent silence feel specific to this world. Slight risk of archetypal wise-artist figure tempers the score. Overall synthesis is fresh and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
