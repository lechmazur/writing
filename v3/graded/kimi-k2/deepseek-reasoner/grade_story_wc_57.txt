<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is textured and embodied; her patience is dramatized in the slow unfurling of the knot and the warming fulgurite. The shift from collector to initiate is earned and carries felt cost in the final image. Amos’s quiet guardianship adds relational pressure without crowding the POV.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the knot’s mandala and the fog’s lift crystallize her new stance. Causal linkage holds—each beat (trust-building, knot study, gentle coaxing) tightens toward the final reweighting. Cost is legible in the silence now “full of weaving.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The golden dock under snow, the fog, and the salt-stiffened rope function as micro-setting that constrains movement and attention. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered; the rope’s texture and the fulgurite’s warmth guide the final choice. Environment charges the closing image without ornamental excess.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving ancient methods—tightens when the knot rewrites itself, foreclosing the option of mere collection. Escalation is one meaningful deepening under an Accumulative/Textural lens; the cost is the shift from observer to participant. No reversals needed; the single intensification suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: knowledge as living weave rather than static archive. The final image of the dock holding “the last of the light” reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext in Amos’s quiet “Figured it out, did you?” deepens the resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise; perceptual signature filters every detail through Elara’s collector’s gaze. Syntax modulates with pressure—longer cadences in calm, clipped fragments during the knot’s shift. No head-hopping; focalization remains steady.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful; no mixed metaphors or loops. The final paragraph’s cadence mirrors the thematic reconfiguration without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of seed-collecting, knot-lore, and lightning-born glass feels inevitable yet fresh. Risk in the quiet, lyric closure pays off by recharging every prior image. No derivative echoes; the premise is transformed through specific lived detail.</comment>
