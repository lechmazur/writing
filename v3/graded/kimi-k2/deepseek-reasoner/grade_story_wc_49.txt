<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s quiet, persistent hum of motive is palpable, and her embodied trembling at moonrise shows interior stakes. Yet the interiority stays slightly generic—no contradictory impulse undercuts her resolve, so the arc feels single-note. The final tears register, but the cost is more observed than felt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the vine’s resurrection is a decisive change charged by the moon’s zenith, with the machine’s whirring ceasing as audible cost. Causal chain holds—dream → device → song → renewal—without gaps. Orientation is anchored early; only one minor transition (sunset to moonrise) is handled with a single sentence break.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The arbor is sketched with selective, tactile detail (damp earth, copper coils) that constrains her movements and tools. The vine itself becomes micro-setting, its spindle grip dictating the final action. Sensory hierarchy narrows under pressure: moonlight and scent sharpen as stakes rise.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore the Great Vine—faces a single, irreversible test at moon-zenith. Pressure tightens through dwindling time and the vine’s visible fade. The cost is mostly conceptual (loss of last chance) rather than a tangible forfeiture, keeping it just shy of the highest band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of renewal through forgotten memory emerges from the vine’s resurrection, not from authorial statement. The machine’s translation of lore into song reweights the premise: technology serves ancient practice, not replaces it. Final image of the living forest resonates without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays close to Elara’s tinkerer’s eye—copper coils and filaments noticed before moonlight. Syntax tightens under pressure (“hands trembled”). No dialogue, so voice coherence rests on consistent perceptual signature and rhythmic control; it holds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is vivid yet economical; each sentence advances image or stakes. Occasional soft modifiers (“quiet potential,” “soft luminescence”) flirt with cliché but never stall momentum. No loops or scaffold; final chord is cleanly cadenced.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Fusing steampunk device with folkloric song-craft feels fresh; the vine-as-record needle is a specific, non-obvious conceit. Premise avoids generic eco-fantasy by centering on translation rather than pure magic. Risk is moderate but coherent.</comment>
