<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“solitude a well-worn cloak”), her empathy drives every beat, and the final renunciation—becoming the library’s quiet truth—carries visible cost. The contradiction between retreat and engagement is dramatized in scene, not summarized. Minor slip: the “mistake” remains abstract, blunting the flaw’s bite.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara’s stance toward solitude is reweighted by the book of errors, cost felt in her altered return. Causal chain—invitation → paradox arch → hide by merging → book—holds without gaps. Midnight bell provides crisp temporal anchor; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Library’s “listening silence” and moon-framed window are selective, atmospheric, and directly constrain tactics (she must become silence to survive). Café-bank arch is a fresh spatial paradox that gates the scene. One notch from 9+ only because the plaza exterior is sketched more generically.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—survive the guardian by hiding—tightens once: from physical nook to ontological merge. Cost is the self-erasure she must risk. Agency is hers; coincidence (book appears) complicates rather than rescues. Pressure escalates under situational lens until stance crystallizes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of wisdom through humility of error emerges organically from the book’s contents and Elara’s empathic dissolution. No moralizing; final image of cottage-as-library reconfigures solitude without statement. Subtext in “crumpled invitation” as plea rather than summons deepens the ethical stakes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with controlled psychic distance and sensory bias (“scent of vellum”). Syntax modulates with pressure—longer cadences in calm, clipped fragments during the guardian’s pass. No head-hopping; POV remains tightly anchored to Elara’s perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and dense: “cognitive frost” and “nestled paradoxes” do fresh figurative work without clutter. No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances. One minor register lift—“conceptual repricing” diction in final paragraph—keeps it from perfect 9.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Transforms the trope of secret-magic-library into a test of empathic self-erasure; the “hide by becoming the room” method is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Specificity of the book of small errors feels discovered, not contrived. Risky quiet ending pays off with earned resonance.</comment>
