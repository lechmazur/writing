<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is embodied and specific—her hour-long stillness with outstretched arm is a lived contradiction of her flash-paper vocation. Motivation (preservation vs combustion) is dramatized through micro-choices: selecting twigs, uncorking starlight, pressing the flash-paper. The final renunciation of fire for permanence carries visible cost in the fused plate. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible waived.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the fused map reweights the orchard’s dormant life into a “patient, silent promise.” Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each collected item layers density until the silent flash crystallizes pattern into artifact. Cost is legible in the sublimated objects and the fading aurora. Orientation anchored by word 50; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Subarctic crater, gnarled trees, and aurora are filtered through Elara’s selective attention; cold is felt in “crackle of ice-laden soil.” The copper plate and vial function as micro-setting that constrains the final sealing act. Sensory economy favors touch and sight under polar twilight. Final image of glowing map recharges the orchard’s latent life.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—translate heartbeats into maps—tightens when the orchard’s hum synchronizes with Elara’s pulse, forcing the irreversible sealing. Escalation is accumulative: each discarded item raises the cost of failure. No external antagonist; pressure is situational and temporal (aurora fading). Cost is the loss of raw materials and the irreversible fusion.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of preservation-through-loss emerges from concrete acts: collecting detritus, sacrificing flash-paper to non-fire. No explicit moral; the glowing map offers a non-literal answer to how memory survives dormancy. Subtext resides in the paradox of stillness enabling motion toward spring. Final image reweights the orchard from dead to “spectral anatomy.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise—“moving stillness,” “safekept starlight”—taught early and sustained. Syntax mirrors Elara’s patience: long sentences for stillness, abrupt “she pressed” for the flash. No dialogue; interior monologue stays within POV limits. Final cadence slows to match the world’s exhale.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; each sentence layers sensory or causal information. Figurative language is selective—“liquid mercury,” “spectral anatomy”—and never muddles clarity. No loops or scaffold; paragraph cuts are purposeful. Rhythm accelerates into the silent flash, then breathes out.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise of an alchemist who forsakes combustion for cartography of dormancy is fresh. Flash-paper repurposed for permanence inverts trope. Specificity of polar orchard, auroral ink, and fossilized apple grounds the concept. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
