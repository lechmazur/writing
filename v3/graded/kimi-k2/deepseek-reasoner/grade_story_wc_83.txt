<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s survivor guilt and milky eye are embodied in concrete micro-choices (geode to forehead, zero-g push-off). The final “how to drink” stance crystallizes her arc with visible cost: joy is dead, only cold proof remains. Interiority is specific, never diagnostic. One slip: “mathematical fluke” edges toward label-speak mid-peak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the hunt ends with a reconfiguration of cosmic meaning and a foreclosed path—she cannot return to prior grief. Causal chain (power outage → silence → hunt → resonance) holds under Accumulative/Textural lens. Cost is legible in the final image. Orientation anchored by viewport and console within 120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Floating observatory hums, dies, and reboots, constraining the silence window that enables the hunt. Geode’s amethyst heart functions as micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered. Spatial choreography in zero-g is coherent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—locate the pooled potential—tightens when the resonance from K-7B forecloses the option of believing the universe is only entropy. Agency is Elara’s psychic pulse and listening; cost is the ache in her ruined eye and the cold ash of lost joy. One meaningful deepening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the tension between entropy and preserved potential, crystallized in the final image of the pinpoint light. No moralizing; resonance is earned through concrete particulars. Subtext operates in the geode’s silent pulse and the milky eye’s pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, scientific-lyric, with controlled rhythm and purposeful compression (“choir cut short by a singular, percussive whine”). Perceptual signature is biased toward mathematical and sensory precision. No head-hopping; POV remains tight and coherent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and propulsive; no loops or scaffold. Metaphors are precise (“cathedral of amethyst spikes”). Sentence variety supports pressure. One minor register drift—“perturbation theory of death”—but context justifies it.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses drone-strike trauma with cosmic dowsing; feels inevitable yet fresh. Geode-as-resonator and “unused potential” as literal gravity well transform familiar grief tropes. Risk-taking in lyric-scientific hybrid pays off without obscuring clarity.</comment>
