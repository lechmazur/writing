<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is embodied and specific—her fingers “pale in the starlight,” her needle-work a tactile dialogue with the dead. Motivation (“to ground restless spirits”) is dramatized through the ritual of knot-unraveling and the final suturing of the mask. The only gap is Kael’s functional flatness; he supplies the net but exerts no pressure on Elara’s choices, so relationship-as-crucible is absent. Still, her earned renunciation of simple repair in favor of visible mending carries a felt cost that caps the arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the spirit’s dissolution into “serene, accumulated silence” reweights the sanctuary’s atmosphere from heavy to light. Causal chain—net → knot → truth → mask suturing → release—holds without gaps. Orientation is immediate (“subterranean sanctuary,” “prism-lit chamber”). Cost is palpable in the final image: the mask remains fractured, the break honored rather than erased.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The prism sanctuary is not mere backdrop; its fractured beams mirror the mask’s fracture and the spirit’s splintered memory. Micro-setting—the hemp net on the bench, the cold spot beside Kael—constrains Elara’s tactile ritual. Starlight and silence evolve from oppressive to “light, and complete,” charging the closure. One notch shy of 9+ only because the broader world beyond the chamber is left to implication.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—freeing the drowned spirit—is signaled early and tightened through each loosened knot. Agency is Elara’s alone; each filament she picks narrows the spirit’s options until the final suturing forecloses the haunting. Cost is visible: the mask’s break is permanently foregrounded. No secondary escalation, but one decisive intensification suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the concrete: truth must be exhumed, not hidden, and repair must acknowledge rupture. Subtext lives in gesture—the spirit watching, the slackening net, the deliberate gold stitches. Final image offers a non-literal answer: acceptance of fracture as wholeness. No moralizing, only resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with a perceptual signature attuned to texture and silence. Syntax modulates with pressure—long sentences during excavation, clipped fragments at the release. No POV drift; even Kael’s minimal dialogue is filtered through Elara’s awareness. The prose’s rhythm mirrors the ritual’s careful cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Line-level craft is near-flawless: high density, zero loops, figurative language that serves rather than decorates. “Lucid unrest” and “accumulated silence” are coined phrases that earn their keep by reappearing in altered form at closure. No filter-verb stacks or mixed metaphors. Every sentence advances story or atmosphere.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The premise—restoring masks by unraveling cursed nets—feels inevitable yet wholly fresh. Tropes of ghostly redemption and sympathetic magic are transformed through tactile specificity and ethical nuance. Risk is taken in the quiet, ritualistic arc; the payoff is a crystallized final image that could belong to no other story.</comment>
