<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s quiet obsession is embodied in tactile micro-choices—gripping controls, boots sinking, fingers brushing the arrow—yet interiority stays concrete. The final renunciation (leaving the arrow) is earned by the memory-shock and the visible greening of moss, so cost is felt. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene; motivation is steady rather than conflicted, capping below 9.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara’s purpose shifts from seeking to guarding, crystallized in the image of her skiff descending under restored gravity. Causal chain—gravity inversion → access → discovery → renunciation—holds without gaps. Cost is legible in the weight she now carries. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Floating rock arches, inverted soil, and the “library of quiet” are vivid, selective, and filtered through Elara’s pilot priorities. The moss patch at the pool edge functions as micro-setting that constrains the final choice by demonstrating the arrow’s power. Environment directly shapes tactics and charges the ending image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—find the source of resilience—is signaled early and tightened when the arrow’s memory reveals the true “source” is the echo itself. One decisive deepening: discovery reframes the quest from possession to stewardship. Cost is the forfeiture of taking the arrow; pressure coherent under situational lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of weapon into seed; no moral is stated. The final image—skiff descending under normal gravity—reweights the premise: resilience is memory sustained by refusal to possess. Subtext operates in the silence and the withheld arrow.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elara’s perceptual signature; sensory hierarchy reflects pilot priorities. Rhythm modulates with pressure—longer cadence in the hush of the grove, clipped descent at the end. No dialogue, so voice coherence is judged solely on narrative texture, which is consistent and purposeful.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet lyrical; every sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Figurative language (“petrified canopy,” “library of quiet”) is sparse and earned. Final line lands with crystallized image and no clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Stone-orchard planet with gravity inversion feels inevitable yet fresh; the arrow-as-seed reconfigures familiar tropes. Risky structural choice—single quiet revelation instead of external conflict—heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specificity of water-flow navigation and memory-echo ecology anchors the vision.</comment>
