<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—violent lineage vs imposed pacifism—are dramatized in live beats: the conscious swap of seeds for bone slivers under threat, the micro-choice to face rather than flee, the soldier’s trembling handing her his weapon. There is a visible, embodied cost: her father’s sandbag scrap becomes the literal pouch for peace, the rose offered to the soldier is stripped of thorns as if disarming her past. One slip: the tag “from the fallen tower” reads too expositional. Still, earned quiet as the renounced road feels on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: after the tower collapse, continuity is re-won through a gesture of stillness rather than combat. Accumulation / textural lens: the hum of regulators, rose scent, and humming blade layer into tension until the blade’s quiet deactivation re-prices the arena—non-combative continuity now irreversible. Cost crystallizes in Elara’s line “This one understands courage”—a stake now too charged to undo. Lens is steady; no causality break.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Glass dome, perfumed air, and grit under boots function as micro-setting that directly alters tactics: the climate-controlled calm dissuades violence the way a weapon-free zone would outside. The rose itself becomes a tactile proxy for a new rule-set. One minor drift—“shimmering, silent haze outside” is atmospheric but not tied to consequence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: weave meaning after collapse. Escalation begins in dread, intensifies through the soldier’s blade threat, then resolves when Elara’s ethos forecloses violent defense; the immediate risk drops while long-term unknowns rise with felt cost. The tightening is single-point but decisive, consistent with 600–800 word scope.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges not declared: bone slivers as inherited violence retooled into virtues, rose as living memorial to a gentler future. Final resonance—not “peace wins” but continuity demands choosing difficult stillness. It avoids slogan by letting the rose in the soldier’s dirty gauntlet carry the charge.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct lyric voice—“shimmering, silent haze”, “perfumed, engineered tranquility”—tuned to Elara’s precise noticing. POV is locked; no head-hop. One micro slip: “cooling ember” drifts from concrete toward ornamental. Overall cadence mirrors her cautious breathing with sentence lengths that throttle as soldier enters.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Clean compression; each line multitasks, no paraphrase loops. Sensory filters are voice-guided not extraneous. One mixed metaphor “a void where constant data-streams once buzzed” leans abstract, but it sits in reflection rather than high-pressure beat and is forgivable.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The conceit of weapon-values transplanted into plant roots is fresh, avoids allegory by grounding in tactile process. Desert-rose-as-peacemaker feels inevitable once set. Risky quiet ending lands without gimmick; one recognizable archetype “ragged soldier” is slightly default, slightly tempered by his panic.</comment>
