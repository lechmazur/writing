<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and profession-specific; the translator’s contradictory pull between detachment and compulsion is embodied in the hand-to-glass moment. The final choice—to absorb the keeper’s daughter’s story—carries visible cost (loss of distance) and is foreshadowed by the “honor” motive. One slip: the merchant’s line is exposition rather than pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the lens-guided absorption re-weights the narrator’s identity from observer to keeper. Causal chain—fragment → painting → whispered translation—holds without gaps. Cost is legible in the phrase “the anchor held fast,” implying irrevocable tethering. Orientation is swift; no debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Market is sketched with ozone, herbs, metallic tang—selective, POV-filtered. The lens fragment itself becomes micro-setting, constraining the final act when held to canvas. Spatial choreography across rope bridges is coherent. One missed beat: canvas stall’s interior could be one sensory notch sharper.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—restore fading intuition—tightens when the fragment offers direction, then deepens when the painting demands release. One clear escalation: from curiosity to compulsion to absorption, each with rising cost. Agency drives every turn; coincidence only complicates.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of honoring overlooked histories emerges through the keeper’s daughter’s silent warning, not exposition. Final image—narrator as “keeper of their light”—reweights the opening credo without moralizing. Subtext in the woman’s gesture (warning, not farewell) deepens resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with translator’s perceptual signature: “cartographer of the spaces between.” Rhythm modulates under pressure—short clauses during absorption, longer ruminative lines earlier. No head-hopping; POV distance stays intimate. One minor cadence echo: “I felt a pull, a direction” could trim the second clause.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and conceptual work. No loops or scaffold. Metaphors (“watercolor bleed of orange and deep blue”) are fresh and scene-tied. One mixed image—“elusively tangible”—is forgiven because the paradox is immediately enacted.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses alchemist market, fragmentary lighthouse lens, and memory-translation into a singular whole. The hidden-detail method feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric compression pays off in the eternal-instant beat. No derivative echoes.</comment>
