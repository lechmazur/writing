<comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—ink-perfectionist vs. puppet-provocateur—is dramatized in the stick-turn micro-choice; the renunciation of “clean truth” costs her prior professional identity, felt in the line “her method was forever changed.” Serenity trait shifts from defensive armor to tactical instrument, showing embodied cost. Could edge higher if the puppet-shows were on-page rather than recalled.</comment>

<comment>Single-scene causal chain: argument → dome → stick → reversal → new method; each beat tightens options under the Accumulative lens. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the pamphlet refusal makes audience complicity the new price. Meteor-hush motif bookends, reweighting silence from emptiness to charged space. Orientation anchored by word 60; no teleporting props.</comment>

<comment>Radar dome’s skeletal ribs and meteor-quiet function as micro-setting that literally arches over the decision; stick’s tactile carvings constrain her pivot. Sensory hierarchy obeys calligrapher’s eye—ink, line, texture—filtering the Cold-War relic through her urbane bias. Final image of city lights “fallen constellation” reprises sky motif, charging the pamphlet choice with cosmic scale.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—ethical storytelling vs. commercial sensationalism—tightens when stick-flip forces her to foreclose the “fortress of fact” path. Pressure grows via accumulative density: each carved symbol adds weight until silence becomes unbearable argument for invitation, not defense. Cost legible in forfeiture of publisher contract and embrace of uncertain audience interpretation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from object-handling: truth as communal stick-passing rather than authorial decree. Subtext in puppet-show memory—laughter turning to silence—prefigures the pamphlet gambit without overt statement. Final image reframes earlier “meteor hush” as creative space, offering resonant non-literal answer: silence is the story yet to be told. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly aligned to Elara’s perceptual signature—ink, line, twilight bruise—without head-hopping. Syntax lengthens in calmer beats, fragments under stick-revelation, mirroring emotional cadence. Free indirect “her ethical duty wasn’t to present...” retains calligrapher’s elevated diction yet stays in-character. No dialogue to test, but internal voice remains coherent and distinctive.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose achieves high density: “vast, geodesic cavern suspended on a remote hilltop” packs world, scale, mood in one stroke. Rhythm modulates from long atmospheric sentences to staccato epiphanies (“What if...”). No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; figurative language disciplined to POV. Occasional elevated latinate diction (“antithesis,” “complicity”) justified by urbane narrator.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fusion of calligraphy, Cold-War ruin, and puppet subversion yields fresh angle on “ethical storytelling” trope. Stick-as-communal-truth-tool reverses typical author-god premise, making listener co-author. Risk-taking in quiet, reflective closure paid off by Conceptual Repricing. Slight familiarity of “publisher vs. artist” frame prevents 9+ band.</comment>
