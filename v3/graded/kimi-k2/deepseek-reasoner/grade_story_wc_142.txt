<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyra’s interior contradiction—duty to founders vs paycheck from OmniCorp—drives every micro-choice; the stone’s transfer from Hem to her hand externalizes the cost of trust. Emotions are embodied (hands stained, weight of stone) rather than labeled. The final crystallization into “steady resolve” is earned because the graffiti plan and community adaptation are dramatized, not asserted.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the city re-orders itself around its own heart, shown in the new mural with the stone at its center. Causal chain—graffiti instructions → communal potlucks → inspectors arrive to a still-carnival—holds without gaps. Cost is visible: Hem’s smaller stall, Lyra’s permanent dual allegiance, the stone now hers to “hold.”</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The raft-city is evoked through motion and sound—“canal of murky water between rafts decked with blinking lights”—and the stone functions as micro-setting that constrains choice. Spatial choreography is clean: Hem’s old stall → new nook → mural behind it. The environment guides tactics; sunnier corner “better for whittling” is a concrete constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prevent sanitization—tightens when the graffiti plan forces a communal retreat that still claims space. One meaningful turn: reorganization shifts from corporate victory to community-led adaptation. Cost is legible: Hem’s concession of space, Lyra’s acceptance of perpetual bridge-role.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: adaptation without surrender. The stone’s migration from luck-charm to encoded emblem reframes the premise—survival is not stasis but persistent re-coding. Final mural’s text “Remember. Adapt. Persist.” is earned subtext, not sermon.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is controlled, lyrical yet concrete: “her every step a negotiation between orderly intuitive planning and the chaotic, beautiful noise.” Perceptual signature filters all detail through Lyra’s tactical eye. Dialogue with Hem carries subtext in the stone’s transfer.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; every sentence advances either tactic or atmosphere. No loops or scaffold. Figurative language is selective—“sound like creaking wood”—and never muddies clarity. Rhythm modulates with pressure: longer reflective cadence, then clipped beats as inspectors near.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Premise—culture-shock absorber using graffiti to resist corporate gentrification—feels fresh and specific. The stone’s transformation from relic to living instruction is a non-obvious synthesis. Risk in encoding plot in street art pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
