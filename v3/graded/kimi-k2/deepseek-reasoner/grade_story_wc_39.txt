<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The poet’s drive—to translate generations—anchors every choice and survives the micro-epiphany without tidy moralizing; embodiment (“soft, percussive thump of his own heart”) links motive to action. Interiority resists therapy-speak and remains character-bound, though “gleaned redemption” flirts with summary in the final line. Earned Stasis surfaces: he accepts silence forever altered, cost legible in the single clear note that merges with his improvised symphony.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Drive lens = Accumulative/Textural: pattern of collecting, layering, and cadence shift reweights the dominant stake to one of shared inheritance. Orientation anchors early; causality holds via “because sounds were raw ➔ therefore he blended.” Closure lands as Earned Stasis—the box joins the self-made orchestra—cost felt in the relinquishing of sole authorship. No teleportation or amnesia artifacts; one minor drift: transition from beach to loft is unflagged but doesn’t confuse.</question>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dunes, driftwood loft, and crystalline note function as micro-settings constraining action; jars physically occupy table and dictate composition. Sensory focus stays selective—wind through cracks, salt crust on wood, sand grain releasing mechanism—never catalog. Final note resonates against earlier “low groan” of foghorn, recharging the beach memories inside one sunlit room.</question>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Single stake declared: repair the box; pressure tightens not via escalation but through narrowing compositional space—each opened jar reduces his remaining empty vessels and increases risk of discord. Cost accrued in jars spent, original device irreparably mute without hybrid solution. Coherence preserved under Accumulative lens; coincidence limited to wind delivering the box—allowed to complicate, not resolve.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of memory as communal song emerges organically from his labor, not sermon. The final crystalline note reframes every prior jar as ancestor voices, accomplishing Conceptual Repricing without moral. “Lonesome splendor” refrains from abstract label-izing; meaning lodged in the sonic weave.</answer>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Lyrical third-person interiority retains distinct perceptual signature—“salt-crusted music box,” “marram grass gossip”—without overwriting. Rhythm surges with long cadence then compresses during the tuning scene. One brief register drift: “gleaned redemption” momentarily lifts into thematic exposition, tamped by subsequent image of trembling steel comb. Pronouns stable; no head-hopping.</question>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose pulses with information-dense images—“a space woven from driftwood and forgotten things.” Few figurative risks avoid self-indulgence; “grain of sand dislodged” physicalizes epiphany cleanly. One mild loop: “soft, percussive thump… steady drum” could consolidate. Otherwise propulsion clean with zero paraphrase stacks, high sentence variance.</answer>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Premise of composer-poet who literally jars sounds is fresh, yet grounded in tactile ritual rather than whim. Transformation test passes: swap boxes for urns or jars for cages and the emotional engine collapses. Specificity (marram grass, foghorn pitch) prevents template drift. Minor risk—not maximal—still earns resonance through execution.</answer>
