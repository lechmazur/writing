<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s claustrophobia and notebook ritual are embodied early; the porcelain doll anchors her panic and later reweights identity. Interior contradiction—fear vs. wonder—peaks when she forces her eyes open to catalog the new silence. The final stance crystallizes with felt cost: she abandons her father’s bunker-logic and her childhood anchor. Only minor slip: “no longer her father’s daughter” is slightly abstract summary rather than dramatized renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of silences accumulates until the inversion stretches and reweights them. Orientation is immediate; causality is lyric but coherent. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the sprout on the doll reconfigures Elara’s stance toward openness with visible cost—her childhood relic is permanently altered. No causal breaks; the hour-long rule is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The xenial trellis is vivid, selective, and immediately tied to Elara’s anti-bunker desire for open air. Micro-setting (porcelain doll) constrains her grip and later becomes the site of transformation. Sensory detail is filtered through claustrophobic bias: “smooth, concrete walls” vs. “sun-drenched emptiness.” Only minor drift: “planetary core” as ceiling is briefly disorienting before inversion rule is accepted.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—collecting silences vs. fear of containment—is signaled in paragraph one. Escalation occurs via the inversion: gravity flip forces Elara to test her method (limiting exposure) and confront the new silence. Cost is tangible: the doll’s irreversible sprout marks the loss of her bunker-identity. Pressure tightens once, cleanly under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the tension between containment and openness; no explicit statement. The porcelain doll’s sprout reweights the “silence of inversion” from terror to potential, offering non-literal answer. Subtext operates in gesture: squeezing the doll vs. opening her eyes. Final image avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers in the living leaf.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Voice is lyric yet anchored in Elara’s perceptual bias—selective attention to textures of silence. Syntax modulates with stress: longer cadences calm, fragments spike during panic. No POV leakage; knowledge stays character-bound. Minor elevation in diction (“intangibly tangible”) is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and propulsive; figurative language is selective. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Occasional elevated diction (“xenial trellis,” “conceptual repricing”) is consistent with lyric mode. Clean grammar and spatial tracking.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Inversion of gravity as crucible for silence-collecting is fresh; not a trope rewrite. Porcelain doll sprouting life in anti-gravity feels inevitable yet surprising. Specificity of “flavors of silence” grounds abstraction. Risk-taking (lyric structure, minimal dialogue) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
