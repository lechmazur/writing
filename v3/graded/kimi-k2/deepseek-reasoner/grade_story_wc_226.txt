<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Kaelen's interiority is vivid and embodied; his contradictory impulses—defiance vs. the clan's safety—coexist in the same beats. The final renunciation of his voice lands with felt cost. Minor: "innocently mischievous" is stated rather than dramatized in the present crisis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each choice tightens the noose—crystal refracts → Elders react → Stone erases. Closure is a decisive change with undeniable cost: Kaelen's voice is obliterated, foreclosing his path. Orientation is clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The canyon of bone towers is not backdrop; its acoustics and ossified pillars literally constrain tactics (echo chamber for the crystal trick) and charge the final image. Micro-setting (the polished bone-plate) anchors the climax. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether the clan will keep a single truth or allow multiplicity—escalates via Kaelen's agency: each stanza raises the cost until the Elders foreclose the option. The tightening is visible and irreversible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: the violence of enforced unity refracted through Kaelen's doomed attempt. Final image—his erased voice becoming another ghost-echo—reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext in the Elders' weary finality is chilling.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; diction ("ossified pillars," "shattered doctrine") is character-specific. Rhythm modulates with tension—longer cadences for dread, clipped beats for the Stone's approach. No head-hopping; POV remains locked to Kaelen.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; each sentence advances stakes or atmosphere. Metaphors are coherent and grounded ("prisons in those pale, rib-like spires"). Zero loops or scaffold. Only a single filter-verb cluster ("he began to speak") is negligible.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: ritual memory erasure + optical refraction as rebellion. The crystal trick feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Specificity of the bone-canyon acoustics prevents generic dystopia. Risky ending—total defeat—earns its chill.</comment>
