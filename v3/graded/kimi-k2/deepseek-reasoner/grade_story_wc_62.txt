<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her shift from dutiful craft to spiritual scribe is earned through tactile micro-choices with the ribbon and the vision. The only drag is a slight over-articulation of motive (“she needed to discover…”) that edges toward label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the final image of her walking back “under the emerging stars” crystallizes the new vocation with felt cost. Causality under an Accumulative/Textural lens holds; each sensory layer (dust, wings, nectar) tightens the pattern until the re-weighting is inevitable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The greenhouse is not backdrop but pressure chamber: broken panes admit the butterfly river, humidity condenses on the ribbon, ferns frame the ghost-table. One more sensory constraint (e.g., a thorn tearing her sleeve) would have nudged 9+.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—how to give form to collective grief—tightens once: the ghost-family’s poem-trade redefines the ribbon from ornament to stanza. Cost is conceptual (she must now carve silence), but a more visceral forfeiture would have lifted the score.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: grief as remembered poetry, continuation through craft. The final image of “space for a poem” reweights every prior chisel-stroke without moralizing. Subtext hums in the overlap of spectral voices and living wings.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Voice is lapidary, tactile, and consistent; perceptual signature filters every detail through a carver’s eye (“each curve and serif a final, permanent kindness”). No head-hop, no register drift; slight rhythmic monotony in the middle paragraph keeps it from 9+.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, dense, and propulsive; figurative language is selective and purposeful. One paraphrase loop (“a silent, pulsing event that occurred…”) and a filter-verb cluster (“she felt… she understood…”) slightly dull the peak beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The synthesis—gravestone carver, spectral mentorship, butterfly migration, remembered poetry—feels inevitable and fresh. Risk lies in the quiet lyric mode; it pays off in the final reconfiguration without gimmickry.</comment>
