<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulse—clinging to power yet needing silence—drives the decisive discard of the star shard. The cost is felt in the gorge-swallow of a cherished symbol. Minor slip: “profound peace” edges toward label-speak at closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the shard’s fall reweights the premise from additive to subtractive listening. Causal chain—perigee moon → brass glow → discard → crystalline hush—holds without gaps. Cost is legible in the irreversible loss of the fragment and the absolute silence that follows.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The suspended city, rusted grate, and gorge constrain every move; the moon’s gravity literally tugs the metal, shaping Elara’s final tactic. Micro-setting—the brass shard glowing under lunar light—charges the closure image. No orientation drift; spatial anchors are crisp.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—hearing the hidden signal—tightens when Elara must choose between amplification and renunciation. The discard of the shard is the single decisive turn that forecloses her prior method and pays the price of certainty. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: beginnings are found not by adding but by stripping away. The shard’s journey from glamour to void reconfigures the motif of endings into origins without moralizing. Final image of “listening to the birth of a world” offers resonant, non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct—precise, sensorily acute, slightly lyrical yet grounded in technical diction. Rhythm modulates with pressure: longer sentences during calibration, stark fragments at the moment of discard. No POV leakage; perceptual signature remains consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and propulsive; every sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful (“serenely electric,” “shard of hush”). Zero loops or scaffold; the final paragraph crystallizes without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses celestial signal hunting with Hollywood detritus in a way that feels inevitable. The inversion—silence as signal, subtraction as revelation—is fresh and fully committed. Risky structural minimalism (single scene, no dialogue) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
