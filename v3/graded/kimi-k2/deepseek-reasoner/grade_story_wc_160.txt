<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—technical precision vs. reverence for the living mountain—are dramatized in micro-choices (chain placement, console reroute) with embodied cost. The final renunciation of Kael’s binary logic is earned by prior causality and carries visible exhaustion. Interiority is concrete, but one moment of diagnostic self-label (“compassion often wore desperate disguises”) nudges the score below 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: tremble → discovery of tampering → reroute sequence tightens options to a single viable path. Closure is a decisive change (mountain breathes, Elara’s stance crystallizes) with felt cost in her sinking onto the bench. One minor ellipsis—how she instantly identifies the polymer—keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The volcano’s breathing rhythm and the chain’s tactile feedback constrain every tactical choice; the crumbling amphitheater is not backdrop but pressure source. Sensory hierarchy is filtered through Elara’s professional eye. Final hum recharges the opening sigh, locking environment to closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—city survival vs. mountain integrity—tightens when the console lies and Kael’s sabotage forces a triangulated third path. Escalation is causal: tremble → polymer clue → reroute. Cost is legible in the groaning stone and Elara’s post-decision weight.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of harmonizing extremes emerges from concrete dilemma, not assertion. Final image of balanced breathing offers non-literal answer to the central question. One soft echo of “true harmony was never found in extremes” edges toward statement but is saved by preceding embodied cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is distinct—measured, tactile, slightly metallic—matching the POV’s engineering mind. Compression and purposeful elision (“her fingers flew”) keep momentum. No dialogue, so no voice convergence; internal texture remains coherent under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, high-density; every sentence advances. One mixed metaphor (“dappled resolve fractured”) and a filter-verb cluster (“she began to work by analyzing”) are minor artifacts that do not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Floodgate-machinist-in-volcano premise is fresh; antique chain as listening device transforms surveyor trope. Synthesis of geothermal tech and living geology feels inevitable. Risky third-path resolution is earned, not gimmick.</comment>
