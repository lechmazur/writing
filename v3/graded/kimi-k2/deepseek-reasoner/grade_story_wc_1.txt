<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elara’s interior conflict (luminous vs incinerated identity) is embodied and specific; choices reveal shifting values under pressure and culminate in an earned renunciation that forecloses rebuilding the studio.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens: a second ledger strip plus frost map build pressure cleanly to one crystallized reconfiguration—turning the furnace from creative to investigative tool—charged with cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Portals: frost-etched trail disappears at sunrise and the canyon’s micro-setting (fire-blackened box) constrain final choice; no physics break.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake flagged early; one deepening (realizing the ledger decodes caches) reweights her tactics before the final image; cost legible.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: safeguarding knowledge in quiet pauses; the ending recharges the luminous motif as invisible light without moral mini-lecture.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct lyric compression, rhythmic control under pressure; no head-hop; purposeful ellipsis in reflections is taught early and re-revealed in a final Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Minimal scaffold, high information density; occasional poetic filtering at intensity but it heightens pressure and culminates in clean diction at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Fresh transmutation of “glass vs fire” trope with specific craft logistics; invisible-light pivot feels inevitable and heightens stakes without obscurity.</comment>
