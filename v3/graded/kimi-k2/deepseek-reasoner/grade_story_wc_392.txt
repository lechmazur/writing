<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—detached investigator vs. aching witness—plays out in embodied micro-choices (touching the lantern, defying protocol). The shift from personal escape to custodial witness is earned by the causal chain of Cora’s memory and the on-page cost of abandoning departmental procedure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara’s stance crystallizes from rebellion to custodianship, the lantern reweighted as grave-marker. Causal lens holds—each beat (touch, pursuit, placement) narrows options under the entangled memory constraint—felt cost is legible in the final refusal to log and leave.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Subway tunnel’s damp gravel, rust, and culvert topography constrain every move; lantern’s placement at the dry streambed charges the final image. Sensory selection is POV-filtered and purposeful; drought residue tightens stakes without exposition.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—truth vs. departmental erasure—tightens once: the lantern’s memory forces Elara to choose witness over protocol. Agency drives escalation; the cost (career jeopardy, emotional toll) is visible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: historical erasure vs. individual witness. Subtext in the lantern’s silence and Elara’s refusal to file a report carries the weight; no moralizing, only embodied cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elara’s perceptual signature—selective, professional, then raw. Syntax tightens under memory pressure; no head-hopping, no register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, information-dense. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is sparse and purposeful. Final paragraph achieves Charged Poise without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fusion of historical artifact with speculative memory transfer feels fresh and inevitable. The Underground Railroad lantern recontextualized as data/ghost is a non-obvious synthesis that deepens stakes rather than gimmickry.</comment>
