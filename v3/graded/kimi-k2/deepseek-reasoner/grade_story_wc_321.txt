<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Leo’s “resiliently positive” trait is embodied in his refusal to see a curse, but interiority stays generic; the final beat (“tempered with a profound understanding”) is told rather than dramatized. Micro-choices under pressure are present—grabbing the radio, turning the hourglass—but the cost is more conceptual than visceral. Still, the trait drives every beat and earns the closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: turning the hourglass reconfigures reality with a visible cost—the grotto fades and Leo returns to a timeline he must now steward. Causal lens holds: each beat (radio coordinates, pedestal fit, sand reversal) links because/therefore. One minor ellipsis—how Leo “understood” the timeline duty—keeps it from 9+.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Steel deck, salty spray, and the spectral grotto are sharply sketched and filter through Leo’s trained eye. The grotto’s starlight and flickering ferry echoes constrain the final choice and charge the image. A touch more sensory narrowing under crisis would lift it higher.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore a coherent timeline—is signaled early and tightened when Leo steers toward the cavern. The reversal of the hourglass forecloses the option of returning to ignorance; the cost is the eternal vigilance implied in the final line. One tightening suffices and is felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of synchronizing impermanence emerges through the ferry’s hellos/goodbyes and the hourglass’s sideways sand; no moralizing. The final image of Leo brushing the deck while echoes linger reweights the premise with quiet cost. Subtext stays implicit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Voice is steady, maritime, and lightly lyrical; perceptual signature shows in “salt-spray smile” and “starlight that did not come from any sky he knew.” No head-hopping or register drift. Compression in the grotto section is purposeful and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and propulsive; only minor scaffold (“the ferry would always be…”) slows the final paragraph. Metaphors are fresh and coherent. No loops or mixed vehicles in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The vanishing-ferry conceit is familiar, but the sideways-flowing hourglass and radio-timeslip collage give it a fresh, non-obvious twist. Specific maritime detail and the final reconfiguration of transience as stewardship feel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
