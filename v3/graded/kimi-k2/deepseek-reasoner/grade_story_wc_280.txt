<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—yearning for witness yet fearing finality—surface in the moment she chooses to “pour more of herself” into the memory, a micro-choice that visibly costs her spectral cohesion. Leo’s synesthetic perception is embodied (taste of blood, scent of hemp) and drives his decision to kneel and anchor rather than flee. The final bow is earned because every echo has tightened the stakes toward acknowledgment, not escape. Only the slight abstraction of “spectral core” keeps it from 9+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara’s timeline mends not by reversal but by being witnessed, and Leo’s palm closing over the coin is the decisive anchor that reconfigures both fates. Causal chain is tight—each echo Elara releases narrows Leo’s options until he must act. Cost is legible in Elara’s final fade and the coin’s now-absolute silence. Lens is causal throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The orchard-within-maze functions as micro-setting: the rustling leaves become the medium for echoes, and the fallen coin on grass is the spatial pivot that constrains Leo’s kneel. Sensory selection is POV-filtered (Leo tastes music, smells rope). Only the phrase “mystic orchard garden” flirts with generic placeholder, preventing 9+.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Elara’s need to be witnessed—escalates with each echo that bleeds her remaining coherence. The tightening is visible: from curiosity to full surrender of her last prop. Leo’s agency anchors the final cost. One more beat of tangible consequence for Leo would have pushed it to 9+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of acknowledgment versus erasure emerges through concrete sensory echoes rather than statement. The coin’s reprise as cool, solid weight in Leo’s palm reweights the entire haunting from tragedy to gift. No moralizing—just the quiet reconfiguration of grief into shared memory.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is synesthetically textured without purple drift: “the crunch of gravel underfoot tasted of stale bread” is specific and character-bound. Rhythm modulates with pressure—longer cadence for Elara’s melancholy, clipped fragments during the rigging collapse. No head-hopping; focalization remains cleanly split by section.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “a cascade of silver and blue threads weaving through the apple trees” does triple duty (image, synesthesia, stakes). No loops or scaffold. Only a single mixed metaphor—“spectral core”—keeps it from 9+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The synesthetic ghost-encounter trope is transformed through Leo’s embodied perception and Elara’s tarot-coin medium, making the haunting a two-way sensory translation rather than spectacle. The final bow to a single witness feels inevitable yet fresh. Risk in structure (no dialogue, pure sensory montage) heightens coherence.</comment>
