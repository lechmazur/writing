<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her finger on the wall, the ache in her hand—yet the “ignorance cartographer” label is asserted more than dramatized; the final resolve is earned, but the contradiction between fear and duty could be sharper in-scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the blueprint commits her irrevocably, the lake’s groan confirms commencement, and the cost is the risk of heresy; causal chain from data → model → inscription holds under a Causal lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The obsidian spire and frozen lake are atmospheric anchors, but the kingfisher feather quill is the micro-setting that finally constrains choice—its iridescence against monochrome charges the act of writing; spatial grounding is immediate and tactile.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—break stagnation or starve—is signaled early; pressure tightens when doubt threatens to freeze her hand; the decisive act forecloses the safety of old ways with visible risk.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of innovation-through-constraint emerges organically from the ice, the model, and the quill; the final image of the tremoring lake reweights the premise without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is precise, tactile, and slightly elevated to match the cerebral stakes; no head-hops, no filter-verb clutter; rhythm modulates with pressure—long sentences for modeling, clipped final strokes.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and propulsive; only minor scaffold (“thick and cold as the ice”) and one mixed metaphor (“pregnant with possibility and dread”) keep it from 9.0; no loops or register drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The “ignorance cartographer” premise and icy aquaculture blueprint feel fresh; synthesis of science, myth, and politics is specific and inevitable in hindsight; risk-taking (heresy, fragile model) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
