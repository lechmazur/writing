<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara’s prosopagnosia and artistic gift are shown in action, not labels; her interior contradiction—seeing truth through absence—drives every choice. The final empathy surge is embodied in the “raw and aching connection” rather than declared. Only a slight over-articulation of motive (“not justice, not exactly”) keeps it from 9+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the drawing reconfigures the case’s premise by revealing the twin. Causality is causal-deductive; each inference (ribbon → mask → twin) is legible. One transition (mist lifting / sun verdict) is crisp. A hairline slip: the off-stage removal of evidence is asserted, not dramatized.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The quarry’s “bowl of furrowed hush” and coiling mist act as pressure vessel; the ribbon fragment becomes micro-setting that constrains her reconstruction. Sensory selection is POV-filtered and purposeful. The final ray of sun striking the wall recharges the opening image with cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—awakening empathy through solving the case—is signaled early and tightened when the twin insight forecloses the “wrong face” path. The cost is the emotional blow she now must carry to the police. Agency is cerebral yet irreversible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the paradox of blindness yielding vision; the mask motif shifts from disguise to revelation without explicit statement. Subtext in the final “phantom face on her paper” reweights the entire premise. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in the unrecognizable face.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is painterly, compressed, and consistent: “furrowed hush,” “cold, grey breath.” Prosopagnosic perception is rendered through selective sensory gaps. No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates with emotional intensity. Rhythm accelerates during the deductive cascade.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; each sentence advances knowledge or atmosphere. Metaphors (“bowl of furrowed hush”) are precise and non-contradictory. No loops or scaffold. Minor elevated diction (“preternatural”) is voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The prosopagnosic portraitist solving a cold case by drawing absence is a fresh synthesis. The twin twist grows organically from the mask ribbon rather than gimmickry. Specificity of artistic process and quarry atmosphere prevents template feel.</comment>
