<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her shift from hunter to surrender is dramatized through micro-choices (sitting to read the diary as confession). The time traveler remains a flickering prop rather than a second character, so relationship crucible is absent. Flaws (arrogance, impatience) are shown via future-self indictment, not just labels. Final renunciation carries felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the library’s true nature reweights the quest and seals the corridor behind them. Causal chain holds—diary leads to surrender, surrender opens path, path rescues traveler. One clean transition (corridor appears) is legible. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 3. Cost is legible in the sealed corridor and the kept diary.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The mountain-bookstore is atmospheric and specific—“shifting pages and settling dust” filters through Elara’s perception. Micro-setting (crumbling alcove, ozone breeze) constrains her search and later enables the corridor. Spatial choreography is coherent; no floating rooms. Final image of shadow-and-starlight shelves charges the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—save the traveler by finding the library—is signaled early and tightened when the diary warns of paradox. Escalation is one deepening: quest reframed from hunt to surrender. Agency remains with Elara; coincidence does not resolve. Cost is the irreversible sealing of the path and the internal unlearning.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: wisdom through humility, rescue via self-confrontation. Subtext lives in the diary’s future-tense warnings and the metallic flowers. Final image of “gracefully forgotten” lessons reweights the premise without moralizing. No thematic echo; complexity preserved.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise—“unheard symphony,” “sputtering glow-globe”—anchored in Elara’s arcane-linguist perceptual bias. Syntax modulates with pressure: longer sentences for reflection, clipped fragments when the corridor appears. No dialogue, so no register clash. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; each sentence layers scent, texture, or motion. No loops or scaffold; “ozone and old paper” is fresh. Metaphors are coherent—“tomes of humility”—and never muddle causality. Rhythm accelerates at the corridor reveal, then settles into the final chord.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise fuses Borgesian library with time-loop confession; the diary-from-the-future twist feels inevitable in hindsight. Tropes (labyrinth, time traveler) are transformed through scent-map and self-indictment. Specificity of metallic flowers and cypher grounds the concept. Risky surrender structure pays off.</comment>
