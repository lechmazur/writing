<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is strong, motivation of “professional curiosity sharpens into singular desperation” is dramatized via micro-choices with the shard; contradictory impulses felt in the last jump and in holding the regret alone. Cost shows, but relationship crucible is offscreen; regret remains abstract. Enough earned stasis with Elara’s sigil addition, though the withheld truth itself is simple.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal lens (because/therefore jumps) holds: each shard-use escalates emotional load and narrows options to the final universe visit. Closure is an Earned Stasis: Elara does not alter the past, maps it, accepts cost in her sigil. One felt beat. No orientation debt; geography and timeline anchored.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Micro-setting of repair bay and the shard itself constrain choices (shard’s warmth limits further jumps). Sensory detail is vivid and POV-filtered: “phantom scent of ozone,” “echo of long-silent alarm.” Dockyard silence and derelict hulls are tactile; final shift to same bay with living regret reweights the backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of “discover withheld truth” is signaled immediately; emotional cost accumulates shard by shard. Each universe visit is a deepening that intensifies regret load; no resolution, only crystallized regret, which for the situational lens counts as foreclosing alternative relief. Legible price in exhaustion Elara carries.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from Elara’s map as living residue and the cost of knowing personal failures. Subtext: the “silent dockyards of the heart.” No moralizing; the green sigil is earned reflection, not tagline. Emotional honesty in regret without tidy moral—ambiguity lingers in collective memory.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is immersive and singular: “cartographer of the intangible,” “synesthetic tapestry.” Tense and stance stable; POV never slips. Compression in inter-universe jumps is purposeful and legible. Final dialogue has subtle subtext: “It never gets easier, does it?”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Ear test clean: rhythm breathes between dense sensory lines and concise action. No paraphrase loops; “murder of rust” avoided. A single mixed metaphor (“cyclically spontaneous”) drifts above POV lexicon late, –0.2; otherwise diction serves pressure. Final cadence earned.</comment>

<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Sensory cartography of emotional residue is fresh, non-obvious. Trope of parallel-jump regret is transformed through object-as-memory shard that bears literal heat. Synthesis between ghost-viewing and map-making feels inevitable at closure. Risk heightens stakes (heart repair rather than ship repair) without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
