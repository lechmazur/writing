<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara’s need to belong is vivid and embodied; her hand-aching drive to weave permanence anchors motivation early and governs every beat. Interior contradiction—longing vs. fear of rootlessness—peaks in the reed-climb up obsidian; the final choice to build the lattice rather than expose the artist earns enduring, visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Causal chain is tight: lantern-search → find hut → vow → public lattice-dedication; each step narrows Elara’s options. Closure reconfigures community meaning without betrayal; luminescent moss glow becomes the collaborative tag, foreclosing both secrecy and her solitary art with material stake.</comment>

<comment>Crystalline orchard is tactile—glinting fruit, crater rim—its space channels gatherings and reagents (moss-wash). Micro-obsidian’s sharp edge repurposed as living canvas forces spatial choreography and final image, constraining final choice.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—public identity—tightens with every shared clue; discovering the artist’s hideout forces Elara to decide secrecy vs. welcome. Cost: she exposes only her own offer first, tangible Reed-fiber cost glowing on arbor.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of communal graft insists that art must belong; each clue of outsider longing mirrors Elara’s own. Subtext: tag is love-letter, not defacement; ending bridges solitude and belonging without tidy moral.</comment>

<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Tactile verb-strings (“hummed,” “glowed,” “weave”) synchronize with heartbeat rhythm; compression lifts during lattice-fever dream. POV steady in seeing and naïve inference; no head-hop.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Clean, image-rich prose—no loops. Density high: one line (“reed lattice climbed the dark obsidian and fractured sunset into needles”) does triple duty. Minimal filter verbs; late clauses accelerate breath.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Marsh-reed sculptor meets elusive moss-artist is fresh framing; tag-as-love-letter subverts vandal trope. Architected lattice becomes visible handshake, inevitable in hindsight, fits length without gimmickry.</comment>
