<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—her craving for isolation versus the geologist’s plea—are dramatized in the moment she descends the attic stairs. The embodied cost of re-entering trust is visible in the trembling hands and direct eye contact at the post office. One slip: the phrase “preserve the echo of lost songs” edges toward label-speak rather than lived memory.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The causal chain holds: meteorite arrival → data confession → paper-trail hunt → personal delivery. Closure lands as a Decisive Change with felt cost: she trades her dust-mote sanctuary for the risk of human contact. The lens is clearly Causal; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The attic’s dust motes under the skylight function as micro-setting that constrains her meditation and later recharges the final image. Sensory detail is selective—decaying paper, cold stone—filtered through her courier’s precision. The bookshop itself is sketched just enough to anchor space without clutter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether to re-engage trust—tightens once: from refusal to act to walking to the post office. The cost is visible in the tremor of purpose replacing fear. No escalation loops; one decisive turn suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: trust as a fragile song that must be sung anew, not merely echoed. The final image of “a new, fragile note of her own” reweights the earlier “echo of lost songs” without moralizing. Subtext in the silence after betrayal is handled through gesture, not statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is precise, courier-bred, with rhythmic control under pressure: “the weight of a message, the span of a wing.” Compression is purposeful; no head-hopping. One minor register drift: “conceptual repricing” feels academic, but it occurs outside the POV’s interiority.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, propulsive, and information-dense. No loops or scaffold. Metaphors are spare and apt: “a digital scream into the void.” One near-redundancy—“terrifying, exhilarating balance”—but it lands within a high-pressure beat and is quickly sharpened by the next clause.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of courier logistics, Martian extinction, and personal betrayal feels inevitable in hindsight. The meteorite chip re-weights from scientific curiosity to existential mirror without gimmickry. Risk-taking in the quiet, non-thriller treatment of conspiracy pays off.</comment>
