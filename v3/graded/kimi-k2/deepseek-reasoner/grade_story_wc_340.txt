<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Kael’s finely-etched interiority—warm inquiry colliding with quiet detachment—drives every beat: the micro-choice to lift the goggles and read the diary is a direct product of his described trait. His compulsion to “seek joy beneath anguish” constrains later tactics like the smiley-face packet. A credible endurance (renouncing formal power yet serving Elias) closes one route at cost. Minor slip: name drift “Elias” vs “new resident”.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal engine: because Althea’s diary exists, therefore Kael acts, therefore Elias reconnects. Closure choice—Kael quietly steps back—has felt cost (service but no ownership) and forecloses a relationship path. Vine-tight orientation from frost viewport to penthouse table. Patterned elision of backstory fits lens. No causality breaks.</comment>

<comment>Frost-spire viewport is immediately anchored; body-as-tool (hands lifting goggles) constrains the perception choice; diary object charges final image. Small object (goggles) recurs as filter for the light trick that unlocks plot. Setting energy oppresses mood yet enables the scattered-light method. External but elegant.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: ferry joy past sorrow. Escalation: fifth-floor frost → penthouse blank stare → laughter memory forced by diary artifact. Agency in unfolding packet pays visible price (removes barrier, not solves root), tightening options. Coincidence (sun break) complicates, not resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through diary entries: small surrenders against vast loneliness. Subtext in smiley-face gag reweights prior ache with tender absurdity. Cliosing diary pressed to chest recharges concept—joy survives the anguish—without stated moral. Explicit expression kept spare.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Distinct, restrained lyric voice: “quiet compulsion,” “rained anguish,” “phosphor-dusted lens.” Free indirect style remains taut during sun-beam moment. POV modesty—Kael’s knowledge never exceeds his role. Dialogue blunted yet charged. Zero slippage under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Propulsive rhythm, minimal scaffold, every sentence advances cause or image. “Bloom of frost” → “shook the rigging” tight turns. No looped phrase or purple muddle. Line-level clarity sustains the climax. Minor tick: “rigging” for airship metaphor could read posed.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Pre-industrial spire diary + paradigm goggles create fresh variant on haunted-hand-me-down trope. Modifier “icebound” rather than generic gothic. Final prismatic reveal reconfigures familiar item into plot key. Quiet originality avoids flourish.</comment>
