<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s claustrophobia and mission to “stand by the unremembered” are stated early and embodied in her hitching breath and trembling hands; the final choice to risk phase-transition extraction is consistent with her stated motive. Interiority is concrete, but the shift from fear to resolve is compressed into a single beat rather than layered. The cost—abandoning the dead to finish the work—lands as Earned Stasis, though the emotional price is more asserted than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara steps through sound to the surface, the Codex now dormant, the facility collapsing behind her. Causal chain holds—Codex activates array, array enables escape—under a Causal lens. Orientation is clear by line 5; no drift. The only minor slip is the late reveal of the Emergency Protocol, but it is foreshadowed by the waveform console.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The abyssal plain, breached dome, and anemone-grown corridors are vivid and selective; pressure and darkness constrain every move. The gold-flecked Codex doubles as micro-setting and tool, its shimmer charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions. One minor over-description (“skeletal structure of rusting metal”) slows the descent beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—retrieve Codex and survive—is signaled in paragraph one. Pressure tightens once: tidal change collapses the exit, forcing the phase gamble. Cost is visible—she leaves the dead behind—and the choice is hers. No reversals beyond the single decisive turn, sufficient for length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of giving voice to the silenced emerges through the Codex and the abandoned lab rather than exposition. Final image—sun-warmed deck against crushing dark—reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext is present but slightly undercut by the explicit “her work had only just begun.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elara’s sensory filter; diction is precise and marine-specific (“liquid weight,” “pale, ghostly anemones”). Rhythm accelerates during the phase transition, mirroring disorientation. No dialogue, so voice consistency is judged solely on narrative texture, which holds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is lean and propulsive; every sentence advances image or tension. Occasional stacked modifiers (“crushing, liquid weight, a crashing hush”) flirt with overwriting but serve tone. No loops or scaffold. One typo risk—“one thousand meters underwater” could read smoother as “a thousand metres down”—but clarity is intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fusion of deep-sea claustrophobia with quantum-tracking array feels fresh; the Codex as acoustic calibrator is a non-obvious pivot. Premise commits fully; no late rule changes. Risky phase-transition escape is foreshadowed and pays off. Derivative echoes are minimal.</comment>
