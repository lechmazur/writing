<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—practical mender vs. mythic restorer—surface in the embodied act of “sewing stone,” but the interior split is stated more than dramatized until the final stitch. The sleepwalking inheritance is evocative yet functions as inherited magic rather than a flaw that complicates her choice. Still, her calloused fingers, net, and song give her a distinct perceptual signature, and the earned ache at dawn carries cost. Cap stays at 8.7 because no interior contradiction actively threatens success inside the critical beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the first trickle re-weights the entire premise, making the fracture not erased but adorned, with the price of her night-long trance and bodily ache visible in the final image. Causal chain holds: illustration plate → sleepwalking navigation → kelp-twine seam → water released. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are taught by line 3 and re-anchored at every shard break; no orientation debt. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of ghost-walkers, dust, song—crystallizes in the single water-thread without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The red canyon walls, salt-grass dust, and starlit copper plate are not backdrop; their grit literally passes through the needle and into the seam, so environment constrains and enables the final repair. Micro-setting (the fissure’s lip, the plate’s etched channels) is handled in motion as she kneels and stitches. Sensory hierarchy follows Elara’s wharf-trained eye: texture first, then sound of water. No static postcarding; every descriptor feeds the sewing action or the eventual trickle.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore the spring—signaled in paragraph 1 and tightened when the fissure silences it. One meaningful deepening: ghosts’ overlapping paths converge, adding ancestral pressure without external antagonist. Cost is legible—her blistered palms, the trance-risk, the irreversible dawn—but the beat-to-beat escalation is more accretive than sharply reversed. Sufficient for 600-word scope, yet a second micro-turn could have pushed higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of “repair as reverence” emerges from the literal sewing of ruin, never sermonized. The orchid-solace tone and the adorning-not-erasing ethic reprice the concept of healing without moralizing. Final image of water singing back crystallizes the thematic shift. One faint echo of abstraction—“path from ruin to reverence” in opening—keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays tightly fused to Elara’s wharf-weaver idiom: “calloused fingers,” “kelp-twine,” “hauntingly optimistic hum.” Rhythm compresses under pressure—single-clause sentences during stitching—then widens at the water release. No head-hopping; ghosts remain external silhouettes. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or action. Figurative language is sparse, patterned, and paid off: “orchid solace” returns as the scent of repaired stone. No mixed metaphors or register drift. Opening and closing lines book-end with sonic echo (“hum” / “sang it back”), creating purposeful cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fusing net-mending with geological suturing feels inevitable yet fresh; the sleepwalking matrilineal GPS is a risk that pays off inside the accretive logic. Transformation test fails if relocated to another biome, confirming specificity. No trope recycling without inversion. Slight deduction for faint eco-mythic familiarity, but the tactile execution redeems.</comment>
