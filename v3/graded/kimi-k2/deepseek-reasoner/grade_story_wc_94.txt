<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—compliance vs. witness—drives every beat; the embodied shift from archivist to witness is earned by the ticking timer and the poem’s cost. Micro-choice of reading aloud to the storm crystallizes her hierarchy of values with visible risk.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (storm, timer, poem) tightens stakes until the final ventilation-shaft dispatch reweights meaning. Closure is a Charged Poise—truth now airborne—cost paid by the patrol countdown and her forfeited anonymity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stormlit observatory constrains every move: open dome exposes her, wind snatches words, lightning maps scars. The darkroom timer and ventilation shaft act as micro-settings that enable the final act; environment is inseparable from tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve vs. release the poem—tightens once: the rarefaction decision narrows options from hiding to weaponizing memory. Cost is the patrol sweep and the irreversible broadcast of her brother’s voice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of truth as living storm emerges through concrete acts: lightning reveals, thunder affirms, poem disperses. Final image of the city unknowingly inhaling the rarefied truth offers non-literal resonance without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is poet-archivist: precise, sensorily acute, rhythm modulating with wind and heartbeat. No head-hop; perceptual signature filters every detail through her scar-map lens. Compression (“furiously tranquil”) is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language serves pressure (“storm-kissed wonder”) without clutter. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances stakes or atmosphere. Final line’s “scar upon the flawless skin of the night” crystallizes without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Familiar dystopia transformed through lyric meteorology and the rarefaction conceit; the poem-as-virus angle feels fresh and inevitable. Risky dispatch into ventilation system pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
