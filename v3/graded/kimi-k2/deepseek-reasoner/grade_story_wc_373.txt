<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is embodied and specific—her “frantic drum” heart, the “silent and sure” gait—yet her contradictory impulses (loyalty vs. betrayal) remain mostly summarized rather than dramatized in-scene. The final renunciation is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost (the broken fob, Silas’s shame), satisfying the 9+ quick test, but the emotional layering under peak pressure could be sharper.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds cleanly: each beat tightens options—failed bump, paranoia learned, frog distraction, fob click—until the decisive change lands on-page with felt cost (Silas’s shame, Elara’s heavier satchel). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the truce of hush is broken by sound itself. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The rotting-pier market is vivid, selective, and filtered through Elara’s practiced eye; salt/decay/whispers anchor atmosphere without catalog. The fob functions as micro-setting that constrains the final choice, but the broader environment could have pressed one more tactical limit to reach 9+.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“capture the sound of trust breaking”—is signaled early and escalates through each failed attempt until the fob-click crystallizes the cost. Agency drives every turn; coincidence only distracts. The tightening is singular but sufficient for 600–800 words.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of trust-as-sound emerges organically from the fob’s click and the truce of hush; no moralizing. The final image reweights the premise: betrayal is audible, irreversible. Subtext in Silas’s wordless shame deepens resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct, tactile, and consistent—Elara’s perceptual signature (“moss-slick ladder,” “brackish air”) stays controlled under pressure. No head-hopping; free indirect style is clean. Compression and purposeful elision (e.g., “she didn’t bump into him”) heighten tension.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and propulsive; every sentence advances story or atmosphere. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Figurative language is sparse and precise (“metallic sigh of betrayal”). Final line lands with cadence and charge.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Familiar noir tropes (smugglers, betrayal, dawn escape) are transformed through the acoustic twist of “sound of trust breaking” and the fob’s mechanical intimacy. The synthesis feels inevitable yet fresh; risk is measured and coherent.</comment>
