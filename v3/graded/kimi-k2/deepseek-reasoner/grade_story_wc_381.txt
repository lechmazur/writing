<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied (“a quiet so profound it felt terrestrially cosmic”), motives are singular and intensify under pressure; the final renunciation—letting the wing go—carries visible cost. Flaw: no contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene; the summoner’s struggle is purely reactive to the prophecy’s assault rather than an internal split.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the prophecy is silenced, the wing released, and the hush becomes a dreaming presence. Causal chain (mapping silence → weaving → release) holds; cost is legible in “weary to his bones.” Lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of silence increases until it reweights the world.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Brook, moss, willow, and paper wing are tactile micro-settings that constrain the summoner’s method; the wing’s final ascent charges the cosmic closure. Sensory selection is purposeful and POV-filtered; no orientation drift. One notch below 9+ only because the environment does not actively resist him—constraint is more conceptual than physical.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—silence the prophecy—is signaled early and escalates through psychic assault; the final absorption of noise into the wing is a decisive tightening. Cost is felt, but escalation is largely external (prophecy fights back) rather than a narrowing of the summoner’s own options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of silence as active, healing force emerges organically from the summoner’s craft and the wing’s trajectory. Final image reweights the premise: silence is no longer absence but “a quiet that dreamed.” No moralizing; resonance is earned through concrete particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet disciplined, with rhythmic control (“smoothed hush,” “terrestrially cosmic”) that mirrors the summoner’s inward focus. Perceptual signature is consistent; no head-hop or register drift. Compression and elision are taught early and paid off in the silent flash.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet clear; figurative language is selective and purposeful. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Sentence rhythm modulates with pressure—long, flowing lines in calm moments, clipped fragments during the psychic assault. Closure image is unmarred by artifacts.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—cartographer of silence using an origami wing to absorb a coded prophecy—is fresh and non-obvious. Risky lyric mode is fully committed and coherent. Specificity of “moth’s-breath paper” and “white scar against the dark sky” anchors universals without cliché.</comment>
