<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Kaelen’s interior contradiction—searing impatience versus the need for glacial vigilance—is embodied in every micro-choice: the taut economy of his movements against the humming lodestone, the decision to release the counterweights. His motivation scales visibly with pressure across each beat and culminates in an Earned Stasis that carries real, felt cost.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Causal (Accumulative/Textural hybrid but Causal dominant). Closure is delivered on-page as a conceptual repricing: the viaduct’s new, patient arc is the visible cost—his lifelong impatience finally shaped into legacy. The chain—data gathering → anomaly → theory → relinquishment—shows clean linkage under this lens.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vivid, selective details (basalt chamber, ice-glint, lodestone hum) consistently constrain choices: the iron viaduct literally pulls his metal boots, anchoring the final decision. The micro-setting of the magnetic viaduct becomes the final image that reconfigures the horizon; lake and rock function as one mutable frame rather than ornamental postcard.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>The dominant stake—prove perception fluid without domination—tightens in one decisive intensification when the magnetic anomaly bends the moon path. Agency culminates in the deliberate release of counterweights; the price is the mapper’s permanent erasure from his own discovery, a felt loss that reweights the final image under the causal lens.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>‘Fluid horizons’ emerges non-declaratively through concrete experience: his boots pulled by iron, the moon bent by mathematics, the viaduct left alive without its maker. The final image asks the reader to inhabit a world where limits are contingent, refusing tidy moral and instead offering conceptual repricing.</comment>

<comment>Narrative stance stays taut in Kaelen’s singular perceptual signature: volcanic pores, “lodestone sphere that hummed,” moon paths sketched in silver. Syntax tightens under pressure—“the crunch ... the distant groan”—yet remains legible when the pattern expands at closure.</comment>  
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Precise imagistic diction: “thousand crystalline pearls” instead of generic ice; no paraphrase loops or template stems until the penultimate sentence’s “gentlest, most purposeful of trajectories” which is earned by prior accretion, barely crossing into abstraction. Momentum sustained.</comment>  
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of magnetic anomaly as cosmic lens is non-obvious and fully integrated; the story hinges on a quiet act of surrender rather than a coup de science. The final image carries both personal and civilizational scale without recourse to familiar tropes, creating freshness that feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
