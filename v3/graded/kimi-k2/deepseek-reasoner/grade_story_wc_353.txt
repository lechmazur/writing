<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aris’s interiority is embodied and specific; the moment he “let his own breath slow, his heartbeat quiet” crystallizes his empathy as a felt cost. Motivation is singular and intensifies to the final act of strumming the insulator. The earned change—world made resonant—carries visible price in his bodily surrender. No contradictory impulses on page, yet the arc is coherent and affecting.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the grove’s silence becomes symphony through Aris’s decisive strum, cost paid in his self-emptying. Causal linkage is tight—because he listens, therefore the note answers. Orientation anchors by line 4; lens (Causal) holds without drift. No teleporting props or retro-patches.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The petrified alder grove is tactile and constraining; the “frozen monument” and “wound in the sculpture” charge the final image. Micro-setting (the crack) literally guides the strum. Sensory economy favors touch and sound; no white-room syndrome. Environment evolves from mute to resonant under causal pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore music to silence—is signaled in line 1 and tightened by each strum. Agency is continuous: every beat is Aris’s choice to risk himself. Cost is embodied heat transfer and the final surrender of control. No coincidence; escalation is driven by his empathic action.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: art as listening, creation as healing. Subtext lives in the insulator’s shift from relic to conduit. Final image—grove chiming—offers non-literal answer without moralizing. No thematic echo or late abstraction; resonance is earned through concrete particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise; “cathedral of stillness” and “silver thread of sound” are character-true. Syntax modulates with pressure—short percussive clauses at climax. No head-hopping; POV remains interior and stable. Compression is purposeful and legible at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; every sentence advances music or silence. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Rhythm accelerates through strum sequence without clutter. Final paragraph crystallizes earlier motifs cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Premise—last tree-song sculptor reviving petrified grove—is fresh synthesis of eco-fantasy and acoustic magic. Tropes transformed through embodied empathy rather than spellcraft. Specificity of porcelain insulator as resonator feels inevitable. Risk is quiet yet stakes feel large.</comment>
