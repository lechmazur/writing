<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's interiority—her guilt, yearning, and bodily response to deceit—is richly embodied, and her solitary confession in the Aviary carries visible cost; the moment she names her fear is earned and forecloses her path of complicity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The final golden “Listen” provides a clear Resonant Reconfiguration: a conceptual repricing that reweights silence itself as the new obligation; lens is Accumulative/Textural with a cadence shift that lands on-page cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Glass-latticed Veridia, the brass scent of decay, the zinc fragment’s tactile chill—details are selective, bias-filtered, and culminate in the Aviary’s skeletal avians charged by the final glow; one setting element constrains the choice.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Stakes are personal and legible: complicity versus truth; one sharp micro-escalation occurs when Candor becomes the literal required coin. Yet the external system tension (the city’s scarcity) remains backdrop; pressure tightens internally rather than by cascading crisis.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The story refracts its central theme through every beat: candor versus elaborate façade. The Aviary machine literalises the theme, and the final word “Listen” is an earned conceptual epiphany rather than an exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Lush, ornate diction mirrors Elara’s gilded craft yet tightens under pressure—“wilt,” “malachite,” “avian cathedral”—all contained within her sensory register; no line-level drift, and rhythmic control matches beat urgency.</comment>

<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Virtually no scaffolding: each sentence forwards image, decision, or tension. Occasional lyrical density is purposeful and pattern-taught. Clean quote mechanics and no loops; final sentence crystallizes without figurative muddle.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dishonesty-triggered wilt, gold-ink contracts, zinc legend as truth-currency—specific synthesis that feels fresh and inevitable. Minor proximity to “truth machine” trope is transformed by bodily cost and miniature scale.</comment>
