<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“dimensionally homesick” as a gnawing ache), and her micro-choice to hurl the pendant is earned by the guardian’s revealed plight. The guardian’s shift from growl to chuffing nudge shows credible pressure, but the beast’s interior remains opaque, limiting relationship crucible depth.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the pendant’s ejection reconfigures the boundary of light and costs Elara her last tether to the dream. Causal chain—pendant → decay → guardian’s fear → Elara’s act—holds under a Causal lens. No orientation drift; anchors are clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Frozen garden, obsidian pendant, and light-boundary are specific, sensory, and constrain choice (the pendant’s cold bite, the fraying film). The garden’s metamorphosis into library interior is spatially coherent and charges the final image. Meets 9+ gate: the boundary film directly shapes the decisive act.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Elara’s need to understand her homesickness—tightens when she sees the guardian’s parallel displacement. One meaningful escalation: the boundary’s visible fraying forces the throw. Cost is felt in the pendant’s loss and the dream’s dissolution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of embracing uncertainty emerges through concrete action (waiting, listening, throwing) rather than statement. The final image—library walls solidifying—offers a resonant, non-literal answer: acceptance stabilizes both worlds. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with controlled rhythm (“a temporary ghost in the perpetual mist”). Perceptual signature is consistent: Elara notices cold, light, and silence through a displaced dreamer’s lens. No POV leakage; compression is purposeful and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and motion. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is selective (“spirals that seemed to drink the faint light”). Final beat is unmarred by overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: dream-archive guarded by a feral beast, homesickness as dimensional echo. Tropes (dream quest, guardian) are transformed through tactile specificity and causal linkage. Risky interiorizing-exteriors device pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
