<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority—“to transform the scar…into a story of strength”—drives every beat; the crystallization attribute, panic, and subsequent superstition-led “shedding choice” crystallize contradictory impulses under pressure and force a visible cost (renunciation of old self-shield) that lands on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The causal drive—“because the rune threatens rupture, therefore she must revise tactics mid-gasp”—leads to Earned Stasis: the scar becomes strength, the old wound is foreclosed with “one final lungful of cost.” Orientation anchors fast; no breaks, zero exposition dump. Closure unit meets all gates.</question>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Atmosphere is selective (sky-void hush, ink of starlight, crystalline facets) fused with body-as-setting; floating platform is backdrop only, but the living scar constrains the final choice. One spatial anchor suffices; no constraint beyond scene needs, so lands just short of 9 gate.</question>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—turn pain into chronicle—is signaled early, tightened by escalating crystalline agony; “shedding the defensive skin” costs prior power, narrowing choices. The single micro-turn (shift from suppression to alchemy) is causally driven and price-visible.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Theme—“pain as text, not verdict”—emerges via embodied choice, not commentary. Folktale superstition reweighted into adult agency creates subtextual resonance: “exhale becomes history.” Avoids moralizing; the final image is earned reconfiguration.</question>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Distinct lyric texture—“ink swirled with captured starlight,” “hush lifted by meaning”—modulates breath with pressure. Compression taught early, paid at closure. No head-hop, no register drift; focalization coherent.</question>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with tension; high information density without redundancy. One faint scaffold (“the moment of truth, the point of no return”)—ignored under strict cut test—doesn’t obscure the payoff image. Ear and clarity hold.</question>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</question><comment>Fresh twist: scar-alchemy by ritualized breath-holding folklore fused with microscopic crystal magic. Premise feels inevitable in hindsight. One derivative echo—“eyes like river stones”—keeps it shy of 9+.</question>
