<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Eli’s guilt and vocational doubt are embodied through tactile micro-choices (handling the heart, winding the key) and culminate in a credible shift from guilt to vocational redefinition. The internal contradiction—minister who doubts his own efficacy—drives every beat. Cost is visible: he purchases the heart, committing to a new practice. Minor slip: Cole remains off-page, so relationship crucible is inferred, not dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single-scene structure under Causal lens: Eli’s failure → seeking repair → receiving heart → realization → purchase. Orientation anchored by line 3; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where Eli reframes ministry from speech to tool-giving. Cost is the literal price paid and the irrevocable shift in self-definition. No causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Antique shop is rendered through scent, dust, ticking, and prismatic light; every detail either pressures Eli’s guilt or enables the epiphany. The heart itself becomes micro-setting that constrains choice (only one key, one winding). Light mechanics are physically plausible and thematically charged. No spatial drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: can Eli convert apology into effective ministry? Pressure tightens when Anya offers the heart; the decisive turn is Eli’s choice to buy it, foreclosing the option of continued guilt-laden speechifying. Cost is money and the irreversible commitment to a new method. Escalation is causal and character-driven.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: grace is not earned but witnessed, and ministry is tool-giving, not absolution. Subtext in Anya’s “light does not ask” line reframes the entire preceding guilt arc. Final image of light dancing on prison walls reweights prior darkness without moralizing. Avoids tidy binaries.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly inside Eli’s perceptual filter; sensory bias favors ecclesiastical and mechanical imagery. Diction is precise, rhythmic, and unshowy. Anya’s dialogue carries subtext and propels the plot. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, vivid, and propulsive; every sentence advances character or atmosphere. Metaphors (light breaking through clouds) are integrated and paid off. No loops, scaffold, or filter-verb clutter. Rhythm modulates with emotional pressure. Clean mechanics.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Transforms familiar redemption arc via clockwork heart as literal tool of grace. Antique-shop-as-confessional is fresh, and the vocational reframing avoids sermon clichés. Specificity of brass gears and prismatic light anchors universals. No derivative echoes.</comment>
