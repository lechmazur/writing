<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is precise and embodied; the worry-stone micro-choice anchors her arc. The exile motive is clear, but the “discover beauty” drive is asserted more than dramatized until the final beat. The shift from exile to bittersweet home is earned and carries cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the lodestone shift re-weights the covenant and her exile status. Causal linkage holds—every beat flows from watching sand → decoding silence → decisive move. Cost is legible in the lingering melancholy.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The magnetic nexus is vivid, selective, and causally active; the iron sand’s motion literally guides her choice. The twilight palette mirrors internal twilight without overt symbolism. Micro-setting (basalt stone) also constrains her final gesture.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“nexus will tear itself apart”—is signaled early and tightened by the phase deadline. Escalation is one sustained rise: erratic sand → anomaly → single corrective move. Cost is the irreversible exile residue she accepts.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of finding beauty in difficulty emerges organically from sand patterns and chess logic; no moralizing. Final spiral image reweights earlier chaos into quiet order, leaving bittersweet resonance. Subtext in Kael’s weeping and her stone’s re-valued dent.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is controlled, slightly elevated diction suits a former royal tutor; perceptual signature filters every detail through strategic logic. No head-hop; psychic distance tightens under pressure. Rhythm modulates with scene intensity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; figurative language is spare and purposeful. No loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated phrasing (“ethereal glow”) is consistent with POV. Final sentence lands with cadence and closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of chess logic, magnetic physics, and covenant myth; feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky quiet climax pays off. No derivative echoes; specificity of sand-language and stone-dent reprise anchors originality.</comment>
