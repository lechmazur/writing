<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the contradiction between her meticulous craft and the “violent, cracking, painful thawing heart” is dramatized in real time. The micro-choice to stop at one orb and place the bookmark on the console crystallizes her arc with visible cost. Minor over-articulation of grief (“fresh puncture wound”) keeps it just under 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final image of the bookmark left behind reconfigures meaning and stakes without exposition. Causal chain—craft orb → realize safety requires thaw → renounce further making—holds cleanly. Cost is legible in the single orb and the abandoned craft.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Control-room ice sheet and dripping panoramic window constrain pacing (“race against this melt”) and charge the final image when sunlight floods in. Micro-setting of furnace, marver, and annealing oven is tactile and choice-shaping. One hairline slip: “steel cliffs” reads slightly generic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finish a safe-zone orb before external/internal thaw renders it meaningless—tightens once when Elara decides one orb is enough. The visible price is the cessation of her craft, a forfeiture that alters future tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of thawing as both peril and liberation emerges from glass, ice, and heart without explicit statement. Final image reweights the bookmark from relic to seed, offering resonant non-literal answer. No moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited voice is consistent, with glassblower’s perceptual signature (“molten core,” “pontil”) and rhythmic control under pressure. No dialogue; narrative voice modulates with emotional intensity. Occasional lyrical heightening (“sculpture of white”) stays within contemplative register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; sentences advance multiple tasks. Metaphors are coherent and purposeful. One minor paraphrase loop (“abandoned…abandon”) in mid-text; does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Fusion of glassblowing craft with post-apocalyptic thaw feels fresh; transformation of familiar “letting go” arc through material practice avoids cliché. Bookmark’s shift from wound to seed is specific and earned.</comment>
