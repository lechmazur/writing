<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is embodied and contradictory—anger vs compassion—shown through micro-choices like mixing adhesive instead of raging. The tail-repair decision crystallizes her reconfigured self-respect/compassion weave, with visible cost (time, precision, emotional exposure). Minor slip: “reconstruct her own fractured principles” edges toward label-speak, though it’s brief.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Single-scene causal arc: betrayal → confrontation → tail loss → repair → earned reconfiguration. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the rejoined tail twitches under mist and starlight, reweighting her stance with felt cost (her vigilance, Pascal’s risk). No orientation debt; transitions are clean.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Misty workshop under stars is more than backdrop: the low lamp, adhesive’s planetary glow, and mist that “feels accusatory” all constrain her meticulous repair and mirror internal fog. Micro-setting (workbench, tools, tail tip) functions as crucible; environment guides choice without clutter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can compassion survive betrayal without self-betrayal? Pressure tightens when tail loss forces her to act; repair is the decisive narrowing of options. Cost is tangible—her time, Pascal’s fragility, her revised worldview. Escalation is single but sufficient.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: tail as metonym for trust, repair as apology. Final image (tail twitch under starlight) offers non-literal answer—compassion is not naïveté but deliberate, costly craft. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in the mist.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays close to Elara’s sensory filter; diction is precise yet lyrical (“medical-grade adhesive,” “single-hair brush”). No head-hopping. Rhythm modulates with pressure—long sentences for reflection, clipped fragments during repair.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is clean, dense, propulsive. No loops or scaffold. Figurative language is selective (“tail tip curled like a question mark”) and serves character perception. Occasional elevated phrase (“planetary glow”) is earned by context.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Familiar betrayal/repair arc is refreshed through chameleon biology as moral metaphor and the quiet workshop ritual. Specificity of adhesive chemistry and micro-surgery grounds the premise. Risk lies in the subdued ending, but it pays off.</comment>
