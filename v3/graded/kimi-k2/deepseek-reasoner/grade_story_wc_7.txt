<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s layered motivation (“to prove decay could birth wonder”) anchors every on-page choice, yet the interiority drifts into lyrical summary rather than embodied contradiction during pruning. “Quiet courage of a thousand gentle rebellions” lands thematically but is asserted, not dramatized within Elara’s body; the final cost is poetically stated more than visibly earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure hinges on a resonant reconfiguration: the aligned moons wane as Elara consumes the perfected fruit, reweighting both ruin and creation. Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, density deepens through the tightening spiral of cuts and dissipating primordial memories; the felt cost is the deliberate pruning of chaotic history, though the beat’s emotional price is compressed at the end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Greenhouse rust “weeping orange tears,” gravity of collapsing glass, and silver-green moonlight all compress into an object-setting that physically constrains every choice. At closure the lattice of glowing leaves recharges the initial image of ruin-made-beauty, satisfying the constraint gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transform decay into living hope—tightens when each pruning cut forces live loss of raw memory, yet the escalation is mostly lyrical rather than external. Cost is legible but scaled to poetic resonance, not visceral danger to Elara.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</question>
<comment>Theme (gentle rebellion against synthetic forgetfulness) emerges from concrete particulars without thesis speech; the final taste “of something beautiful created from ruins” answers the central question, but a last-minute explanatory tag drags 0.4 pt.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</question>
<comment>Sensuous, tactile diction (“boots crunching on old gravel,” “steel blades cold in her hands”) constitutes an intimate, idiosyncratic perceptual signature; rhythm breathes with the crescendo of branch expansion and the hush after pruning. Moments drift into elevated lyric register but remain controlled.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</question>
<comment>Prose is largely crisp and propulsive; no loops or scaffolds drag closure. Minor overwriting (“branches shooting out in chaotic, desperate directions”) flirts with purple but remains within allowable intensity. No artifacts touch the final beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</question>
<comment>Fresh graft of gastronomic synaesthesia onto post-industrial pastoral yields a memorable pivot; ruin-grown fruit as living archive feels organically inevitable at close. Risk leans toward the lyrical, but stakes are personal and coherent.</comment>
