<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Silas’s exhaustion and craving for stillness are embodied in tactile micro-choices (bone-handled opener, funereal reverence). The contradiction between resisting chaos and answering the lens is dramatized in the moment the light fractures across his parlour walls, not merely summarized. The final renunciation—accepting the grandfather’s stillness as his own—carries visible cost in the gentle hand on the preserved corpse, earned by prior causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as an Earned Stasis: Silas forecloses rescue in favor of joining the grandfather’s perfect quiet, cost legible in the descent and final touch. The Causal lens holds: each beat (lens arrival → restoration → pulsing light → underwater discovery) links by “therefore” logic without gaps. Orientation is anchored early (Tuesday, parlour, undertaker) and never drifts.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>The parlour’s low afternoon light, the salt-crusted twine, and the bioluminescent library are selective, POV-filtered details that constrain action (light angles dictate lens placement; impossible capsules bar casual entry). The final green glow reframes the initial prism spectres, charging the closure image. Spatial choreography from parlour to watchtower to seabed tracks cleanly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</question>
<comment>Dominant stake—Silas’s pursuit of permanent stillness—is signaled early and tightened when the lens’s light show forces a choice: retreat or answer. The single meaningful turn—descending to the library—renounces rescue and crystallizes the cost. Pressure escalates causally; no coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</question>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: the seductive danger of absolute stillness. Subtext resides in gestures (the gentle hand on the corpse) and the reweighted image of the glowing library as both sanctuary and tomb. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers over whether this stillness is peace or surrender.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</question>
<comment>Voice is precise, tactile, and consistent with an undertaker’s measured diction (“funereal reverence,” “chased stillness”). Syntax lengthens underwater to mimic slowed motion, then contracts on surfacing. No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains Silas’s throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.3</question>
<comment>Prose is lean yet textured; each sentence advances image or stakes. No loops or scaffold. Metaphors (“soul of light”) are sparse, earned, and coherent. Rhythm modulates with pressure—short pulses for the signal, languid clauses for the dive—without monotony.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.7</question>
<comment>The sunken librarian grandfather trope is inverted: the signal is invitation, not SOS. The undertaker’s craft translating to lens restoration feels inevitable rather than gimmicky. Specificity (salt-crusted twine, silver compound) grounds the fantastical in lived detail, creating fresh synthesis.</comment>
