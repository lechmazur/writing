<question>1</question>
<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Elara’s internal contradiction—need to conquer self versus fear of ordinariness—is embodied in scene, drives every decision, and culminates in the earned merge with her echo; her leap from water to stone anchors the final cost. No traits are labeled; all revealed via micro-choice and embodied emotion.</comment>

<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Labyrinth as procedural mirror follows Causal lens: because her prior failures shift options, therefore each generated viaduct must be walked. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—she accepts the echo, ending cycles and paying psychic cost.</comment>

<question>3</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Glowing viaduct and crystallized anxiety arches are vivid tactile anchors that constrain movement and mirror stakes. The rain-soaked stone and inverted gravity pool are irreplaceable environmental hazards that alter tactics and charge the ending.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—break cycle of fractured timelines—tightens when each generated path closes an actual option. Final choice to merge is a high-cost renunciation that crystallizes stance and forecloses future resets.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from Elara’s refusal of simplified identity mirrors; fear of ordinariness reframes her power as escape. Final image—bare feet touching water—offers non-moral answer to the central question of self-acceptance.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Lyrical syntax mirrors gravity defier flow; perceptual signature woven through body, tool, object. No head-hop; interiority filtered through fear-tight awareness; cadence heightens under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Clean, dense propulsion; no loops or scaffold. Metaphor “between drop and ripple” is precisely used once and recharged at closure, zero figurative muddle. Line-level clarity never obscures causality.</comment>

<comment>Procedural labyrinthal mirror of self resets cycles is a fresh synthesis; no genre template matches. Final inversion—touching water—reweights prior theme and offers non-obvious resolution.</comment>
