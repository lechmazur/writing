<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s obsession is vivid and embodied; the brush-in-hand opening instantly fuses profession, motive, and sensory stakes. Interior contradiction—preservation vs. theft from entropy—drives every micro-choice, and the final drawing is earned by the prior time-borrow that visibly exhausts her. No other characters appear, so status/relationship bullets are N/A; single-POV interiority stays specific and avoids label-speak. The only minor slip is a touch of over-articulated motive in “she believed only there could she capture…” which momentarily tells what the scene has already shown.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the freed note reweights the premise—silence is not absence but origin—and the cost is the giant’s shallower breath, a city-scale price. Causal lens holds: each beat (climb → fracture → borrow → uncage → draw) is linked by because/therefore logic. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“glass-domed cupola…”) so no penalty; transitions are clean within the single shard. The only hairline slip is “she had tracked its last known echo” arriving as retroactive knowledge, but it is quickly paid off in-scene.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Glass canal, frozen clock face, and the pendant-as-tool all constrain tactics and charge the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate. Sensory hierarchy mirrors Elara’s illustrator bias—color, texture, light—while the giant’s breathing keeps time tactile. Spatial choreography is flawless: climb, sphere, moth alighting. One decimal off perfection only because the city’s social context is hinted but not leveraged for micro-choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—capture the moth-image before the giant wakes—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when the breathing shallows. The interrupted cadence fracture supplies a single decisive intensification that forecloses the option to wait; borrowing time from the giant’s nap exacts an on-page price (colder pendant, shallower breath). Agency remains hers throughout; coincidence complicates but does not resolve. Cost is legible, though the city-scale stakes could be felt even more viscerally in her body.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: preservation vs. impermanence, silence as generative source. The crystalline moth etched with “forgotten stars” reweights the opening malachite scale without moralizing. Subtext resides in gesture—pendant colder, hand steady—rather than statement. No motif is forced; recurrence of echo/sound/silence accretes meaning through action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is painterly yet urgent, syntax lengthening then compressing under temporal pressure. Perceptual signature is illustrator-specific: “iridescent scale,” “patterns of forgotten stars.” No dialogue, so dialogue bullets N/A. Free-indirect style stays clean; diction never exceeds Elara’s plausible lexicon. Rhythm control peaks in the horrific skip—“the world stuttered”—without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image, time, or stakes. Metaphors (mountain-giant, woven sound) remain coherent and physically legible. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges earlier motifs. One hairline slip: “a single, perfect note that had been sung when the tower was new” is slightly redundant—cutting “that had been sung” would tighten—but it does not touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fusion of extinct-fish illustrator, time-sculpting pendant, and mountain-giant city feels inevitable and fresh. The crystalline moth drinking starlight is particular to this world logic, not generic fantasy fauna. Risk-taking—borrowing geological time into a personal lens—heightens stakes without gimmickry. Transformation test passes: remove any core ingredient and the entire edifice collapses.</comment>
