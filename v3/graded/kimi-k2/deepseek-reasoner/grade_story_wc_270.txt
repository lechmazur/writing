<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s quiet insurgency and plant-telepathy are embodied through tactile micro-choices (tracing script, cupping amber, humming to moss); the final renunciation—grafting the past onto the future—carries visible cost in her defiance of the council. Interiority is concrete and character-specific, though the “quiet fire” summary edges toward label-speak. Motivation remains consistent and intensifies to the decisive act. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible not tested.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: amber dissolves, embryo roots, Elara’s stance crystallizes with felt social cost (council condemnation implied). Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of pattern (kite script, moss wisdom, steam glyphs) reweights the stake. Orientation anchored by ~80 words; no causality breaks. One meaningful tightening suffices.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Volcanic hot springs and mineral steam are not backdrop but active agents—heat softens amber, steam carries the decoded pattern, moss mediates translation. Micro-setting (amber in palms, wrist-deep water) constrains the final act. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful; no static repetition.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Dominant stake—preserve/evolve tradition—signaled early. Escalation is textural: each decoded loop of the kite script tightens the pressure until the only option is harmony, not force. Cost is legible: Elara risks council censure; embryo’s rooting forecloses return to anonymity. One deepening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Theme emerges organically: memory as living graft, not museum relic. Subtext operates through gesture (cupping amber, humming to moss) and silence. Final image of the unknown leaf offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. No thematic drift.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Elara’s gnarled fingers, patient plant-listening, mineral scent of steam. Syntax modulates with emotional rise—longer clauses during decoding, clipped fragments at climax. No dialogue, so voice coherence judged solely through interior texture. No POV leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Prose is dense yet clear; each sentence advances image or pressure. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Rhythm breathes with scene needs—expansive during moss communion, tight at fracture line. One minor filter-verb cluster (“she began to hum”) does not obscure action.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>Fresh synthesis: insurgent grandmother + plant-telepathy + volcanic rebirth of extinct flora. Premise commits fully; no late rule changes. Risk-taking (telepathy as slow, communal decoding) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Transformation test passed—story collapses if elements swapped.</comment>
