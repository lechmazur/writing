<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Aris’s interior contradiction—data-driven detachment vs. visceral tenderness—is embodied in the micro-choice of lifting the wing. The shift from sterile quantifier to participant in the “experiment” is earned and carries felt cost in her renunciation of emotional distance. No second character on page, so relationship crucible waived.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the final image of Aris “an element within it” crystallizes her new stance with visible conceptual cost—she abandons the safety of detached observation. Causality holds under pattern accumulation; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The greenhouse’s silt-coated surfaces and dripping trusses constrain movement and perception; the butterfly wing becomes a micro-setting that literally charges the final image. Sensory selection is filtered through Aris’s scientific gaze, grounding atmosphere without cataloging.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: Aris’s need to sterilize grief vs. the flood’s demand that she feel. Pressure tightens once when the dust patterns force her to confront beauty in ruin; the cost is the forfeiture of her analytical shield. Escalation is one deepening under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the tension between catastrophic rupture and patient accretion; the final image reframes decay as creative without moralizing. Subtext resides in the silence and the microscopic trace of wing dust—no thematic echo in final paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is precise, slightly cool, matching a cosmologist’s lexicon yet modulates into tenderness when handling the wing. No dialogue; perceptual signature remains consistent. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language (“neutron star researcher,” “phantom hand”) is sparse and purposeful. No loops, no mixed metaphors. Final paragraph’s cadence shift mirrors the thematic turn.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Familiar disaster-recovery frame is transformed by the butterfly-wing-as-artist conceit and the cosmologist POV. Synthesis feels inevitable; risk lies in the quiet lyricism that could have slipped into sentimentality but doesn’t.</comment>
