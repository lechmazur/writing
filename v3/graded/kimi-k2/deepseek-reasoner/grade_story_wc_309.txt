<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elian’s interior contradiction—yearning for ineffable simplicity while trained to efficiency—drives every beat; the mist-walk embodies this clash viscerally. His final vigil, sustained by a child-level cooling charm, crystallizes the renunciation with visible bodily cost. Minor slip: “finally felt like a true mage” edges toward label-speak, blunting the earned ambiguity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elian’s choice to stay and freeze the keystone forecloses return to the guild, cost legible in the closing image of cold seeping into bone. Causal chain—touch keystone → mist-walk → conceal folly—holds without gaps. Lens is Causal; each beat narrows options until only vigil remains.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The spire’s “brilliant dimness” and keystone’s paradoxical warmth constrain every action; the insulated blanket literally alters the thermal stakes. Sensory triangulation—silver sun, frost-rimed glass, breath-plume—anchors orientation within 120 words. Final image of hidden light under ice recharges the opening twilight motif.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve wild magic from automated dismantling—tightens once: after the mist-walk reveals the folly’s value, Elian’s only path is concealment. Escalation is causal: discovery risk rises as guild lights wink on below, forcing the blanket-and-ice gambit. Cost is felt in physical endurance and social exile.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of sacred simplicity emerges through concrete acts—hand-watering a rose, sustaining a basic charm—never stated. Final image of hidden light under mundane blanket reweights the premise: true power is conservation, not creation. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in the unspoken fate if the ice fails.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elian’s perceptual bias—selective attention to warmth amid cold, to inefficiency amid algorithmic perfection. Syntax mirrors his shift from guild jargon (“pre-cast algorithms”) to elemental simplicity (“single droplet of water”). No dialogue; internal voice remains coherent and textured.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is lean yet lyrical; each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and thematic work. No loops or scaffold; “brilliant dimness” and “lingering luminance” recur with shifting charge. Minor density spike during mist-walk description, but rhythm accelerates appropriately to the disorientation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Familiar “mage vs automation” frame is inverted: the underachiever’s failure becomes the only viable resistance. Mist-walk as tactile, non-utility travel feels fresh; keystone-as-battery is a quiet, organic invention. Risky choice to climax on a cooling charm succeeds because stakes are reweighted, not resolved.</comment>
