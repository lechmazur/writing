<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the “quiet, persistent madness” and “second heartbeat” compulsion are concrete. Micro-choice—curling into the alcove, clutching the postcard—aligns with motive. The final sleep is earned by prior agony and visible cost. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in scene, so the 9+ quick test is narrowly missed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of wind-lullabies intensifies until the cadence shift into silence. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—wind resolves, weight lifts, reef-shadow joy lands with felt cost (“exquisite wrenching”). Orientation anchors by line 3; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The shell’s nacre walls and bioluminescent light constrain Elara’s posture and echo her internal state. The postcard’s final pulse recharges the nebula image, satisfying the 9+ gate. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered; spatial choreography is clean.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—turn sleepless anguish into one night’s peace—is signaled early. Escalation is the tightening of wind-songs until they demand transcription; the cost is the “exquisite wrenching” of spirit. Agency is renunciation/creation; no external reversals needed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of transmuting collective pain into fragile beauty emerges through concrete action, not statement. The reef-shadow joy image reweights prior suffering without moralizing. Subtext resides in silence after the final line.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise; perceptual signature (“acid of her wakeful anguish”) is consistent. Syntax modulates with pressure—long sentences during listening, clipped fragments at climax. No POV drift; diction stays within poet’s lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and musical; figurative language is patterned early and paid off. No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances. Minor elevated diction (“nacreous niche”) is voice-motivated and does not obscure clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—ancient leviathan shell as insomnia cathedral—is fresh and fully committed. The synthesis of cosmic postcard, wind-lullabies, and photosynthetic metaphor feels inevitable. Risky lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
