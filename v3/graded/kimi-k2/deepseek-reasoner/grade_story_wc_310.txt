<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara's interiority blends doubt and composer-like precision; the shift from passive observer to active composer shows earned growth under pressure, though moments lean slightly analytical rather than raw emotion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Backwards prophecy operates as explicit set-up/instruction set; each beat tightens causality until the final resonant reconfiguration lands and crystallizes the new law with visible conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Elegant “ambered tomb” and pre-creation static generate specific texture; the deck itself pressures access and tool-use, though some atmospheric phrases verge on ornate overlay.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant entropy-capture stake tightens via coin resonance and dice throws; one decisive deepening shifts task from monitor-meaning to create-Physics, with felt cost of prior doubt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme reframes cataloguing ending as composing beginning; quiet final note reframes grief into generative hope without sermon, recharging prior coin motif and prophecy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited voice remains precise under stress; slight elevation matches analytic composer, though one “stellar doubt” phrase reads abstract in peak beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Clean, propulsive sentences, no loops; metaphor density spikes only when harmonics plot demands. Occasional adjectival surplus is voice-motivated and rhythmic.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Collapsing-verse pre-creation lab and musical-dice method synthesize fresh angles on well-trodden themes; risk of metaphor overload is balanced by tight causal integration.</comment>
