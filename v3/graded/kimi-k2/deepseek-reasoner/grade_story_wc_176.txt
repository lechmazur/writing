<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her “technically gentle” touch and the micro-choice to unpick the rope both reveal motive and cost. The forgiveness backstory is brief, anchored to the present task, and tilts her stance. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, so the 9+ quick test is narrowly missed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the bronze sings the names, reweighting the premise with undeniable conceptual cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each added layer (wax, card, rope, bronze) deepens density until the final cadence shift. Causality is intact; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The icebound sanctum, aurora light, and casting tools constrain every move; heat versus cold becomes tactical. The reconfigured rope itself functions as micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve the forgotten names—is signaled early and tightened when the rope’s new weave becomes the only path. One meaningful deepening occurs as the bronze flows into the braid-scored channels, foreclosing earlier failures. Cost is visible in the vanished wax and the audible chorus.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of remembrance emerges organically from the casting process; no explicit moralizing. The final chorus of names offers a non-literal, resonant answer that reweights all prior material. Ambiguity lingers without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise; perceptual signature is consistent under pressure. Compression and patterned elision (“snowmelt ardor”) are taught early and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and propulsive; every sentence advances image or stakes. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Figurative language is sparse under peak heat, keeping clarity intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of lost-wax casting, mechanical punch card, and ceremonial rope feels inevitable and fresh. Risk-taking in the non-literal “illumination” pays off without gimmickry. Specificity anchors the universal theme of cultural memory.</comment>
