<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s studious solitude is vivid, but her interiority remains largely descriptive; the “refract” moment is powerful yet reads more as mystical event than earned choice, so the cost feels ambient rather than personally paid.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer thickens until the dawn light reweights the entire field. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration—her notepad now holds an “incomprehensible map”—with conceptual cost legible on the final page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The bonsai labyrinth and buzzing lamp are rendered with tactile economy; the lamp’s hum and pale glow physically constrain her attention and later become the conduit for revelation, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—capture the dawn’s unique resonance—tightens as the hum intensifies and histories flood in. The pressure is atmospheric rather than adversarial, yet the final image shows an irreversible absorption of stories, a felt forfeiture of ordinary perception.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of time-as-texture emerges organically through the act of drawing sound; no moralizing, only the quiet implication that bearing witness extracts a silent toll. The final page’s “profound sense of peace” is earned by the preceding sensory overload.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Voice is restrained, lyrical, and consistent; perceptual signature is precise—“thin, wavering line of noise” felt in the crown of her head. Compression and patterned elision are purposeful and paid off in the closing cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; occasional elevated diction (“incandescent restraint”) fits the stationer’s sensibility. No loops or mixed metaphors; only minor scaffold in the opening ascent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Premise—tuning into fluorescent hum to harvest buried histories—is fresh and executed with quiet conviction. Risk lies in the near-mystical pivot, but the sensory specificity and earned stasis keep it from gimmickry.</comment>
