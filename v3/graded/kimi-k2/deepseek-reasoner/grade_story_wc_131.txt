<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction—yearning to be a “presence” yet hiding—drives every micro-choice; the renunciation to remain unseen while enacting kindness feels earned because the remembered warmth of Ms. Gable viscerally substitutes for family. Embodied tension is visible as he fingers the tape, halts, pockets it, and later feels “profound visibility” without showing his face. The only cap: no on-page interaction with a second character, so relationship crucible is moot.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise (CR): static-sacrifice crystallized in the “treasured relic” and the pledge to stay hidden—an irreversible social cost. Causal chain (tape fragment → memory → change in method) is tight under an Accumulative/Textural lens; each step increments density and reweights Silas’s stake. One invisible transition between crawlspace and carrel is cleanly scaffolded by “Slipping into a service corridor.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The library’s blue-lit shadows, pipe chases, and radiator depths physically shape tactics—only he can reach the niches. Dust, gloom, and humming HVAC supply sensory immediacy and mood modulation; the tape reel’s cold, curled metal acts as micro-setting that constrains his ancient reader. No spatial incoherence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—replicating intangible kindness—tightens once via the tape-triggered memory, a pivot that rechannels all risk into perpetual invisibility. Escalation is quiet but coherent: from private yearning to secret gifting; the “cost” is both the memory’s ache and the possibility of discovery ruled out by his own decision.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Kindness as unwitnessed service emerges unsummarized from action and image; the tape’s archived decency becomes a reverberant moral counter-data. Theme avoids moralizing—final image of the unseen hand gifting a “single, perfect book” answers the lonely by showing, not stating.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Luminous, slightly archaic diction (“ferromagnetic,” “cache”) fits a ghosted bibliophile’s internal register. Short dashes accelerate under pressure; longer meditative sentences mimic furtive stillness. No POV slips; compression in “lights flicker-stuttered” teaches the compressed rhythm early.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence multi-duties (tone, action, micro-setting). Figurative bursts (“sapphire hush”) are spare and purposeful, paid off in the finale’s suggestive blue quiet. Occasional passive “robbing him” is voice-driven for stealth feel.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Libraries full of secret benefactors is familiar, yet the invisible custodian whose only weapon is taped kindness reframes it; warm memory triggered by obsolete media is a fresh reweighting. Transformation test fails in a blatant way? Who else hides books in radiator ledges for strangers at 3 a.m.?</comment>
