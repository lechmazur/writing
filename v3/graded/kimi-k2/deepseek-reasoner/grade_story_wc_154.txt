<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is embodied and specific; the coral as memory-anchor and the translator’s reflex to “unknot” trauma are credible. The boy’s first spoken word lands as earned micro-choice. Cost is visible in her exhaustion and the tear on his cheek. Minor slip: “lotus-hearted ache” edges toward label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single-scene causal arc: anesthetic fog → coral prompt → decrypting cast → boy speaks. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the smear becomes a named fear, foreclosing silence. Cost is legible in Elara’s drained “profound exhaustion.” Orientation anchored by line 3; no drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mist, twilight, sterile hospital light create tactile pressure; the coral and plaster cast function as micro-settings that constrain choice. Final image reweights the coral from charm to promise. One minor redundancy: “mist-clad space” / “misty atrium.”</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: break the boy’s silence. Escalation tightens once: Elara’s decryption narrows options from chaos to named fear, forcing speech. Cost is the emotional toll on both. No reversals beyond the single decisive turn, sufficient for length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of turning scars into stories emerges through concrete decryption beats, never stated. Coral and cast reprise as memory vessels; final image reframes ache as growth without moralizing. Subtext in nurse’s “shrewdly innocent” glance and boy’s nod.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is translator-precise yet anesthetic-blurred: “syntax of silence,” “gardening a wounded thing.” POV stays locked in Elara; no head-hop. Rhythm modulates with drugged languor then crystalline focus during decryption. Dialogue minimal but subtext-rich.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language serves pressure (“woolly tide,” “labyrinthine surface”). No loops or scaffold. One mixed metaphor—“lotus-hearted ache” slightly jars—but does not obscure closure. Strong sentence variety and sensory economy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: conflict-zone translator decrypts child’s trauma via plaster hieroglyphs. Coral fragment repurposed as neural talisman. Risk taken in lyric compression pays off; premise would collapse if details swapped. No derivative echoes.</comment>
