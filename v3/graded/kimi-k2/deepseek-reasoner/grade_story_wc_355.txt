<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her shift from acquisition to connection is dramatized through micro-choices (tuning dial, imagining the craftsman). The final renunciation—silence catalog can wait—carries felt cost. Minor slip: “theatrical sincerity” is asserted rather than shown.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single-scene causal arc holds: tuning attempts → doubt → empathic reframe → lock opens → fireworks silence. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with visible cost: she abandons her lifelong project. Orientation anchored by word 60.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Workshop, diary, and crystalline resonators are tactile and constraining; the brass clasp’s cold weight guides her fingers. Fireworks outside mirror internal stakes. Micro-setting (bench, vials) functions as pressure vessel.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Dominant stake—recover grandfather’s story—tightens once when empathy reframes the lock from obstacle to person. Cost: surrendering the catalog. Agency is continuous; no coincidence resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</question><comment>Theme of empathy vs. acquisition emerges organically; grandfather’s line reweights the premise without moralizing. Final image (reading by colored light) offers non-literal answer: silence is not absence but attention.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: “listening for the silence within the hum.” Syntax modulates with pressure—short clauses under doubt, longer cadence at release. No head-hopping; POV remains intimate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Prose is lean and propulsive; figurative language is sparse and purposeful. One minor loop: “theatrical sincerity” appears twice without deepening. Otherwise zero scaffold, high density.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Premise—pacifist cataloguing silence to open a locked diary via empathy—is fresh and specific. Risky synthesis pays off: the silence she sought becomes the silence she breaks. No derivative echoes.</comment>
