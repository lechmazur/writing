<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara's luminous skepticism is vividly embodied in tactile beats (finger on damp sill, prying the amber) and micro-choice (placing amber on crystal with felt cost); interior contradiction—fierce analytic drive vs emerging resonance—is sustained without epiphany shortcut; academic rebellion threads through action (loss of post traded for data pursuit) and converges with earned stance at closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Inferred Hybrid lens (Situational/Accumulative) taught by recursive pattern: footprints stop at fork, return after closure; causality holds under chosen lens with one meaningful intensification; closure achieves Charged Poise reconfiguring place vs frequency of belonging; cost encoded in bronze-toned quiet and loss of prior self-definition.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Rainwashed tower and sculpture path are micro settings that actively pressure choices: spring scent and damp stones cue every step, bronze light constrains emotional palette; the path materially forks choice, amber lens operates at tactile scale. Detail anchors POV without museum tour density.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</question>
<comment>Dominant stake—decode alien "pilgrimage"—signalled early and escalates via each object triage; final amber-crystal fusion forecloses the path of scientific detachment, price visible in conceding "home is a frequency I was tuned to receive". One visible narrowing suffices; no artificial reversals.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</question>
<comment>Theme of manufactured belonging emerges organically from her iterative material choices—amber→tower→map of stars—without overt statement; final image reweights earlier skepticism without moralizing; bronze quiet and alien frequency give resonant aftertaste, earned through specific particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</question>
<comment>Consistent free-indirect interior voice ("needed to understand the chemistry of homecoming") tracks perceptual priority; syntax subtly modulates between analytic and sensorial registers. No POV leakage; compression (no dialogue) is purposeful and reinforced by closure rhythm.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Line-level craft is lean: varied sentence lengths mimic breath of trek, figurative language sparse and targeted ("serpent of moss"); zero loops, redundant adjectives, or causality drag. Strong information density without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.9</question>
<comment>Non-obvious fusion of alien transmission, amber lens as fractal key, and conceptual closure of home-as-frequency synthesizes familiar elements into fresh whole; risk in cerebral sci-fi arc pays off by grounding in tactile beats. The story could not swap any named element without collapse.</comment>
