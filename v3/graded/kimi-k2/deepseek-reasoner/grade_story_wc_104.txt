<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is embodied and specific—raw wrists, silent sorting of keys—yet the “staggering grace” refrain edges toward label-speak. Her contradictory impulses (urgency vs. deliberate calm) are dramatized in the piano-bench beat, and the final renunciation—locking herself in—carries visible cost. The flaw of over-control is credible and compounds the outcome. Minor voice convergence under stress keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each beat tightens because/therefore links—keys → door → arrow jam → entrapment. Closure is a decisive change (Earned Stasis) with felt cost: she trades freedom for guardianship. No orientation drift; anchors land by line 3. One causal leap—arrow’s unexplained rigidity—nicks perfection.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The carnival prize center is tactile and specific—mildewed plush, skeletal skee-ball lanes—and constrains tactics: the piano bench is the lock, the clown mural the gate. Micro-setting (arrow wedged in door gap) charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy narrows under pressure. A touch of generic “dusty arcade” keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—buy time for seed-bearers—tightens once: militia arrival forces the arrow gambit. Escalation is causal and legible; cost is the irreversible self-imprisonment. No coincidence resolves the conflict. The single deepening is sufficient for length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of resilience versus barrenness emerges through concrete objects—seeds, rusted fence, paper arrow—without statement. Final image of Elara kneeling among seed packets reweights the premise: life preserved inside a tomb. Subtext in the “song of resistance” played on keys is earned. No moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is textured, rhythmic, and POV-locked; perceptual signature filters decay through Elara’s tactical priorities. Compression (“patiently strategic grace”) is taught early and paid off. No head-hopping. Occasional elevated diction (“singular artistic stance”) momentarily lifts out of register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; sentences advance multiple jobs. No loops or scaffold. Metaphors are precise—“song of resistance on cold iron.” One mixed image (“staggering grace that belied urgency”) slightly muddies peak beat. Clean mechanics.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: post-apocalyptic seed vault hidden behind clown mural, decoded via piano keys, sealed by paper arrow. Tropes are transformed through sensory specificity and causal integration. Risky structural gamble—protagonist locks herself in—pays off with earned stasis.</comment>
