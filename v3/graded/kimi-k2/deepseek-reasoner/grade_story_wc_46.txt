<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is embodied and specific; the tactile polishing of the sea glass crystallizes her quiet resolve. The internal conflict—keep the light for herself or offer it—drives every micro-choice and lands with a felt cost when she commits to becoming a lens. Minor: the grandmother memory is vivid but slightly generic, nudging the score below 8.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara’s decision to “become a lens” reweights the premise and carries visible cost (renouncing solitude). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each rub of the glass increases density until the final light burst. Orientation is clear within 120 words; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The grotto’s serpentine walls and mist filter light and choice; the tiny fissure is a precise aperture that enables the climax. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, anchoring the POV’s coastal eye. The setting constrains the final action and charges the image, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“share light without fire”—is signaled early and tightened when Elara must decide between private beauty and communal gift. One meaningful deepening occurs when the polished glass refracts the sunset; the cost is the forfeiture of her solitude. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: broken things remade into vessels of shared light. The final image of “a thousand green suns” offers a non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext resides in gesture and silence; the grandmother’s line reweights at closure, though a touch more ambiguity could push higher.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet grounded in coastal specificity; perceptual signature is consistent (“earthbound star watcher,” “zephyr bloom”). Syntax modulates with emotional intensity, and no head-hopping occurs. The compression of memory into present action is taught early and paid off cleanly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic; every sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is purposeful (“liquid emerald” lands). Minor register drift in “conceptual repricing” phrasing is negligible. Closure beat is unmarred by artifacts.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Familiar elements—sea glass, grotto, starlight—are transformed through Elara’s specific coastal lens and quiet ethic of repair. The synthesis feels inevitable: broken glass becomes constellation. Risk-taking is subtle (no fire, no blaze) but coherent and heightens meaning without gimmickry.</comment>
