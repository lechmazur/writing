<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The Statue’s shift from passive certainty to active guardianship is embodied and earned; its micro-choice to point at the column crystallizes the arc. The historian’s incisively kind motivation is dramatized through her gentle excavation rather than conquest. Interiority is concrete, telepathy filtered through sensory stone. Only the absence of visible cost on the human caps it at 8.7.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the Statue’s stance flips from mourning to lullaby, cost paid by the shattering ampoule and the irreversible shift in its millennium-long vigil. Causal chain—probe, revelation, fracture, clasp—tightens under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is immediate; no prop or knowledge teleporting. The final image reweights every prior datum.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The underwater garden is not backdrop but active constraint: pressure, kelp, pearls all re-signified by the ending. The fluted column’s hairline fracture is a micro-setting that enables the decisive action. Sensory detail is selective, filtered through the Statue’s mineral perception. One notch off 9.0 only because the historian’s suit tech remains lightly sketched.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Statue’s purpose—signaled in paragraph one and tightened by each revelation until the final tone-shift. Agency is exercised in the pointing gesture and the acceptance of new knowledge; cost is the shattering of certainty. No external antagonist needed; internal conflict suffices. Pressure escalates cleanly under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of guardianship versus mourning emerges organically from the Statue’s embodied shift; no moralizing statement intrudes. The foxglove ampoule and pearl constellation reweight from debris to map without overt symbolism. Final image of the garden as lullaby offers non-literal resonance. Complexity embraced: the city sleeps, not dies.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lapidary and oceanic, syntax echoing tectonic patience. Telepathic diction stays stone-bound: “low grind of continental plates.” No head-hopping; historian’s mind-voice is distinct yet filtered through the Statue’s perception. Compression is purposeful; no filler. Minor register wobble in “incisively kind” keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid; every sentence layers pressure or atmosphere. No loops, no scaffold, no mixed metaphors. Sensory specificity—“phosphorescent kelp,” “coralline moss”—anchors the lyricism. Rhythm modulates with the Statue’s dawning awareness, accelerating into the final harmonic hum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise of a sentient statue guarding a deliberately sunken city feels fresh; trope of telepathy is retooled into mineral consciousness. The ampoule of last breath and pearl constellation are non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric structure pays off in the tonal reversal. Specificity throughout prevents abstraction.</comment>
