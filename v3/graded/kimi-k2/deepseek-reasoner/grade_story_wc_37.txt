<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyra’s contradictions—borrowed memories vs. active weaving—drive every beat; her quiet renunciation of self to birth communal dawn earns the ending’s cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative lens sustained: micro-choices tighten toward woven dawn reconfiguration; ghost sunrise reclaimed → communal song = on-page closure with visible cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Crystalline orchard pressures every decision (resource scarcity, memory threads as tools); closing blanket of light is charged by its constraints.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges from particulars: fragmented memory → communal continuity; final reprise of woven dawns reweights stakes without didacticism.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
