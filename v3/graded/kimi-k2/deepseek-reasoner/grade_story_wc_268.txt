<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“delicate yet strong as stone”), her centuries-long patience collides with the single decisive act of spitting on the pellet, and the cost—quiet exhaustion after the drift—is felt. The contradiction between regal bearing and child-size form is shown, not told. No second character on page, so relationship crucible not tested. Motivation is clear and intensifies to the final choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the pretender’s glamour unravels in real time, the throne is left empty, and Elara’s quiet sigh carries the cost of an endless crusade. Causal lens holds: each clue leads to the pellet, the pellet to the rune, the rune to the drift. No orientation debt; anchors are clear by line 3. One meaningful tightening—ink pellet activated—suffices.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The temple library is not mere backdrop; its dust-choked silence and ozone scent constrain Elara’s stealth and frame the pellet’s discovery. Micro-setting (leviathan-hide folio) becomes the pivot object. Spatial choreography is coherent; no impossible moves. Environment does not directly charge the final image, so capped below 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—unmask the pretender—is signaled in paragraph one and tightened when the rune’s drift is chosen over force. Escalation is causal: each decoded clue narrows options until only the subtle key remains. Cost is visible in Elara’s soft sigh and the empty throne. One decisive turn suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of truth vs. illusion emerges through the rune’s gentle sundering rather than authorial statement. Subtext lives in Elara’s refusal of spectacle—she closes the folio and turns to the next shelf. Final image reweights the premise: truth is restored yet the cosmos remains vast and unfinished. No moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with rhythmic control (“perfume of graceful collapse”). Perceptual signature is titanic patience filtered through child-size form. No dialogue, so no register clash. Compression and patterned elision (“across the pause of shifting constellations”) are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence advances atmosphere or action. No loops, no mixed metaphors. Figurative language is selective (“chalk drawing in the rain”). Minor scaffold in “centuries perhaps” could tighten, but does not touch closure. Read-aloud rhythm is controlled.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: a child-sized titan dismantles an empire with spit and a rune of drift. Familiar tropes—lost heir, ancient library—are transformed through tactile specificity and causal subtlety. Risky quiet ending lands with conceptual cost. No close echoes of famous scenes.</comment>
