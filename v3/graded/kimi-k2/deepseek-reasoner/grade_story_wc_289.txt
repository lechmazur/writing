<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictions—architect of eloquence yet haunted by borrowed emotion—are embodied in her wading into the pond; micro-choice of retrieving the letter-lining nest crystallizes her arc. Interiority is precise ("borrowed room"), emotional cost visible in final stance shift from ghost to architect. Deduction for a trace of convenient epiphany in "the method came to her then, fully formed."</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens: each collected fragment densifies the emotional ecology. Closure—lantern of secrets on water—is Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost: she forfeits anonymity. Causality tightens steadily because/therefore without gaps.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Lotus pond and temple function as a palpable, mirrored constraint; the pier serves as stage for communal witnessing. Micro-setting—rain-dark planks, candlelit vellum shadows—charges the final image. Minor drift: spatial relationship between pedestal and temple could be sharper.</comment>

<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“to give secrets open-air life”—escalates through gathering fragments and forfeits anonymity. One meaningful tightening crystallizes in the lantern scene where private becomes public with visible social cost.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges implicitly from ecology of affection rather than stated thesis; the communal reflection of overlapping love-beams on stone is earned moment. Subtext of shared vulnerability crystallizes in crowd’s recognition without meta-comment.</comment>

<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person close interiority is tightly disciplined to Elara’s noticing: “smelling of wet earth and lotus blossom” and selective projection of vellum text. Rhythmic control, no head-hops; voice is specific and sustained.</comment>

<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Poetic texture balanced with propulsion; “word-covered sculpture” and “prismatic quiet made manifest” enrich without purple drift. One near-paraphrase loop around “thread” imagery is minor. Clean grammar, no diction mis-steps.</comment>

<comment>Fresh synthesis: discarded love drafts repurposed into bird architecture, then public luminary. Risk-taking (literal secret ecology) pays off; moment feels specific to Delhi Lotus Temple setting rather than transferable postcard.</comment>
