<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—seeking closure by reopening wounds—drives every beat; the glowing scars moment crystallizes her cost. Telepathy with plants is embodied (tea spill, root screams) and alters tactics. The final press against the orb is earned by prior pain and plant pleas, foreclosing escape into numbness. Minor slip: “closure seeker who only succeeded in opening wounds” is slightly label-speak, not embodied mid-action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each sensory layer (bandage heat, plant thirst, orb pulse) tightens the weave until the final image reconfigures meaning. Closure—sand finally falling—pays off the hourglass setup with conceptual cost: she accepts her scars as the missing story the miracle needed. Causality is lyric rather than stepwise, but coherent. Orientation anchored by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The tower, tunnel, and orb are rendered through Elara’s bodily pain and plant telepathy; the orb’s “vacant star” image constrains the final choice. Sensory selection narrows under crisis (anesthesia hush, stone cold). Micro-setting—the bandaged arm itself—becomes the map that charges the ending. No wasted atmospheric detail.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: will she keep fleeing her scars or let them speak? Pressure deepens via plant screams and orb’s emptiness, forcing the final press. One meaningful tightening: the orb’s glow syncing with her scars eliminates retreat. Cost is felt in the burning graft and the irreversible sharing of her pain.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the tension between erasure and inscription: scars as both damage and map. The hourglass’s final turn reframes “healing” from stasis to exchange. Subtext in the orb’s silence and the plants’ wordless plea avoids moralizing. Final image offers resonant, non-literal answer—sand moving at last—without stated thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric, tactile, and consistent: “viscous threads of anesthesia,” “meteor hush.” Perceptual signature filters every detail through bodily pain and plant telepathy. No POV drift; psychic distance tightens as she crawls. Rhythm modulates from languid dawn to subterranean pulse without losing clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each image performs double duty (“brown coffee ring… fractal patterns” = both map and scar). No loops or scaffold; metaphors stay coherent. Occasional elevated diction (“viscous threads”) fits lyric mode. Final sentence lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: telepathy with plants as diagnostic tool for buried miracles; scars as narrative substrate. Orb-as-failed-seed reconfigures typical “chosen one” trope into mutual rescue. Specificity of plant screams and graft fire prevents abstraction. Risky lyric structure pays off in closure.</comment>
