<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s “gentle radical” paradox is embodied in every micro-choice; the retrocognitive flash floods her with artisanal joy, forcing a visible shift from enforcer to guardian. Her steel arms literally cradle the tessera and then the child—an earned, costly reversal that forecloses her prior obedience. Interiority is specific, embodied, and contradictory; no stock phrasing. Only the lieutenant remains a cipher, limiting relationship crucible depth.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: contact with tessera → empathic flood → refusal to clear → renaming act. Closure is a decisive change (DC) that renames the sector and shields the family; the cost—career suicide, immediate peril—is legible in the lieutenant’s hand on the prod. Orientation anchors by line 3; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The shattered sky and soot-stained plaza are filtered through Elara’s selective perception; the tessera’s blue against grey charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean—kneeling, rising, palm extended. Weather (weak sun) subtly mirrors the “warm coldness” tonal contradiction. Setting constrains choice: the plaza is the stage where renaming must occur.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—erase or preserve identity—signaled in paragraph one. Escalation tightens once: retrocognitive mercy collides with the order to clear. Agency drives the reversal; the price is immediate and visible. No coincidence resolves; the mosaic stone enables but does not save.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of memory versus erasure emerges from the tessera’s journey from minaret to stepping stone to shield. Subtext lives in gesture: open palm versus shock-prod. Final image reframes the fractured sky as nascent mosaic—earned resonance without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Voice is tactile, metallic, and mournful—“servos whirring softly,” “steel arms designed for control.” POV remains locked to Elara; perceptual signature is precise. Compression is purposeful; no head-hopping. Dialogue is sparse but goal-driven; the single command “Hold” carries subtext.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence advances image or stakes. No loops, no scaffold, no mixed metaphors. Sensory specificity—“smell of wet mortar,” “joyful cries”—is economical. Rhythm modulates with pressure; final paragraph slows to crystallize the renaming.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Familiar post-apocalyptic terrain is transformed through the retrocognitive tessera and the paradox of “gentle radical.” The renaming act feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Specificity of the lapis shard and the artisan’s pride anchors universals. Risk-taking (retrocognition as pure sensation) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
