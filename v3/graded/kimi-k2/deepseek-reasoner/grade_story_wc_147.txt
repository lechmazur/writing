<comment>Elara’s interiority is concrete—her memories of Jupiter, puzzle-solving satisfaction—but the sender remains a cipher until after contact; we get no prior view of her mind under pressure from the sender’s impending death. The instinct override is stated more than dramatized, reducing felt sacrifice. Still, the exchange of memories reads as a hard-earned trade-off that crystallizes a mutual witness.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Causal linkage holds: because the Chopin loop is deciphered, therefore Elara descends; because she overrides instinct, the sphere unsnarls. The “flat tone” bio-scanner beat is the clear final cost—sender gone with vial sealed—landing Decisive Change under Causal lens without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Temple stones “fur[ring]…bioluminescent blue,” statues “smoothed by millennia” and the sphere “shimmering sphere of nothingness” are vivid, specific, and tethered: every setting detail constrains choice—silenced movement, limited oxygen clock. Vial’s bird stopper reconfigures in final image, satisfying Gate 3+.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Single dominant stake—“harness the ephemeral…quiet the screaming static” vs sender’s fading pulse—escalates through tightening countdown. Oxygen and life-sign flatline are live prices; the final choice costs the sender’s actual death, legible and on-page.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically from the silence/witness bargain: a plea to be remembered becomes mutual, unsentimental gift of Elara’s own mundane memories. No didactic statement; final image of vial held against abyss conveys wordless thematic echo.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Consistent third-person close that stays inside Elara’s perceptual register—water pressure, “wary metal beetle,” thruster whir—without leakage. Rhythm modulates under pressure; “touches memories” line is slightly telegraphic but serves immediacy. Interior diction aligns with exploratory scientist.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Few if any loops; density high—“preternaturally still, heavy with lonesome splendor” carries simultaneous atmosphere and threat. Minor overwriting alert on “lonesome splendor” twice, but variation mitigates. No clarity issues.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh twist: ‘distress signal’ is not pleading for extraction but for witness, transforming rescue trope. Silence bottled as balm for psychic static and memory exchange are innovative yet tightly tethered. Specific, irreproducible elements.</comment>
