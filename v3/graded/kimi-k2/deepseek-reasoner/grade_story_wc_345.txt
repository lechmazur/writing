<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elara’s altruism is dramatized through concrete pressure—she works the bell, wavers, then gives her remaining self to save the grove. Interiority is embodied (phantom shudder, dissipating shimmer) rather than abstract, and the final shift to nebula feels earned by her sustained choices, showing credible endurance with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Causal linkage holds: chalk guides Kael, Kael guides repair, bell chime activates irrigation; each because/therefore advances toward closure. Closure—a nebula of respite settling on dying trees—reconfigures the stakes live on the page with felt, mystical cost that crystallizes the community’s hope without sentimental sermonizing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Sylvan’s orchard, copper bell, and floating rose-quartz arches pressure choices and supply tools; bell’s rework into deep-root pump and misting minerals from arcs reweights the ending. Specificity of drifting rock bridges and crystalline fruit roots choices under water scarcity, reinforcing tone and stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—save dying trees—escalates from withering roots to miraculous recovery via bell and ghost; Kael’s strike, collective repair, and nebula constitute micro reversals with visible cost of ghost’s dissipating form. Pressure coheres under causal lens without external coincidences resolving the central conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of selfless stewardship emerges through character action: ghost’s renunciation and community’s metonym of grief to garden. Nebula recharges prior friendships, reframing individual loss into communal guardianship without overt moral, offering a resonant, nonliteral answer that lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Voice is precise and spectral—phrases like “form shimmering with a need to help,” “labor of translucent fingers”—create a consistent POV. Tone modulates with stress, from urgent whispers in chalk to hushed awe at the nebula, maintaining lyric specificity under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is rhythmic (“slow, miraculous trickle”), high information density; metaphors (ghost as garden, bell as world’s heart) are controlled and purposeful. No loops or filler; final sentence anchors with “You are the garden” crystallized poise. Articulates cost without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Trope transforms: altruistic ghost and dying orchard marry crisis practicality—bell irrigation adaptation and spectral nebula payoff. Elements feel inevitable in hindsight; alt ending affirms family roots rather than easy salvation, taking a calculated tonal risk that reconfigures meaning without gimmickry.</comment>
