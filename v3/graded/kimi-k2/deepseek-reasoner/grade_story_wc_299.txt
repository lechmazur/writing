<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Leo’s contradictory impulses—nostalgia vs. protective fact-armor—are embodied in trembling hands and the micro-choice to open the browser tab. The final renunciation of dollar-value for creative utility is earned by the grille-cloth’s sensory assault and the singer’s note, with visible cost: he forfeits the safety of appraisal for the risk of rebuilding sound.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the silence of the quarry becomes a “blank canvas” and the browser tab a decisive pivot. Causal chain—parcel → memory → photograph → new search—holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens; each beat adds density until the final image reweights the stake from valuation to creation, with the felt cost of abandoning emotional insulation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The quarry trailer’s stale coffee, pleather chair, and limestone dust anchor POV and mirror Leo’s desiccated state; the grille-cloth’s ghost-smell of beer and electricity intrudes as a micro-setting that reconfigures the room’s meaning. The final shift to “blank canvas” silence shows the environment constraining then enabling choice, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover lost sense of creative utility—tightens when the photograph and note force a trade-off between safe appraisal and uncertain return to sound-building. Escalation is one deepening, not multiple reversals, but the cost is unmistakable: Leo abandons the fortress of facts for the vulnerability of making music live again.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: creation as purpose versus applause as validation. The grille-cloth reprises as both relic and catalyst, the singer’s inscription reframes past failure as unfinished gift, and the final browser search offers a non-literal answer—utility over glory—without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is textured, rhythmic, and POV-locked: “deafening volume” vs. “silent, dusty room” carries Leo’s perceptual bias. Compression like “meticulously, confidently uncertain” teaches the pattern early; the final cadence shift to spare, declarative search language mirrors the emotional unclenching.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “the skin of a beast he had fed” compresses history and emotion. No loops or scaffold; sensory specificity (“rust-colored stain as likely Coca-Cola”) replaces generics. Rhythm accelerates through short clauses under pressure, then breathes in the final image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Familiar premise—failed artist called back by relic—is transformed through the specific lens of a roadie-turned-appraiser and the object’s acoustic ghost. The risk of quiet, internal closure pays off; the final image feels inevitable yet non-obvious, synthesizing loss and renewal without cliché.</comment>
