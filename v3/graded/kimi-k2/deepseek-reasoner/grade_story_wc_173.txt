<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—compliant courtesan vs. awakened seeker—is embodied in the first paragraph and crystallizes in the final unperformed smile. The micro-choice to pluck starlight threads is specific and stakes her identity. Yet the “harvest of echoes” remains abstract; we feel the cost conceptually rather than viscerally, blunting the earned change.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the lullaby loses power, her thread turns gold. Causality is lyric rather than plot-driven; the prism sanctuary sequence is an accumulative deepening that reweights meaning. One minor drift: the spatial return to the courtyard feels like a reset rather than a consequence, slightly softening the cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The silver courtyard under snow is rendered with selective sensory detail that mirrors Elara’s isolation; moonlit snow becomes blank verse. The prism sanctuary, though off-stage, is evoked through refracted color and crystalline song, charging the final image. Environment constrains choice only implicitly; the snow is backdrop more than obstacle.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—defy conformity via awakening—is signaled early and escalates through the harvest ritual. The tightening is conceptual: once she sees the tapestry of threads, compliance is impossible. Cost is felt as irrevocable awareness rather than tangible loss, satisfying the lens but staying cerebral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: conformity as cage, connection as key. The prism sanctuary’s echo-harvest embodies suppressed humanity without moralizing. Final image of the unperformed smile offers non-literal resonance, reweighting prior motifs of performance and silence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is lyric, controlled, and consistent; perceptual signature is cool, observant, yet charged with latent heat. Syntax modulates from measured iambs to crystalline fragments under pressure. No dialogue, so voice carries all texture; occasional elevated diction (“bodily poetic”) is earned by context.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid; figurative language is patterned and purposeful. Minor loop: “alarming serenity” is repeated without fresh inflection. Otherwise, rhythm breathes with scene needs, and no line stalls momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The chaste-courtesan-as-observer trope is inverted into a metaphysical harvester of human echoes. The prism sanctuary reframes memory as light, a fresh synthesis. Risk lies in the abstract payoff, but coherence holds.</comment>
