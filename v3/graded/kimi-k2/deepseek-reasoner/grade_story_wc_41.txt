<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas’s contradictory impulses—yearning to capture the sound yet surrendering to forgetting—are dramatized in embodied micro-choices (kneeling, pressing ear to metal). The final renunciation is earned: he accepts the cycle of loss with a tear, foreclosing any hope of permanent possession. Interiority is specific and non-diagnostic; the “tidal longing” is shown through action, not label. Only the absence of a second on-page character prevents the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the circle on the bus and the single white-hair note crystallize the cost of endless search. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each driftwood arrow and chalk mark layers density until the final image reweights the premise. Causality is intact: forgetting drives the next search, the search generates new markers, the markers enable the next forgetting. No orientation debt; spatial anchors are clear by line 5.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The fog garden, chalk circle, and rusted bus function as micro-setting that constrains Silas’s movements and charges the final image. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered: “fog-thatched arches” mirror his mental haze; the cold metal of the bus becomes a stethoscope. Environment evolves with action—ivy slowly consuming the bus mirrors time’s consumption of the body. One hairline slip: “physics of vapor” is slightly ornamental, not tactile.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—capture the sound of aging—is signaled in paragraph one and tightened by the chalk circle moment. Escalation is accumulative: each driftwood trail raises the cost of forgetting, narrowing Silas’s options to endless repetition. The final beat crystallizes the price: he gains a wisp of the sound yet loses the memory, locking him into the cycle. Agency is renunciation rather than defeat; luck never rescues.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the concrete loop of seeking and forgetting; no explicit statement intrudes. The final image—the chalk circle and the single white-hair whisper—reweights the premise without moralizing, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to the cost of consciousness. Subtext operates in gesture: arranging driftwood is both hope and resignation. The piece invites reflection on memory’s futility without tidy resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded in Silas’s perceptual signature: “fog sculpture garden,” “sound of growing older.” Syntax modulates with pressure—long, winding sentences in calm beats compress to fragments during the vision. No head-hopping; POV remains tightly focalized. Compression and elision (“全部 gone”) are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers texture without redundancy. Metaphors are precise and character-bound: “prophet whose only true prophecy was the cycle of his own search.” No loops, scaffold, or register drift. One minor filter-verb cluster (“he could feel the memory”) is offset by immediate embodied action.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The premise—precognitive forgetting as engine of endless search—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Transformation test fails if names/places change; the junkyard, chalk, and fog are inseparable from the emotional arc. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. No close echoes of famous lines; the voice is singular.</comment>
