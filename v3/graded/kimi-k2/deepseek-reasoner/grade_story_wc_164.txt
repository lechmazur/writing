<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses—yearning for truth yet fearing its cost—surface in the micro-choice to plant the seedling. The final smile carries visible cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test, but the captain’s psyche is filtered through summary rather than dramatized contradiction, keeping it just below the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the “cheerful gloom” reweights from burden to balanced truth, with the seedling’s sprout as felt cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each added fragment of memory deepens pattern until the final cadence shift. No orientation debt; anchors are clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The iridescent geode and crater glass function as micro-setting that constrains every beat: the glass translates emotion, the cave refracts light to mirror Elara’s shifting stance. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered. The seedling at the entrance charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“why paths disappear”—is signaled early and tightened once when the glyphs reveal the captain’s deliberate embrace of the maelstrom. The tightening forecloses the “tragic accident” reading and forces Elara’s acceptance of sublime choice. Cost is legible in the sprouting Lamentation Tree.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: memory’s erasure is not loss but translation of complex, chosen endings. The final image of the silver seedling reframes prior sorrow into understood sacrifice without moralizing. Subtext operates in the glyphs’ color shifts and the paradoxical “cheerful gloom.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; perceptual signature is consistent in Elara’s synesthetic noticing (“watery hues,” “milky tear”). Patterned elision—e.g., the ellipsis between seed placement and glyph flare—is taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates with pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and emotion. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is purposeful. Minor register lift in “transliterates emotions” is justified by the speculative frame and does not obscure clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The sea-foam recollectionist, crater-glass translator, and Lamentation Tree seed form a fresh, non-obvious synthesis. The premise transforms familiar “lost ship” tropes through speculative memory-work and emotional cartography. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
