<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—her fingers “delicate yet steady,” the puppet head’s weight an “anchor”—and her contradictory impulses (duty vs. maternal love) act simultaneously in scene. The final choice to sing rather than mechanically force the Clock is earned by the puppet’s warmth and her remembered lullaby, with visible cost in her spent slump. Minor slip: “bruised awe” is named rather than fully embodied at the end.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the Clock’s retreat from midnight and the dissolved “pane of hush” mark a before/after legible under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality holds—song diffuses through nested patterns, puppet warmth fuels miracle—yet the cost is felt in her exhaustion and the eternal return of the task. No orientation debt; lighthouse and dusk are anchored early.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The hidden lighthouse, obsidian floor, and great lens are sketched with selective sensory detail that constrains action: the pane of hush literally blocks outside sound, shaping her isolation and the need for song. Micro-setting—the puppet head in her palm—functions as charged object-as-setting. One minor drift: “quantum filaments” edges toward jargon without tactile grounding.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—prevent universal midnight—is signaled in the first paragraph and escalates through the Clock’s frantic shudder. One meaningful tightening: the moment she chooses song over gear-turning, foreclosing the mechanical fix. Cost is visible in her sweaty palm and tired smile; escalation is coherent under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of “beautifully flawed love worth saving” emerges organically from the puppet head’s journey from toy to cosmic fuel. Subtext resides in gesture—the warmth of cracked maple versus perfect gears—without moralizing. Final image of the tired smile reweights the premise: salvation is iterative, maternal, imperfect.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with rhythmic control (“frantic energy… shuddering perilously”) that modulates under pressure. Perceptual signature is consistent—Elara’s professional gaze fused with maternal memory. No dialogue, so no register clash; free-indirect texture remains coherent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; each sentence layers image and stakes. Occasional elevated diction (“vouchsafed,” “conceptual dread”) skirts register drift yet feels motivated by the mythic frame. No loops or scaffold; metaphors stay coherent. One mixed moment—“pane of hush” as both crystal and object—barely clouds clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses cosmic clock-mender with lullaby-singing mother in a way that feels inevitable, not gimmicky. The broken puppet head as engine of salvation transforms a familiar trope into specific emotional truth. Risky lyric compression pays off in the final ripple of song across lifetimes.</comment>
