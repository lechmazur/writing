<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias’s mortality paradox and obsessive internal tally anchor every micro-choice; the heartbeat count and shard handling externalize obsession without cliché. The contradiction—needing a past self who failed—drives the final renunciation (picking up a whole cup would be betrayal) with on-page cost: silence is finally accepted instead of denied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: “He simply was” reweights the premise by ceasing to resist the flaw; cost is felt in trading redemption for authenticity. Causal linkage holds under Accumulative lens—the repetition of heartbeat, shard, and ink blooms intensifies stakes until the final beat refuses the fix it could take up to 600 ms later.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Observatory snow, domed dark, and India-ink splash create an atmosphere thick enough to be a second skin; ink blot and shard serve as micro-setting that constrains data rituals. However, nothing in the built world physically blocks Elias—space remains abstract, so environment does not quite shape the final choice itself, holding it beneath 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove existence by confronting ghost-failure—is visible from para 1. Escalation accrues in density: shard pressed to ink, data tightening, heartbeat rising, dome darkening. One deepened moment—recognizing the error as human vice, not algorithm glitch—narrows Elias’s last option to *accept*, not erase, himself, meeting pressure requirement.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>"What is a man without his flaws?" emerges organically from the memory-feed rather than authorial commentary; the porcelain shard’s transformation from broken remnant to un-weaponized relic reconfigures the theme around imperfection *being* continuity. Lacks outright 9-tier inevitability but sustains complex ambiguity without thematic declaration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person interiority retains Elias’s clipped, technical diction ("catastrophic miscalculation in a stellar cartography algorithm") alongside visceral, tactile description ("coffee mixed with the black India ink"). Compression, metaphor, and patterned repetition ("he counted...he counted") teach the reader the data-ritual rhythm; no head-hop, pure perceptual singularity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Sentences contract and expand under literal cardiac pressure; no scaffolds or synonym loops. Sensory and abstract glide cleanly (e.g., “a binary star in a nebulous galaxy”). One slightly stock phrase—“quiet defiance of the paperwork”—is forgiven; it never recurs in the final, cost-heavy beats, so it does not dull the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>The fusion of forensic self-Autopsy via digital ghost, cardiac metronome, ink blot as decryption cipher, and refusal of reconstruction creates a synthesis that feels inevitable only after reading; no direct antecedent. A near-paradox procedural—“death certificate error survivor”—becomes the *only* premise able to yield the closing Charged Poise.</comment>
