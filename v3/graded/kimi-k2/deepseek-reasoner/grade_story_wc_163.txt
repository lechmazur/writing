<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s need to belong is embodied in her breath and gaze; the feather triggers panic, the fireflies slow it—visible micro-choice. Ronan’s silent presence adds status pressure that eases rather than complicates, a missed crucible. The final renunciation of the feather as “just a relic” is earned by the rhythmic shift, but the cost feels gentle rather than irreversible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Single-scene, single-POV, causal lens: feather (inciting) → ascent → fireflies → synced breathing → sunrise release. Closure is Earned Stasis: she forecloses return to the surface by accepting the deep’s rhythm. Cost is quiet—loss of the old world—but legible in the fading fireflies and bleaching light.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>“Pressurized labyrinth of hums and shadows” and the ionized barrier give tactile limits; the platform’s spatial logic is clear. The deep’s black dome and the fireflies’ “lazy, luminous scripts” mirror Elara’s internal shift. Setting constrains choice—she cannot leave—yet gifts the fireflies as resource, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: belonging vs. exile. Tightening occurs when the fireflies replace the feather as focal point, narrowing options from flight to acceptance. Agency is attention, not action; cost is the quiet surrender of the surface world. Pressure is coherent but low-grade, fitting the lyric mode.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of belonging emerges through rhythm—star charts vs. living pulse—without overt statement. The fireflies’ silent dance offers a non-literal answer: belonging is attunement, not location. Subtext in the shared exhale with Ronan avoids sentimentality; ambiguity lingers in the sunrise’s “soft, deep blue.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elara’s perceptual bias—she reads ocean reflections, not star-charts. Diction is precise (“shadowseam wonder,” “ionized barrier”) yet lyrical. No dialogue; silence between Elara and Ronan carries subtext. Voice modulates from clipped panic to expansive calm, mirroring heart-rate shift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, with only one paraphrase loop (“rhythm of belonging” twice). Metaphors are fresh and coherent—fireflies as “first of summer,” not cliché. No scaffolding; each sentence advances image or pressure. Final line lands clean without figurative muddle.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Underwater astrologer reading oceanic star-mirrors is fresh; fireflies adapted to abyssal pressure feel new yet plausible. The burnt feather as trauma anchor avoids melodrama by yielding to living light. Risk is quiet—lyric over plot—but the synthesis feels inevitable.</comment>
