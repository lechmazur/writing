<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—pigment-stained hands, postcard inheritance—but her “quiet drive” is asserted more than dramatized; the decisive kneel and hairpin choice show agency, yet the emotional cost feels slightly under-embodied in the final beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the violet beam → loose stone → journal reveal reconfigures Elara’s quest into a Charged Poise. Causal chain holds under Accumulative/Textural lens; only minor ellipsis between days of watching and the single beam weakens the final click.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Cathedral’s layered glass and worn flagstone are tactile and constraining; amber pavilion returns as charged ceiling canvas. Sensory hierarchy is painterly, but the leap from winter thaw to autumn dusk in one paragraph risks temporal disorientation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—why night flowers bloom—tightens when the journal reframes it as faith in unseen pollinators. One clear escalation: spectral violet spotlights the stone. Cost is conceptual (renunciation of wall for ceiling) but lightly felt on-page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of unseen reciprocity emerges organically from glass layers, moth lore, and grandmother’s journal. Final image—gold-and-violet ceiling for moths—offers resonant non-moral answer; no overt thesis, only reweighted perception.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is painter-poet: “ghosts of a thousand pigments,” “umbral tenderness.” Syntax modulates with emotional crests; no head-hop. Occasional lyrical inflation (“spectral violet trembled”) edges purple but stays purposeful.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers pigment, light, or scent. One paraphrase loop (“she began to see the layers… she saw the secret geometry”) and a filter-verb cluster in the discovery beat keep it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: cathedral glass as time-capsule love letter, night-bloom secret as interspecies covenant. Grandmother’s hidden journal avoids deus-ex-machina by early postcard seeding. Risky temporal jump is the only near-gimmick.</comment>
