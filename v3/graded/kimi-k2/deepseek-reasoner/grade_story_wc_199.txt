<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—her “mossy delight” and stained fingers ground her—but the shift from passive decoder to active sower is asserted more than dramatized; the final plunge reads slightly convenient rather than wrestled. Still, her embodied awe and the cost of abandoning order carry enough felt weight to satisfy the arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the moonstone seed planted in the workbench triggers a luminous reconfiguration of sky and self. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each illuminated leaf adds density until the final image crystallizes the stake. One minor ellipsis: how the moonstone’s folklore is instantly accepted without skepticism.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The ashen arbor is evoked with selective sensory strokes—“gnarled living wood,” “veins of silver and gold”—and the workbench-as-micro-setting constrains the final act. Spatial anchors are present early; the sky’s transformation is legible and causally tied to the seeding.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Dominant stake—decode vs. plant—tightens once the final leaf reframes prophecy as sowing. Pressure escalates through the accumulating illuminated leaves; the cost is the irreversible abandonment of her life’s ordering. No external antagonist needed; the conflict is internal and resolved by her decisive act.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: knowledge vs. generative action. The refrain of “the message was never in the falling, but in the planting” reweights every prior beat without moralizing. Subtext hums in the tiny monuments—practice for a future she didn’t yet grasp.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lush yet disciplined, with a rhythmic tilt that mirrors Elara’s meticulous joy. Compression (“mossy delight,” “dust of a thousand pods”) teaches the pattern early; the final cry retains the same cadence while opening outward. No POV drift or filter-verb clutter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; figurative language is patterned and paid off (“constellation seed,” “sky-blossom that no longer bloomed”). One minor loop—“she looked… she looked”—but momentum never stalls. Final image is crystalline.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Folklore of moonstone-as-constellation-egg is refreshed through tactile handling and literal planting. The inversion of prophecy from reading to sowing feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Specificity of seed-sorting labor roots the fantastical in lived detail.</comment>
