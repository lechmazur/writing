<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses (salvage vs. preserve) surface in the micro-choice to “weave truth carefully.” The final renunciation—closing the window by delivering the globe—earns its cost through prior causality. Minor slip: the daughter’s interiority is reported rather than dramatized, keeping it just below 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the melted globe reweighted from token of shame to vessel of absolution. Causal chain (dream-cameo → vision → crafted dream → release) holds under Accumulative/Textural lens; the shrine’s warming candles mark felt cost. No orientation debt; lens taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Glacier shrine’s cold actively constrains Elara’s breath and posture; the melted globe’s warped glass becomes micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy (ice-light, pluming breath, fused plastic) is filtered through her professional eye. One beat of spatial vagueness—“alone in the quiet ice”—keeps it from 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—deliver the unfinished promise—tightens once when Elara chooses to craft the daughter’s dream, foreclosing her own detachment. Cost is visible: the ghost’s anguish unravels into the shrine’s warmth. Escalation is single but sufficient under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of salvaging intent over artifact emerges organically from the officer’s act and Elara’s craft. Final image—constellation of borrowed starlight—offers non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext in the melted globe’s transformation carries the emotional aftereffect.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; perceptual signature (“the cold was a living presence”) stays consistent. Compression in dream fragments is taught early and paid off. No dialogue, so no voice leakage; free-indirect drift into daughter’s dream is brief and functional.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and conceptual work. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is selective. One mixed metaphor—“knot of anguish unraveled”—is minor enough to leave closure untouched.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise synthesizes ghost-whispering and dream-cameo archaeology into fresh emotional engine. Risky lyric compression pays off in the final reprise. Transformation test fails if elements swapped; specificity of melted globe and glacier shrine is irreplaceable.</comment>
