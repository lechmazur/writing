<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses (to hide in the grotto vs. risk the relationship) are dramatized in the moment she offers the cicada. The final micro-choice—handing it to Aric—earns the shift from “hiding place” to “observatory” with visible relational cost. Minor slip: Aric’s interior pivot is asserted rather than fully embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the shared vision reweights their stalemate, and the final image of stars above a turning tide crystallizes the new stance. Causal linkage holds—touching the cicada triggers the vision, which in turn dissolves the argument. No orientation drift; anchors are clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The grotto’s bioluminescent walls and mirrored pool constrain the choice to look into possible futures; the jade cicada itself functions as micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (“smelled of deep water and wet quartz”). One minor spatial hiccup: the flashlight sweep feels disembodied for a beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether the partnership survives—is signaled early and tightened when the vision forces a mutual re-evaluation. The tightening beat (shared glimpse of three futures) narrows options and carries felt cost. Agency is shared, but Elara’s initial deflection into the grotto still drives the escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of time’s texture emerges organically from Elara’s vocation and the cicada’s mechanism; the final redefinition of “observatory” offers a resonant, non-moralizing answer. Subtext in the silent hand-off of the cicada carries more weight than any spoken line. No thematic drift or late sermonizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with tidal cadences that mirror the setting. POV stays locked to Elara; perceptual signature is distinct (“slow creep of barnacles,” “frantic dance of transparent shrimp”). Dialogue is sparse but subtext-rich; Aric’s final line lands as earned reversal.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; figurative language is purposeful and never muddles causality. No loops or scaffold. One near-repeat—“perfect mirror,” “perfectly still”—is minor enough to waive penalty.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The jade cicada as emotional rain gauge is a fresh synthesis; the speculative glimpse reframes a familiar breakup scene without gimmickry. Specificity of tidal-pool chronicler and dynastic artifact grounds the concept. Risk in the quiet, lyric closure pays off.</comment>
