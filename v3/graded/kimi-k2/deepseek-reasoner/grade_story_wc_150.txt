<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is embodied and particular—her fingertips trace inscriptions, her feet find “subtle pathways,” her resolve is “iron.” The contradiction between reverence and need drives every micro-choice. The final peace is earned by prior causality, but the cost (physical strain, emotional risk) is stated more than felt, keeping it just below 8.8.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the sundial’s shadow becomes a “bridge” that reweights the entire quest from excavation to reconnection. Causal linkage is clean—each beat (finding the slab, crafting the gnomon, levering the stone) tightens options. The lens is Accumulative/Textural: density and cadence shift toward stillness and earned stasis. Cost is visible in the dusk shadow and her trembling hands unrolling the scroll.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard is vivid, selective, and purposeful—roots “cradling ancient skulls,” scent of “damp earth and blooming orange trees.” The sundial stone constrains her final choice and charges the closing image. Spatial choreography is coherent; no white-room syndrome. One notch below 8.8 because the broader island geography remains impressionistic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restoring faith in lineage—is signaled early and tightened once: the broken sundial must be rebuilt to reach the tomb. Agency is clear; coincidence never resolves. The price (exhaustion, risk of desecration) is legible but understated, holding it under 8.5.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: interrupted journeys are completed not by retrieval of treasure but by acts of remembering. The sundial’s repaired shadow offers a non-literal answer—time restarted, lineage re-membered. Subtext operates in gesture (trembling hands, cautious footsteps). No final moralizing; resonance lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet grounded, with controlled rhythm: “cool and thick with the scent of damp earth and blooming orange trees.” Perceptual signature is consistent—Elara’s noticing is selective, reverent. No POV leakage or register drift. Compression is purposeful; no experimental elision, so 8.5 rather than 8.8.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, propulsive, and information-dense: “the afternoon sun cast a sharp, definitive shadow across the carved stars.” No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Occasional elevated diction (“cautious enchantment”) fits the lyric mode. One minor filter verb cluster (“she felt”) keeps it from 8.9.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The diaspora-returnee frame, catacomb orchard, and genealogical scrolls synthesize into a fresh angle on ancestry stories. The sundial’s resurrection feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Specificity (“farmers, poets, and sailors”) grounds the universal. Risk is quiet but coherent; no derivative echoes.</comment>
