<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Elara’s wounded-predator stillness, her scar-traced map of betrayal, and the micro-choice to raise her scarred hands rather than flee—each moment crystallizes her internal war between flight and fixation on honor. The contradictory impulses act in-scene and the final stance earns prior causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the engraved box re-legitimizes Elara and redefines the mole hunt, cost shown in her turning from the bluff into fire once more. Causal chain remains intact—betrayal corrected on the page with visible price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Mist-soaked fir, unstable cornice, and the silver hush create immediate pressure on movement and visibility; body-as-micro-setting when numb fingers fumble the box. Setting constrains every step onto the cornice, charging the retrieval beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Stakes tighten from package retrieval to identity restoration; the pillbox’s revelation narrows Elara’s choices to face the mole or vanish forever. A prudently daring step onto the cornice forces the first trade-off; the final stand with raised hands forecloses escape.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of fractured trust and redemptive duty grows from the engraved phoenix and the command “fix what I broke,” never baldly stated. The final image—spook walking back into the fire—offers non-literal answer that reweights the premise with visible consequence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Voice carries a spy’s clipped lyricism—wind’s “soft exhalation,” “silver hush”—and sustains rhythmic pulse under threat. POV never leaks; sensory narrowing under stress is authentic, and the phoenix engraving catches light like loaded symbolism handled through perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is muscular and spare: every sentence advances through cold gloves, phoenix metal, wind sound. Filter verbs remain minimal; occasional figurative snow-metaphor is earned and precise, no purple drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Snow-code retrieval and engraved pillbox as truth-voucher feel fresh and specific; premise of burned spy seeking redemption through betrayer’s last artifact avoids cliché. No stock confrontation—her open-palmed surrender re-weaponizes honor.</comment>
