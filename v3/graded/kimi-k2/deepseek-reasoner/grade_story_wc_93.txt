<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kaelen’s interior contradiction—cursed foresight yet driven by forgotten promise—grounds every beat; the final alignment costs him his identity as “herder,” a visible renunciation. Embodied emotion (“his fingers arranging…”) and micro-choices (spiral placement, reaching with “entirety of his being”) keep interiority concrete. Flaw (compulsive pattern-seeking) complicates tactics and is confronted in the earned stasis. Only the amnesic promise edges toward convenient amnesia, preventing 9.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: friction’s faint return reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost. Causal lens holds—each stone placement is a “because” that summons eels, the eels’ spiral “therefore” births the mote, and Kaelen’s alignment dissolves it into the world. Orientation anchored by line 3; no drift. Cost is legible in the final shudder and the loss of his prior role. Minor ellipsis in how the promise was originally spoken keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The sod hut, peat, and aurora are not backdrop but instruments: the bluff’s crumbling edge forces urgency, the peat releases eels, the aurora feeds the stones’ glow. Micro-setting (painted stones) literally constrains the ritual space. Sensory hierarchy (damp peat, silent sliding) mirrors Kaelen’s numb grasp. Only the tidal mechanics remain slightly abstract, capping at 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—restore friction via sacred patterns—signaled in paragraph 2 and tightened when the spiral becomes irreversible. Agency: Kaelen’s decision to dissolve the dust rather than possess it forecloses personal triumph for global repair. Cost is the loss of his cursed but guiding visions. Escalation is causal and single-cycle, sufficient for length; no secondary pressure keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: control vs. alignment, the hubris of herding what must guide. The eels’ return reconfigures “sacred patterns” from domination to participation. Final image—first real dawn inside him—offers non-literal, resonant answer without moralizing. Subtext in the forgotten promise charges the ending with haunting ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is tactile, salt-stained, and mathematically lyrical (“language of primes and fractals taught by the eels”). Perceptual signature filters every detail through Kaelen’s synesthetic curse. Rhythm modulates: longer coils of description tighten into staccato beats as the void appears. No head-hopping; compression (“a hole in his memory”) is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers world, mood, and physics. Figurative language is patterned (spiral echoed in sky and ritual) and never muddles causality. No loops or scaffold; “sliding things” and “borrowed dawn” are precise. One near-mixed metaphor (“weightless hope”) barely grazes clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Frictionless world + eel-herder mathematician is a fresh synthesis; the eels as non-human teachers of prime spirals feels inevitable yet unforeseen. Risk in cosmic stakes compressed to 750 words pays off via earned stasis. No recognizable template; transformation test fails—names and places cannot be swapped without collapse.</comment>
