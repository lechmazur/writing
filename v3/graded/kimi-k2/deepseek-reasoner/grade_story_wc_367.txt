<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas’s contradictory impulses—dread-tinged thrill vs. prophetic compulsion—are embodied in the laugh he cannot suppress; the crystallized wick and the helmsman’s salvation crystallize his shift from mere keeper to shadow-guide, with the cost of embracing a role he never chose.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the laugh’s meaning flips from curse to compass, the glass wick glows anew, and the lighthouse’s shadow becomes the true path. Causal linkage holds—storm → crystallized wick → laugh → helmsman’s turn—under a Causal lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The Emerald Lighthouse, the glass lens, and the reef-shadow channel are not backdrop but tactical terrain; the beam’s total internal reflection and the hidden channel constrain Silas’s final choice, charging the ending with physical stakes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—whether Silas’s laugh will doom or save—tightens when the galleon ignores the beam; the helmsman’s turn into darkness is the decisive reversal that reweights the premise, paid for by Silas’s acceptance of his new role.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of salvation through darkness emerges organically from the helmsman’s counter-intuitive maneuver; the final image of the glass wick glowing in the shadow reframes light and dark without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is oceanic and mythic yet precise—“stars themselves seemed captured within the tower's crystal heart”—with rhythmic control that swells under storm pressure; no POV leakage or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is selective and purposeful, e.g., “storm hit with the fury of a waking god.” No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; every sentence advances stakes or atmosphere.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The lighthouse-as-shadow-guide premise feels inevitable in hindsight; the crystallized wick and prophetic laugh transform familiar maritime tropes into a fresh mythic engine without gimmickry.</comment>
