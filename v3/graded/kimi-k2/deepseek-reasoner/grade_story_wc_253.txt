<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The blank-faced performer’s interiority is embodied through ritualized micro-choices—counting chews, narrating chores—that externalize his grief-mask. His contradictory impulse to mourn while feigning mandated joy is dramatized in scene, culminating in the un-narrated carving of memory. The final renunciation of mandated lightness for authentic grief is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: the whittled bird and shed tears. Only minor slip: “morally ambiguous protest” is stated rather than shown.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pattern of mechanical narration vs. raw silence tightens until the turbines stop. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the hush flips from imposed cage to chosen blanket, cost legible in the tear and the translucent bird. Orientation is immediate; no causality breaks. One micro-turn suffices.</comment>

<comment>The farmhouse, turbines, scrap wood, and dried bouquet are selective, tactile, and filtered through the performer’s numb precision. The turbines’ sudden stillness reweights the entire acoustic world and triggers the climax. Micro-setting (the bouquet as altar) constrains the final choice. Only the turbines’ physical logic is lightly sketched.</comment>

<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: private grief vs. mandated joy. Escalation is a single cadence shift—turbines stop, silence becomes unbearable, forcing un-narrated carving. Agency is renunciation of performance for authentic mourning; cost is the tear and the irreversible thinning of the bird. No coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>

<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the tension between mandated happiness and unsanctioned grief. The bouquet and bird accumulate meaning without overt statement. Final image reweights the hush from oppression to chosen peace. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in the morality of forbidden mourning.</comment>

<comment>Voice is precise, flat, ritualistic—mirroring the performer’s emotional anesthesia. Compression and patterned elision (“He chews precisely seventeen times…”) are taught early and paid off when narration collapses into silence. No POV drift; diction stays within the character’s lexicon. Rhythm modulates with turbine hum vs. stillness.</comment>

<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and information-dense. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful (“shavings like pale tears”). No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Sentence variety supports momentum. Minor filter verbs in early beats do not dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The happiness-mandate dystopia is rendered through intimate ritual rather than exposition. The whittled bird as memory-carving is a fresh, grounded transformation of the “token object” trope. Risky choice—no dialogue, no overt antagonist—heightens interior stakes and succeeds.</comment>
