<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kaelen’s interiority is vivid—tasting ozone and remorse, feeling Elara’s grief as a jolt—but the final absorption of the lord’s memory is slightly under-dramatized; we see the cost (“a new stone in his gut”) more than the moment of choice. Motivation remains consistent and intensifies, yet the boy’s interiority is absent, limiting relationship crucible. Still, contradictory impulses (preserve vs. erase) are embodied in the coral’s weeping, earning the ending.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the boy’s return and Kaelen’s burden crystallize in the coral’s sigh. Causal chain holds—tidal-pool reading → coral tracing → memory digestion—though the “how” of subsume is lightly elided. Cost is legible on the final line. Orientation is swift; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The damp fortress air and fossil-coral pavilion are tactile, selective, and constrain Kaelen’s method; the tidal pool’s micro-setting literally shapes his next move. Frost receding to “mere glisten” mirrors emotional release. No static cataloging; every detail earns its place.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—retrieve the boy without losing Kaelen—tightens when he must choose to internalize the memory. Escalation is causal: each analytical step narrows options until only ingestion remains. Cost is visible in Kaelen’s stagger and new weight.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of inherited grief emerges through coral architecture and taste; no moralizing. The final image of Kaelen “rougher” reframes the opening desire to “sandpaper” others’ pain. Subtext in Elara’s whispered “unspoken dream” carries generational loss without exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is sensorial and chef-specific—“broth of love, fear of loss”—with rhythmic control under pressure. POV remains locked; no head-hop. Compression like “sturdy brittle” teaches the tone pattern early and pays off in the coral’s sigh.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet clear; each sentence advances. Metaphors (coral weeping, stone in gut) are precise and non-contradictory. No loops or scaffold. Minor elevation in diction stays within Kaelen’s perceptual lexicon.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Memory-chef in a fossil-coral tomb is a fresh synthesis; the trope of psychic gastronomy is grounded in tactile process. Risk of magical ingestion is fully committed to and paid for. Specificity of “coral icebound” makes the image non-transferable.</comment>
