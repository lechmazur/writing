<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“her breath coming in ragged clouds”), motivation singular and intensifying. The final renunciation of crown for keeper role is earned, but the spirit’s instant knowledge transfer feels slightly convenient, muting cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the queen’s stance crystallizes into eternal watch, cost legible in “the weight of her crown finally replaced.” Causal chain holds—dream summons → climb → ritual—under Accumulative/Textural lens; one minor ellipsis in how the ritual is learned.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cobalt grotto’s luminescent stone and rising fireflies constrain the final ritual; setting actively stitches the wound. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered. Spatial choreography is clean; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—mystery of bleeding starlight—tightens once when queen learns hereditary failure. Agency drives escalation: she climbs, accepts ritual, performs repair. Cost is visible (eternal vigil), though external pressure remains abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of inherited duty versus personal disenchantment emerges through image pattern (lace of menace → lace of renewal). Final image reweights crown as burden, keeper role as purpose, without moralizing. Subtext in shared exhale is potent.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with rhythmic control under pressure (“slow, swirling vortex of bleeding starlight”). POV remains tightly anchored; no head-hop. Spirit’s diction is distinct, softly commanding, matching status.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; figurative language is patterned and paid off (“lacy menace weaving through her sleep”). No loops or scaffold. One mixed metaphor—“tear in the fabric of reality”—slightly blurs physical logic, but does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Familiar quest arc is transformed through cosmic wound and firefly suturing, specific to this world. The synthesis of celestial and terrestrial light feels inevitable. Risk in lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
