<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—her loneliness, obsession, and ethical reckoning are embodied in chalked walls and gritty dials. The final renunciation (fracturing the broadcast) is earned by her prior investment and despair, carrying visible cost. Minor drift: the prophet remains off-stage, so relationship crucible is absent, but single-POV focus holds.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the prophet’s message is atomized into static, reweighting the meaning of “variant allegiance.” Causal chain—hear, transcribe, broadcast, co-option, fracture—holds under Accumulative/Textural lens. One micro-turn suffices; cost is legible in the final image of secret whispers.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The stormlit observatory and cobalt portico are not backdrop; the portico refracts lightning and later becomes the metaphorical lens Elara rejects. Weather and architecture constrain every move—equipment grounded in copper veins, glass fracturing light. Sensory detail is selective, urgent, and filtered through her fatigue.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserve the prophet’s plural truth—tightens when the Unified Dawn perverts it. Escalation is one deepening: jamming forces Elara to abandon the spire’s authority and scatter the message. Cost is the loss of centralized voice; agency remains hers.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of variant allegiance emerges organically from signal fragmentation; no moralizing. Final image reconfigures meaning: truth survives as puzzle, not doctrine. Subtext in the static’s hiss and the portico’s refracted light carries the weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct—lyric yet weather-worn, matching the storm and the prophet’s weary cadence. Compression (“a gentle rain of ideas after the long drought”) is taught early and paid off. No head-hopping; POV stays locked to Elara’s sensorium.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; metaphors are precise (“sapphire shards,” “chorus of variants”). No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances. Rhythm accelerates under pressure, then fractures with the broadcast—form mirrors content.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: post-apocalyptic radio mysticism refracted through glass architecture. The prophet’s disembodied voice and Elara’s anti-broadcast feel inevitable yet non-obvious. Risk in the lyric-static structure pays off in closure.</comment>
