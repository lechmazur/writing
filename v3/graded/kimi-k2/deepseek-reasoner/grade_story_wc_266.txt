<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s grief is embodied in hollowed-out silence and the glowing star; his micro-choice to climb despite exhaustion crystallizes the internal shift. The guides remain archetypal, but their pressure on Elias is immediate and stakes-shaping. The final image—star dimming as courage is reclaimed—earns the change with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the star’s fading light marks the decisive internal shift from paralysis to self-possession. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each leg of the journey layers density until the ridge-top stillness reweights the premise. Cost is legible in the spent star and the lullaby’s fade.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The drowned cathedral groves and veiled ridgeway are rendered with selective sensory detail that constrains movement and mood. The star on the wrist functions as micro-setting, guiding each footfall. Environment and object together charge the final image without ornamental excess.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reclaiming abandoned courage—is signaled early and tightened once: the guides refuse to carry him further, forcing the climb. The pressure is coherent under the Accumulative lens; the cost is the spent star and the bodily effort of ascent. One meaningful deepening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: courage is not granted but uncovered through ordeal. The shoreline lullaby and star motif reconfigure meaning at the end without moralizing. Subtext resides in gesture—the silent vigil, the cold pressure of the punch—rather than exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded, with rhythmic control that mirrors the river’s languid pull and the climb’s measured persistence. Perceptual signature is consistent: Elias notices light, texture, and sound through a lens of exhaustion and wonder. No head-hopping; compression is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid; each sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. Figurative language is selective—“drowned cathedral,” “river’s leash”—and never clutters the closure beat. No loops or scaffold; syntax modulates with scene tempo.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The mythic ferry passage is refreshed through tactile specificity and the understated star toll. The transformation of a generic “find courage” arc into a quiet, sensory pilgrimage feels inevitable. Risk lies in the near-allegorical guides, but the grounded detail keeps it from cliché.</comment>
