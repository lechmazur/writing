<comment>Elara is sharply defined: singlesighted attachment to her theory, embodiment of mystic sensitivity (hearing quartz, perceiving metaphysics), and credible internal contradiction (rage at academics leaks into car). Choices track: anger poured into car→ ice scream; pride humbled by arbor. Quiet renunciation earned—firmly rooted mystic now widened by arbor’s depth.</comment>

<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: recurring image of “absorbed emotion” charges every beat from car frost to quartz core. Closure is a Charged Poise—Elara kneels beneath split tree, crystallized understanding hits without needing overt act. Cause/effect woven via prism-light coaching attention from personal anger to cosmic feeling.</comment>

<question>3</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Quartz arbor functions as living character: mist transduces sound, crystals’ violet core reframes human rage as planetary memory. Micro-choice—leaning against wounded tree—constrained by its glowing hollow. Late-night driveway passage is atmospheric engine, not set dressing. Specificity over breadth: one grove, two shards (car, tree).</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—prove objects absorb emotion—escalates from window-shards of anger to arbor’s soul-mirror. Prism forces choice: dismiss petty rage or accept universal scale. Arbor damaged by same cold that honed anger tightens metaphor until Elara surrenders ego. Cost legible in kneel under halved tree.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme surfaces via concrete pattern: each object holds a “truthful lie” of frozen feeling, culminating in arbor’s communal memory overriding Elara’s personal grievance. No pronouncements—quiet reverence closes the story. Emotional honesty in rage→wisdom arc, morally ambiguous: belief validated but vision dwarfed.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Distinct perceptual voice: “hummed with low frequency only she seemed to hear.” Syntax mirrors mystic cadence—long intoxicated sentences against sharp freeze-shard fragments during anger visualization. No head-hops. POV filter guides selective sensory detail, compresses without losing clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is taut and textured: “visual scream of spiked angles,” “truthful lie” language calls back prism/frost. Zero loops, zero filter-verb stacks. High information density; each sentence advances character, argument, or atmosphere. Rhythm breathes (long late-night calm vs volta at tree split).</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Idea is familiar trope—objects as emotional vessels—reframed through specific lived detail: brutal academic dismissal, quartz trees’ violet heart. Prism as mystic tool repurposed from anger mirror to cosmic lens. Bold risk: arbor breaks itself, not protagonist wielding power. Necessary renunciation emerges organically.</comment>
