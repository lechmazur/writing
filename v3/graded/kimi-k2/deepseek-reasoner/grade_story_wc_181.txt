<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses (curiosity vs institutional taboo) act simultaneously in scene. The final choice to eat the fruit is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost—the cameo now bears her profile. Minor slip: “philosophical panic” edges toward diagnostic label-speak, but the embodied reaction (“skin prickle”) rescues it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the journal’s final “Yes” crystallizes choice and reweights the premise. Causal lens holds—each beat because/therefore narrows options until the decisive act. Cost is legible in the blank cameo resolving into her own face, a permanent alteration. No orientation debt; anchors arrive by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The crystalline orchard is selective, sensory, and purposeful; its wrongness constrains Elara’s hesitation and later choice. Micro-setting (gazebo of woven light) provides the only unobserved space, directly enabling the epiphany. Final image—the fruit’s nebula-light flowing through her—charges the closure. One minor spatial blur: “petrified root” could be sharper.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—accept or refuse the inheritance—is signaled early and tightens once: the journal’s blank pages begin scripting her in real time. Escalation is causal: blank cameo → unobserved gazebo → final choice with irreversible cost. No coincidence resolves the conflict; agency is hers alone.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of self-authored knowledge emerges organically from the blank cameo and the journal’s script. Subtext operates in gesture (hand snatching back from fruit) and silence inside the gazebo. Final image reweights the premise without moralizing: knowledge is not received but carved. Avoids tidy binaries—inheritance is both gift and burden.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, lyrical, and POV-locked; perceptual signature (“brightened disquiet”) is consistent. Compression and elision (“disorienting slide through folded space”) are taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates with stress. One register drift: “cosmologist’s alleged method” feels slightly academic for Elara’s interior.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence advances story or atmosphere. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is controlled and purposeful. Rhythm accelerates under pressure (“She reached out, her hand no longer hesitant”). Minor mixed metaphor—“orchard sighed, a wave of energy”—but clarity remains intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes familiar tropes (forbidden knowledge, living text) into a fresh angle: inheritance as blank silhouette awaiting self-carving. The pistachio-shell cameo is specific, irreverent, and thematically central. Risk-taking (real-time scripting, gazebo reprieve) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Transformation test: story collapses if cameo or orchard is swapped.</comment>
