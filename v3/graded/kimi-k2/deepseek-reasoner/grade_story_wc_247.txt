<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—her “quiet, constant hum” and the embodied sorrow/joy tension are specific. The grandfather’s presence is memory-made-flesh, not exposition. Micro-choice (raising the blind camera) aligns with motive. Cost is felt in the final solitude: the music is hers alone.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single-scene arc holds under Accumulative/Textural lens: silence is textured into music, disrupted, then re-won. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—her stance crystallizes as solitary conductor; cost is the eternal secrecy. Causality is interior but legible: map → translate → defend.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Moonlit harbor is not backdrop; its “luminous path” becomes the staff on which she writes her score. The camera’s brass and the groaning pier supply tactile constraints. Final image of dawn light recharges the opening moonlight, reweighted by loss.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake: preserve silence’s music against violation. Tightening occurs when speedboat shatters the map; Elara’s agency answers with a single trumpet-note that silences the intruder. Cost is the unshareable beauty—felt, not declared.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges: translation as both gift and exile. Subtext lives in gesture—sign language for silence, camera click for unheard chord. Final solitude is the non-literal answer: communion without audience.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Lyric third-person limited stays inside Elara’s perceptual filter; moonlight, salt, brass textures are hers. No head-hop; even the grandfather’s signs arrive as remembered instruction. Rhythm modulates with pressure—long sentences swell, then cut to the single trumpet note.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable; figurative language serves the musical conceit without clutter. No loops or scaffold. Sentence lengths orchestrate tension—crescendo and abrupt rest. Final line lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Premise—translating silence into music via a blind camera and sign language—is fresh and fully committed. Tropes (mentor spirit, magical object) are transformed through specificity of method and the bittersweet cost. Risky lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
