<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s interior state is lucid—betrayal, memory of Lyra, and the deciduous-vow reframe all push clear micro-choices (pilfering the lens shards, climbing the pillar, tying the ribbon). Embodied emotion registers (soot-stained apron, mortar-grit fingers). The final stance crystallizes with visible cost: surrender to the Guild’s verdict, irrevocable pivot to a new spectral lens. Relationship crucible is modest—only Lyra appears late to soften anger into shared wonder—but the generational bridge is earned and felt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Causal lens: because/therefore linkages escalate—breach→flight→re-purposing shards→pendulum lens→shared reconfiguration. Closure lands with conceptual repricing: “some vows are deciduous” recalibrates meaning rather than resolving plot. Cost is legible in surrendered craft reputation and cathedral exile. All temporal anchors arrive swiftly. No ambiguity at payoff.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Orchard canopy and shattered window anchor who/where early; cathedral interior offers tactile access and light palette for the finale rainbow. Environment serves tactical use: rafters as workshop, stone as grinder. Scale of description is selective and purposeful. One prop (quartz shard) constrains the final choice, satisfying the 9+ micro-setting gate.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—Guild betrayal severs Elara’s path; the pendulum lens reweights options without offering a clean victory. Escalation pivots on her hands-on re-composition of light rather than revenge or appeal. One credible on-page loss: professional identity, now “heretical.” Pressure is coherent, no coincidence resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Theme of vows as organic, seasonal cycles emerges through action (leaf dropped from satchel → decid lens → ribbon flag). No explicit speechifying; final dialogue reframes rather than sermonizes. Subtext breathes in the mother-daughter tension and shattered rose-window light. Leaves ambiguity without drifting into pseudo-profundity.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate POV remains stable; voice has perceptual signature filtered through Elara’s craft lexicon (“grinds quartz with stone,” not generic description). Rhythm modulates under pressure—slow grind beats, sudden sun-strike rainbows. Lyra’s arrival speech carries youthful briskness distinct from maternal interior. Compression taught early: river stone, clasp, leaf all matter in the scene rather than in later exposition.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Lines propel: “she climbed a stone pillar, finding purchase in the mortar gaps” fuses body, place, action. Only negligible scaffold—a near-loop “the rainbows danced around Lyra, painting her in fleeting colors” is slight paraphrase but remains earned visual climax. Strong varied syntax; no mixed metaphor. Error-free mechanics.</comment>

<grade>8.9</question>
<comment>Quartz-lens optics repurposed into spectrum-prism ribbon yields fresh angle on familiar “broken healer” trope. Cathedral orchard defies cliché and becomes organic workshop. Concept feels inevitable after leaf-letting motif; synthesis is seamless. Bold structural choice to keep climax quiet and symbolic—risk pays off.</comment>
