<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—seeking a lost twin who is herself—drives every beat; the emerald card’s re-weighting from memento to shard of self is embodied and costly. The final weaving-back is earned by prior causality and carries visible emotional price. Minor slip: “blissfully aberrant” is asserted more than dramatized until the end.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the garden is revealed as the moment of self-reintegration, reweighting the entire quest. Causal linkage holds—each logbook clue and sensory echo tightens toward the final image. Fog-lifting to bedroom is a decisive change with felt cost. No orientation debt; lens is Accumulative/Textural and coherent.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The ship-as-mind micro-setting constrains every move: rotting boards, salt-rot, silent carousels mirror fractured identity. Fog and dusk narrow perception in real time, guiding Elara to the bow. Final bedroom reveal re-uses the emerald card as charged object, satisfying 9+ gate. Selective sensory detail never stalls momentum.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—wholeness via recovered twin—is signaled early and tightened once: the “passenger of two minds” logbook entry reframes the quest from search to self-repair. Agency is Elara’s interpretive labor; cost is the dissolution of the fantasy brother. One meaningful deepening suffices under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of fractured identity emerges organically from plot and image; no moralizing. The garden’s redefinition as the instant of reintegration offers resonant, non-literal answer. Emerald card’s shift from clue to mirror charges the final image with conceptual cost. Complexity lingers without tidy resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; perceptual signature filters decayed carnival through grief-tinted synesthesia. Compression and patterned elision (“story she was desperately trying to read backwards”) are taught early and paid off. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens under pressure. Rhythm modulates with fog-dusk transition.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. “Unkindled solace” risks abstraction but is grounded in salt-rot and frayed fabric. Final line crystallizes without overwriting. Minor filter-verb cluster mid-story (−0.2) prevents 9+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: abandoned carnival ship as literal mindscape, twin as dissociated self. Trope of lost sibling is inverted into self-reintegration. Risky lyric structure pays off in closure. Specificity of emerald card’s color and texture anchors universals. Transformation test: story collapses if elements swapped.</comment>
