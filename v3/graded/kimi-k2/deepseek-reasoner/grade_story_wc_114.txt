<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her “hollowed out and clear” state, the “baptism of ice,” the “grim peace”—but the final beat of grief for the valley feels slightly generalized, not fully earned by prior interior contradiction. Micro-choices (cleaning the lens, crawling under the station) align with motive and reveal hierarchy of values. No second character on page, so relationship crucible waived. Fault-tolerance as trait is dramatized through her struggle with flawed data rather than stated.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: fever → flawed visions → sensor failure → crawl to margin → emergency alert. Closure is Earned Stasis: she transmits the warning, accepts the “immense and terrible weight,” and the dawn light crystallizes the cost. No orientation drift; anchors (Mount Hebron station, dawn after fever) are clear by line 3. One transition (gantry → crawlspace) is clean and motivated.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is not postcard: the station’s “humming servers,” “vicious mountain wind,” and “crusted rime” actively constrain choices and damage tools. The botanical illustration reappears at closure to reweight the stake. Spatial choreography on the gantry is precise; no impossible positions. Sensory hierarchy narrows under stress to wind, cold, dark display—exactly what survival filters.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—verify the swallowed truth of imminent flood—is signaled in paragraph 2 and tightened when the primary sensor fails. Escalation is causal: each attempt (gantry, crawlspace) narrows options and raises cost. Final cost is the irreversible knowledge she must broadcast. No coincidence resolves; luck only delays discovery.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of knowledge as burden emerges through specific events: the extinct flower, the failed forecast, the “brutal clarity of fact.” No moralizing; the dawn light offers a non-literal answer to what seeing truly costs. Subtext in the flower’s fragility and the station’s failing margins deepens the ecological grief without exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, scientific yet lyrical—“auroral sorrow,” “fault-tolerant oracle”—and remains consistent under stress. Compression is purposeful: “She suited up, her movements slow and deliberate” skips transit without loss. No dialogue, so mechanics waived. Perceptual signature is filtered through meteorological expertise and post-fever clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and dense: “the single room was a capsule of humming servers” does triple duty. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances. Figurative language is selective and earned—“baptism of ice” is the only overt metaphor in the crisis beat and it lands. Technical diction (anemometer, barometer) is accurate and character-bound.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Premise—post-climatic oracle at isolated station—feels fresh, not template. The extinct flower and “fault-tolerant” implant are specific inventions that shape stakes. Risk in quiet, interior climax is taken and paid off. Transformation test: swapping names or places would break the ecological specificity and the implant logic.</comment>
