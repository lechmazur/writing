<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—her dread is embodied in the “cold dread, colder than the grotto’s air.” The shift from self-referential weaving to cosmic orientation is a credible, costly renunciation of her old stance. The only drag is a touch of diagnostic self-awareness (“she was boundary-lessly trapped”) that edges toward label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the fractal tapestry reframes her purpose from archive to testament. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—density and pattern break reweight the stake. Cost is legible in the extinguished lamp and her “exhaled breath she felt she had been holding for years.” Orientation is swift; no drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The bronze grotto, star-slit roof, and crystalline walls are not backdrop; their cosmic orientation literally reorients her weaving. Sensory detail is selective—wet metal, old stone, starlight—and constrains the final choice. Micro-setting (lamp, pedestal) doubles as tool and axis. One hairline slip: “shingled hush” is evocative but never re-anchored.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transforming the archive’s burden—is signaled early. Escalation is a single, decisive intensification: the calcifying collapse that forces re-orientation. Agency is hers; the star pattern is discovered, not granted. Cost is the surrender of her prior method and the risk of blindness while weaving behind her back.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the weave itself: preservation versus witness. The final tapestry “asked only to be seen,” a non-literal answer to the burden of carrying others’ pain. No moralizing; the shift is felt in the image. Subtext is carried by silence and starlight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise—“whalebone reverie,” “shingled hush”—with rhythmic control that modulates under pressure. Compression is taught early and paid off in the final cadence. No head-hopping; POV remains locked to Elara’s sensorium. Distinct perceptual signature throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence layers image, emotion, and motion. No loops or scaffold. Metaphors are coherent—“crystalline formations like frozen moss”—and serve the texture. One minor register drift: “boundary-lessly” feels coined rather than inevitable.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The fractal-weaver archiving grief via cosmic orientation is a fresh synthesis of mythic and mathematical. Risky lyric compression is fully committed and pays off. The transformation of calcification from failure to balance feels inevitable in hindsight. No derivative echoes.</comment>
