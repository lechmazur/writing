<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interiority is embodied and character-specific; the trauma responses feel lived-in. The shift from endurance to mercy is dramatized through concrete micro-choices (noting fractals, releasing strap). The final renunciation lands with visible cost, though the mathematics metaphor flirts with abstraction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the strap’s release crystallizes mercy as self-measurement. Causal chain—pain → pattern-seeking → self-recognition—holds under Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is swift; no teleporting props. Cost is legible in the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Violet forest is vivid, selective, and purposeful: pollen, bark, fungi all constrain perception and supply pattern variables. Micro-setting (his own body) functions as charged environment. One minor spatial slip—distance to pedestal not tracked—but final image re-anchors.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can mercy be calculated?—tightens as each sensory datum becomes a variable. One clear deepening: from endurance to self-forgiveness. Cost is felt in the strap’s fall, though pressure plateaus rather than spikes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: mercy as non-quantifiable self-acceptance. Subtext carried by the strap’s evolving weight and the reflection’s geometry. Final image reframes prior pain without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent under stress. Compression (“raw data of existence”) teaches the pattern early. No POV leakage; perceptual signature remains character-bound. Rhythm modulates with pain spikes.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is pattern-taught and paid off. One filter-verb cluster mid-scene (“he saw only…”) but no loops or mixed metaphors. Final paragraph lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: trauma math + bioluminescent penance. Tropes transformed through embodied specificity. Risky lyric mode succeeds; premise commits fully without gimmickry.</comment>
