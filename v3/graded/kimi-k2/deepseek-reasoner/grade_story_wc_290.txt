<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s claustrophobia and prudence are embodied in micro-choices (measuring steps, cold focus under panic) and culminate in the decisive press of the compass; the cost—her fear transmuted into earned knowledge—lands cleanly. Interiority is specific, never diagnostic. Only the absence of a second on-page character prevents higher-band crucible dynamics.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: compass-touch triggers organ tone → silver blueprint → keyhole → lens projection, each beat a because/therefore linkage. Closure is a Decisive Change: the wall opens, knowledge replaces void, and the cost is the irreversible exposure of the lost archive. No orientation drift; spatial anchors are immediate.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The star-ceiling, spherical prison, and crystal lens are not backdrop but instruments: the false constellations focus through the lens to project the map, directly enabling closure. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered; the “crushing dark” and gemstone starlight mirror Elara’s internal stakes. One minor slip—“era of the fallow period” is summary exposition.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover the vital key—is signaled early and tightened when the room refuses entry; the organ’s chord escalates pressure until the compass insertion forecloses retreat. Cost is the irreversible revelation of hidden knowledge, paid on the page. Agency is hers alone; coincidence complicates but does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of wistful rebellion against oblivion emerges through concrete action: the chamber’s mutiny is not defiance of her but defense of memory. Final projection of star-chart reweights the premise—knowledge itself is the key—without moralizing. Subtext resides in silence and light, not statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, lyrical yet precise: “frantic bird in a stone cage,” “spatial mutiny.” Syntax modulates with pressure—short clauses under panic, longer cadences during revelation. No head-hopping; POV remains tightly bound to Elara’s perceptual field. One near-purple phrase—“wistful rebellion against the impossible odds”—barely grazes excess.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, propulsive, and information-dense; every sentence advances plot or atmosphere. Metaphors are controlled and purposeful. No loops, scaffold, or register drift. The final image—“star chart of impossible accuracy”—lands with crystalline clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses claustrophobia, celestial cartography, and sonic architecture into a fresh synthesis. The compass-as-key and organ-as-lock invert expectations organically. Specificity of the star-ceiling projection feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking (sound as inscription) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
