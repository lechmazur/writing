<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s drive to “compile fragments into meaning” is embodied in tactile micro-choices—tracing maker’s marks, cross-referencing logs—culminating in the charged moment she re-weights the valve as “a seed.” The contradiction between her exile and the ship’s mission is felt, not told, and her final resolve carries visible cost: she must publicly honor those who enforced her prison.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the valve re-frames her exile from tragedy to paradoxical liberation. Causal chain holds—valve → smithy → garrison → Sea-Scribe → exile—without gaps. The cost is legible: she will carry the moral weight of their deaths. Orientation is clean within 120 words; lens is Causal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Ivory Harbor’s rain-washed quays and the half-repaired library’s “missing teeth” anchor place and mood. The valve functions as micro-setting, its cold brass constraining her grip and later re-weighted in the final image. Selective sensory detail (salt-sting, dripping water) filters through Elara’s archivist priorities without tourist catalog.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—uncovering the Sea-Scribe’s mission—tightens once when the single line “silent warning” redefines her exile. Escalation is causal: each archival step narrows interpretive options until the final reframing. Cost is felt: her freedom required their drowning. No reversals beyond the decisive re-weighting.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from particulars: archival reconstruction as both wound and suture. The trumpet valve’s shift from relic to key embodies the paradox of enforced silence enabling voice. No moralizing; the ending’s “warning that became a welcome” invites counter-readings without tidy resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays close to Elara’s perceptual filter—“salt-sting of the sea still a comfort”—with consistent lexicon. Syntax mirrors methodical thought: layered clauses for cross-referencing, short pulses at revelation. No dialogue, so no voice convergence. Rhythm modulates with pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet textured: “gaps like missing teeth in a familiar smile” does double duty. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances. Metaphors are precise and earned. Opening and closing lines frame the arc cleanly. Zero artifacts in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: archival recovery as inverted detective story where the absence is the culprit. The exile’s jailer becoming unwitting liberator is non-obvious yet inevitable. Specific occupational detail (maker’s mark, census log) grounds the premise without exposition dump.</comment>
