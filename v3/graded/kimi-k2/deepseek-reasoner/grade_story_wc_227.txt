<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—despair vs. hope, fear vs. resolve—are embodied in her trembling hands and the warm charm; the final renunciation (accepting the workshop’s loss while redeeming the statue) is earned by prior micro-choices and carries visible cost. Interiority is specific and sensory, avoiding label-speak. The only minor slip is a touch of diagnostic self-awareness in “she was narrating a biography of loss,” but it is brief and does not undercut the earned stasis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the statue’s golden veins blaze while the workshop dissolves, reweighting the premise that brokenness equals value. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each matched pockmark is a density increase that culminates in the final luminous image. Causality is intact; no teleporting props or retroactive patches. Cost is legible in the swallowed gears and Elara’s last breath.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The acid sea, ticking gears, and corroding glass constrain every choice and charge the final image; the workshop’s dissolution is felt in the lungs. Sensory detail is selective and urgent—acid hiss, copper tang, warm metal—filtered through Elara’s priorities. Spatial choreography is clean; no floating rooms. The environment’s pressure directly shapes tactics and the ending’s glow.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove broken things hold worth—is signaled early and tightened by each pockmark matched; the final blaze forecloses retreat. Escalation is driven by Elara’s agency under Accumulative pressure; the snapped gear and rising acid raise cost without coincidence. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length. The price is visible: the workshop lost, the statue alone afloat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically from the kintsugi conceit: damage as luminous record. No moralizing; the final image reweights prior scars into gold without stating a thesis. Subtext operates in the sculptor’s weeping and Elara’s silent stitching. The aftereffect lingers—beauty wrought from ruin—without sentimentality.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with rhythmic control under pressure: “the moment stretching thin and taut between breaths held underwater.” Perceptual signature is consistent—Elara notices acid hiss, ticking clocks, warm metal. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens as doom nears. One minor register drift (“pieced-together history”) is negligible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; every sentence advances story or atmosphere. Figurative language is purposeful—acid “licked at her boots”—and never muddles causality. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn. Rhythm accelerates with the snapping gear and final inundation, then crystallizes in the last line’s quiet glow.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The kintsugi premise fused with a floating acid-workshop alchemist is fresh and fully committed; no template echo. The transformation test passes—this story could not swap settings without collapse. Specificity (olive-wood scent, copper tang) grounds the fantastical. Risk-taking (lyric compression, accumulative structure) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
