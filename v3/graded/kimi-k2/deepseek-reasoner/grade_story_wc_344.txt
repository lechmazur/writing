<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her breath plumes, her hands “uncap” the lock, her nostalgia is tactile. Motivation (“rhythm of repair”) is stated early and re-energized by the mirrors and gears, culminating in a visible cost: the moment she repairs is her own fractured self. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible waived. One minor slip: “driftwood nostalgia” edges toward label-speak, but the embodied context rescues it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density of mirrored selves and gear-symphony builds to a cadence shift that reweights the stake. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—mirrors still, light warms, world resumes—cost is the irrevocable alignment of her possible selves into one present tense. Orientation anchored by 120 words; no causality breaks. One seamless transition from library to mirror-hall.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Frozen library and mirror-hall are rendered with selective, sensory precision; ice refracts light that later softens, directly constraining and then enabling the repair. Micro-setting (the gear-pedestal) functions as locus of choice. Spatial choreography clean; no white-room drift. Slight over-reliance on visual, but other senses (cold air, tonal hum) balance it.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—repair the schismed moment—signaled early. Escalation is textural: each gear placed tightens the tonal frequency until the final click reconfigures reality. Cost is the loss of all alternate selves but one. No external antagonist needed; pressure is ontological and coherent under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of wholeness-through-fracture emerges organically from the mirrors and gears; no explicit moralizing. Final image of unified reflection and thawing light offers a non-literal answer to the question of repair. Subtext in the silence between light and shadow is sustained. One near-miss: “universal past of wholeness” flirts with abstraction, but context keeps it earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with rhythmic control that accelerates during gear-assembly. Perceptual signature is consistent—Elara notices through locksmith-sight and eclipse cadence. No dialogue, so no voice convergence issue. Occasional elevated diction (“repository of forgotten truths”) is justified by the mythic register taught early.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; each sentence layers image or action. No loops, no mixed metaphors. Minor scaffold: “deep click resonated… not a sound but a feeling” could be tighter, but it occurs mid-scene, not at closure. Strong verbs (“pierced,” “webbed,” “meshed”) and concrete nouns throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise—lunar-eclipse locksmith repairing time with phase-keys—is fresh and fully committed to. Mirrors as fractured selves and gears as temporal notes synthesize into an inevitable yet non-obvious closure. No derivative echoes; risk-taking (hall of living mirrors, conceptual repair) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
