<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s drive to “cultivate foresight” is dramatized through micro-choices—mapping wind, pocketing the patch, rerouting tactics—each with visible cost (aching teeth, risk of catatonia). Interiority stays concrete and embodied; no stock labels. The final act of ripping the power coupling is earned by prior causality and forecloses further investigation, satisfying closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each beat (survey → map → deduce → act) links by “because/therefore.” Orientation is anchored within 120 words. Closure is a decisive physical act with felt cost (the hum ceases, silence returns). No teleporting props or retro patches.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The container labyrinth is not backdrop; its geometry shapes wind vectors that Elias must navigate, directly constraining his path to the epicenter. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (“rust-colored canyon,” “teeth ache”). Final image reweights the setting from threat to neutral quiet.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—stop the infrasound before irreversible catatonia—is signaled early and tightened once: the map reveals a single convergence, forcing Elias to risk direct exposure. Cost is visceral (pressure on teeth, proximity to catatonia). Agency drives escalation; coincidence only complicates.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of unintended consequence emerges organically from the engine’s “accident” and the engineer’s patch. No moralizing; resonance arises from the final reconfiguration of silence from weapon to natural absence. Subtext in the patch’s irony is understated yet potent.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elias’s perceptual signature—technical diction (“anemometer,” “infrasound”) filtered through bodily stress. Rhythm modulates with pressure; no head-hopping. Voice is distinct and consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, vivid, propulsive. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances. Metaphors (“woolen quiet,” “rust-colored canyon”) are precise and purposeful. Technical terms are accurate and integrated into action.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: infrasound weaponized by accidental resonance inside a shipping maze. The patch’s bitter coincidence feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking (scientific premise, quiet ending) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
