<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—logic vs intuition—drives every beat; the tearful smile at the end is earned by prior micro-choices and carries visible cost. The “secretly sentimental” trait constrains her final surrender to wonder, not just a label. No secondary character on page, so relationship bullets waived.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the orchard’s glowing fruit and Elara’s empty palm crystallize the new balance with felt cost. Causal lens holds—each beat because/therefore—no teleporting props or retro-patches. Orientation anchored by ~80 words; no debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The kaleidoscopic waterfall and orchard are not backdrop; their mist and light become active reagents in the final synthesis. Spatial choreography is clean; the brazier’s flame and vapor track plausibly. Environment constrains the climax and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—harmonize logic and intuition—tightens once when Elara renounces forced synthesis and instead creates conditions for emergence. Cost is legible: the crystal is gone, the orchard irreversibly altered. Escalation coherent under causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the orchard’s glowing fruit and the starlings’ wordless dance; no final-paragraph moralizing. The ending reweights the premise without statement, offering a non-literal answer to the central question. Complexity lingers without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Elara’s alchemical diction (“ledger of formulae,” “primordial potential”) stays consistent under pressure. No dialogue, so voice judged solely on internal texture and description; rhythm modulates with emotional intensity. No POV drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is vivid yet lean; no loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Sentence rhythm accelerates during the starling descent, then exhales in the final image. Figurative language is purposeful and never muddies causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of crystalline logic and avian intuition feels inevitable yet non-obvious; the premise is transformed through specific, grounded choices. Risk-taking (alchemy + murmuration) heightens stakes without gimmickry. No close echoes of famous scenes.</comment>
