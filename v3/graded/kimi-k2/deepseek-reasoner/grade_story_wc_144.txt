<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is embodied and specific—her fingertips “reading” sound and pressure, the warmth of the lamp on her hands—but the client remains a cipher, so relationship pressure is absent. The final micro-choice (the gold-wire bypass) is earned by prior sensory deduction and carries a visible cost: the drone’s instant flight away from her palm, severing her tactile connection. Blindness is not a label; it constrains every beat and forces inventive method. One more contradiction in her own psyche would have pushed this into the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each beat flows “because/therefore” from the last, culminating in the decisive change—the drone’s restored song guiding the *Aetherwind*. Closure lands on the page with felt cost: Elara’s quiet relinquishment as the hummingbird vanishes into the mist. Orientation is anchored by word 60. No teleporting props or retro-patching. A hairline slip: the depot’s social fabric is sketched rather than tested, keeping it just shy of 9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The mist-coated depot is evoked through sound, temperature, and the wet slap of anxious footsteps; the ceramic bowl of water becomes a micro-setting that literally reframes the drone’s failure. Spatial choreography is clean—bench, lamp, bowl, open door track without drift. The environment constrains choice: the anchor horn’s deadline is audible pressure. One more sensory detail tethered to Elara’s blindness (e.g., echo-location off the iron ribs) would have nudged 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—decode the drone or the airship is lost—is signaled in paragraph two and tightened by the three-hour horn. Escalation is causal: each diagnostic step narrows options until the bypass is the only path left. Cost is visible: Elara trades her calm isolation for the risk of public failure. The client’s fear supplies external pressure, but the depot engineers remain off-stage, muting the crucible effect slightly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges implicitly: perception is an act of repair—broken data re-ordered into direction. The hummingbird’s final chime reweights the opening image of “sound and pressure” into navigable song. No moralizing; the resonance is in the gesture of release. A touch more ambiguity about whether the drone’s new path is truly safe would have deepened the conceptual repricing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is tactile, rhythmic, and blind-specific: “a topography she navigated with her fingertips and the echoes of her own quiet breaths.” Syntax tightens under pressure—short, percussive clauses during soldering. No head-hopping; the apprentice is heard but never focalized. The final image crystallizes the voice: “a speck of purpose against the grey mist.”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet textured: “fine metal shavings,” “indecipherable screeches of feedback.” No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances. Metaphors are grounded—“a bridge over a flooded river”—and never muddle causality. The closing line lands with sonic precision. A single redundant “quiet” could have been cut, but it does not dull the closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of blind engineer + atmospheric optics + hummingbird drone feels inevitable yet fresh. The trope of the gifted artisan is transformed through non-visual engineering logic. Risk is taken: the climax hinges on refraction physics perceived by ear, and it pays off without gimmickry. The final reconfiguration—data becomes song becomes flight—reverberates beyond the page.</comment>
