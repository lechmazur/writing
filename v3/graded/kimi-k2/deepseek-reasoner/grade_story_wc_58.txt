<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction flickers once (projecting presence vs documenting endings) but does not press beyond summary. Isolde’s grief is embodied, but the boy’s craftsman joy arrives fully formed from the thread rather than through prior causal stakes. The renunciation – keeping loss woven in – is emotionally plausible yet only thinly foreshadowed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the crimson thread reweights the stake mid-beat and lands Charged Poise in the final image. One clear deepening replaces causal reversal. Cost is felt but diffuse (thread warmth) rather than a concrete forfeiture.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Damp earth and chrysanthemum decay anchor the micro-setting; garden air tightens during the sensory flood, constraining Elara’s next step. The carpet’s oceanic geography literalizes stakes without cliché. Vividness doesn’t alter a final choice, keeping it from higher bands.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake – understanding healing as integration – emerges mid-scene. The crimson thread tightens it by turning memory into tactile presence, foreclosing a purely external escape. Cost is internal, not enacted on page.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme of healing-as-texture emerges organically from the carpet image and final gesture. Final line reweights “lonesome splendor” from deficiency to fullness without didactic statement. Remains resonant but slightly safer than daring.</comment>

<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Third-person omniscient stays tightly locked to Elara’s selective noticing. Syntax blooms without overwriting. Garden scent, sawdust, and pine resin are filtered through lived perception. No POV slippage; compression is taught early.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lyrical but compressed, propelling beats. Occasional lyrical overload (“gold veneer over deepening blue shadows”) but none dulls momentum. No figurative contradictions; syntax varies to mirror emotional intensification.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.7</question>
<comment>Premise – living obituarist weaving present absences – offers fresh angle on grief memoir. Carpet-as-map resists cliché by becoming tactile conduit. Transformation arises from specific tactile detail rather than device-y twist. Slightly quiet, avoiding maximal risk.</comment>
