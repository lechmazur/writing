<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is textured and embodied; her contradictory impulses—cataloguing death while craving continuity—are dramatized through tactile micro-choices (handling the shard, pricing the lamp). The final renunciation of panic in favor of timeless custodianship is earned and carries visible cost. Minor slip: the attic woman is more device than crucible, muting relationship pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara’s stance shifts from borrowed-time panic to translator of an ongoing continuum, cost paid in relinquished future. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of artifacts (urn, letters, garage-sale codes) thickens until meaning reweights. One clean transition (silo→attic) stays within scope. No orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Emerald silo’s claustrophobic curve and mildewed dust act as micro-setting that constrains breath and movement; attic trunk supplies new texture without white-room drift. Sensory hierarchy follows Elara’s failing lungs. The urn fragment’s cool weight anchors the final image, charging the continuum promise.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to spend finite breath—tightens when the phantom-year revelation forecloses denial. Escalation is textural: each artifact adds density until the cost of knowing outweighs the cost of dying. Agency remains Elara’s; the attic arrival complicates but does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of time’s texture emerges through concrete handling of objects rather than statement. The final image—shard returned as promise—reweights the entire catalogue of decay into continuity. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers about whose shame is erased.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is spare, elegiac, consistent with a dying archivist’s perceptual signature (“dust of decayed ambitions”). Compression and elision taught early (“1972b”) pay off at closure. No head-hopping; attic woman’s dialogue is brief, subtext-laden.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, information-dense; figurative language is selective (“ghost of a year”). No loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated diction (“continuum”) fits the curator’s lexicon. Clean mechanics.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses dying curator, phantom year, and garage-sale cryptography into a fresh angle on mortality and record-keeping. Risky structure—epistolary archaeology—pays off in earned resonance. Specificity prevents cliché; no derivative echoes.</comment>
