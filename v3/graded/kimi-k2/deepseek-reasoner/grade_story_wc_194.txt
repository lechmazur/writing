<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Elara’s desire to unearth the secret is textured through embodied interiority (the “weight” of the ledgers versus the physical hum in her bones), and her relief at discovering liberation rather than wealth lands with felt cost: she accepts herself as “conclusion,” not heir. Minor slips: two abstract pulses—“dynasty ender” and “gilded cage” lean diagnostic rather than embodied, though not enough to derail causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each sensory layer (gramophone silence, wire vibration, shadow solidifying) heightens knowledge and narrows possibilities. Closure qualifies as a Resonant Reconfiguration—the final image reframes the entire ledger ritual as gift rather than loss, with cost embodied in the “final, graceful note.” Orientation is clear by paragraph two.</comment>

<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>The sepia room, map, rug, and brass horn are evoked through touch and sound, not postcard listing; the gramophone’s crank handle physically enables the closing discovery, satisfying the microlocale constraint. One moment of static description—“Persian rug—” dips into ornament, but it is brief.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—“uncover the hidden truth”—is introduced early and tightened when the wire’s vibration reveals the handle. Pressure intensifies steadily under the Accumulative lens, yet the final shift trades discovery of fortune for discovery of freedom; the cost (Elara’s family myth dissolving) is evident but understated rather than visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The theme of generational liberation emerges organically through object resonance; the motif of “bridge” is earned when the wire literally lets sound carry family legacy into altered meaning. There is a line—“understood the map was … of choices”—that flirts with explicit thesis, trimming the ceiling of the band.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Free-indirect style remains fixed in Elara’s angle, diction consistent with a book-bound heir (“meticulous, yet ultimately futile, accounts”). Syntax ripples under sensory discovery—note the single run-on sentence spanning three clauses in the plucked-wire moment—yet never fractures into incoherence. Occasional lyric uplift edges toward purple only in the final sentence.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>The prose is largely clean and rhythmic; “liquid amber,” “bridge of intuition,” “elaborately silent” are felicitous without overwriting. One filter repetition—“she felt / she found / it felt”—clusters near the midpoint, dulling immediacy once.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>The fresh synthesis is turning a clichéd “last of the dynasty” into revelation of deliberate self-dissolution via literal sound wave. A hint of derivative gilded-cage phrasing prevents top band entry, but overall the angle is individual and memorable.</comment>
