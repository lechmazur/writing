<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Kiv’s curiosity is embodied in tactile tinkering and embodied awe; the arrow-tip micro-choice crystallizes his values under pressure. Interiority stays specific—no stock phrases—and the final smile carries earned cost. Minor slip: “irreverent awe” is asserted rather than dramatized once.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the bell-schematic etches a future that reweights the entire quest. Causal chain—arrow tip → kaleidoscope → algorithm → bell—holds without gaps. One transition (slotting the kaleidoscope) is clean and taught early.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The acid sea and floating workshop constrain every move; the brass disk’s final schematic is charged by the corrosive environment. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered. Spatial anchors are clear by line 3; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“to ring a bell no one hears yet”—is signaled early and tightened when the algorithm’s frantic clatter forces the arrow-tip gambit. Cost is visible: the relic’s past violence is repurposed, foreclosing nostalgia. One meaningful escalation suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of signaling an unborn future emerges through concrete mechanism rather than statement. The bell’s unheard chime becomes a non-literal answer to the story’s central question. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in the acid fog.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is distinct—measured, brass-tinted, slightly archaic—without slipping into pastiche. Compression and patterned elision (“gears-and-cogs heart ticking”) are taught early and paid off. No head-hopping; psychic distance stays tight.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence advances image or stakes. One minor loop—“yearning…yearning”—is quickly broken by new action. No mixed metaphors or register drift. Final image is crisp and uncluttered.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of steampunk salvage, evolutionary code, and unheard bell is non-obvious yet inevitable. Risky conceit (mechanical yearning) is fully committed to and pays off. Specificity of “acid sea” and “brass disk schematic” prevents generic drift.</comment>
