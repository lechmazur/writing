<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—duty to permanence vs personal sacrifice—drives every micro-choice; her gently thorough trait chokes alternative shortcuts and forces exacting action under pressure, earning the renunciation at the jetty.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closes with earned stasis: the weekly steeping reconfigures her identity from observer to covenant participant; the red bloom’s appearance late reweights prior material with undeniable conceptual cost, satisfying the Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Jetty’s bioluminescent moss, moss-light texture, and precise spatial choreography pressure tactics during the steeping ritual; the setting evolves to embody covenant renewal and supplies the final charged poise image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Pressure mounts when steeping changes stakes from archival duty to existential covenant; explicit cost felt in elemental colour shift and time pressure tightens choices without redundancy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of cyclical rebirth emerges via object-reprise rather than statement; ambiguity allowed—the covenant’s unbroken chain both haunting and euphoric—without tidy moral resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Distinct sensory filter—ink, salt, bioluminescence—colours perception under lyrical compression; interior monologue never lapses into therapy-speak but distills to pressure-driven thought.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with tide cadence; every descriptive sentence advances the atmosphere or character mindset; minor tautologies (<em>soft, pulsating blue light</em>) forgiven under pressure of lyrical mode.</comment>

<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Regenerational covenant not generic; crimson-to-blue bloom inversion feels inevitable. Risk-taking quiet ending elevates stakes without gimmickry, crystallizing cycle-of-memory trope into felt cost.</comment>
