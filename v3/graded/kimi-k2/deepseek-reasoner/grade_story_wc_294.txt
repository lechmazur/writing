<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Leo’s contradictory impulses (curiosity vs inherited criminality) generate on-page micro-choices—folding money into a dart, choosing to dissuade rather than kill. Yet interiority dips into editorial commentary (“paths circle because we insist…”), softening the felt cost of the final renunciation. Still, the Earned Stasis of dropping the strongbox remains credible and rooted in prior causality.</comment> 

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Leo leaves the train void and empty, a Decisive Change in inheritance. Accumulative/Textural lens holds via pattern of “circling” repeated images; the colorful money recharges as cautionary fossil. Cost is legible when the emptied strongbox becomes Leo’s forfeiture of potential wealth.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Desert dusk is atmospheric—bruise-colored sky, cool air—but rarely exerts physical constraint. The caboose serves as key micro-setting, guiding Leo’s hiding and dart launching, yet the train itself never complicates his movement or tactics beyond mood.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake: “will he inherit the outlaw circle?” signaled early. One micro-turn suffices—choosing non-violence to mark territory. However, the scavenger’s arrival feels coincidental rather than an escalation paid for by Leo’s prior choices, blurring felt cost at closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</question><comment>Theme of “circles” emerges iteratively from image chain—robber-turned-businessman-turned-robber, defunct currencies, scavenger’s inevitable flight. Avoids explicit moral yet slips into a slightly editorial final paragraph, blunting resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Controlled third-person voice filters observation through Leo’s sensibility—rust, dust, bruised sky—balanced by calm, rhythmic sentences. No head-hop; POV modesty holds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is generally clean, rhythmic, and concrete, but contains echoing “circling” abstractions and some overwritten lyrical filler (“dusky harmony settled over the landscape”). The final repetition of “path” three times in four sentences loops conceptually and weakens impact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of outlaws, startup dreams, and valueless relics feels organic. Circles metaphor transforms the trope of buried treasure into existential recursion without gimmickry.</comment>
