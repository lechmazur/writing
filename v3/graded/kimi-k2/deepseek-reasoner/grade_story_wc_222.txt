<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elara's yearning to "embrace the unknown" drives her pivot from mercenary thief to guardian—visible when she shatters the obsidian and reseats the queen. The apprentice’s one-line divine is sufficient pressure. Some interiority drifts toward explanatory epiphany ("To embrace the unknown was not to steal it...") and could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Situational lens: wrong-sky closes to right-sky, a Charged Poise that reconfigures Elara from thief to apprentice. The causality of the chess swap vs non-swap is crystal; cost registers in forfeited fortune and the apprentice’s final phrase. Orientation anchors by line 20; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Seamless ice dome, violet-gold sky, and stone chessboard are woven through motion and choice; altitude is felt in "breath pluming" and "silent ice." These elements constrain access and tempo. Complements but does not fully constrain the final tactical choice; still, atmosphere charges the closing image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserve wonder vs sell it—clarifies early and tightens when apprentice recasts the job’s morality. The single decisive refusal (shattering shard, resetting queen) forecloses Elara’s mercenary path with visible cost: lost pay and unforeseen apprenticeship. Pressure remains coherent; no extraneous reversals.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme—“embracing the unknown is protecting it”—arises from Elara’s pivot, apprentice’s stakes reframing, and circlet of time locked back in place. Subtext in apprentice’s line about “keeping time interesting.” Minor echo of stated desire in closing prose keeps score below 9.0.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Third-limited stays tight to Elara; sensory idiosyncrasy—“pluming breath,” “chime of falling icicles”—reflects her discerning pressure by elegance vs harsh. Cadenced syntax climbs and releases with action. No leakage, brisk compression, stable stance.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is propulsive and specific, each detail dual-use. One moment of ornamental density (“deliberately playful concentration” followed by “divine ritual and delightful joke”) trips redundancy, but no artifact touches the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Risky synthesis of fable, clockpunk, and heist yields fresh narrative logic. Theft-reversal into compact mentor entrustment feels inevitable yet surprising. Specifics prevent tropes from ossifying: apprentice’s invitation “to keep time interesting” crystallizes wonder.</comment>
