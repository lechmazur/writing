<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s quiet, stubborn ember of motivation is embodied in her offhandedly exact stone-work and the tremor when she places the nut; the contradictory pull between guiding others and freeing herself crystallizes in the final beat. Interiority is specific and sensory, never diagnostic. The cost—loss of her lifelong purpose and identity as caretaker—is felt in the hush that follows the click.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: every beat follows “because/therefore” logic from the traveler’s cry to the nut’s discovery to the shutdown hum. Closure is a decisive change with unmistakable cost—the orchard’s silence strips Elara of her role. No orientation drift; anchors are clear within 120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The orchard’s rotting-apple air, bronze-winged glare, and frost-laced window are filtered through Elara’s wary priorities; the blackened stump node physically constrains the final choice. Sensory selection tightens under pressure, and the mechanical birds’ stilling recharges the setting’s menace into relief.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—free herself and the orchard—tightens once when the nut’s blueprint is decoded, forcing a single irreversible act. Escalation is causal: each discovery narrows options until the final click forecloses both curse and identity. Cost is legible in the global hush.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of reluctant guardianship and self-liberation emerges through concrete action; the orchard’s shift from malice to neutral beauty reweights the premise without moralizing. Final image of “stark, clean cold” offers resonant reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is spare, weathered, and consistent with a solitary caretaker’s perceptual bias; rhythmic control tightens in the climax (“It clicked… the world”). No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and propulsive; every sentence advances stakes or atmosphere. No loops, mixed metaphors, or scaffold. Sensory nouns and strong verbs carry load without clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The cursed orchard, whispering fruit, and mechanical birds feel freshly synthesized; the fossilized nut as literal shut-off valve is an unexpected yet inevitable turn. Specificity grounds the fantastical in tactile consequence.</comment>
