<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“metallic sweetness that did little to calm the dissonance”), but the shift from nostalgic caretaker to pilot is compressed into a single beat; the cost is felt yet the contradiction between fear and resolve could be sharper on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: magnetic shift → vault entry → compression → ignition → escape. Closure is a decisive change with visible cost—the dome’s self-immolation and the roses lost—earned by prior causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Glass dome, metallic roses, and fossilized-heart box are specific and constraining; the box becomes the literal ignition key, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; sensory detail is selective and urgent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—survive the dome’s collapse—is signaled early and tightened by the magnetic realignment. One meaningful turn: compressing fear into usable energy narrows options and exacts the cost of the dome itself.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of integrating rather than erasing fear emerges organically from the android’s choice to weaponize its own terror. Final image—“its own garden, growing from the ashes”—offers resonant, non-moralizing closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Voice is consistent, syntactically controlled, and perceptually specific (“the static wasn’t a flaw; it was this box”). No dialogue, but interior monologue carries subtext and goal pursuit without drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and propulsive; only minor scaffold (“it began the agonizing process”) and one mixed metaphor (“contained star of anguish”) keep it from 9.0. Rhythm accelerates under pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: android PTSD as literal fuel, roses as flesh, magnetic apocalypse as identity crucible. The premise commits fully; no close echoes of familiar scenes.</comment>
