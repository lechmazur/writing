<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—terror vs. the need to plant—are embodied in the freeze/anchor beat; the photograph’s re-weighting at the end shows earned endurance with visible cost. Interiority is specific, somatic, and avoids therapy-speak. Only the “quietly talented” label remains ornamental, never tested under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the photograph shifts from betrayal to evidence, anchoring her decision to keep planting. Causal chain (jet trigger → freeze → tactile anchor → reassembly) holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens; cost is the unending labor of tending grief. Orientation is immediate; no lens drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The wind-sculpted pines and cliffside arboretum are not backdrop; the gnarled pine’s bark becomes the literal anchor that reassembles reality. Salt scent and damp earth filter through trauma-narrowed senses. Setting constrains choice and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—justify continued tending after irreparable loss—tightens when the jet triggers freeze; the micro-choice to stay with the bark forecloses flight and confirms endurance. Cost is the perpetual, unglamorous labor of planting in darkness.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of “stubborn realism” emerges through action: the photograph’s re-weighting from mockery to evidence offers a non-moralizing answer. Subtext lives in gesture—the smoothing of the photo against her leg—rather than statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is restrained, coastal, slightly salt-etched; perceptual signature shows trauma’s narrowing of sound and touch. Rhythm modulates with panic’s staccato and the long release of stillness. No POV leakage or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is lean, sensory, and propulsive; figurative language is sparse and purposeful. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Sentence variety mirrors emotional compression and release.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The drone-strike-wedding survivor tending a darkened lighthouse garden is a fresh synthesis; the “pearl of stillness” trope is grounded in tactile bark rather than abstraction. Risk lies in the quiet refusal of redemption, paid off in the final image.</comment>
