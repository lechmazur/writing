<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas’s face-blindness and sky-mirroring obsession are dramatized through tactile searching, coin-fit, and final renunciation; the contradiction between infinite desire and mortal craft is embodied in the lens failure. Interiority stays concrete, embodied, and character-specific. The earned stasis—watching the sky vanish—costs him the building and the dream simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single-scene causality under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each beat (search, coin click, lens crafting, projection, fade) layers density until the final image reweights the premise. Closure is a Charged Poise: the sky’s disappearance crystallizes the limit of craft with undeniable cost. No orientation drift; the lens holds to the last line.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The hollowed oak library is not backdrop but tool: its oculus, grain, and imminent demolition constrain every move. Micro-setting (trunk grooves, dust motes) and macro-setting (condemned building) converge to charge the final image. Sensory hierarchy is POV-filtered and urgent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—capture the uncapturable sky—tightens as dawn nears and the lens frays. One decisive intensification: projection succeeds, then fails, forcing renunciation. Cost is visible in the groaning building and the vanished image. Agency remains with Silas throughout.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of limits emerges organically from the failure of perfect mirroring; no moralizing. The final image reweights the premise without a thesis statement. Subtext operates in the silence, the flicker, and the upturned face at dawn.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Distinct perceptual signature: fractal precision, synesthetic attention to wood grain and light. Syntax and rhythm modulate with pressure—short, urgent clauses during lens crafting, longer breaths during the fade. No head-hopping; POV stays locked and consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances image, tension, or character. Figurative language is sparse, precise, and earned. Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; no mixed metaphors or register drift. High information density without clutter.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: face-blind portraitist seeks sky-mirror in condemned tree-library. Tropes (secret journal, magic lens) are transformed through tactile specificity and inevitable failure. The final reconfiguration—sky uncapturable—feels inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
