<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Oracle’s obsession is embodied in tactile micro-choices—tracing pages, hovering brush, final clutch—yet interior contradiction is muted; no competing impulse tests her resolve, so renunciation feels inevitable rather than wrested. Motivation is clear and consistent, but the absence of a genuine internal struggle caps the score just below the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each distilled silence adds density until the final stroke crystallizes the map as Charged Poise. Closure lands with unmistakable cost—the dawn irrevocably erases the night she has captured—earning the 9-band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Storm-tossed ridge fort, flaking booklet, and solitary star are rendered with selective sensory precision; the booklet’s glow absorbing starlight directly charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate. Minor reserve: environment constrains mood more than tactical choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve the last silence—is signaled early and escalates through denser notations until the bird’s chirp forecloses all further mapping. Cost is felt in the Oracle’s burnt arm and stinging eyes, but the pressure is atmospheric rather than a decisive narrowing of options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>Theme of infinite silence mapped by finite gesture emerges organically from the Oracle’s method; the final image of the fading star reweights every prior mark into a vessel of infinity. No moralizing—only resonant implication.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet disciplined, with rhythmic compression that mirrors the act of summarizing silence. Perceptual signature is distinct—sandstone fingers, viscous hush—and holds under pressure without head-hop or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is taut, vivid, and loop-free; figurative language is sparse and purposeful. Each sentence advances atmosphere or action; no scaffold or mixed metaphors mar the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise of cartographing silence is fresh and fully committed; the transformation of absence into artifact feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
