<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kaelen’s interiority is vivid—shadows recoiling, “still pool” mind—yet the shift from passive observer to active agent is slightly under-cooked; the empathy motive is stated more than embodied in micro-choices. The final renunciation of protocol carries cost, but the emotional toll feels generalized rather than specific to her flaw.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds cleanly: shard fall → orchard descent → mirror diagnosis → valve fix. Closure is a decisive change with felt cost—Kaelen’s exile from the garrison’s certainty—delivered in the quiet image of the now-dark fragment. One transition (orchard to city) is economical and anchored.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The lighthouse orchard, frost-bitten apples, and groaning ice are selective and atmospheric; the vintage store’s claustrophobic mirrors constrain movement and perception. The shard’s light bleeding into glass is a micro-setting that charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prevent city-wide zero-K catastrophe—is signaled early and tightened through each mirror glimpse. Escalation is causal: each reflection narrows the diagnosis to the valve. Cost is visible in Kaelen’s breach of duty and the shard’s final inertness.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of empathy-as-intervention emerges organically from the shard’s diagnostic function and Kaelen’s refusal to neutralize it. The final image—the dark fragment resting in her palm—reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext in the mirrors’ fractured futures is potent.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is distinct: lyrical compression (“weighted breath before reply”) and tactile specificity (“dust and ghosts of lavender sachets”) remain consistent. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens under pressure. Syntax modulates with urgency without losing clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and propulsive; each sentence advances knowledge or atmosphere. Occasional elevated diction (“absolute zero,” “conceptual repricing”) is earned by context. No loops or scaffold; metaphors are coherent. Final paragraph achieves charged poise without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The shard-as-diagnostic rather than prophetic device is a fresh inversion of the crystal-ball trope. The lighthouse orchard above shifting ice is a singular, memorable locale. Risk-taking in structure—quiet, diagnostic quest instead of battle—pays off in thematic resonance.</comment>
