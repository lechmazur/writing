<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The Mapkeeper’s interiority is textured—her “ripple-marked” skin and “hammered repose” embody her lifelong vocation and present anxiety. Motivation (“find the quiet in the storm”) is dramatized through tactile micro-choices: tracing walls, kneeling, whispering pure tone. The climactic realization that “they had not come to bring noise, but to be harmonized” is earned by prior struggle and carries visible cost—the old maps are obsolete. Minor slip: the final shift from mapkeeper to “keeper of equilibrium” is slightly abstract, not fully embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the bloom of hush permanently reconfigures the cave’s sonic ecology and the Mapkeeper’s identity. Causal chain is tight—each beat (silent stone → whispering into ice → resonance → bloom) advances goal and narrows options. Orientation is immediate; spatial anchors (“kneeling above the still pool”) are clear. Cost is palpable: the echo chamber stone’s glow is now “steady, quiet,” and her former calling is foreclosed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The harmonic caves are not backdrop but instrument: their “soft, resonant songs” become the stake, their silence the antagonist. Micro-setting (ice patterns, still pool) constrains her method and charges the final image. Sensory specificity is selective—cold solidity, static hum in teeth, silver constellation of cracks—always filtered through her trained perception. The energy beings’ shift from invasive hum to “respectful bass note” shows causal environmental evolution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“restore the caves’ song”—is signaled early and tightened through each beat. Escalation is accumulative/textural: the hum grows heavier, the stone darker, until the single crystalline note slices it away. Agency is continuous; her whispered tone is the active lever. The visible price is the irreversible shift from mapkeeper to keeper of equilibrium, felt on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: silence not as absence but as active harmony, storm and quiet as co-dependent. The bloom of hush reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture—the stone’s dark muteness mirrors her own fear. Final image (“the caves sighed, a contented, harmonic sigh”) offers non-literal resonance that reconfigures prior material.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded in the Mapkeeper’s sensory expertise: “skin etched with ripple-marks from a lifetime of reading stone.” Syntax modulates with pressure—long, flowing sentences under calm, then clipped fragments during the bloom. No dialogue; interior monologue remains character-bound. Diction stays within her artisanal lexicon; no register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; every line advances atmosphere or stakes. Metaphors (“flower of pure stillness petals unfurling”) are precise and paid off. No loops or scaffold; sentence rhythm mirrors sonic tension. Opening anchors voice and stakes; final line crystallizes the new equilibrium.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of sound ecology, memory, and identity feels fresh. The bloom of hush as living silence is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Tropes (ancient guardian, magic stone) are transformed through sensory specificity and causal logic. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
