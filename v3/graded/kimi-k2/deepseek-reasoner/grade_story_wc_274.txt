<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—frozen discipline versus burning need—embodies an archivist who chooses treason. The moment she bypasses the comms terminal to plant the digital ghost crystallizes her decisive arc. Embodied emotion (heartbeat hammering, thermal gloves grazing the letter) turns abstract stakes into visceral price.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal linkage is airtight: because she obeys duty the lie survives; therefore she awakens dormant networks to unscar the past. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the quiet chime across the city reweights meaning without a single riot, proving pressure landed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Micro-setting mastery: each breath plumes like visible stakes; the warmer envelope against a crystalline case is tactile, specific, and story-altering. The echoing library’s frost keeps intimacy high while foreclosing escape, charging the final stillness. No ornamental snow, only physical threat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (freeze vs thaw) tightens through beats: frozen past blocks voice; letter cracks the dam; dormant network weaponizes silence. Cost is legible—career, safety, the archive’s sealed sleep—each escalation forced by Elara’s agency under causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Contraband truths reframed as quiet doubt: the final image of a thousand roomfuls of pale faces reweights the premise without sloganeering. Theme emerges from concrete spillover of action rather than moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature—“dizzying quiet” as thick with echo—remains coherent amid pressure. Voice modulates from clinical cataloguing to breath’s plume; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Every line advances story through crystalline imagery (“frozen knowledge preserved in perpetual frost”); rhythms accelerate during upload beats, then drop to hush. Zero loops, filter-verb stacks, or purple overload.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Quiet, devastating earthquake seeded through severed data conduits is specific and non-obvious; lifts taut political thriller via archivist treason. Fresh angle rescues “leak” trope from cliché.</comment>
