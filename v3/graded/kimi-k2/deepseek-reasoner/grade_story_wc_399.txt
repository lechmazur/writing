<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—her need to capture wisdom versus the cost of binding it forever—governs every micro-move; her kneeling decision is earned by earlier peripheral sensing of the light pattern. The scout’s uncensored presence is a living mirror that refines the resonance, so the moment Elara “wove his innocent perception” the relationship becomes the crucible she needs. Cost is visible when the light dissolves into stone and her spirit is left “weary,” renouncing further contact. Only a touch of label-speak—“sacred charge”—keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: because each sensory grain, each shimmer, each word of chant adds density until the resonance is fixed in stone. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara’s earned stance leaves the echo embedded for centuries, the cost legible in her exhausted nod and desert hush. Orientation is taught early by the whisperfield calm and sustained spatial anchors. Nothing breaks causality; every beat is consequential under the lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The pavilion’s psychic pressure, the blistering sand, the grinding parapet bones all constrain Elara’s steps and tactics. Each setting element is tactile, hot, and weighted; the conjured clearing is a second micro-setting that materially changes what can or cannot enter. The desert hush replaces the final image, underscoring the isolation the prophet’s echo carries.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—to capture the vanishing wisdom—is signaled in paragraph one and tightened when Elara’s knees scorch against unforgiving sand. The scout’s intrusion intensifies the signal, forcing her to risk external contamination of the resonance. One clear escalation: the moment she binds the echo irrevocably into stone, the choice narrows possibilities for both woman and relic forever. Cost is visceral: “her body weary but her spirit light.”</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</comment>
<comment>Theme emerges from the tacit question of reverence versus possession, with no moral slogan stated. The echo’s capture reframes earlier “whisperfield calm” into a centuries-long vigil now locked in stone. Subtext operates in the scout’s naked honesty and Elara’s refusal to explain herself further. Final hush invites reflection without platitude.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Compression and patterned lyricism—“whisperfield calm, peripheral awareness”—taught early and paid off by closure. Distinct perceptual signature: Elara’s one visible eye guides every sensory narrowing. No head-hopping; no filter-verb stacks. Tense, diction, and rhythm remain stable and purpose-driven.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>High-density, variegated syntax that breathes in step with ritual. No synonym loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Lines do more than one job: “The light on the sand dissolved, absorbed into the earth” compresses action and closure image without drift. Compression occasionally flirts with overwriting—the phrase “ghost of thought before it vanishes”—but the excess is one hairline, already neutralized.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: line walking plus half-mask as sensory prosthesis, a conjured clearing as anti-bubble, using a skeptic’s untutored clarity as tuning fork. No stock desert mysticism; every concept is tied to Elara’s unique perceptual toolkit. Transformation test passes; swap names and the arc collapses. The gamble of binding immaterial truth in inert stone feels earned and inevitable.</comment>
