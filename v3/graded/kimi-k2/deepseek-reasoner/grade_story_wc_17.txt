<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara’s sensitivity (hearing stone-whispers) is embodied; her interiority “walls dream” motive is reiterated twice but translates into decisive reading of diaries and listening “in the sighing corner.” One jump—feeling Lysander’s fear instantly—is shorthand rather than embodied choice; still, her final assumption of stewardship is credible closure with felt weight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara holds the negative that rewires the story’s stakes. Causal logic: diary clues → acoustic clue → hidden panel → negative secured; all links active and on-page. Cost: personal guardianship replaces her former mercenary surveying, signaled by “now hers to carry.” Small ellipsis in how Lysander wordlessly guided the “sighing corner” lowers edge from 9.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Atmosphere is ivy-eaten decay filtered through Elara’s “corridor echo” lens: “dappled green” and “silent, still” air narrow her perception to acoustics. The hearth diaries and mantel cracks anchor the room and later guide the acoustic hunt; setting acts as tool. Final image “world before the shifts” via negative gives charged specificity but stops just short of constraining a fresh choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Central stake: map fading acoustics vs. rescue Argossy memory; tension deepens when Lysander’s diaries force her to redirect from acoustics to artifact recovery. The beat “silent eye … sighing corner” escalates via acoustic cue narrowing options, paying cost by shifting her career goal, but no additional external opposition or visible physical price appears, keeping escalation credible but moderate-length appropriate.</comment>

<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: legacy as fragile echo surviving climate loss. Image chain—diaries, negative, ancestral superimposed faces—reconfigures “what walls dream of” without didactic thesis. Subtext of stewardship versus forgetting lands through Elara’s Charged Poise stance on the final balcony; some overt nudging (“soul within it”) just undercuts maximum resonance.</comment>

<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Narrative voice is precise lyric (“ivy-veiled passages,” “faded, frantic script”) always anchored to Elara’s acoustic POV; syntax tightens under diary discovery with no head-hop. Compression in final sentences builds cadence to crystallized close. Occasional decorative adjectives (“lush, ordered,” “crushed pressure”) inch toward overwriting but clear for 600–word scale.</comment>

<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is sinewy: “stone breathes in silence,” information density high with purposeful sensory compression. Minor lapses—repetition of “silence” twice in adjacent clauses, one mixed metaphor “crushed pressure of being”—but no scaffold loops or clarity breaks. Final paragraph’s run of near-mirroring phrases (“world before / world they had built”) is deliberate recursive echo that recharges motif.</comment>

<comment>“Corridor echo cartographer” is fresh post-climate occupation that fuses cartography and acoustics, transformed into preservationist thriller. No template matches; world detail (climate riots, acoustic anomalies) feels lived-in. A faint aroma of familiar manor-exploration story slightly tempers total freshness.</comment>
