<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (skeptic vs. ghost-shift confrontation) manifests bodily in trembling hand and burning muscles; motives pivot mid-scene from abstract curiosity to concrete absolution, visible in Leo’s strained grunt against the valve. The cost—accepting the “immense, quiet burden”—is palpable and earned by the prior test against the valve’s fused resistance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: because of persistent radio static + sealed truth → density of echoing guilt increases → narrowing of choices to force the release of steam as literal exhale. Closure lands as Earned Stasis absolution with concrete cost—the wheel finally spins free and the hiss dies, leaving Leo slumped under newly real weight.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Cold tunnel gravel, rust-breathing boiler, and brass necklace on the valve are not backdrop but tools; the valve literally stops Leo’s progress and must be manhandled. Final exhalation of superheated yet cool steam re-charges the atmospheric “hush” from the opening beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“weight of swallowed truth”—escalates from ambient guilt to physical immobility of the valve; the single beat of wrenching the corroded wheel raises and releases embodied pressure. No coincidence, no outside saviors; the fight itself is the tightening.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme arises wordless: industrial negligence, personal culpability, and the moral necessity of bearing witness achieve resonance via sensory ghosts and the final literal venting of secrecy. No moralizing lines—only the metallic sigh of decades—leave reader with after-echo.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Narrative texture stays in filtered skepticism—radio static, corroded brass, sweat, breath—until perceptual shift under ghost-shift pressure. Sensory compression tightens under climax (“clanging roar vibrated in teeth”), then releases in clean, quiet aftermath.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Varied sentence arcs mirror pulse: opening clause-long inhale, mid-scene sentence fragments under labor, punch-paragraph climax around the valve. Precision of “beaded glass beads” vs. “colossal sigh” keeps diction active; zero looped phrases or register drift.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Familiar tropes—abandoned mill, ghost shift, survivor’s guilt are made specific through tactile valve ritual and radio-archival method, turning urban-explore cliché into moral stenography. The valve-wheel as absolution latch is fresh enough to survive hindsight.</comment>
