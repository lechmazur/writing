<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—protective love vs. tactical calculation—are dramatized in the frantic tuning scene; the final choice to become “part of the song” is earned by prior embodied struggle and carries visible cost (loss of autonomy). Interiority is specific and sensorily grounded; no stock phrasing. Minor slip: “logically emotional” is asserted rather than fully embodied in micro-choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each beat (ship’s approach → key insertion → frequency matching → sonic absolution) tightens options under pressure. Closure is a decisive change with felt cost—Elara’s self-subsumption into the lighthouse’s song—rendered on-page. No orientation debt; anchors clear by 120 words. One micro-turn (silence before the final note) is allowed and functional.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Drift-ice marina is vivid, selective, and causally active: grinding floes dictate urgency, frost-rimed pylons ground spatial choreography. The lighthouse lens and key function as micro-setting objects that constrain tuning choices. Final golden light recharges opening sunset, crystallizing transience. No static cataloging; every detail either pressures or mirrors Elara’s arc.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—protect the Heart—signaled early and escalated by the ship’s invasive C-sharp. One meaningful tightening: the artifact’s A-minor wavers, forcing Elara to adapt via sonic absolution. Cost is legible: her identity dissolves into the lighthouse’s perpetual song. Agency drives every beat; coincidence complicates but does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of adaptive love versus extractive force emerges organically through sonic metaphor; no explicit moralizing. Final image reweights the premise: protection achieved not by domination but by harmonic surrender. Subtext in the artifact’s “distress” and Elara’s breathless chest-heave carries the emotional aftereffect. Minor thematic echo in “logical outcome born from deep love” could be trimmed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, tactile, and pressure-responsive: “fleshly ethereal” diction modulates from mournful groans to crystalline absolution. Syntax tightens under stress—short clauses during tuning, then the single immense note. No POV leakage; perception stays anchored to Elara’s sensorium. Dialogue absent, so no voice convergence issues.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is lean and propulsive; every sentence advances stakes or atmosphere. Figurative language is sparse, precise (“mournful symphony,” “brutal C-sharp”). No loops, scaffold, or register drift. High information density: “She adjusted the rings, her movements precise…” does triple duty—action, interiority, sensory anchor. Final line lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: sacred artifact as resonant ice-shield tuned by inherited key and engineer’s ear. Tropes (lighthouse, corporation) are transformed through sonic specificity and self-sacrificial closure. Risk-taking in the “sonic absolution” concept pays off without gimmickry; the premise would collapse if any element were swapped. Feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
