<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elian’s brittle devotion is embodied in micro-choices—temperature tweaks, drip pacing—each a visible wager against doubt. The shift from naive certainty to “quiet, certain knowledge” is earned drop by drop, with the final toll of the bell as cost. Interiority stays concrete, never lapsing into label-speak. Only the absence of a second on-page character keeps it from the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the bell’s single question re-opens the world’s song, cost paid in Elian’s spent focus and altered stance. Causal linkage holds—each drip adjustment tightens options until the final strike. No orientation drift; who/where/when are anchored by the second paragraph. Lens is cleanly Causal throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The sapphire viaduct and motionless sea are not backdrop but instrument: rails conduct temperature, dew becomes solder. Micro-setting (the bell’s cracks, the drip paths) constrains every tactic and charges the final image. Sensory selection narrows to sound and temperature under pressure. One hairline slip—no olfactory note despite marine stagnation—keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore cosmic balance—is signaled in paragraph one and tightened through each calibrated drip. Escalation is causal: slower east, faster west, soldered fractures, culminating in the abyssal answer. Cost is visible exhaustion and the irreversible shift from “earnest naivety” to tempered knowledge. No extraneous reversals; one clear arc suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: restoration through attentive humility rather than force. The final image—the bell’s pure question meeting the abyssal hum—reweights every prior failure into a resonant, non-moral answer. No thematic statement intrudes; meaning is carried by sound and silence. Complexity lingers: balance is “not fixed, but righting itself.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elian’s perceptual filter; syntax tightens under stress (“plink-plonk”). No dialogue, so voice is carried by rhythmic, purposeful description. Occasional lyric elevation (“liquid tone, solidified song”) is earned by context. One minor filter-verb cluster mid-scene prevents 9.0.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet musical; each sentence advances image or tactic. No loops, no mixed metaphors. Rhythm accelerates with drip cadence, then breathes at the final toll. A single redundant “then” sequence costs 0.1.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Familiar quest frame is inverted: the mage is underpowered, the repair is artisanal condensation, the victory is a question, not a shout. Transformation test passes—swap any element and the story collapses. Risky choice to hinge climax on silence answering sound pays off with conceptual reweighting.</comment>
