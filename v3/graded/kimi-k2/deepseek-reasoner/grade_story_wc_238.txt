<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s apology motive is clear and embodied; her shame and Leo’s grief are palpable. The micro-choice to use her exorcist skill as reparative act is credible. Yet Leo’s interiority is only implied, limiting relationship crucible depth.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the glowing chord and lingering apple scent crystallize a before/after in their relationship. Causal chain—apology → induced current → sensory miracle—holds. Cost is felt in Elara’s trembling effort and Leo’s tears.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Archive, orchard, and perfume bottle are vividly etched and constrain choices: the archive’s silence demands the sonic miracle; the orchard’s imminent loss charges the scent. Spatial choreography is clean.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—repairing a decade-old rift—tightens when simple apology fails and Elara risks her method. Escalation is one deepening, not multiple reversals, but the cost is legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of imperfect restoration emerges through concrete action; no moralizing. The final metaphor (“shelves waiting for the right book”) reweights the premise with quiet resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is textured, sensory, and consistent. Elara’s perceptual signature—cataloguing emotional currents like a technician—remains distinct. Dialogue is spare but subtext-laden.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense. No loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated diction (“phosphorescent light”) fits the heightened moment.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: gossip-column exorcist + sheet-music archive + olfactory miracle. Premise is specific enough to resist swap test. Risk is moderate but coherent.</comment>
