<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—her “shared burdens” felt in the scent of the telegram—and her micro-choice to speak into a dream is embodied and costly. The final beat shows earned stasis: she accepts perpetual solitude as the price of saving the city. Secondary pressure from Alaric is brief but sharp, forcing the star-map revelation. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in scene, keeping it just below the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: telegram → star chart → dream-message → evacuation. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration—the dreams shift from fear to curiosity—paid for by Elara’s unending vigil. One transition (dream-lens to celestial wing) is clean. Cost is legible in her last look at the “waking city” that will never know her.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The brass-and-oak observatory and the “cold stone” underfoot anchor every move; the telescope’s brass fittings constrain Alaric’s gnarled fingers, charging the final image. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—floral telegram against cold metal. Micro-setting (pressed flower) reappears in the second telegram, reweighted from dread to relief.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decode the dream inscriptions to avert cataclysm—is signaled in paragraph one and tightened when the star’s pulse becomes a countdown. Agency: Elara’s decision to risk dream-contact narrows her future to eternal service. Cost is visible in the changed collective dreams and her isolation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Theme of shared memory and communal responsibility emerges through the shift from “silent, shared anxiety” to “shared history.” Subtext in the final telegram’s “The burden is shared no longer” reframes the entire dream archive. No moralizing; resonance is carried by the altered city’s sleep.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise—“subconscious cartographies,” “witching hour when the world was soft”—and stays within Elara’s scholarly lexicon. Compression is purposeful: “She spoke until she felt the dreamer’s restlessness settle.” No head-hopping; Alaric’s dialogue is distinct in cadence and diction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and dense: “the great telescope aimed not at the sky, but at the dreaming minds of the city below.” No loops or mixed metaphors. Sensory specificity (“smelling of old books and cold metal”) advances atmosphere without stall.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The inversion of telescope-as-dream-scanner and temples-as-astronomical-events is fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Dream-healing as civic duty synthesizes fantasy and hard science without gimmickry. Specificity of the daylily telegram and variable-star cipher anchors the concept.</comment>
