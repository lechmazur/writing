<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority is embodied and specific (“glass cage where the great, dead eye…watched me”), but the final renunciation—speaking truth into the lattice—relies on a sudden, abstract epiphany rather than a visible cost paid on the page. The contradiction between inherited guilt and self-authored truth is dramatized, yet the moment of containment feels slightly under-motivated because the lattice’s rules are revealed only at climax.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the protagonist’s truthful story starves the lie-echo, reconfiguring his stance from passive bearer of guilt to active narrator. Causal linkage holds—storm → door ajar → discovery → containment—though the lattice’s function is introduced late. Cost is felt in the final image: he waits to explain two corpses, freedom now shadowed by consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Environment is vivid and selective: “glass cage,” “coppery glow,” “jagged reef.” The lighthouse itself constrains movement and frames the final choice; the lattice becomes micro-setting that channels the climax. Spatial choreography is clean; only the coppery hue edges toward overused gothic palette.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—replace inherited lies with personal truth—tightens when the storm breaks routine and the echo appears. Escalation is causal: each beat narrows options until the protagonist must speak or release the entity. The cost of truth-telling is the impending discovery of bodies, a felt price that charges the ending.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of inherited versus self-authored narrative emerges organically; the lattice reframes confession from religious ritual to containment device. Subtext operates in silence and withheld names. Final image—holding the lattice, awaiting the boat—offers resonant ambiguity without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is textured, lyrical, and consistent: “dusty indifference,” “copperlight repose.” Syntax mirrors the protagonist’s heightened solitude; no POV drift. Compression and elision are purposeful and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; metaphors are precise and rarely over-stacked. Occasional elevated diction (“malevolent distortion”) risks register drift but stays within the narrator’s introspective lexicon. No loops or scaffold; rhythm accelerates under pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Familiar gothic tropes—lighthouse, storm, confessional—are reconfigured through the lie-echo and truth-lattice, yielding a fresh angle on inherited guilt. Specificity of the reef and the lattice’s re-purposing elevate the premise beyond template.</comment>
