<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s meekness and quiet determination are embodied in her deliberate forging of rescue gear and her refusal to surrender her mind to the lichen; the final choice to sacrifice the silk effigy instead of herself crystallizes her interior contradiction and costs her the relic, earning the change.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The causal chain—maps → descent → breadcrumb camps → cavern discovery → silk-for-consciousness swap—tightens options until the decisive, on-page act frees Kael and destroys the silk; the felt cost (loss of the irreplaceable silk) seals closure under a causal lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The orchard planet’s dying soil and floating rock arches frame the stakes early; the mine’s crystalline dome and fissure of sky become micro-settings that constrain tactics and charge the final image of “blue defiance,” satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—rescue Kael without surrendering her mind—escalates through each breadcrumb and tightens when the lichen’s bargain is revealed; the protagonist’s agency drives the final exchange, with the silk’s loss as visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Resilience-from-rubble emerges organically from Elara’s craft and the planet’s decay; the ending’s image of “a narrow ribbon of blue defiance” reweights the premise without moralizing, offering resonant ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The prose carries a blacksmith’s tactile precision—“forge and her voice for the necessary pleasantries”—and modulates rhythm under pressure; no head-hopping, and the final image’s lyric compression is earned.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences are lean, vivid, and propulsive; no loops or scaffold, and the crystalline cavern description is selective and purposeful, though one or two modifiers flirt with excess without muddling closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The orchard planet, lichen stasis, and silk-for-consciousness swap synthesize into a fresh, inevitable myth; the quiet refusal to trade minds feels both surprising and foreshadowed, transforming familiar rescue tropes.</comment>
