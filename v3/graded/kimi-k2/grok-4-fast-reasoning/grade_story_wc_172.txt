<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elias’s contradictory impulses—empire-builder vs. bird-haunted boy—coexist in every beat; the egg warms in his gloved hand while he calculates exposure, and the final crack is earned by that dual track. Interiority stays concrete, never diagnostic. The cost is legible: he walks away with his alibi intact but his self-justification dissolved, a visible price scaled to the word count.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the yolk soaking into salt reweights every prior extractive act with undeniable conceptual cost. Causal lens holds throughout—because he engineered the drought, the cracks became a legible map; therefore the egg’s release crystallizes his irreversible loss of alibi-proof innocence. Persistent constraint: the approaching storm will erase forensic evidence but not the internal fracture he now carries.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The salt flat’s cracked polygons, ozone scent, and yielding crust are filtered through Elias’s engineer-eye and boyhood memory; every sensory note guides his footsteps along the map he alone can read. The dried basin acts as micro-setting that physically receives the egg and conceptually receives his guilt. Weather tightens the clock—rain will erase tracks—so environment directly shapes the timing of the final act.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving the echo of what he annihilated—tightens when the map of cracks forces a single actionable spot; releasing the egg forecloses the option to sell or display it, a visible price. Escalation is causal: each aerial survey converts to on-foot risk as storm clouds gather. No coincidences; pressure is coherent and protagonist-driven.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the irony that the drought designed to expose minerals instead exposes the protagonist to his own eradicated past. The egg’s iridescence and the salt’s white desolation reconfigure into a guilt circuit without moralizing. Final image—yolk disappearing into the flat—offers resonant, non-literal answer: extraction leaves only absence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited remains locked to Elias’s perceptual signature—corporate calculus fused with boyhood bird-storm memories. Diction shifts cleanly between boardroom steel (“alibi’s web”) and lyrical recall (“living storms”). No head-hopping; psychic distance compresses under pressure as sentences shorten against the approaching rain.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “ground a cracked mosaic of white desolation under a sky bruised” does double descriptive work. Metaphors stay consistent—salt as bone, cracks as wings—no mixed vehicles. One scaffold spot: “He had studied it for weeks…” could compress, but it occurs early and does not touch the closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: eco-villain uses his own engineered drought as cartography to re-bury extinction guilt. Passenger-pigeon egg smuggled for prestige becomes reverse-trophy—no resurrection, only sonic echo. Risk-taking (no dialogue, lyric escalation) heightens stakes without obscuring causality.</comment>
