<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s claustrophobia and prudence are embodied in every micro-choice—her tremor, the steady fingers on the map, the refusal to lunge blindly—yet the interiority occasionally drifts into abstract “wistful rebellion” shorthand rather than concrete sensation, keeping it just shy of the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The causal chain is tight: claustrophobia → measured descent → compass-guided divination → organ resonance → seam opens → Keystone claimed. Closure lands as a Decisive Change with felt cost (claustrophobia faced, spatial order reasserted) under a Causal lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stone, shadow, starlight, and organ tones are filtered through Elara’s panic and wonder; the nexus itself becomes a character that resists and yields. One hairline slip: “starlit dust” edges toward poetic convenience rather than tactile specificity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—retrieve the Keystone or remain trapped by space itself—tightens once when the organ’s reverberation forces a single, irreversible choice. Cost is visible: the nexus’s embrace nearly crushes her before the seam parts.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of spatial rebellion against imposed geometries emerges through action and image rather than statement; the final image of Elara “ready to redraw the world’s boundaries” reweights the premise without moralizing. A faint echo of “wistful rebellion” in the last paragraph nicks the score.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elara’s sensorium; diction is textured, rhythmic, and panic-tinged. No dialogue, so voice is carried by perception and syntax alone—distinctive and consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; metaphors of veins, lovers, and vises serve pressure without clutter. Only a single mixed echo—“lover’s embrace turned vise”—momentarily muddles the physical logic.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The spatial-mutiny premise and architect’s compass-as-divining-rod feel fresh; familiar quest tropes are retooled through claustrophobic embodiment. The organ-as-map device is unexpected yet earned by earlier hints of “forgotten chapels.”</comment>
