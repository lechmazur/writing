<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Elara’s delayed-foresight gift and the enigma of “chosen paths” anchor every major choice; her final ascension into the storm ties motive to closure with visible existential cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The “because/therefore” spine is tight: seal → dream reading → transcendence. One scene window held; orientation anchored by ~100 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Vines, concrete, storm pressure, and the wafer’s shifting engravings all constrain tactics and charge the final moment; body/setting recursion is specific.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—why paths choose walkers—escalates through dream visions and compels the transcendence turn; cost felt in relinquishing certainty.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Theme of agency and balance emerges organically from character action; final image of Elara walking into the storm offers non-literal reweighting without didacticism.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Lyrical, precise diction; first-person interiority feels embodied; occasional poetic sentences compress time under dream logic, purpose-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>High density, varied rhythm, and zero loops; figurative language is selective and thematic—no muddle in the peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of delayed prophecy with ecological destiny; dream-mosaic structure adds risk without gimmickry.</comment>
