<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s obsession is embodied in tactile pacing and the flaking booklet; her contradictory impulses—yearning to map the void yet renouncing paper—are dramatized in the final silence. The cost is the star’s extinction, a felt forfeiture that crystallizes her stance. No stock phrasing; interiority is character-particular.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the lone star winks out, reweighting the premise—her map is now internal, the cost endless night. Causal linkage holds: because she chooses silence over inscription, the star’s light is spent. Orientation is anchored by the ridge fort within 120 words; no drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The storm-tossed fort and flaking booklet constrain her choice—too fragile to write, she must etch in mind. Weather and object states evolve with beats; the single star’s vanishing charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; no white-room syndrome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—map the endless night—tightens when inscription becomes impossible; the silence she wields is the decisive escalation. Agency is renunciation; cost is the star’s death. Pressure coheres under Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the tension between articulation and silence; the final image of internalized map versus vanished star offers non-literal resonance. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers. Subtext is carried in gesture and silence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; perceptual signature is Elara’s coastal-bred attention to pebble and flake. No head-hopping; tense and distance stable. Patterned elision—“summarizing silence”—is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and free of loops; figurative language is purposeful. No filter-verb stacks or mixed metaphors. Final third is clean, supporting the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: oracle who maps by silence, not speech; star as expendable ink. Risk-taking in form—retelling via silence—heightens stakes without gimmickry. Feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
