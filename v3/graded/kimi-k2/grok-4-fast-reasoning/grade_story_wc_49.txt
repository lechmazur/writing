<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elowen’s whimsical-mystic tinkerer trait stays consistent; her interiority is concrete (“fingers dancing like fireflies”) and links to embodied action. The micro-choice to pluck the tendril on the loom crystallizes her hierarchy of values, and the cost—exposure as the village oddity risking failure—is felt. Yet the absence of a second on-page character keeps status/relationship crucible dormant, capping the arc short of deeper contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: a Resonant Reconfiguration as the golden tapestry drapes the arbor and the villagers recommit to song, cost paid in Elowen’s公开 vulnerability. The Accumulative/Textural lens—pattern of song-threads building to cadence shift—holds without contradiction. Orientation is anchored by word 52; one causal leap (“the loom wasn’t just metal and vine; it was her soul’s extension”) is earned by prior setup, keeping linkage intact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The arbor’s dawn light, leaf-whispers, and loom/tendril micro-setting constrain choices—she must finish before the sun swallows the moon’s silver. Sensory triage narrows to touch and sound during the critical pluck, mirroring urgency. While locale stays generic (“the village”), the specific grove carvings and synchronized canopy sway charge the final image, passing the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore harvest rites or watch land wither—is signaled early. Pressure tightens when the celestial window shortens; the beat of elders joining song narrows failure risk and visible price (fields momentarily green). Cost is legible, though escalation is single-arc rather than layered reversal, keeping it just outside the 8.8 band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of cultural memory versus innovation emerges through the loom’s fusion of tech and vine, never sermonized. The final image of dawn-lit carvings rewakens ancestral gratitude without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: will next generations maintain the songs? The reweighting satisfies complexity, though the absence of counter-argument keeps it shy of 9.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-limited stays locked to Elowen’s perceptual filter; whimsical diction (“spark of mischief,” “curling like a question mark”) is consistent yet modulates to hushed reverence at the climax. No head-hopping; psych-distance clean. Rhythm mirrors loom-whir tempo under stress, demonstrating prose-as-character control that meets the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud cadence breathes with scene tempo; sentence openings vary, no template runs. Figurative strings stay purposeful—moon “waned without its due reverence” compresses stakes into one visceral clause. One paraphrase loop (“golden stories… golden threads”) costs −0.2; otherwise density is high without scaffold. Artifacts do not touch closure, allowing 8.7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Fusing eco-mysticism with Maker-culture feels fresh; the living-tendril loom is specific enough to resist swap-out. The sacred-song-as-code notion re-weights familiar harvest tropes. Risk is moderate—lyric accretive structure rather than twist—but execution coherence earns the upper band.</comment>
