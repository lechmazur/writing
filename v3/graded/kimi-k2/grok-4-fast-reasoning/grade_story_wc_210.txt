<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s refusal of escape and turn to memory-forged planning is credibly rooted in earlier cowardice, giving his interiority a sharp contradiction. The “rejects false comfort” trait shows up in two micro-choices—leaving the bottle untouched and stepping into the mist to stake garden plots—so the endurance carries cost. Emotional embodiment stays specific (salt-crusted windows, pocketed vial) rather than label-speak. Flaw is present but cost feels moderate, not gutting, capping the band just below 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elias forecloses the wish-granting path and crystallizes a communal blueprint under a charged dawn image. Causal chain holds: because the last wish failed, therefore he renounces the bottle; because memory still holds formulas, therefore revival is conceivable. One shimmer of lens ambiguity in the montage-like middle is quickly re-anchored. Cost is visible—solitude, years of stored knowledge spent—meeting the 9+ quick-test threshold, but the beat is summary-heavy, keeping it short of the top band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lanterns shift from nostalgic décor to bioluminescent hardware, a charged micro-setting that constrains the final vision. Fog, salt crust, and lantern sway are filtered through an alchemist’s sensory hierarchy, guiding his choice of algae and tide-powered wheels. Spatial choreography keeps the bottle, shop, and street in clean alignment across the single scene. Environment is not merely painted; it supplies the materials for the new civilization plan, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—rebuild versus abandon—signals in paragraph four and tightens when Elias pockets the vial, narrowing options to DIY biology. Pressure stays coherent under causal lens: each recalled failure (over-fishing, storm damage) raises the perceived difficulty, sharpening the final garden-staking moment. No coincidence resolves the conflict; the only “assist” is memory itself, earned earlier. Price is present but intellectual rather than visceral, keeping the score just below 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: sustainable knowledge over exploitative magic. The amber bottle’s demotion from active agent to dusty relic reweights the premise without authorial commentary. Subtext resides in the town silence that answers Elias’s call, implying the cost of recruitment still lies ahead. Final image of glowing life avoids moralizing yet reframes earlier lantern lore, giving resonance at a hairline below exceptional.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias with consistent perceptual signature—lantern light as “trapped sunlight,” fertilizers remembered from “desert nomads.” Syntax lengthens during memory collation, then compresses into imperative action (“He rose, pocketing…”), mirroring cognitive shift. No dialogue appears; prose carries the conversational load credibly. One filter-verb cluster (“he recalled… he remembered…”) slightly dulls immediacy midway, preventing 9-band entry.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Information density remains high: one sentence often performs scene, sensory filter, and world-rule (“Lanterns were relit, not with fire, but with glowing life…”). Rhythm modulates from reflective cadence to propulsive garden-staking close. A single mixed metaphor (“mental forge… ingredients in a potion”) is forgivable and early. Minor template stem repeats (“He recalled… He imagined…”) appear but do not touch the closure beat, keeping line-level craft firmly in the 8-band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of alchemy, ghost-town revival, and working-memory world-building feels particular rather than borrowed. Bioluminescent lanterns and tide-wheel workshops are fresh yet grounded in previously mentioned texts, escaping gimmickry. Risk is taken by making the climax an internal plan rather than external showdown; coherence holds. While “last alchemist revives town” is a known contour, the insistence on memory over magic gives a non-obvious inflection, meriting high-band placement.</comment>
