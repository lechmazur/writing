<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s curiosity is embodied and consistent; her micro-choice to press the seal under meteors crystallizes her arc. Thorne’s guarded warmth and “mysterious familiarity” create credible status tension. Both characters’ flaws—her naïve hunger for secrets, his protective secrecy—drive the final trust-gift. Relationship shift from wary neighbors to co-custodians of the building’s voice is legible and earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara receives the seal and hears the building’s “familiar lullaby,” reweighting all prior teas and lies. Causality holds under Accumulative/Textural lens—weekly teas accrete trust until the rooftop moment crystallizes meaning. One clean transition from study to rooftop; no orientation debt. Cost is the shared guardianship and the end of innocence about the building.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Victorian tenement, cluttered study, rooftop garden, and meteor shower are vividly selective; each space constrains choice (cramped study for intimacy, open roof for revelation). Sensory hierarchy favors scent of wax and ozone, grounding POV bias. Weather directly affects the climax—meteors provide the charged light for the sigil’s unveiling. Spatial choreography is coherent; no floating rooms.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Elara’s desire to learn the building’s true language—tightens when she must decide whether to confront Thorne. The rooftop interrogation forces a trade-off: risk the fragile trust or remain ignorant. Escalation is steady via weekly teas; no coincidence resolves anything. Cost is the acceptance of shared custodianship and the haunting knowledge that follows.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of “listening to the living past” emerges through concrete objects (seal, cornerstone) and embodied rituals (tea, wax). Subtext operates in Thorne’s silences and Elara’s growing recognition that the building’s grief is also theirs. Final image of the sigil pressed under meteors offers non-literal answer: language is covenant, not translation. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays close to Elara’s perceptions; no head-hopping. Voice is textured—“warped floors and shadowed corners whispering invitations”—yet avoids purple overload. Dialogue between Elara and Thorne carries distinct diction: her direct questions, his oblique, scholarly replies. Psychic distance tightens at climax, mirroring her sharpened attention.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers atmosphere or advances relationship. Occasional lyrical excess (“steam from Earl Grey mingled with the scent of aged books and wax”) is purposeful and patterned. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks. Metaphors are coherent—building as archive, seal as covenant. Final paragraph achieves charged poise without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh angle treats architecture as palimpsest of emotion rather than mere backdrop. Antique seal and cornerstone sigil are not generic occult props but keys to custodianship. Transformation of “borrowing sugar” into ritual of shared guardianship feels inevitable. Specificity of meteor shower as revelatory stage light avoids cliché. Risky quiet ending lands with earned resonance.</comment>
