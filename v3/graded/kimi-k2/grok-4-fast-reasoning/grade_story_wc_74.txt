<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elias’s insomnia and benevolent drive stay consistent; the brush-triggered visions dramatize his values. Yet interior contradiction is told (“his heart quickened”) rather than embodied in micro-choice, and no external character pressures him, so the arc is solitary and static. The final renunciation of sleeplessness feels foreshadowed but not costly because no live alternative is foreclosed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens: each glyph-dream layers proof of kindness remembered, culminating in the charged hush of the final image—an earned stasis. Orientation is clear by 120 words; single-scene frame holds. The causal chain is loose (moon → brush → vision → insight) but coherent under lyric pattern; cost is conceptual—he relinquishes vigilance—yet the city’s response is hearsay, softening the closure punch.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Smog, glass panes, and moonlight filter every beat; the greenhouse’s wilting ferns mirror Elias’s fatigue and revive with his hope, constraining mood. Sensory triage favors metallic taste and dim glow, suiting insomnia. Spatial choreography is clean; no geography drift. The moon-tipped brush functions as micro-setting that charges the final image, meeting 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove strangers remember kindness—threads all visions; pressure is textural (accumulating vignettes) rather than a narrowing vice. No external obstacle complicates the painting act; tension is solely elegiac. One deepening: he realizes the paintings are invocations. Visible cost is the surrender of sleepless vigilance, but it’s lightly dramatized, keeping escalation temperate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges via accreted mini-acts of compassion encoded in lost scripts; no overt thesis stated. Final whispered line reweights prior vignettes without moralizing. Ambiguity remains—did the woman below truly recall?—inviting reflection. Lost-language motif shifts from preservation to invocation, charging closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person hovers close to Elias’s fatigued sensorium: saffron quiet, waxing glow, “threads of unraveling canvas.” Syntax lengthens then contracts with brush-stroke rhythm, imitating breath. No dialogue, so voice contamination absent. Perceptual signature—painterly chromatic noticing—stays distinct under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Lyric overdrive risks purple tinges (“neon haze blurred the stars into forgotten whispers”) yet pattern is taught early and sustains moonlit incantation. No loops or scaffold; sentences multi-task. Metaphors stay coherent within painterly lexicon. Some modifier stacks (“methodically hopeful”) edge precious but do not stall closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Fusing insomnia, extinct scripts, and moon-powered brush yields fresh texture; kindness-as-epigraphy avoids trope ruts. Risk is moderate—lyric accretive structure—but payoff lands. Could transpose core arc to another artist yet saffron-quiet city and glyph specificity root it here. Not groundbreaking but memorably synthesized.</comment>
