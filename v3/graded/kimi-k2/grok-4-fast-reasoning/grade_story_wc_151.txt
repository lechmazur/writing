<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elias’s margin-seeking impulse is concrete and embodied in the chalk ritual, but the stakes never press back; no contradictory impulse or visible cost complicates his inventiveness, so the arc flattens into mere performance rather than tested character. The final “Shadow Weaver” tag feels gifted, not earned through prior friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the dawn light, chalk dust, and mailbox silhouette layer into a Charged Poise that reweights nostalgia as tactical resistance. Cost is legible in the fading chalk and the impending drone-world erasure; the closure image crystallizes meaning without forced exposition.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The arcade’s amber glow and overnight rain residue constrict Elias’s palette—real chalk on wet alloy dictates timing and technique. The juxtaposed holo-ads and chalk dust charge the final mailbox outline with tangible cost, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Pressure tightens once: the approaching foot traffic and sunrise limit chalk survival, forcing rapid encoding. The stake remains single-track—preserve tactile meaning—so the deepening is narrow but legible under the Accumulative lens; no antagonistic force beyond time itself, yet the cost is visible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through material contrast rather than statement: child-medium vs. neural implants, paper vs. data stream. The final chalk mailbox reprises this without moralizing, letting the image revalue “slow” as insurgent. Some near-abstractions—“tactile soul”—edge toward soft profundity but stay contained.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person stays anchored to Elias’s selective noticing—dying-star billboards, clipboard weight, chalk grit under nails. Rhythm swells with syntactic parallelism that mirrors fractal code, then tightens into single-stroke final outline; no head-hop or register drift. Distinct perceptual signature holds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable; each sentence carries sensory + symbolic load without purple drift. One scaffold paraphrase loop (“golden arcade at dawn…amber glow”) costs −0.3; otherwise rhythm modulates, verbs stay strong, and closure image lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The chalk-cipher remix of playground iconography against quantum fractals feels specific to this voice; nostalgia is weaponized rather than fetishized. Risk lies in choosing a quiet image for closure—paid off by the reweighted mailbox silhouette. Could edge higher with one more unforeseen inflection mid-scene.</comment>
