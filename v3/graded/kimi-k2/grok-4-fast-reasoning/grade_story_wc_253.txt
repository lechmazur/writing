<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—performer’s reflex versus exhausted numbness—are vividly embodied in the whittling beat; the blank mask is sustained without slipping into diagnostic labels. The micro-choice to narrate the mundane task crystallizes her hierarchy of values: voice as last shield against void. Grief for the sister is anchored in tactile bouquet memory, supplying credible cost. Moral ambiguity remains shield, not evasion, because the text lets it constrain nothing in the present beat—she neither confesses nor atones—so the arc plateaus at renunciation rather than change, capping score below 8.8.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each shaving curl thickens the pattern of artifice-as-survival until the bird-image reweights the stake—flight carved from stasis. Closure is Charged Poise: the unfinished bird beside the brittle bouquet reconfigures options (she will narrate tomorrow) with undeniable exhaustion as cost. No orientation debt; turbines and farmhouse anchor by line 3. One causal micro-turn—knife slips, curl falls, narration rises—suffices for this length. Persistent constraint (void cannot cry) shapes every tactic; cost is legible in final “remade hush.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Turbines’ blade-whoof replaces cicadas, farmhouse boards warp under vanished laughter—selective sensory triage filtered through Elara’s depleted attention. Wind-sculpted sky returns in narration metaphor, braiding outer weather to inner weather without overt symbolism. Micro-setting of table (bouquet + bird) constrains the final image, charging the “fragile bloom” motif. Spatial choreography clean: her body tracks from field to chair to window without drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</question><comment>Dominant stake—can she coax any lightness out of grief’s void—signaled in paragraph 3. Pressure escalates via accretion: each shaving narration thickens the stakes of voice itself; when the bird’s wing snaps free, the tightening lands—she must finish the metaphor or admit defeat. No external antagonist needed; void is coherent pressure. Cost is visible: splinters in palm, throat raw from solo performance, bouquet loses another petal—each loss alters no tactic yet accumulates to the exhausted poise.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Theme emerges from iterative image-pair: brittle bouquet (dead joy) vs. emerging bird (possible flight). Final tableau reweights the pair—bird still earth-bound, bouquet still dead—yielding a non-literal answer: artifice neither redeems nor collapses, it merely endures. No moralizing; the silence after “drama of the mundane” invites counter-readings (courage, cowardice, habit). Subtext in knife’s “beak sharp and eyes mere indents” hints at blind, weaponized hope—resonant without statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</question><comment>Third-person limited clings to Elara’s performer-brain: syntax elongates into stage cadence, diction vaults to “coaxing secrets from the grain,” then collapses into flat “blank mask”—rhythmic mimicry of her mask-work. No head-hopping; perceptual signature consistent. Filter verbs (“she noticed”) appear only when they echo audience-direction habit, hence motivated. Final whisper “ready for tomorrow’s narrated ordinary” lands with controlled psychic distance—intimate yet unbroken.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence detected. Figurative language sparse and purposeful—three extended metaphors (turbine-gods, blade-dance, bird-flight) taught early and reprised at closure. No mixed metaphors; turbine logic held. One paraphrase loop midsentence (“remade hush … a quiet reconstructed”) but intra-beat, so −0.2 only. Information density high: each shaving sentence carries both tactile detail and emotional echo. Line-level artifacts do not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</question>
<comment>Post-mandate emotional void rendered through solitary whittling performance feels fresh; grafts Beckett-like stasis onto eco-gothic turbines. Transformation test fails if names change—specificity lies in performer narrating to empty room, not concept alone. Risk distinction awarded (+0.3): choosing theater-of-one as survival tactic elevates stakes without gimmick. No familiar scene echoes; bouquet-and-bird pairing particular to this voice.</comment>
