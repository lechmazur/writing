<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—her tactile search for “a filament of hush” embodies the contradiction of a deaf musician craving silence to feel. The micro-choice to rig the broken needle and press her palms to the phonograph is a charged, embodied risk that crystallizes her arc. Emotional thaw is earned through these physical acts, not declared. Only the sister’s death remains slightly abstract, blunting the final cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story lands a Resonant Reconfiguration: the reversed song’s vibrations literally break her numbness, the cost etched in silent tears. Causality is tight—because she rigs the needle backward, therefore the hush pierces her. Orientation is immediate; the cavern’s geography and Thorne’s absence are anchored in the first 120 words. Closure is legible under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density of vibration accumulates until the emotional pattern ruptures.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The cavern’s resonant stone and scattered drum frames act as an acoustic extension of Elara’s body; the phonograph’s horn becomes a micro-setting that constrains her final gesture. Sensory detail is selective—dust-moted light, the scrape of wax—never decorative. The mirrored hush is rendered through tactile cold and vibration rather than visual cliché. Only the outside seasons remain a distant backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—defeat emotional numbness—is signaled in paragraph five and tightened when the backward song forces a trade-off: risk reopening grief to feel again. Escalation is one sustained crescendo of vibration; no false reversals. Agency is entirely Elara’s; luck does not intervene. The price is the silent tears that prove the numbness has been pierced.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the paradox of a deaf woman using reversed sound to reclaim feeling; no statement is required. The “filament of hush” motif reweights from abstract longing to lived catharsis without moralizing. Subtext resides in the unspoken sister’s absence vibrating through every beat. Final image of the cavern as “her rebirth” offers a resonant, non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elara’s tactile perception; no head-hopping. The prose’s rhythmic pulse—“subtle at first, like the faint rustle”—mirrors the phonograph’s irregular revolutions. Diction is precise and sensory, never academic. Only the single paragraph of backstory slips into slightly more abstract register, a minor waver.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in cadence, accelerating with the crank of the phonograph, then breathing in the aftermath. No loops or redundant phrasing; each image advances mood or motive. Metaphors (“petrified bloom,” “ghosts of melody”) are sparse and purposeful. Minor filter verbs appear only in the reflective paragraph, not during the climax.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The conceit of a deaf musician decoding reversed sound through bone conduction is fresh and fully committed to. Tropes of grief-healing are transformed by the acoustic alchemy of wax and vibration. The story’s risk—using silence as the active agent—pays off without gimmickry. Specificity of craft (beeswax, snapped silver) anchors the premise in lived detail.</comment>
