<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s “carefully resourceful” tag is dramatized—key into driftwood lock, puddle-map read under drone threat—yet interiority drifts into thesis language (“tyranny of indifference”) that short-circuits embodied contradiction. Kael’s reappearance supplies relational pressure, but his erased-then-returned arc is told, not resource-constrained; the key’s loss registers only as symbolic drop, not micro-choice with cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: lost network → lagoon cue → key → holotapes → Kael. Closure lands as Charged Poise—tapes sealed, dyad re-formed, dawn hint—cost legible in key abandoned to glowing water, future dissemination unwritten but reweighted. One scaffold loop (“plans unraveled” x3) slightly dulls tightening; still, lens stays causal and final image forecloses retreat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Auric lagoon’s star-lit algae, puddle’s rippled star-map, and drone hum create selective sensory triad that guides movement; micro-setting (key/lock disguised as driftwood) physically gates the cache. Environment directly constrains tactical path and charges final image—key sinking into glowing tide—meeting 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“ignite coded freedom before forgetfulness wins”—tightens when encrypted signals die, leaving lone recovery of holotapes. Protagonist agency drives each beat: read puddle, skirt patrols, unlock cache; cost visible in key forfeiture and exposure risk. No off-stage rescue; coincidence (Kael alive) complicates rather than resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of memory vs. engineered apathy emerges through concrete objects—tapes, key, puddle-map—rather than slogans. Final image of submerged key re-prices earlier “relic” motif: truth now buoyed by collective risk, not metal. One echo of prompt language (“tyranny of indifference”) keeps it shy of 9.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lyric-cinematic third-person hovers close to Elara’s sensorium: “pockets bulging,” “lariat of starlight,” compressed syntax under patrol hum. Filter verbs minimal; metaphor vehicles consistent (wire, algae, cipher). No head-hop; Kael’s voice surfacing is external, maintaining POV discipline.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Rhythm varies from long breathless arcs to staccato beats mirroring stealth. Minor paraphrase loop on “plans unravel” and one mixed metaphor (“embers…fog”) but no clog at climax. High density: most sentences double-task exposition and atmosphere.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Post-cyberpunk resistance tropes refreshed by analog relic (phone key) and bioluminescent-star navigation; puddle-map is inventive visual cipher. Concept of algae-lit lagoon as living archive feels singular, though regime-amnesia premise is familiar. Risk taken in lyrical compression pays off in final image.</comment>
