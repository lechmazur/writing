<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elowen’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her fingers “mapping the fractures born of storms and neglect” shows embodied empathy. The contradiction between her need to heal silence and the risk of reopening wounds is dramatized in the act of strumming. The final choice to keep playing despite the cracks widening carries visible cost. Minor slip: “symphonically minded” is asserted more than enacted in micro-choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single-scene arc anchored by the hedgehog’s uncurling as temporal pivot. Causal chain: hedgehog signal → Elowen kneels → analyzes cracks → strums → sound bridges silence. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the grove’s hush is not broken but reweighted into shared resonance, cost paid in the audible widening of the cracks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The siskin alder grove is rendered through selective sensory detail—mossy earth, twilight’s last light—filtered by Elowen’s tactile attention. The porcelain insulator evolves from relic to active resonator, constraining how sound can be released. Spatial choreography is clean: sculpture, insulator, vine string, hedgehog all track without drift. Setting subtly guides choice via the alders’ “expectant” lean.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can empathy survive in a world silenced by trauma? Pressure tightens when strumming risks shattering the sculpture. Agency is the deliberate act of strumming despite that risk; the cost is the audible widening of cracks—harmony bought with further fracture. Escalation is causal and single-turn, sufficient for length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>Theme emerges from the image of music born from wounds: “pain into harmony.” Subtext operates in the hedgehog’s silent witness and the porcelain’s cracked but intact state. Final image of the grove “pulsed with possibility” offers non-literal answer: silence is not cured but shared. No moralizing; resonance arises from concrete particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elowen’s perceptual filter; no head-hopping. Syntax mirrors her musical ear—phrases like “crescendos of pressure, rests of release” feel organic to her mind. Voice modulates with intensity: shorter clauses during the strum, longer lyrical ones in reflection. Minor drift: occasional elevated diction (“symphonically minded”) slightly above character lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet fluid; each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and thematic work. Metaphors are precise—“stress cracks spiderwebbing like forgotten sheet music.” No loops or scaffold; rhythm accelerates with the strum, then exhales. Only micro-slip: one mixed metaphor (“bridge for unseen energies”) that still reads legible.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise of “tree-song sculptor” in a hushed world feels fresh, not gimmick. The porcelain insulator repurposed as resonator is a specific, grounded invention. Transformation test passes: the emotional arc depends on the exact alder grove, exact cracks, exact relic. Risky lyric compression pays off in the final resonant image.</comment>
