<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory pull—between seeking death’s whisper and choosing to guide strangers to safety—grounds her interiority; the parasol-tip anchor is tactile and specific. Her “loose grip on reality” is shown through sensory slippage, not label. Final renunciation (turning from the marina) costs her the quest that once defined her, earned via Kai’s recording and the storm’s arrival.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: she hears the ending-sound but chooses service over spectatorship, parasol warm in hand—cost is the foreclosure of her original death-tourism goal. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each salvage, story, and gust layers until the storm’s “gentle unfurling” reweights stakes. Orientation anchor arrives by line 5; no ambiguity at end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Drift-ice marina is not backdrop but hazard: slick decks, groaning floes, wind that tugs parkas constrain every step. Salt-ice scent permeates dialogue and action; the parasol-tip micro-setting replaces generic room. Final image—storm breaking over shifting ice—crystallizes the reconfiguration, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“learn the sound of approaching endings”—tightens when Kai’s recording offers the literal hum; storm then forces live audition. One meaningful deepening suffices: from observer to actor, she forfeits passive hearing for active rescue, price legible in the closing turn. Accumulative lens accepts pattern-intensification rather than causal chain, met.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from pattern: salvage of broken things (lace tip, Kai’s wife, floe refugees) revalued rather than discarded. Final image reframes “endings” as communal transition, not private exit—no moralizing statement needed. Ambiguity lingers: did she really hear it, or join the living chorus? Resonant without tidy thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person hovers close to Elara’s synesthesiac ear: “world had tilted just enough to unmoor her” signals lyric compression early, held to last line. Wind-borne diction stays inside her sensorium; no head-hop. Dialogue minimal, idiomatically Kai’s: “She heard it coming” carries subtext of shared loss.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with scene tempo—long cadence for lull, clipped fragments as storm breaks. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances salvage, memory, or auditory search. Metaphors stay sensory (“floes clattered like forgotten thoughts”) without crowding high-pressure beats. Clean grammar; pronoun tracking clear across shifting ice choreography.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Euthanasia-tourism meets climate-refugee crisis through auditory obsession—fresh synthesis. Parasol-tip shard carries elegiac femme lineage across eco-apocalypse, resisting macho salvage tropes. Risk of quiet ending paid off: choosing to listen while aiding flight reconfigures death-trip premise. Specificity prevents generic dystopia.</comment>
