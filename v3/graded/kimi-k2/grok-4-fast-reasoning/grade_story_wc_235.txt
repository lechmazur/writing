<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid—Elias’s envy of “feral nostalgia” fuels the writing beat—but no contradiction plays out in-scene; the grave vision is recalled, never re-experienced under pressure, so the final “peace” feels declared rather than earned by micro-choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the birch scroll now “talismanic,” grave-terror reweighted into “wind beneath imagined wings,” cost legible. Accumulative lens holds—pattern of return (grave-soar-scroll) tightens once—but no fresh tightening inside the scene itself keeps it below 8.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Frost-laced panes, resin scent, cabin groans under wind—selective, POV-filtered; birch scroll re-appears in the final image as the tool that converted dread into narrative lift, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Single stake: turn dread into living narrative. Pressure accumulates via lyric recursion—grave/soar dyad deepens—but no middle beat narrows real-world options; escalation is poetic, not tactical, so cost stays conceptual rather than felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme—the alchemy of envy into art—emerges through image chain (grave→roots→wings) without moralizing; final reconfiguration invites counter-readings (is the scroll escape or tomb-mark?), achieving complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice owns a weary lyric cadence—“jaded wonder” maintained across frost, resin, smoke curls—modulating into hush at the star-close. Perceptual signature is consistent; patterned repetition (“feral nostalgia,” “jaded wonder”) is taught early and paid off, keeping prose legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong verbs, sensory economy; occasional modifier stacks (“raw, untamed yearning”) flirt with overwrite but peak beat at scroll-rolling stays clean. No loops, coherent spatial tracking; readable aloud without stumbling.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dream-records & grave-visits are familiar territory, yet the fusion of birch bark as living parchment that absorbs dread gives fresh inflection; transformation keeps premise from feeling templated.</comment>
