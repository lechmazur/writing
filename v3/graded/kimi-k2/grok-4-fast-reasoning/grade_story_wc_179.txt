<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s pacifist scheming is embodied in tactile micro-choices—offering the box, brushing Thorne’s hand—each action calibrated to awaken cellular memory. Her contradictory impulses (non-violent yet manipulative) coexist in-scene, and the final renunciation of force carries visible cost as she pockets the box again. Thorne’s shift from clenched fists to silent tears is earned by the memory transfer, not authorial fiat. Minor slip: “scheming pacifist” is once label-speak, not embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Thorne’s release of resentment is legible in the gesture of returning the box, the sanctuary walls re-stabilizing, and the air’s new lightness. Causal chain—box → memory → release → reality steady—holds without gaps. Cost is felt in Thorne’s tears and Elara’s quiet acceptance of perpetual guardianship. Orientation anchored by line 3; no drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The soundless sanctuary is not backdrop but instrument: enforced quiet enables the box’s silent resonance and constrains the only permitted language—hand signs. Spatial warping (floating altar, fractal shadows) mirrors Thorne’s inner chaos and subsides as he releases anger. Micro-setting of the box’s broken pin functions as tactile “setting” that charges the final image. One cliché—“impossible angles”—keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will Thorne relinquish resentment?—tightens when reality’s instability makes harbored anger lethal. Escalation is driven by Elara’s single decisive tactic: the memory transfer via box. The tightening forecloses Thorne’s prior stance; his fists unclench and the sanctuary stabilizes, showing visible cost. No reversals needed; one meaningful turn suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: resentment as inherited poison, grace as reappearing but demanding release. Subtext resides in the silent exchange of the box and the unshed tears. Final image—Thorne handing back the box—offers a non-literal answer without moralizing. Only the phrase “shifting grace” edges toward abstraction once too often.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elara’s perceptual signature: selective attention to silence, tactile detail, Thorne’s micro-expressions. Hand-sign dialogue carries subtext (“What peace can you offer…”) and advances the plot. No head-hopping; voice modulates with pressure, compressing diction as reality warps. Rhythm controlled throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid: “resentment must be released, not harbored like a thief in the night” does triple duty—theme, image, foreshadowing. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances story or atmosphere. Figurative language is precise; “cellular memory” is introduced early and paid off. Only one near-mixed metaphor—“bridge to healing”—keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: pacifist manipulation via broken music box transmitting ancestral memory to defuse violence. The concept of “shifting grace” is literalized in the warping sanctuary that stabilizes only when anger is released. Risky choice—silent hand-sign dialogue—heightens stakes without gimmickry. Feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
