<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—clinging to the screw while fearing its memory—surface in her tactile buffing motion, not in labels. The micro-choice to pocket the polished screw crystallizes her shift from paralysis to tentative renewal, with the weight against her thigh as embodied cost. Silas acts as gentle pressure, not full crucible, so relationship dynamics stay minor. Interiority remains concrete, never drifting into therapy-speak, and the final endurance carries credible, scaled cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the restored screw in her pocket reweights time’s flow, cost felt in its new heft. Accumulative lens holds: each drip, scratch, and polish adds density until the patinaed object reframes her past. Orientation anchors—who, where, when—arrive by line 3, beating the 120-word test. No因果 breaks; the fog’s lift parallels insight without resolving grief too neatly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fog, rust, and dripping reservoirs filter through Elara’s scentless world, narrowing perception to tactile detail that guides her choice to act. The screw itself serves as micro-setting, its threads constraining how Silas and Elara relate to time and memory. Selective sensory focus (absent smell, present chill) mirrors internal absence without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography stays clean—workbench, lantern, window track consistently.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>A single dominant stake—reclaim sensory meaning—tightens when polishing the screw becomes the decisive, narrowing act; no reversal is needed. Pressure grows through accumulative texture: each drip and rubbed fleck raises the implicit cost of abandoning the past. No external antagonist, yet the internal conflict gains visceral traction. The final poise forecloses retreat without promising full healing, satisfying cost requirement.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of “ordinary miracles” emerges concretely from a rusted clamp screw reborn, never stated outright. The screw’s transformation reconfigures prior hospital trauma without moralizing. Subtext operates in Silas’s trembling grip and Elara’s silent pocketing, implying shared mourning more than declaring it. Final image invites reflection on resilience through humble objects, avoiding tidy thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person stays tightly latched to Elara’s perceptions, modulating from tentative entry to lighter exit. Diction—“tactile rhythm,” “veiled drips”—carries aromatherapist-honed sensory precision without leaving her POV lexicon. No dialogue clutter; brief murmurs carry trembling calm cadence. Free indirect rhythm breathes with fog’s density, then lifts in cleaner final light.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening, tracking fog-thick hesitation then release. Figurative language appears sparingly and purposefully (“time flowed not in ticks but in steady, veiled drips”), never clogging beats. No synonym loops or paraphrase stacks; each clause advances image or emotion. One micro-copy slip—“mapping the emotional terrain” repeats prompt phrasing—stops just short of the closure beat, allowing high band.</comment>

<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Merging aromatherapist anosmia with water-clock repair feels fresh, avoiding familiar grief templates. The birthing-screw-as-talisman supplies specific, verifiable detail that generic trauma objects lack. Transformation test passes: swap screw for coin and obstetric context collapses. Slight risk in lyric accumulative structure is purposeful and paid off, meriting small bonus.</comment>
