<question>1</question>
<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Interiority is character-rich and exact (“mistakes into constellations”), but some shepherd-backstory lapses into summary rather than shaping urgent choices. Her forgiving-skeptic stance crystallizes believably when she clicks the tooth to the fountain, yet a few beats read slightly expository.</comment>

<question>2</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Plot holds under an accumulative-textural lens: the tooth-pattern tightens with each garden beat. Orientation is anchored early; the final image reweights meaning via the dissolving tooth-light, delivering a resonant reconfiguration with felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question>
<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The hedge-maze-garden functions as micro-setting that constrains movement and hides wards. Sensorial detail is selective—yew scent, nightshade, stiff water—culminating in a charged fountain image. Minimal physics or anchor drift.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Stakes escalate through pressure on the cleft in certainty: the tooth’s warmth forces a reconfiguration of Elara’s stance. Agency is hers at the fountain; no deus ex machina; cost is the irretrievable surrender of the tooth/decoy illusion.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the tension between nostalgic garden play and the hard knowledge of changeling theft. The final forgiveness image reframes the central question—turning illusion into a constellation—without sermonizing.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>POV is single, intimate, with a distinct perceptual signature (“mistakes into constellations”). Compression and patterned diction under lyric mode are taught early and paid off in the final chant; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Rhythm varies naturally, high density without loops or synonym loops. A few metaphors stretch (“forgotten ambitions”) but do not muddle. Sentence propulsion accelerates with scene needs.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Changeling garden fuses fairy lore with bone-setter craft in a fresh synthesis that feels inevitable. Specific rune-tooth mechanics and fountain wards make it irreplaceable; slight risk is the familiar fairy-swap trope.</comment>
