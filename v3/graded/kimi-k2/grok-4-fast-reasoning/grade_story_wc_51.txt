<comment>Elara’s fractal-curse/quest dynamic grants her interiority with recursive scars and embodied motion; choices calcify burdens to stakes, though reverie sometimes flattens micro-choices. Interior contradiction—love of infinity vs need to end it—grounds her. Closure renunciation (bearing all weights) feels earned, emotional cost legible.</comment>

<question>2</question>
<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern intensifies via stone-weights density. Setup (widow’s sorrow) → Development (lamp orientation calcifies) → Payoff (final scale balance) land with cost. No causality breaks; quiet ending reconfigures recursion instead of resolving grand conflict.</comment>

<question>3</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Bronze veins and starlight function as micro-setting: fractal wall drives Elara’s orientation choices, burner alignment uses copper gleam for psychic focus. Sensory depth (shingled hush) constrains echo collection. Consistent spatial anchors; environment charges final image.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—balancing her infinite loop by gathering weights—tightens via each calcified burden narrowing options. One deepening beat (stone weights reconfigure pattern) is sufficient. Cost (bearing all griefs) felt, though escalation stays moderate, not high-drama.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>6.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from iterative burden-gathering: endless loops vs finite choice. Subtext in silence where grief calcifies avoids moralizing. Final image (weighted belt) reweights premise—acceptance of infinity’s cost—without tidy epiphany.</comment>

<comment>Limited dialogue enhances lyric texture; third-person close POV stays stable. Whalebone reverie voice modulates with fractal diction (“shingled hush,” “recursive scars”). Interior sentences avoid therapy-speak; filter verbs minimal. Perceptual signature distinct throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, patterned, and read-aloud rhythmic; figurative language (“whalebone reverie”) ties to imagery without fluff. Information density high; no loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated diction fits POV’s lexicon. Metaphors cohere, no muddle in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Fractal-geometry trap and burden-weights offer fresh inflection on “trapped by infinity” trope. Specificity in copper veins and stone weights grounds concept. Final image reconfigures mythic quest via quiet acceptance. Risks lyric compression that heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
