<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elara’s longing is vivid, but her interiority drifts into lyric shorthand (“motivation burned softly”) that tells more than shows; the father’s voice flashback supplies motive yet arrives too late to shape her micro-choices under pressure. No embodied contradiction plays out in real time—she never hesitates, backtracks, or pays an on-page price for mis-reading the wood or the codes—so the final crossing feels gifted rather than earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the terrace tilts homeward after she whispers codes,Cost is conceptual—the world “mending in whispers” implies she accepts necessary distances—but the causality is soft: no prior beat shows failure or resistance that this success overcomes. Orientation is waived because floating disorientation pays off thematically; lens is Accumulative/Textural, held throughout. One scaffold loop—“fractured hush” repeated with identical cadence—dulls the final image slightly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Drifting prism terrace, corn-field horizon, and logbook grain are tactile, POV-filtered, and supply the tactical resource (codes) that catalyze closure. The terrace’s refractive physics remain consistent; spatial choreography is clean across the single continuous scene. The prism array literally charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate; minor overload of “fractured” and “shard” metaphors keeps it sub-exceptional.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—cross back home by honoring thresholds—is signaled early and tightens once: the logbook forces her to translate abstract awe into operational code. However, escalation is narrated rather than dramatized (“she intuited a way back”) and no visible price—lost time, physical risk, or failed attempt—attaches to the tilt homeward, so pressure feels moderate, not acute.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme of “necessary distances as architects of meaning” emerges via mirrored imagery—maze buffer rows, pilot clearance codes, prism gaps—without overt statement until the penultimate paragraph. Final reconfiguration re-weights father’s earlier aphorism, inviting reflection on restraint as portal home. One near-echo of the prompt phrase (“thresholds felt sacred”) is softened through corn-maze memory, avoiding sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Elara’s selective attention—wood veins read as storm maps, prisms clink like “forgotten chimes”—creating a consistent perceptual signature. Syntax lengthens under wonder, shortens under action; no head-hopping or register drift. Occasional poetic堆叠 (“featherly determined”) risks mannerism but remains legible and pattern-consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Information-dense sentences layer image, memory, and tactile cue without paraphrase loops; only “fractured hush” repeats verbatim. Metaphors stay coherent—wind-swept plains in grain, prism shards in sky—but two adjacent “like” similes in the climax blunt momentum. Otherwise clean grammar, precise tense, and purposeful paragraphing propel the read.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Butterfly-effect limbo and agrarian maze-craft splice into fresh mythic territory; the pilot logbook as hymnal of sacred gaps is an inventive pivot. Risk is moderate—lyric speculative vignette rather than bold structural gamble—but the synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight. Could swap for any lost-child tale without corn detail, so freshness is solid, not startling.</comment>
