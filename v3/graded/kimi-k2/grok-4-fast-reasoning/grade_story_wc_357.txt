<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is clear and embodied—her grip on the controls, her racing heart—but interiority stays surface-level; no contradictory impulses are dramatized under pressure. The final choice to safeguard the arrow tip is motivated, yet the cost feels external rather than internal. Competence slightly outweighs struggle; the inversion never truly endangers her stance or values.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the broken arrow tip is discovered, its history revealed, and Elara’s new custodianship reweights the premise with conceptual cost. Causality is causal-accumulative hybrid; each beat (inversion, inverted rivers, echoes) tightens the lens toward the relic. Orientation is anchored early; no temporal or spatial drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Setting is vivid, selective, and purposeful—floating arches, luminous rivers, mossy ledge—each detail constrains navigation and choice. The inverted waterfalls and whirling silence charge the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent; no impossible positions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—uncover the source of resilience—is signaled early and escalates through the inversion. The tightening moment is the discovery of the glade and relic; agency is present, cost is conceptual (custodianship). Pressure remains coherent under the lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of resilience-as-seeded-sacrifice emerges through the arrow-tip visions, never stated. Subtext operates in the echoes and the silent covenant Elara accepts. Final image reweights the premise without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elara’s sensorium; no head-hopping. Diction is textured—“whirling silence,” “luminous veins”—and rhythm modulates with scene pressure. Perceptual signature is consistent and character-specific.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, vivid, and propulsive; no loops or scaffold. Metaphors are coherent and purposeful. High information density without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Premise of gravity-inverting orchards seeded by ancient pilots feels fresh and specific. The synthesis of ecological SF with mythic relic is non-obvious and fully committed. Risky inversion mechanics pay off without gimmickry.</comment>
