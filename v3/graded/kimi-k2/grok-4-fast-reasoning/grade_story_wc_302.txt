<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Interiority is atmospheric but abstract (“exhilaration bubbled… wariness of one who had chased illusions”); no embodied contradiction in-scene. Micro-choices (wind watch, jot notes) advance plot yet never sharpen a value hierarchy or flaw. Final stance is wonder, not renunciation; cost is mentioned (“weight… fulfilled—for now”) but not dramatized on her body or future options.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: letter → watch → cipher → coordinates → library. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—library reweights her past “fractured” status and foreshadows second-letter risk. Cyclical-reversal cipher and propagation-delay watch provide persistent constraints that shape tactics. Cost (“second letter loomed… trap”) is legible in final sentence; could be sharper on-page but suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Attic, alleys, mist, hovering books—selective, tactile, filtered through her urgency. Watch glow as micro-setting guides night walk and final image. Spatial choreography clean; no white-room patches. Environment does not actively constrain final choice (library admits her freely), keeping it under 9.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—reach library—signaled early; each cipher layer/watch delay narrows timeframe and forces patience, a credible cost. No external antagonist; pressure is internal/time. One meaningful tightening when reversed cycle clicks into coordinates. Could use a sharper tangible forfeiture (energy, safety) to push higher.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of reclaiming silenced voices emerges through images (hovering books, unspoken regrets) rather than statement. Final “symphony of silenced voices” reweights prior cipher loops with conceptual cost. Avoids moral lesson; ambiguity about confidence-man trap lingers. Slight abstraction in “fractured past” keeps it from resonance ceiling.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric sustained: cadenced clauses, heightened diction (“sanctuary where silenced thoughts bloomed eternal”) fits obsessive dreamer. No head-hopping; perception stays tightly veiled. Compression and elision (“the days unfolded”) taught early and paid off. Tiny register wobble: “propagation delays” slips into tech-talk but brief.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Strong rhythmic variety; sentences advance multiple jobs (image + motion + stakes). Occasional overwrought flourish (“mist curling around her like a protective shroud”) but beat remains clear. No loops, paraphrase, or scaffold. Punctuation clean; metaphors coherent. One mixed vehicle (“petals of a nocturnal flower” beside clockwork cipher) barely dents clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Fuses con-artist relic, temporal puzzle, and library of unvoiced regrets—fresh synthesis. Cyclical cipher that erases prior progress is non-obvious constraint. Confidence-man lore enriches but doesn’t overshadow protagonist’s metaphysical quest. Concept feels inevitable in hindsight yet not derivative; risk level moderate.</comment>
