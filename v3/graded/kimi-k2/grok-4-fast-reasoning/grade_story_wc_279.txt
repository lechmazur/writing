<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elara’s whimsicality and social perceptiveness are shown through tactile sand-play and tactical placements, but interior contradiction is muted; we hear her motives summarized rather than felt as clashing impulses under pressure. The final “smile” is a label, not an embodied cost, so the renunciation reads lightly rather than foreclosed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration—mandala crystallizes silence with undeniable social cost—yet the lens wavers between situational and accumulative; causality is soft (“voices tapered”而非 forced choice). Orientation is secure by 120 words, but escalation beats are more cadence-shift than narrowing options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Grotto acoustics and lilac fog constrain speech tactics; the tile flake’s cool hum and chalk-slick floor anchor every motion. Spatial choreography never drifts; environment is not backdrop but active amplifier that charges the final hush. Detail is selective, filtered through Elara’s artist-eye, earning micro-setting authority.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“can communal silence be designed?”—is legible, but pressure escalates via additive imagery rather than harder choices; no option is foreclosed until the ambient hush simply “lingers.” Cost is atmospheric, not tactical, keeping the beat below high-band tightening.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of meaning-through-mess emerges via sand-image, not statement; ambiguity is preserved, no moral is preached. Final image reweights prior noise without tidiness, though thematic counter-readings stay modest. Resonance is concrete yet not strikingly non-obvious.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Elara’s sensorium; diction is painterly, rhythm ebbs with mist-breath. No head-hop; free-indirect slips are clean. Voice is distinct and consistent under pressure, with taught compression (“echoes danced like forgotten sighs”) that pays off in the closing hush.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lush yet information-dense; mixed metaphors are few and minor. Occasional loop near-paraphrase (“whispering…whispers”) drags slightly, and lilac over-saturation risks perfume overload, but rhythm breathes with scene needs. Errors never obscure causality or dull the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Acoustic-mandala as conflict-resolution device feels fresh; whispering-gallery flake gives concrete science twist to lyric ritual. Risk is moderate—quiet climax, no twist—but specificity of chalk-stained sand artistry lifts the piece above template. Not strikingly bold, yet memorable within short-form lyric niche.</comment>
