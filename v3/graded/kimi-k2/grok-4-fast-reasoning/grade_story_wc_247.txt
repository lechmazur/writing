<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elias’s hollow longing is embodied early; the camera-as-mirror and his halting sign-language replies show interior contradiction. The final hum costs him social invisibility and charges the camera with new purpose, meeting Earned Stasis. Yet Lir remains an emblem rather than a crucible—his charisma described, not tested—so the relationship side of the rubric stays thin.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the emptied camera becomes a “vessel for the symphony,” silence re-weighted at visible emotional cost. Causality under Accumulative lens holds—each framed silence thickens texture until the fishermen’s hush finalizes the change. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no lens ambiguity at end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Harbor, camera-body, and moonlight constrain every beat: the dock’s gap dictates framing, the tide’s retreat supplies cello hum, the camera’s empty chamber enables the final re-purposing. Selective sensory triage—salt sting, frayed leather, hush after gull—keeps economy tight and charges the closing image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“will Elias remain unseen?”—tightens when public humming forfeits anonymity; price is legible as fishermen turn stare. One meaningful deepening suffices for 700-word Accumulative arc, though pressure is gentle, never existential.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of transmuting absence into art emerges through concrete gesture and final image, not statement. The camera’s emptiness and the harbor’s hush re-weight each other in the closing cadence, offering lingering ambiguity rather than moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person hovers close to Elias with consistent perceptual filter: “camera hung limp” mirrors his drained state; syntax lengthens under moonlight, contracts during hum. No head-hopping; sign-language passages are cleanly italicized by motion description rather than exposition.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Strong rhythmic variation and high-density lines (“joy bubbled in Elias’s chest, a sorrowful delight”) advance triple duty. Two adjacent near-repeats (“luminous harbor by moonlight shimmered...”) mildly loop; figurative language stays coherent and propulsive, never clogging the climax.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Silence-as-score is fresh, but the advisor trope and midnight-redemption harbor are familiar. The camera’s empty frame repurposed as “conductor’s baton” provides a specific, irreversible inflection that lifts the piece above stock imagery.</comment>
