<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elias’s involuntary truth-telling and goal of psychological safety are clear and thematic, but interiority sometimes resorts to abstract labels instead of embodied contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the occluded eye provides selective truth-telling that forges safety, satisfying causal logic and cost under an inferred situational lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>The hanging orchard is vivid and weathers choices, while the glass eye serves as micro-setting; specificity and sensory filter support the dominant stake without clutter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Pressure tightens when the eye’s implantation directly narrows Elias’s options, forcing a trade-off between honesty and safety; escalation is legible and protagonist-driven.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the tension between brutal honesty and gentle occlusion, crystallizing in the final image of the eye—merciful shadows that reweight the premise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Lyrical compression, deliberate rhythm, and tight POV control lend texture; occasional elevated diction fits the introspective mode while remaining character-bound.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, propulsive, and mostly free of scaffold; tiny loops in “storm-sharpened limbs and relentless gales” could tighten, but do not obscure causality or closure.</comment>

<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The empathy-plague premise and antique-eye synthesis feel fresh, and the final image of merciful shadows offers a non-obvious inflection without gimmickry.</comment>
