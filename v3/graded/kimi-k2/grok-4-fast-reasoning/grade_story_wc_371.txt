<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s guilt-driven need for redemption is embodied in tactile micro-choices—planting seeds, breaking bread—yet the interior contradiction between her past betrayal and present gentleness is more summarized than dramatized in scene, keeping her final poise slightly abstract.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each small act of guerrilla gardening layers texture until the final image of steam and crumbs crystallizes a resonant reconfiguration—her earned stasis inside the tea house—whose cost is the perpetual vigilance against creeping normality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The courtyard’s decay and the tea house’s salvaged cushions are rendered with selective sensory detail; the mosaic walls glimpsed through receding vines and the frost-nipped air constrain her planting choices and charge the final quiet image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reclaiming sacredness from decay—tightens through each beat of planting and offering; the pressure is coherent but the cost, while felt, is more atmospheric than viscerally foregrounded.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from Elara’s acts: holiness in the overlooked. The bread’s return as communion and the green shoots amid ruin offer a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays close to Elara’s perceptual bias—her noticing of faded murals, yeast-scented steam—without head-hopping; rhythmic control under pressure is evident in the quiet cadence of the final paragraph.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is lean and textured: “vines receded slightly under her care” and “steam curling like secrets” advance both image and character. No loops or scaffold; occasional elevated diction (“heuristically gentle”) is voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of guerrilla gardening, vanished bakery bread, and secret tea house feels fresh yet inevitable; the quiet subversion of decay into grace avoids familiar tropes without gimmickry.</comment>
