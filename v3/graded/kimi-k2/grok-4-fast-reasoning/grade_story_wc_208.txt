<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s driftwood sculptor identity is embodied through tactile carving and storm-battered hands; her “perpetually learning” trait drives the micro-choice to carve the hybrid figure, but interiority occasionally drifts into lyrical summary rather than concrete contradiction under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The causal chain—GPS failure → slide discovery → carving re-forging alliances—lands a clear Resonant Reconfiguration: the hybrid sculpture visibly reweights the storm’s threat and the slide’s projection, with the turbine-hum as felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Storm-tossed archway is vivid, salt-slick, and proximate; the turbine-hum and lantern flicker narrow perception to immediacy, while the keystone runes constrain Elara’s shelter and later guide her carving, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore frayed timewoven alliances—tightens when the slide’s projection reveals the sailor-guardian pact at risk; Elara’s carving act narrows options and visibly pays the cost of anchoring epochs in a single line of wood.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of malleable history emerges through the slide’s living vignettes and Elara’s re-sculpting; no overt statement, but the final hybrid figure offers a resonant, non-literal answer about continuity and responsibility.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Single POV holds; lyric compression (“turbine-hum reverie”) is taught early and modulates with pressure. Distinct perceptual signature—salt-slick air, turbine drone—anchors the voice without head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; occasional stacked modifiers (“salt-slick air, turbine-hum reverie”) risk overwriting but serve the lyric pattern. No loops or filter-verb stacks; final image crystallizes cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of GPS failure + magic lantern slide + driftwood carving re-anchors ancient alliances; transformation test passes—swap any element and the emotional arc collapses. Risky lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
