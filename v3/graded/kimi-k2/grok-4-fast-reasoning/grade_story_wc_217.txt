<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is concrete and poet-specific; her micro-choice to cradle the scarred conch embodies the “beauty in the incomplete” motive. The internal contradiction—clinging vs. releasing—peaks when the string snaps; cost is felt in the emptied hand. Yet the kite’s flight is observed, not chosen, so agency is observational rather than active, capping the score below 8.8.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: repeated acts of “tending” tighten the pattern until the string break re-weights the premise—liberation as closure. Anchors (who/where/when) are clear within 50 words; no orientation debt. The kite’s escape supplies visible cost under Charged Poise; the feather’s return in the final image confirms Repricing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Cobalt lagoon, wet-sand footing, and rain-scrubbed air are filtered through a poet’s selective eye; every tactile cue services mood rather than cataloging. The feather and broken string function as micro-settings that constrain the final image. Environment never blocks action, but its burnished hush charges the Charged Poise—sufficient for 8.0, not the 9+ bar.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“find poetry in the broken”—tightens through each tended object until the snapped string forces a stance shift: release equals creation. Pressure is textural, not antagonistic; one meaningful deepening satisfies length. Cost is legible in the lost kite, though the external stakes remain low-intensity, keeping the score sub-8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges via pattern: broken shells, fractured feather, snapped string—all re-valued as luminous material. The final line’s “art of harmonizing what remained” offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. No redundancy or echo penalties apply; the concept stays implicit, earning its after-effect.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to Elara’s perceptual signature—“burnished hush,” “fractured sky”—without head-hop. Syntax lengthens in calms, fragments under gusts, matching wind pressure. No register drift; every clause is poet-voice-legal. The voice is distinctive yet unobtrusive, meriting high-band placement.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, image-dense; no scaffold loops or mixed metaphors. Occasional elevated phrasing (“unfinished symphonies”) is voice-motivated and pattern-consistent. One paraphrase loop (“tending… warmly attentive”) repeats across two adjacent sentences—minor, not closure-touching. Otherwise high density and clarity hold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The “kite as released poem” angle freshens familiar shoreline elegy; broken-shell poetics feels specific to this narrator. Risk is moderate—quiet lyric rather than twist—but execution is committed. Lacks a startling inflection that would push ≥8.5, yet remains memorable within its register.</comment>
