<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s grief and longing are palpable, but her interiority leans on lyrical summary rather than embodied contradiction; the transformation beat shows resolve yet lacks a visible cost that forecloses an alternative path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—Earned Stasis in lupine form—yet the causal chain from fortune to metamorphosis feels slightly telescoped; the orchard’s rules are sensed rather than tested, so the lens reads Accumulative/Textural.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The orchard’s silver-leaf gloom and starlit dew are vivid and selective, but the setting serves more as mood than constraint; only the apple-root cookie functions as micro-setting that charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stakes—reforge the bond or remain alone—are signaled early and tightened by the metamorphosis, but the price (loss of human form) is asserted more than dramatized; pressure escalates via lyrical density rather than causal narrowing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of renewal-through-loss emerges through image and action, not statement; the final lope beneath moonlight reweights the fortune’s promise without moralizing, though the conceptual cost remains soft.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is lush, consistent, and textured; cosmic intimacy modulates from elegiac to exultant without head-hopping, though occasional poetic abstractions edge toward purple.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is musical and propulsive, but stacked metaphors (“branches twisting like lovers’ arms”) and near-repetitive phrasing (“paradoxically steady” twice) slightly dull the climactic shift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Fairy-tale orchard + beast-whisperer resurrection is familiar, yet the fusion of fortune-cookie cosmology and lycanthropic grief feels fresh; risk lies in the lyric register, which mostly pays off.</comment>
