<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elar’s conflict feels embodied: inner peace clashing with high-stakes purpose. Motive is dramatized—not told—through the ritual choice, showing hierarchy of values. Final “earned stillness” stance is credible, with visible cost. Micro-moments reveal flaws under stress, avoiding therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mosaic accumulative/lyric lens holds; tension deepens via each deliberate origami gesture. Causal linkage: silence-mapping → prophecy’s unraveling → closure in folded wing. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration—quiet final image seals hush with undeniable conceptual cost. Pattern taught in first 80 words, resolution foreshadowed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Micro-setting (origami wing, brook edge) constrains choice; water flow is both resource and boundary. Atmospheric detail filters through summoners’ perception, guiding ritual stance. Specificity of inks, stone, silence voids renders setting particular. Environment evolves with ritual, affecting later tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake is preserving world balance vs. binding doom; middle-deepening traces to ritual flow choice narrowing options. Cost felt: physical drain, sweat, and final conceptual price of sealing prophecy. Prophecy tension rises through tangible signs (water surge); coincidence absent. Resolution earned without luck.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges from repeated hush of prophecy—silence as constructive act, not stated moral. Subtext in ritual gestures, not exposition. Ending reframes prior whispered secrets as potential cosmos-altering power now neutralized. Avoids tidy lesson; complexity preserved.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lyrical, meditative rhythm mirrors summoner’s calm intensity without drift. POV interiority concrete, embodied, consistent. Distinct perceptual signature—selective noticing of inks, water, silence shapes tone. No drift into generic register; compression purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is lush yet precise—high density, no loops. Rhythmic variation with sentence openings propels ritual beats. Figurative language restrained; when used (moonlight spirits) it charges image, not blur. Clean copy, no scaffold sentences.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: prophecy-as-code tamed by silence-mapping in origami ritual—non-obvious mechanics earned. Specific craft details (infused inks, folded wing) prevent generic template. Final folded wing image seals fate; removal would break resolution. Risk (lyric brevity) succeeds.</comment>
