<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elias’s guardianship motive is clear, but the “logically emotional” trait stays abstract—no moment shows logic and emotion colliding to produce a costly micro-choice. His interiority drifts into lyrical self-summary (“profound, visceral yearnings that no equation could fully map”) rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The beat where he “logically charted the harmonic convergence” while “emotionally enraptured” is told, not dramatized; we don’t feel the tug-of-war steering his tactics. The ending stance is legible, yet the absence of a visible personal cost keeps the change lightweight.</comment>

<comment>Causal chain holds: crypt whispers → key retrieval → sonic ritual → ice stilled. Orientation is swift—place, role, threat, and ticking clock are anchored within the first 120 words. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the relic secure, marina calmed, key glowing—cost is the perpetual vigilance Elias accepts. The only slack is a single off-stage beat: we’re told the ice “calved unnaturally” but never see/hear the first fracture that triggers urgency.</comment>

<comment>Drift-ice marina is more than backdrop; groaning floes and hesitant wavelets supply the low-frequency discord Elias must match, so environment directly shapes tactic. The crystalline artifact’s high, warm hum is sensuously contrasted with the black water, creating a tactile tool-as-setting that constrains the ritual. Spatial choreography is clean—dock, emitter panel, lighthouse base track without drift. One skipped detail: the transition from crypt to dock is elided; a single sensory echo of the keeper’s frost-laced robes on the pier would cement continuity.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—protect relic from encroaching ice—is signaled on page 1 and tightened when the sonic mismatch is measured. Agency sits in Elias’s deliberate frequency modulation; the ice’s retreat is earned, not lucky. A visible price is implied—perpetual ritual vigilance—but not yet dramatized as exhaustion, tool drain, or bodily toll, keeping the cost legible but lightweight. Still, the harmonic convergence moment narrows options effectively under the causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of harmony-through-vulnerability emerges via the flesh-ethereal pulse of the relic and Elias’s skin-warm key; no moral is stated. The final prismatic halo refracts earlier gold sunset, reweighting beauty as guardianship burden—an earned echo. Yet the concept of “sonic absolution” remains more poetic label than lived epiphany; the story leans on lyric recurrence rather than a single crystallized image that redefines the rule-set. Ambiguity is coherent, but the thematic aftereffect is gentle rather than haunting.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s perceptual filter; nautical engineer diction (“emitter coils,” “frequency modulation”) is credible and un-showy. Rhythm swells with the ritual—long sentences during calibration, clipped fragments at the harmonic click—without losing clarity. Occasional loftiness (“nomadic ghosts,” “spectral sighs”) edges toward self-conscious lyricism but stays consistent with the elevated tone the piece teaches early. No dialogue appears; narration alone carries subtext of reluctant devotion.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry triple duty—sense data, emotional voltage, world rule—while avoiding paraphrase loops. Metaphors are cleanly stacked: ice as low discord, artifact as high crystal, key as bridge; no vehicles contradict. A single mixed heat/tactile image—“cold metal warming against his skin” repeating in two spots—risks minor scaffold but is forgivable at this length. Closure line is spare and resonant, satisfying the read-aloud ear test.</comment>

<comment>“Sonic absolution” as literal engineering ritual freshens the familiar guardian-of-relic plot; vibrational matching feels specific to this engineer-mystic rather than generic magic. Drift-ice marina is an evocative stage not often used, and the lighthouse-as-audio-lab merges vocation with myth. Tropes of cryptic keys and ancient artifacts are transformed through tactile acoustics, though the keeper remains an off-the-shelf mystic figure. Overall, synthesis is memorable albeit not paradigm-shifting.</comment>
