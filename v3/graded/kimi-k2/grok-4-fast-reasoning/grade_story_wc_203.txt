<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elias’s motive—“what ceilings hide”—is concrete and distinctive, but we never feel it collide with a counter-desire or fear; the ghosts register only as pity-objects, not as complicating mirrors of his own hunger for secrets. His single decisive act (pocketing the barrel) is motivated by generic compassion rather than a prior, visible internal conflict, so the cost feels light. Competence and observational gift are shown, yet neither trips him up nor exacts price; the flaw line is thin. Interiority stays sensory, not diagnostic, but the emotional hierarchy never sharpens under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: find barrel → ghosts appear → ledgers reveal embezzlement → barrel used to “unwind” torment → ghosts fade. Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elias pockets the relic, sealing the cracks and foreclosing further excavation, with conceptual cost (he now carries the buried guilt). Yet the reversal that triggers the choice—learning the fire was arson—is delivered via summary, not dramatized beat, softening the pivot. Drive lens remains causal throughout; no ambiguity at end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Place is economically anchored by 120-word mark: abandoned carnival admin wing, collapsed big-top outside, ticket stubs under dust. Sensory triage fits an elevator tech’s gaze—metal, beam cracks, dust strata—yet the ceiling crack and the hidden ledgers directly constrain the final pry and choice. Spatial choreography is clean; flashlight beam tracks Elias’s motion without drift. Atmosphere of mourned spectacle is understated but pervasive, charging the final hush when ghosts sigh away.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Stake—uncover ceiling secret—signals early and tightens once: the dust pattern diverges, ceiling panel yields, ledgers expose murderous arson. The tightening is knowledge-based rather than option-limiting; no physical or moral cost accrues to Elias during the ascent. Ghost gratitude substitutes for personal consequence, so pressure stays moderate. Closure is earned via causal disclosure, but protagonist risk remains abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges obliquely: hidden ledgers above a cracked ceiling literalize how institutions paper over culpability; the ghosts’ release reframes “repair” as moral witness rather than mechanical fix. No character articulates the thesis; resonance arrives through the final image of Elias pocketing the time-barrel, quietly shouldering unspoken debt. Subtextual link between elevator shafts vertical gaze and the ceiling’s obscured guilt is tight, though the embezzlement beat is summarized rather than dramatized, muting thematic punch.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment> Third-person focalization stays locked to Elias; perceptual signature—calloused hands, torque memory, dust-layer calculus—remains technician-specific. Syntax is restrained, tactile, no filter-stack clutter; rhythmic control shows in the quickening sentence burst when the panel cracks. No dialogue, so voice distinction untested. One clause edges toward editorial omniscience (“the ghosts carried like invisible chains”), but POV recovers immediately.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, concrete, high-density; each sentence advances image or causality without scaffold. No paraphrase loops or mixed metaphors; metaphor when used (“confetti from a forgotten party”) is brief and scene-rooted. Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; paragraph cuts land on choice beats. Minor filter slip (“he realized”) is quickly compensated by immediate physical interaction with the barrel.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Fusing elevator tech with ghost-witness is fresh; the mainspring barrel as mnemonic key rather than steampunk gimmick avoids cliché. Specificity of dust-pattern forensics lifts the premise above mere spooky atmospherics. Embezzlement-causes-fire is familiar, but its burial in a ceiling crack offers a spatial twist. Risk is moderate—no formal experimentation—but synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
