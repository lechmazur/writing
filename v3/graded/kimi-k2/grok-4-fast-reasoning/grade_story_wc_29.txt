<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is vivid and consistent: to outwit cosmic tricksters before chaos blooms. Her cautious hope collides with gritty resolve in the moment she chooses sub-sonic interference (“her fingers danced over the controls”), showing embodied cost (Harlan staggers, crowds falter). Interiority stays anchored to specific stimuli—charts, dials, the oscilloscope’s dance—rather than generic awe. One flaw: the final beat leans on “honest silence” as summary instead of letting her body register the victory, so the cost is legible but not fully incarnate.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Causal lens holds: because Elara decodes trickster pulses, therefore she counters with sub-sonic doubt, narrowing options for both aliens and campus factions. Closure lands as Decisive Change—signal warps, Harlan’s power play collapses—while sub-sonic cost persists (Harlan staggers, crowds rub temples). Orientation anchors within 120 words (radio station, Orion Arm, power struggle). One hairline slip: the “honest silence” beat summarizes rather than dramatizes the final cost on Elara herself, keeping it shy of 9.0.</comment>

<comment>Radio station confines every action: humming antennas, vibrating console, metal walls that echo Harlan’s bark. Body-tool interface—charts slid toward Harlan, fingers on dials—supplies micro-setting pressure. Orion Arm is sketched briefly yet causally tied to illusions Elara must break. One missed chance: no sensory trace of the sub-sonic hum inside Elara’s own chest would have fused ethereal/grit and locked the 9-band.</comment>

<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—stop cosmic tricksters from weaponizing belief—tightens when Elara injects counter-frequencies, trading her isolation for a campus-wide psychic cost. Agency is clear: her interference, not luck, warps signal and fractures Harlan’s platform. Escalation is singular but sufficient: each paragraph intensifies the stakes from campus schism to physical malaise felt by all. Price is visible on-page (Harlan clutches head, chants falter), meeting the 9-band threshold but stopped by the softer final personal beat.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme—truth as contested frequency—emerges through sub-sonic distortion rather than lecture. Final “honest silence” reweights all prior noise without moralizing. Ethereal grit tone lets cosmic awe coexist with rusted metal and political grime, embodying the thematic tension. Still, the absence of Elara’s private reverb in that last moment keeps resonance a fraction short of full charge.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person anchors tightly to Elara’s professional perception—trace lines on yellowed charts, oscilloscope’s dance—maintaining a scientist’s compressed lyricism. Syntax lengthens under strain (“the air thickening with an otherworldly hum…”) then snaps to staccato beats when she acts, mirroring pulse versus static. No POV drift; Harlan’s interior is shown only through observed gesture. One tiny tic: “cosmic tricksters” edges toward colloquial label inside an otherwise precise mind, but context justifies the shorthand.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry triple duty: atmosphere, tech specificity, plot advance (“These aren’t gifts, Harlan,” she said softly, sliding an astronomical chart…). Metaphors stay coherent—veil cracking like brittle ice—without purple overload. No loops or scaffold; each paragraph pivots choice or stakes. Minor rhythm hiccup: two consecutive “as” constructions dilute propulsion slightly, but the final third remains clean, keeping the closure image sharp.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Blends SETI skepticism with campus political farce in a way that feels inevitable yet fresh. Sub-sonic doubt as weapon literalizes “manufactured consent” without editorializing. Charts evolve from static props to tactical mirror, then to cracked illusion—an object lesson in transforming trope through specificity. The synthesis earns its risk: cosmic horror meets academic back-stab in under 800 words without gimmickry.</comment>
