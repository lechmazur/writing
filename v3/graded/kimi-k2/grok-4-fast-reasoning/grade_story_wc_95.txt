<question>1</question>
<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Elias's metallic limb and duel-scarred history are embodied through decisive micro-choices—tilting the needle card, tracing sundial angles, lunging at shadows—that reveal both wound and wit; his diplomatic ferocity shifts from suspicion to alliance in one credible arc.</comment>

<question>2</question>
<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Causal chain holds: the sundial cipher links early curiosity to the rival’s arrival and the final verbal parry, producing a Charged Poise where violence is reframed as shared quest; orientation is anchored within opening beats, no leaks.</comment>

<question>3</question>
<grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Glass walls magnify brook murmur into whispers that sync with Elias’s doubts; half-painted sundial and needle card double as compass and weapon—micro-setting that alters tactics and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Stakes tighten from potential bloodshed to philosophical alliance; each adjustment of the needle sundial narrows violent options and escalates intellectual cost; the hidden overture transforms rivalry into conspiracy that must be paid with trust.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from geometry of fate—questions bent into destinations—without authorial intrusion; final image of fencers debating beside the refracting atrium crystallizes the motif of dignified chaos.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Distinct, code-laden diction (“angles bent,” “geared whirring”) fits Elias’s philosopher-inventor idiom; POV remains tight, fusing metal-flesh perception under pressure without head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is propulsive and concrete—“foil sliced air in arcs”—with no looped metaphors; filter verbs culled, rhythm mirrors fencing cadence; one metaphor (“veins of doubt”) earns its keep.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of Nordic relic + sundial cipher reworks classic “duel” into joint geometry quest; dignified chaos tone is specific to this atrium’s glass/river acoustics, not generic steampunk.</comment>
