<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s grief is embodied and specific; the dental mirror as relic anchors her interiority. The guardian’s silence is consistent but remains archetypal—no contradictory impulses or visible cost surface in his stillness. A credible shift occurs when she re-weights the mirror from burden to tool, yet the cost feels generalized rather than sharply personal.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the star-pattern on the wall crystallizes Elara’s shift from darkness to reflective light, cost felt in the sigh she releases. Causality is lyrical rather than linear—pattern taught early via mist and mirror, paid off in the final beam. Orientation is clear by line 3; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Cobalt dock, rain-mist, and boathouse interior are vivid, selective, and filtered through Elara’s grief-sharpened senses. The micro-setting of the dental mirror and star-beam actively constrain the final choice. Weather and architecture mirror internal state without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether grief will eclipse or admit light—is signaled early and tightened once when the mirror’s beam fractures into constellation. Escalation is accumulative: each tilt of shutter and mirror deepens the same pressure rather than reversing it. Cost is conceptual (accepting darkness as canvas) and felt in the audible sigh.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: darkness as necessary ground for starlight. Subtext resides in the guardian’s silence and the mirror’s redirected beam—no moralizing. Final image reweights the premise without statement, leaving resonant ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Lyrical third-person limited stays close to Elara’s sensory filter; diction is restrained, rhythmic, and consistent. No dialogue, so voice distinction is moot. Occasional poetic compression (“spiralingly calm”) is taught by repetition and remains legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet textured; sentences vary in length and avoid loops. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful—no mixed metaphors. One minor scaffold: “darkness that had swallowed the light” edges toward cliché but is isolated.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Silent star-ceremony with mute guardian is fresh in its refusal of exposition. Dental-mirror-as-telescope repurposes a mundane tool into cosmic conduit. Risk lies in near-mythic tone, but specificity of dock and weather keeps it grounded.</comment>
