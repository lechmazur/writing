<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias's luminous ache and sage intuition give steady interior tension, but the emotional arc stays more observational than active; choices feel guided by fate rather than his flaws driving irreversible change.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure hinges on the leaf cue enabling the clock reset, a tidy causal twist, yet the final image doesn't reconfigure the core rule-set or impose unforeseen cost—everything lands a little too symmetrically.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Setting is vividly tactile—the rattling girders, frost rim, and vines ground every beat; micro-setting constraints (canted workbench, leaf spray) actively pressure tactics and charge the leaf-solution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Stakes tighten around the ever-shrinking launch window, but pressure remains external (quakes, clock); Elias’s agency feels mostly technical, with no unexpected ethical or relational dividend.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Harnessing the ephemeral becomes both aesthetic wonder and existential debt; the theme resonates through the clock’s blur-to-tick and the probe’s vanishing streak, giving texture to transience without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is calm, lyrical, and uniquely filtered through Elias’s sensorial bias (“lenses like polished obsidian,” “luminous ache”); rhythm modulates with tremor crescendos and leaf-fall hush.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dense, compressed sentences accelerate under tremors; occasional purple flourishes (“stratospheric veil”) are forgivable because they serve atmospheric propulsion and don’t obscure causality.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>The cosmic-repairman archetype is given fresh gravitational stakes, but the premise’s escape-velocity twist feels concept rather than character-driven; synthesis is elegant, not radical.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>His sage decisions (clock rebuild, launch timing) drive two beats with visible stress scars; yet the internal ache is more reported than enacted through micro-choice friction.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Clock hand appears as frenetic blur, returns as purposeful tick, and the micro-grooves of its fall’s rhythm restructure the escapement wheel—each appearance changes options and meaning.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Escape velocity frames stakes (32 km/s or doom) and shapes final probe trajectory; the concept is more than theme—it narrows Elias’s tactics and outcome.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Changelessly constant motion constrains him—endless spin mocks measure until leaf rhythm imposes order, exacting the cost of lost time and missed chances.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Restructuring the clock is the single causal action that converts chaotic whirl to precise tick; without it, probe and closure collapse—irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Leaf-fall sound is seeded in quiet atrium, then etched into escapement micro-grooves—setup, development, payoff gate all met—mechanics directly enable the spin-to-tick control.</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Lunar observatory’s trembling girders and frost-rimmed windows pressure pace; micro-setting (angled workbench, leaf detachment) alters Elias’s final micro-groove adjustment.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>6.1</grade>
<comment>Quakes obliterate the clock countdown, tightening the launch window, but time pressure is mostly structural rather than tracked minute-to-minute.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Elias’s desire to capture “ephemeral whispers” is dramatized through obsessive clock meddling and the probe sacrifice, turning abstract ache into concrete risk.</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>“Luminous ache” modulates from wonder (auroras) to bittersweet sting (knowledge of loss) and infuses every image; tone charges the final probe streak with elegiac glow.</comment>
