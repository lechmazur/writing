<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara’s survivor-cunning and “virtuously mischievous” streak are shown through her decision to play along with the quantum messages rather than reject them; the embodied moment of tightening the bolt crystallizes her hierarchy of values. Interiority stays concrete, but the text drifts into label-speak (“quantum promise,” “communal wealth”) that blurs contradiction under peak pressure. Motivation tightens to the beat, yet the cost feels conceptual rather than visceral, capping short of 8+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: scam-scar wariness → curiosity → bolt action → diamond birth. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the farm literally converts pressure into shared gems, cost visible in the vent’s groan and her single talisman diamond. One seamless scene, anchors clear by 60 words; no orientation debt. The turn is singular but decisive; no loops or amnesia.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The mushroom cavern’s pressure, azure glow, and repurposed-sub bolt form a micro-setting that directly enables the climax; the bolt’s re-use as harness is tactile and stakes-bearing. Sensory detail is selective—humid air, groaning vent—filtered through Elara’s miner-farmer competence. Spatial choreography stays clean; no white-room lapse. Final diamond lattice charges the image under Charged Poise, meeting 9- gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“turn past scam-pressure into communal value”—is signaled early and tightened once when she threads the bolt, foreclosing refusal. Escalation is causal and singular: pressure → compression → diamond birth. The price (vent strain, personal risk) is legible; luck complicates rather than rescues. Meets 8-band; higher would require a second option foreclosed or more visceral cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: predatory pressure inverted into collective wealth. The bolt-mushroom-diamond triad reweights “pyramid” from exploitation to shared uplift without moralizing. Final image reframes prior scam trauma as generative, leaving plausible ambiguity about future seams. No thematic echo in final paragraph; resonance is imagistic, earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elara’s miner-honed perceptual lens; syntactic rhythm compresses under pressure (“Heart pounding with shadowseam wonder…”). No head-hopping; diction stays within her plausible lexicon aside from fleeting abstract nouns. Voice distinguishes itself through bioluminescent-miner idiom; no dialogue to test. Tense stable; no filter-verb bloat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose carries momentum: varied sentence length, strong verbs (“twisted the bolt free,” “funnelled through”). Occasional elevated phrasing (“submerged histories,” “quantum veil”) risks register drift but stays consistent with concept-manifest world. No loops, paraphrase, or scaffold. Metaphors remain coherent; closure image sharp.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: scam-survivor ethos + concept-physics + bioluminescent agri-tech yields a singular mini-myth. The submarine bolt’s re-purposing crystallizes the inversion trope in a tactile, non-obvious way. Risky world rule (ideas → matter) is committed to fully and lands cleanly. Could edge 9+ with more idiosyncratic personal detail.</comment>
