<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Eliza’s synesthetic interiority is vivid and specific; her grief is embodied in “silence that tasted of ash.” The ghost’s hunger for an encore is clear, yet his sudden pivot to mentor role feels lightly motivated—no contradiction or cost inside the relationship is dramatized. Micro-choices (taking the coin, mirroring the dance) track, but the final emotional lift is voiced rather than earned through visible trade-off. Still, her flaw (escapist nostalgia) complicates the choice and remains unresolved, satisfying “earned stasis.”</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: despair → breach → coin → shared dance → possible mending. Closure is a Charged Poise: possibilities “flickered like fireflies,” re-weighting future options with conceptual cost—the ghost’s hunger sated, her despair deferred but not erased. One soft spot: the tarot coin’s rule-set is exposited, not tested under pressure; it hums but never constrains. Orientation is clean by 120 words; single scene, single transition (hedge → orchard), lens stays Causal.</comment>

<comment>Orchard garden is rendered through synesthetic filters—“tongue painted with sweet memories”—so setting doubles as emotional gauge. Spatial choreography is tight: gap, yew walls, lantern-lit clearing, all tracked without drift. Environment actively steers choice: glow-fruit and lanterns supply the stage for the spectral duet. While no object is weaponized at the end, the lanterns’ indigo after-image recharges the coin’s glow, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—lure possibility from despair—is signaled early and tightened once: the dance literally brightens futures. Agency is collaborative but real; each echoing footfall forecloses permanent exit from the garden. Cost is conceptual (she binds herself to a looping phantom circuit) rather than tangible; still legible under short-form lens. A second reversal or material price would push it higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of art-as-survival emerges through image, not thesis: echoes, encores, synesthetic stage-light memories. Nostalgia is treated as both sedative and snare—ambiguity stays intact. Final image of “intertwined echoes” reweights earlier “ash-tasting silence” without moralizing. Ghost’s vaudeville era never becomes nostalgic set-dressing; it refracts Eliza’s present fracture.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited clings to Eliza’s synesthetic register—“sounds blooming into colors”—without purple spillover. Ghost’s diction is distinct: “You’ve come at the witching hour,” cadenced, performative. No head-hopping; his interior access is filtered through her perception. Micro-shifts in sentence rhythm mirror dance accelerando, keeping psychic distance steady.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Most sentences carry double duty (sense + motion + backstory). Occasional perfume/taste pairing risks minor metaphor stack but stops short of clutter. No scaffold loops; pronoun tracking clean. One strained simultaneity: “As they moved together, her steps mirroring his...” could split for sequence clarity. Overall propulsion survives, closure image unmarred.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Synesthetic grief meeting a vaudeville ghost in a moon-lit maze orchard is fresh, yet both tropes are recognizable; fusion and micro-detail (tarot coin as tactile patch-cord between eras) supply transformation. Timeline fracture is more theme label than dramatized mechanism, curbing ingenuity. Risk is moderate—lyric causality, not high-concept twist—but execution commits fully. Stays within 8.5 ceiling because concept doesn’t deepen past metaphor.</comment>
