<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied, but her “stoic wonder” is more asserted than dramatized; the sextant fragment nudges her curiosity yet never forces a hard choice with visible cost, so the arc feels gentle rather than crucible-tested.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the terminal’s lights revive, re-weighting the ruin into possibility. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each airflow tweak is legible—but the cost is atmospheric rather than personal, keeping it just shy of 8.8.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The terminal is evoked with tactile specificity—peeling murals, dormant vents, brass sextant glinting—each detail filtering through Elara’s engineering gaze. The setting actively constrains her tactics and charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate for environment-as-tool.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>A single dominant stake—breathe life back into the dead terminal—escalates via incremental airflow redirections. Pressure tightens, but the price is largely infrastructural; a more visceral personal trade-off would push it higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of renewal-through-precise-attention emerges organically from Elara’s engineering ethos; the sextant’s obsolete star charts quietly reprise as “equations for hope.” Subtext avoids sermon, ending on an image that reweights the premise without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Voice is consistent, textured, and filtered through Elara’s methodical perception; occasional lyrical compression (“time’s indifferent tide”) is purposeful. No head-hopping or register drift, though a few abstract phrases edge toward the poetic.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; figurative language is selective. Minor scaffold (“like a familiar cloak,” “like reluctant farewells”) slightly dulls immediacy but never clutters the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>The fusion of obsolete celestial navigation with modern airflow modeling feels fresh; the ruin-to-rebirth arc is familiar but executed with specific engineering detail that resists cliché. Risk is moderate—no structural daring—yet the synthesis is memorable.</comment>
