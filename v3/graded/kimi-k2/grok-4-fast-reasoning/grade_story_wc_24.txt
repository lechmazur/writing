<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elias’s solitary obsession is credibly salt-etched into callused ritual, and the backward-count choice is a clean micro-turn that externalizes his need. Yet the interiority drifts into thematic abstraction—“gnawing need,” “razor edges of existence”—that sounds like author commentary rather than a shepherd’s lived language, muting contradiction at the hinge beat. The final smile is too light to register as felt cost; we see realization but no bodily price after the blood drop. Still, within single-POV brevity he does foreclose his former clock-winder identity, satisfying the low-word Earned Stasis bar.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The causal spine is simple but intact: whistle → alone → key → reverse-count → sun climbs → insight. Orientation is swift and spatially steady; no lens ambiguity. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—“clocks measure the quiet cuts”—with the fjord image reweighting premise, but the only on-page cost is a pin-prick of blood that feels slight against the cosmic claim; hence not quite 8+ territory. Still, the reversal beat is dramatized, not summarized, and no logistical seams show.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The brass key’s micro-grooves, the unnatural bubble rise, and the horizon knife-line all tether abstract time to tactile specifics; the station’s stone and brass remain constant without tourist clutter. Most detail is filtered through Elias’s professional eye—degrees, valves, salt-stiff beard—so environment constrains procedure. Only lapse: “sun inching upward in jerky pulses” is visually vague and weakens the peak illusion. Otherwise setting supplies both mood and the final charged image, clearing the 9+ gate test.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—“what do clocks actually measure?”—is declared early and tightened once: the forbidden reversal of flow. Agency is present, but external risk is absent; no ship, supervisor, or natural threat responds to his tampering, so cost stays internal. The reversal does reconfigure his epistemic stance, satisfying the lens, yet pressure plateaus after the first backward click; escalation is a single step, not a rising curve. Sufficient for 600-word scale but not punching into high-cost band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through water, blades, and horizon folds without moralizing; the final “quiet cuts” re-prices earlier imagery. The notion that time slices illusion rather than duration is dramatized via the physical rewind, not narrated. One thematic echo—“razor edges” repeated in identical phrasing near close—edges toward statement, but the fjord hush re-absorbs it. Complexity is present but stays cerebral; reader after-effect is contemplative, not bruised.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person stays anchored to Elias’s sensorium: salt-stiff beard, slurp of valves, grooved key biting skin. Syntax lengthens in calms, fragments under reversal—“bubbles rising in defiance of gravity”—creating rhythm tied to pulse. No head-hops; diction never exceeds a weathered technician’s register. One soft spot: distant “lap of waves far below” is stock phrasing amid otherwise crisp noticing, keeping it shy of 9+.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</question>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty—action + sensation—without scaffold; no loops or synonyms clutter the arc. Metaphors stay consistent (water, blades, fjord) and physically coherent. Only micro-overwrite: “burnished paths” and “glass-waters” in the same gaze beat slightly layer luster. Otherwise clean, propulsive, and read-aloud rhythmic; closure image unmarred.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The water-clock rewind is conceptually fresh and grows organically from the shepherd’s mundane task; trope is transformed through embodied procedure rather than magic bolt. Specificity of Norwegian fjord station, hydraulic charts, and whistle routine anchors novelty. Risk is moderate—lyric reversal rather than action set-piece—but coherent to scale. Could edge higher if a concrete consequence (leak, crack, exile threat) had nailed the cost.</comment>
