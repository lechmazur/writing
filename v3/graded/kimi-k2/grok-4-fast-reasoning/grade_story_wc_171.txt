<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—peace broker who profits from endless war—surfaces only in generic “price” abstractions; no embodied micro-choice leaks her own blood or forfeits a concrete privilege. The clipboard-ceremony moment is graceful, but her renunciation is reported, not dramatized, so the cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt. Still, her “operatively gentle” tactic shapes the final beat, earning a solid mid-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—Elara’s voice fades, the accords now the leaders’ to break—but the causality is soft: the ritual’s binding power is asserted, not tested, so the “unbreakable” claim feels like fiat. Orientation is quick and spatial choreography clean, yet the single scene never narrows options under a because/therefore arc; pressure plateaus after the signatures rather than tightening.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The terrace’s rose-quartz altar, scented herbs, and celestial mechanics are vividly filtered through Elara’s ritual priorities, guiding her gestures and timing. Weather and astronomy tighten the deadline, turning the sky into a live constraint that forces the final quill strokes. While the valley fires are distant, the sensory triangulation of stone, smoke, and moonlight anchors the stakes without clutter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—will the leaders sign under the sky-dance—is signaled early, but the only escalation is their hesitation; no new obstacle or revealed cost raises the ante. The blood-ink quill is atmospheric, not tactical; it doesn’t alter Elara’s approach or limit retreat. Peace is achieved without a visible price paid by the protagonist on the page, leaving pressure static.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>“Redemption demands its price” emerges through ritual accords rather than sermon, but the abstract refrain is voiced twice, edging toward prompt-echo. The flawed marble/ flawed peace image reprises effectively in the final silver eclipse, letting theme resonate without moralizing. Complexity is present—peace is fragile, negotiator erased—but the leaders’ sudden camaraderie feels tidy.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person lyrical mode sustains a controlled, incantatory cadence that mirrors ritual pacing; diction stays within Elara’s ceremonial lexicon. No head-hopping; perception remains anchored to her filtered attention. Occasional elevated phrases—“etched against the velvet sky”—border purple, yet the pattern is taught early and paid off in the final hush, preserving coherence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm is deliberate, almost liturgical; sentence variety supports the ritual crescendo without monotony. Information density is high—smoke, herbs, celestial motion woven through action. A few stacked epithets (“weathered stones whispered of empires long crumbled”) flirt with excess, but no mixed metaphors or loops obstruct clarity at the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The “forever-war peace negotiator” trope is familiar, yet the celestial ritual-binding angle refreshes it with cosmological stakes anchored in shamanic detail. Specifics—lavender smoke, blood-ink, twin-moon eclipse—lift the piece above generic treaty scenes. Absence of a personal betrayal or innovative twist keeps it short of memorable transformation; risk level is moderate.</comment>
