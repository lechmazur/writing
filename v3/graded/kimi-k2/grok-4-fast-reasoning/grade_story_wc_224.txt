<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elowen's contradictory impulses—burying sight to escape pain, yet driven to reclaim home—are embodied in mercury-glass flesh and micro-choices (feather on stone). The arc from suppression to architect of memory is earned, culminating in a visible cost: she accepts the thunder of loss as engine rather than wound.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final map of home is “eternally forming,” reconfiguring options without erasing cost. Causal chain holds—stone awakens gift → feather decodes language → inscription seeds reality—each step narrowing possibilities until stance crystallizes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The mountain-bookstore’s veins and frost-capped stacks constrain movement and supply the obsidian crevice; the alcove’s lantern-light versus storm-belly thunder charges the final image. Environment, body (quicksilver eyes), and tool (stone) together shape tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—reclaim home’s shape—tightens when each decoded glyph forecloses denial of war’s destruction. Escalation is textural: memories intensify until the only remaining option is to integrate, not escape, the pain.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the tension between memory as wound and memory as architecture; the ending’s “fractal of memory and myth” offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext hums in the stone’s pulse and the feather’s whisper.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is liquid metal: shifting yet coherent, with perceptual signature in “mercury beads on glass” and “fold where loss meets longing.” No head-hopping; compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and propulsive—no loops or scaffold. Figurative language (“thunder grumbled distantly, hidden in the mountain’s belly”) is precise, never muddled, and accelerates toward the charged final cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of seer, stone, and bookstore-mountain feels inevitable; the risk of substituting reality with memory pays off without gimmickry. Fresh inflection: home as “eternally forming” fractal rather than recovered Eden.</comment>
