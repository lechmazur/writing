<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s interior contradiction—pragmatic craftsman vs. dream-chaser—is embodied in every micro-choice (breath-sync, shard placement). The “runaway dream” is never labeled but enacted; his groundedness anchors the vision without therapy-speak. Cost is felt when fog thins and the orchard’s decay fuses with glass peaks. One slip: the dream’s origin is summarized rather than dramatized, blunting the inciting wound.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the repaired sextant now frames infinite worlds, the orchard’s ruin re-cast as foothills. Causal chain—storm loss → sextant find → breath-sync repair—tightens without gaps. Orientation is immediate; time and place crystallize in “twilight frost.” No teleporting props; every shard and breath earns the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The ruined orchard is not backdrop but pressure: fog limits vision, frost refracts light into the glass-mountain vision. The sextant’s brass and cracked mirrors become micro-setting that constrains repair angles. Sensory hierarchy favors touch and glint over exposition. One minor drift: “centuries of thick fog” is abstract; the rest is tactile.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reclaim the lost dream—escalates via breath-by-breath agency. Each exhale narrows options until the orchard dissolves into mirrored infinity. Cost is the irreversible fusion of decay and vision; no external antagonist needed. Coincidence (finding the sextant) complicates, does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: the boundary between ruin and transcendence is permeable only through disciplined craft. The glass mountains reappear as earned metaphor, not symbol pasted on. Final image reweights the orchard’s decay as necessary substrate for infinity. No moralizing; resonance is visceral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is crystalline, slightly archaic, mirroring Elias’s meticulous craft. Free indirect style stays close to his perception without head-hop. Syntax lengthens and compresses with breath rhythm. One filter-verb cluster (“seemed to part”) softens a peak beat, else flawless.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet aerated: “frost’s gleam turned the fog into a veil of fractured light” does triple sensory work. No loops, no mixed metaphors. Strategic telling compresses backstory in two lines. Only micro-slip: “runaway dream had escaped him” is near-paraphrase of earlier clause.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fusion of sextant, mirror shards, and breath-work is non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight. Orchard-as-foothill inversion feels freshly earned. Risky lyric compression pays off in the final cadence. No stock tropes; even “glass mountains” is re-forged from literal fragments.</comment>
