<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s synesthetic gift and monastic purpose are vividly interiorized; the amber sheet and mallet become extensions of her will. Yet her only real choice—when to strike—remains a single beat, so the “hierarchy of values” is more stated than tested. The smile at the end feels slightly unearned because no contradictory impulse ever jeopardizes her quest. Still, the embodied sensorium keeps her from abstraction and lifts the score above mid-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the cracked statue reweights “wonder” from private obsession to publicly restored marvel, cost visible in the dimming amber sheet. Accumulative lens holds: each bell-layer adds chromatic density until the hush flips to resonance. Causality is metaphoric yet internally coherent—no teleporting props or retro-fixes. The icescape anchors by ~80 words, well inside the safe window.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Ice cavern, prismatic bells, and auroral bleed function as one micro-lab that physically constrains timbre and color; the translucent score literally refracts the light needed for the final key. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—only Elara’s chromatic hearing matters—so detail never becomes tourist wallpaper. The statue’s emergence is spatially coherent, tracked from boulder to revealed form. Environment directly charges the final image; no cap applied.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“certify wonder as essential”—is signaled early and answered when the statue’s eyes prove marvel tangible. Pressure escalates by accretion: each bell thickens chromatic density until silence must yield; no external antagonist needed. The tightening is singular but unmistakable: the third scarlet spiral forces the crack. Cost is conceptual yet legible: the amber sheet expires, signifying irretrievable expenditure of craft.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through color-into-sound alchemy rather than thesis: wonder is framed as a civic utility, not luxury. The final image of star-eyed ice-woman offers non-literal rebuttal to “encroaching gray” without sermon. Subtext resides in negative space—the sculpted hush—whose flip to resonance reconfigures meaning. One fleeting line—“prove wonder essential”—verges on echo, but its placement mid-story and immediate embodiment keep it from moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person omniscient stays locked to Elara’s synesthetic bandwidth; diction skews to shimmer, fracture, refraction—precisely her perceptual lexicon. Sentence rhythm lengthens and contracts with bell-cycles, creating an audible cadence. No dialogue, so voice distinction clause is waived. Density of chromatic verbs never tips into purple because every metaphor is filtered through her sensory synapses.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm is bell-varied; no template cadence or synonym churn detected. Figurative strings remain coherent under the chromatic system—no mixed vehicles. Information density high: one sentence often carries light, sound, and emotional valence. Minor scaffold: “oscillating repose” is repeated without new incremental charge, a hairline slip that keeps the score just below 9.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Synesthetic alchemy fused with sculptural negative space yields a fresh angle on the “awaken the numb world” trope. The aurora-as-psychedelic-metronome risks familiarity, but its refraction through quartz bells specificizes the device. Risk is taken: a climax that is literally a color chord cracking stone, yet causality is taught early and pays off. Transformation test passes—remove the chromatic mechanics and the story collapses.</comment>
