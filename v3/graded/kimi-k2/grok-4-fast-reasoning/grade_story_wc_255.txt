<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias’s color-blind painter trait is dramatized in his search for “imperfection’s beauty,” but internal conflict stays static—no contradictory impulse is shown mid-beat. The final exchange feels generous rather than costly because Elias never visibly risks or forfeits anything he values. Thorne’s half-dream state is evocative, yet his awakening is supplied by the reed, not by a choice that costs him on-page. Relationship pressure is hinted but never crystallizes into a mutual crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the reed’s chord re-weights both men’s creative sight with conceptual cost. Causal chain is present (plant glyphs → consent → joint crafting → reed exchange), yet the critical “barter” beat is narrated as fait accompli rather than dramatized choice, softening agency. Orientation is clean within the word window. Accumulation lens holds, but one tightening only, so entry 8-band is missed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Courtyard glass, furnace echoes, and phoenix glass-shard soil provide tactile, POV-filtered anchors that guide what can be broken or built. Micro-setting (the reed fragment) constrains the final instrument shape and therefore the closing sound-exchange, meeting the 9+ gate. Selective sensory triage favors touch and reflected light over visual color—economical for a color-blind lens. Occasional static tableau sentences stall motion, keeping the score below 8.5.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover Thorne’s traded clarity—surfaces early and tightens once when Elias proposes the reed-in-glass build. The tightening is intellectually clear but lacks a visceral price paid on-page (lost time, broken piece, social risk), so escalation feels moderate. Agency is shared, diffusing pressure. Closure reconfigures stakes, satisfying lens, yet the cost is more conceptual than felt, capping entry into the 8 band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme of “beauty in flaw” emerges through glass bubbles and warped concertina panels, avoiding explicit thesis. Subtext operates in the plant lexicon and the unspoken fear of further loss. Final chord re-prices imperfection as mutual salvation, giving resonant non-verbal answer. A trace of writerly self-commentary (“This motivation drove him…”) slightly over-articulates intent, holding the score short of 8.5.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lush yet restrained third-person hovers near Elias’s color-blind perception, favoring texture over hue. Syntax lengthens during calm observation, then compresses for the reed-activation beat, showing rhythmic control. No head-hop; Thorne’s interior is inferred only through Elias’s read of posies, preserving distance. Occasional elevated diction (“iridescent glass shards,” “ethereal glass concertina”) edges above Elias’s plausible lexicon, a minor register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Strong noun-verb economy; sentences carry double duty (action + atmosphere). Figurative control keeps metaphor consistent with heat/light/glass scheme. One paraphrase loop detected (“glass sculptures caught…/glass sculptures sing”) and a mild filter-verb cluster, but artifacts do not touch the closing cadence, so 8+ stands. Final sentence lands on image, not exposition, satisfying read-aloud test.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fusing color-blind painting, phoenix ash-glass, and botanical cryptography yields a fresh angle on post-catastrophe barter economies. The “traded enlightenment” currency is conceptually bold and followed to logical endpoint. Risk resides in the lyric plant-code, which could have read as twee but is grounded through workmanship detail. Some phoenix imagery nudges familiar iconography, yet the glass reed concertina repurposes it memorably.</comment>
