<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The keeper’s “witness without judgment” motive is concrete and drives every beat; his trembling hands and loosening grip on reality embody contradiction under pressure. Yet his interiority recycles phrasing (“loosely gripped,” “regenerative silence”) without fresh micro-choices once the swan is found—observation stays static, so the final endurance costs him little we can feel.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the obsidian refuge crystallizes options—he can keep witnessing, now healed by silence—cost legible in the buried library above. Accumulative lens holds: each lyrical shard adds density until the final image reweights the stake. Orientation anchors within 120 words; only the swan’s first appearance could be cued a beat earlier.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Sensory triage favors decaying ink, damp earth, and obsidian gloss—details filtered through the keeper’s archivist eye. Micro-setting of the swan’s paper creases constrains the tunneling action; the river’s murmur charges the final silence. Spatial track stays clean from catacomb to refuge; no geography drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving witness without judgment—tightens when the swan offers an exit from decay; refusal to ascend fully costs the library itself, felt on-page. Escalation is textural: each fold adds hush, each meter tunneled increases stakes for the ledger. No reversal, yet deepening suffices under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from decay-to-silence arc: knowledge erodes, witness endures. The origami swan’s return as altar-pattern reweights earlier decay, achieving resonance without statement. Final image avoids moral; silence as healing concept is repriced, not preached.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyric third-person hovers at keeper’s shoulder, diction archaic-leaning (“untold seasons,” “fissuring peace”) yet consistent. Rhythm modulates: long cadence for catacomb drift, clipped fragments during tunneling. No head-hop; patterned elision (“drift of untold seasons”) is taught early and paid off in final compression.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence openings avoid template runs. Dense metaphor clusters occur but serve the hush motif and do not stall beats. One paraphrase loop: “regenerative silence” thrice in four lines mid-text; minor. No mixed metaphors or register drift in peak beats; closure line is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Archive-into-volcanic-sanctuary pairing feels fresh; swan-as-map avoids stock quest object. Concept of silence as restorative force flips usual apocalypse-to-action arc. Risk is moderate—lyric stasis over plot—but coherence holds. Could swap names yet decay-to-witness core would remain distinctive.</comment>
