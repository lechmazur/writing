<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid, embodied, and specific; flaws (iron-grip vs. vulnerability) drive key beats and charge the ending’s renunciation. The earned stasis—yielding instead of guarding—feels inevitable and costly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single, continuous causal lens: driftwood markers → flute trial → insight harvest → closure. One meaningful tightening turns control into acceptance; the before/after change is legible and satisfying.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Granite spires, canyon hush, sun-bleached driftwood: each environmental detail constrains navigation or supplies ritual markers. The range becomes a crucible that pressures tactics and re-weights the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Pressure grows from failing guardianship → need for insight → flute trial narrowing options. The unresolved tear and insight cost escalate clearly; coincidence never rescues.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Failure as growth engine: rigid guardianship must become vulnerable partnership. Theme is dramatized, not stated; the ending’s quiet hush offers a resonant, non-literal reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Vivid perceptual signature—“avalanchingly quiet,” “granite spires swallowed echoes.” Syntax modulates with breath; no head-hopping; narrative stance stays intimate and specific.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Rhythm accelerates through flute trial; metaphors are selective and purposeful. Zero loops, no purple muddle; read-aloud cadence matches stakes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Ancient relic + quiet-canyon magic yields fresh angle: failure as weaving tool. Not merely fantasy set dressing; the synthesis of “yielding as guardianship” feels non-obvious yet inevitable.</comment>
