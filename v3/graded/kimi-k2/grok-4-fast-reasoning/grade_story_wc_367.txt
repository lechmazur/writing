<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The Herald’s lone-puppet mastery keeps agency clear, but interiority stays cosmic-superhero generic (“shadowed elation,” “joy at creation’s edge”) rather than embodied; no bodily sensation contradicts the grand mood. His final laugh/self-extinguish counts as a renunciation with cost, yet the prophecy-of-his-fade is reported, not felt through trembling grip or frayed breath. Still, single-POV discipline holds and micro-steers map motive-to-action. Enough for mid-band credibility, short of lived-in contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Charged Poise: extinguishing the lantern crystallizes his obsolescence and seeds the unnamed girl’s dawn, cost visible in the dimming glass. Accumulative/Textural lens rules—density of light/shadow imagery tightens meaning rather than causal chains—yet the piece teaches its pattern early (laugh-storm, wick-prism) and holds it to the last line. Orientation anchor is late (~160 w) but deliberate disorientation pays off in the final star-sea merger, so waived penalty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Emerald lighthouse, sea-glass walls, and the lantern’s internal-reflection physics are tactile, selective, and return to shape tactics; the wick’s prism literally bends shadows that temper the storm, meeting high-band “tool-as-setting” test. Stars/salt wind are sensory but never catalogued; each detail is filtered through the Herald’s storm-attuned gaze. Spatial choreography holds across the single tower scene. Environment constrains the final choice—extinguish or release—cementing 8.5.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“shape a new dawn from ancient shadows”—is signaled early; pressure deepens through each pulse of accidental prophecy that warns of his own erasure, tightening stakes without external antagonist. One meaningful intensification suffices for 600-word lyric-accumulative design: the vision of the girl externalizes consequence and narrows his option to relinquish control. Cost is conceptual (self-dissolution) rather than visceral, capping entry to 7.0.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges entirely through image-shift: shadows move from destructive relics to life-giving rain, re-weighting “ancient” into fertile ground for post-print rebirth. No explicit thesis; final “cycle turned, steered by reflections unseen” offers open, resonant reconfiguration. Herald’s laughter-as-thunder motif returns charged with self-extinction, satisfying 9+ gate. Only hairline slip: “poison of forgotten headlines” veers toward editorial nudge.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person keeps psychic distance stable; kaleidoscopic diction (“salt-kissed winds,” “frozen bolt of lightning”) feels authored yet consistent with a mythic-weathered consciousness. Rhythm swells and contracts with lantern pulses, teaching an accumulative cadence early and paying it off in the hushed dim-out. No dialogue to test; internal voice remains singular and un-wavering, earning high-band control.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; clauses mirror tidal rise/fall. Dense metaphor is purposeful—storm-herald’s worldview—yet occasional stacks (“verdant promise against the encroaching void”) flirt with purple without muddling causality. No loops or paraphrase detected; pronoun/tense clean. One strained phrase—“laughter bubbled up, a shadowed elation that masked the sorrow”—leans abstract, holding score below 9.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fusing lighthouse keeper with storm-comic demigod and post-journalism elegy yields fresh mythic substrate; internal-reflection optics repurposed as fate-prism is inventive rather than gimmick. Accidental-prophecy twist on obsolescence avoids tidy moral. Specificity of “last print newspaper” grounds universality. Slight risk of romanticized trope-cloud, but particularized details (sea-glass architecture, starlight ignition) transform it.</comment>
