<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s claustrophobia is embodied in ragged breaths and tightening corridors; his vow to the unremembered is dramatized by the codex micro-choice. Interiority stays concrete—no therapy-speak. The final renunciation (codex dissolution) costs him the relic and his mentor’s promise, earning closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single continuous scene anchored by hatch-to-core progression; causality is tight—each beat (hatch, corridor, chamber, console) narrows options. Closure lands as a Decisive Change: codex dissolves, spectral scientists released, Elias exits. Cost is visible in the codex’s luminous loss and his altered stance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Submerged 1950s facility is tactile—rust, brine, warped walls—filtered through Elias’s spelunker eye. The undersea cables thrum beneath, constraining the phase-transition timing. Micro-setting (collapsing console, domed chamber) directly shapes the final activation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—honor the forgotten—signaled early and tightened by tidal clock. One meaningful escalation: codex activation forces irreversible choice. Cost is the codex itself and the spectral release; agency is Elias’s hand on the console.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of remembrance emerges from the codex’s gold flecks and cable ghosts; no explicit moralizing. Final image—cables now singing with restored names—offers resonant Conceptual Repricing. Subtext in the “crashing hush” modulates from menace to elegy.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias; perceptual signature is spelunker-tight—walls “swallowing him whole.” No head-hopping. Rhythm flexes with panic: short clauses under pressure, longer cadences in reflection.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet clear: “gold flecks catching his light like stars in ink” does triple duty—image, character awe, foreshadowing. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances. Figurative language is controlled, never muddling causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: 1950s undersea cable lab + illuminated codex + spectral data rescue. Risky phase-transition tech is grounded in era-appropriate pseudo-science. The forgotten scientists’ digital resurrection feels inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
