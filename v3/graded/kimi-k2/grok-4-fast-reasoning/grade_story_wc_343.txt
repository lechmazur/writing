<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara’s curiosity is vivid—she “cross-references the symbols” with a “dog-eared” phrasebook—but interior contradiction is missing; we never feel her fear of error or envy of the laughing crew, so the final triumph feels preordained rather than earned under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: starling murmuration → vague tip → deliberate descent → cipher cracked → tomorrow’s course reset. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the airship’s tilt externalizes the irreversible commitment and foreshadows the volatile aura cost, satisfying the lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The brass railing, creaking timbers, and lantern-lit dust motes are filtered through map-maker priorities; the hopscotch plank micro-setting constrains her posture and discoveries, charging the final coordinate grid. Only the starlings remain scenic; they never physically redirect the ship, capping the score below 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Stakes tighten once: idle relic becomes risky luminance hunt. The warning about “volatile aura” raises cost, but no immediate tactical trade-off (fuel, time, crew safety) is priced on the page, so pressure intensifies conceptually rather than viscerally.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Theme—lonely scholarship as bridge to communion—emerges through the hopscotch-to-map transformation; yet the closing “shared horizon” is stated more than dramatized, muting the resonance that would reach 8+.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-limited stays tight; perceptual signature is cartographic—“grid,” “coordinates,” “etch”—and rhythmic control lengthens sentences during discovery, then clips them at the tilt. No dialogue to distort voice; free-indirect slips are absent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lush but disciplined: each metaphor (living inkblots, hidden veins) advances the map motif. Occasional stacked modifiers—“sociable isolation,” “forgotten storage hold”—slow momentum; paraphrase loops absent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Hopscotch-as-cipher reframes a child’s game into astral waypoint; starling murmuration as living map legend feels fresh. Risk is moderate—relic hunt aboard airship is familiar scaffolding—but derivation is transformed through cartographic specificity.</comment>
