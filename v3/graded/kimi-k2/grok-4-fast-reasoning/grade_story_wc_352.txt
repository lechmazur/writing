<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elara’s obsessive curiosity is vivid through ink-stained fingers and the “latent blaze” refrain, but interiority leans on abstract labels (“prism-minded”) rather than contradictory impulses acted out in scene; the final ascent is motivated yet cost is asserted, not embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: doodle → grotto → inversion → seeds; orientation is swift; closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—she bears seeds whose vigilance price is implied. Still, gravity inversion solves access rather than testing a fresh choice, so cost feels inherited, not personally forged.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The grotto’s mist, rune-hum, and ceiling-floor flip anchor every move; the doodle’s glow and floating stones track cleanly. Environment directly enables the vertical climb that wins the prize, satisfying the 9+ gate, though a single sensory overload paragraph drifts toward purple.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes—“find forgotten combinations or world balance frays”—are declared, then dramatized when inversion opens the maze and seeds become tangible. One meaningful tightening occurs at the zero-G moment that converts danger into opportunity; price (future vigilance burden) is legible but not yet felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Emergent theme of custodial vigilance grows from doodle to seed without sermon; “latent blaze” motif migrates from personal zeal to world-guarding burden. Ending image of pocketed seeds reframes prior archive fever into stewardship, earning quiet resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person stays close to Elara’s synesthetic cognition; diction (“serpentine,” “prism-minded”) forms a consistent optic lexicon. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk zero; rhythmic control heightens during weightless climb, then exhales cleanly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Figurative strings frequent but purposeful; occasional twin metaphors (“fractured knowledge into rainbows…hidden spectra”) slightly blur. No loops, tenses clean; final line “fire within burned brighter” is earned callback, not scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Margin-doodle-as-map and gravity-flip cavern fuse archive mystery with physics wonder, feeling fresh; yet “seeds of vigilance” echo familiar world-tree failsafes. Specificity of prism-cognition and rune-hum lifts the piece above convention.</comment>
