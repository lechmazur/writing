<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—prudence vs. daring—are embodied in her tactile snow-search and the micro-choice to kneel at the bluff’s edge; the reunion with Marcus crystallizes a cost (shared betrayal) that reconfigures their bond. Interiority is specific, never diagnostic. The pillbox and codes act as extensions of her psyche, not props.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the lattice carved in snow and the pillbox offered to Marcus visibly foreclose isolation and reopen partnership. Causal linkage holds—return because of betrayal, stay because of shared evidence. Orientation is anchored by the second paragraph; no drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zephyr Bluff’s mist, snow, and thawing scent constrain every move—kneeling risks exposure, wind erases traces—charging the final image of two figures re-etching codes together. Micro-setting (the pillbox’s silver surface) doubles as emotional barometer. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reclaiming agency after betrayal—tightens when the spiral coordinates demand physical risk and trust. One decisive deepening: offering the pillbox to Marcus narrows options from lone redemption to joint reckoning. Cost is the reopened wound of shared treason.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of renewal through shared fracture emerges from the thawing earth and the mended cipher; no explicit statement. The pillbox’s shift from narcotic to evidence embodies the conceptual repricing. Ambiguity lingers—will exposure heal or destroy them—without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elara’s perceptual signature—“silver hush,” “zephyrs danced”—with rhythmic compression under pressure. No head-hopping; Marcus’s interiority is inferred through gesture and silence. Dialogue is sparse, subtext-heavy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language (“mist clung like forgotten whispers”) is purposeful and paid off in the final lattice. Sentence variety mirrors emotional ebb and surge.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The burned-spy-returning-to-abandoned-cipher premise is familiar, but the integration of snow-code mechanics and the pillbox-as-vessel gives it fresh specificity. The final image—two former partners re-etching a broken cipher—feels inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
