<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Kai’s numbness-driven motive is explicit and constant; the micro-choice to merge with the duplicate is credible, embodied, and paid for with instant emotional torrent. No contradictory interior beats undercut him, and the closing crack of feeling proves the arc. However, his pre-dojo past is delivered in explanatory blocks rather than triggered memory, muting the interior contradiction that could have lifted this into the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: numbness → ritual merge → clone vivified → feeling restored, each step forcing the next with visible cost (blade activation, containment breach, identity blur). History-rewind chaos is kept off-stage so the single-scene ritual stays coherent; jar’s containment field shatter supplies the decisive physical pivot that externalizes the internal change. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the twin’s first gaze re-weights every prior empty breath of wind. Minor elasticity in “history loops” rule-set is never contradicted on page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Wind-carved stone, levitating crystals, and suspended nutrient fluid are tactile, selective, and filtered through Kai’s sensory anesthesia. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly across the single continuous set-piece; only two objects move—blade and jar—and their positions never blur. The dojo’s micro-setting (pedestal, field, crystals) directly constrains the merge act, satisfying the 9+ gate. One point short only because exterior timeline storm stays atmospheric rather than pressing choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—ownership of the duplicate self—tightens into a life-or-emotion hinge once Kai realizes vivification is the sole path to feeling. Blade-cut through containment is the earned reversal that collapses corporate, archivist, and personal claims into one irreversible act; the price (shared identity, history stabilized around him) is legible on page. Pressure escalates under causal lens: each slice removes an option until only merge remains. No extraneous antagonistic noise after guards are dispelled.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The theme of reclaimed sentience emerges entirely through the vivification act—no narrator sermon. Numbness vs. raw vitality is reconfigured when the “mirror” twin blinks first, re-pricing Kai’s prior survival as half-life. History-rewrite backdrop offers conceptual irony: external timelines flex while his inner timeline finally locks. Final image of dual selves on the rock answers the thematic question without moral tag.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person lingers inside Kai’s anesthetic sensorium: short, wind-cut sentences mirror his stripped affect; diction stays within post-psychedelic fighter register. No head-hops; archivist chant is external sound only. Blade’s harmonic hum recurs as tactile motif, tying perception to action. One clause drifts toward editorial abstraction (“history rewrote itself in chaotic loops”), but it occurs early and is quickly anchored by on-page anomaly flashes.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>High-density lines (“Nutrient fluid spilled in slow-motion arcs, defying the dojo's gravity”) do triple duty: image, rule cue, emotional beat. Rhythm accelerates with parataxis during merge, then exhales into longer sentence at twin’s first breath—precise sonic shape. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; metaphor vehicles (rift-shards, crystalline edge) stay consistent with world logic. One stray adjective “relentless” for winds is the single filler word in 760-word piece.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Brain-in-jar custody fight fused with Buddhist ego-death and quantum revision is a high-wire concept, yet the piece keeps the emotional core primary: numb man births his own feeling反向 twin. Rift-shard blade that literally “slices pretense” could read gimmick but earns its keep by dissolving holographic guards and containment field in successive beats. Risky choice to keep history rewrites off-page pays off—story never buckles under exposition. Feels inevitable in hindsight; remove any element and the merge fails.</comment>
