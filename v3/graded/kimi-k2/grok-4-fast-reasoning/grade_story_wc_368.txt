<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—guardian-of-vats vs. story-magnet hunger—is stated, not dramatized; no mid-scene choice tests her new pulse. The donor memories arrive as a packaged info-dump rather than an on-page micro-choice that changes tactics. Closure is an announced rather than embodied shift; cost remains conceptual, not tactile.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: imagistic density around the wing reweights stakes. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—she decides to “weave this new rhythm,” a legible before/after. Yet causality is thin: the wing experiment does not force a visible forfeiture; the decisive change is rhetorical, not dramatized on stage.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Floating tea house, petrified-fern cup, slate etched with sun maps—details are selective, POV-tinted, and anchor orientation early. The wing-as-micro-setting constrains her final action by refracting light onto patrons, turning environment into active catalyst. Only the valley-mist descriptor repeats enough to risk static wallpaper, but spatial choreography stays clean.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“why do some magnetize stories?”—is declared early; pressure tightens when sunlight refracts and patrons look up, externalizing her internal question. No visible price is exacted; the risk of exposure is asserted, not felt. Escalation is imagistic rather than tactical; options do not materially narrow.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of courageous visibility emerges through light/scale imagery rather than statement. The donor-heart metaphor invites dual authorship, lending complexity. Final image avoids moralizing but skirts sentimental convenience—“iridescent caution” is thematic branding delivered twice, slightly blunting subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person intimate sustains a lyric, textile-tinted diction consistent with a dye master’s gaze. Sentence rhythm modulates from languid observation to sharper pulses synced with heartbeat. No POV slippage; perceptual signature is distinct throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>High figurative density risks purple overload (“liquid fire,” “valley-mist wonder”) yet stays tethered to POV craft. No loops or scaffold; information is layered economically. One mixed vehicle—“clouds clung like forgotten dreams”—is soft but does not obscure causality or dull the final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Floating tea house and heart-borne narrative magnetism synthesize fresh mythic realism. Core questions about story attraction are familiar, but treatment via dye-craft optics gives idiosyncratic tilt. Risk is present yet cushioned by lyric opulence; transformation would survive name-swap, so ingenuity is solid, not singular.</comment>
