<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elias’s cartographic obsession is concrete and embodied; the condensation epiphany shows thought in motion. Interior contradiction surfaces once—quiet mastery vs. latent dread—yet the renunciation at the end (“pressed on”) carries only muted cost, blunting the arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the decision to leave the outpost recharts world flow and carries the implicit price of solitude. Causal chain (falcon→note→condensation→recognition→departure) is tight, lens held, cost legible in the final image of reforming frost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Frozen lake, rust flakes, geothermal rift—all filter through Elias’s map-eye and constrain next moves; the window micro-setting literally redraws his atlas. Spatial anchors arrive by line 5; environment charges the final image as frost re-patterns behind him.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Single stake—locate the river cradle—tightens when the glass convergence forecloses doubt and forces departure. One visible price: the outpost’s shelter abandoned to hostile expanse; pressure coherent under causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of origins and authorship emerges organically through cartographic metaphors; the window “edits” his atlas, reframing knowledge as co-creation with nature. Final image of reforming frost offers non-literal aftershock without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distanced third-person mirrors Elias’s detached precision; dry aside (“rivers don’t start wars...”) maintains character signature. Syntax stays controlled, rhythm tightens in the condensation beat, no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density—most sentences serve two jobs; figurative strings are purposeful, tied to cartography. One mixed vehicle (“iron walls flaking like old skin beside...ice”) nicks clarity; no loops or filler in final third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fusion of map-making with geothermal myth feels fresh; condensation-as-cartography is an inventive reveal. Still trades on lone-scholar-versus-wilderness trope without upending it; risk moderate, not trail-blazing.</comment>
