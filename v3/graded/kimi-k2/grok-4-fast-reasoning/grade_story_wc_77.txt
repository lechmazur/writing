<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid (“repulsive allure,” “velvet over thorns”) and the buried guilt over the sister is concrete motivation, but the confession beat is rushed—no embodied contradiction in the moment, just spoken declaration—so the change feels announced rather than earned under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands: the imagined photograph rebounds the curse, dissolving fear—visible cost is the funhouse’s light burst. Causal chain is loose (why does mental imagery trigger the curse?) yet consistent under a dream-logic lens; orientation is secured early and the single shard holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mirror glass “glittering with unnatural lingering luminance” and the clasp’s serpent filigree are tactile, plot-functional details that constrain the final tactic; spatial track is clean. Selective sensory triage keeps the decay from becoming catalog.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—trick fear into exposing weakness—tightens when paradoxical notes force a public confession; the rebound of the curse is the felt price. One meaningful escalation beat satisfies scope, though fear’s agency is metaphorical rather than enacted.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of revelation vs. silence emerges through the clasp-mirror system without moralizing; final image reweights earlier “grotesque parodies” into liberation. Ambiguity remains—was advisor psyche or specter—inviting reflection, but epiphany leans slightly abstract.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-close voice carries obsessive, sensory diction (“silken rasp,” “moldy cotton-candy sweetness”) that escalates with stress; no filter-verb clutter; whispering advisor is distinct in diction and never leaks POV. Rhythm tightens from languid to staccato at climax.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Strong verbs and varied sentence cadences propel; only minor scaffold (“the method…unfolded here”) and one mixed echo (“fear weakens when flattered by its own lies”) blur edge. No loops or register drift in closure beat; luminance motif stays precise.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Fuses carnival-gothic, cursed-object, and dream-dictionary gambit into one compressed arc; paradox-as-weapon feels fresh rather than trope check-box. Risk resides in dream-logic curse rebound—edge of convenience—but prior luminance pattern teaches acceptability.</comment>
