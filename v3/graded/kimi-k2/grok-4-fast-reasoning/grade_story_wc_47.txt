<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied, but the “watchful dreamer” label is asserted rather than dramatized; her proactive choice to offer the pendant is earned, yet Kai remains a cipher, muting relational crucible pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Single-scene structure holds; orientation is swift, closure lands as Charged Poise with felt cost (the pendant’s redefinition). Causal chain is light—more situational than driven—but the final image reconfigures meaning cleanly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Moss garden is rendered with selective, sensory precision; the thaw-icicle motif threads through action and metaphor, constraining the final gesture. Spatial choreography is clear, though the “data center” past feels ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reclaiming agency after public shaming—is signaled early; pressure tightens via the pendant offer, a micro-choice that forecloses hiding. Cost is present but soft; escalation is more tonal than tactical.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of reclamation through shared fragility emerges organically from image and gesture; the amber’s shift from wound to bridge is resonant. Subtext is strong, though the “honeyed hush” concept edges toward label.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited is stable; prose texture is lyrical yet controlled, with rhythmic variation that mirrors thaw. Dialogue is minimal but natural; perceptual signature is distinct, though Kai’s voice is undifferentiated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>High density, no loops; figurative language is purposeful. Occasional elevated diction (“verdant moss garden,” “honeyed hush”) flirts with purple but stays within POV. Final cadence lands cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Post-digital ruin as healing ground is fresh; transformation of viral shame into quiet communion feels earned. Risk is moderate—lyric stillness over plot—but specificity of moss-over-servers anchors it.</comment>
