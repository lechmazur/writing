<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elowen’s underachiever status is embodied in fizzling spells and frozen tears, but the interior voice drifts toward abstract self-diagnosis (“her mage’s heart no longer underachieving”) rather than live contradiction. The final awakening is credible, yet the cost is more asserted than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The causal chain—keystone → unstrap → mist-walk → embed—tightens cleanly to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the spire’s light reweights the premise. Orientation is swift; the single transition from spire to ledge is legible and serves closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Icebound spire, cloud-cloak, and asymmetrical crystals are rendered with selective sensory precision; the “brilliant dimness” motif constrains Elowen’s choices and charges the final image. Spatial choreography remains coherent across the vertical descent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—prove simple magic against automated perfection—escalates through each beat: vines resist, mists invite, keystone amplifies. The felt cost is the public obscurity she accepts by embracing inefficiency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the keystone’s organic glow versus algorithmic auroras; the final image of “quiet holiness” reweights the premise without sermon. Subtext is carried by gesture—tears freezing, crystals asymmetrical—rather than statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Lyrical, elevated diction is consistent with the spire’s enchanted physics; “gravity whispered rather than demanded” exemplifies the voice’s texture. No head-hopping; POV distance remains stable and purposeful.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; occasional stacked modifiers (“crystalline filigrees across every surface”) risk overwriting but never stall momentum. No loops or paraphrase artifacts intrude on the closing cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The fusion of cyber-magic critique with quiet mysticism feels fresh; the “lingering luminance” concept is particularized through the keystone rather than asserted. Risky vertical traversal via mist-walking pays off as earned wonder.</comment>
