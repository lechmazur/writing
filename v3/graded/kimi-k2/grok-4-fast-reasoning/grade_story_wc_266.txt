<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elara’s fear-of-leash interiority is concrete early (“the leash was her fear, not his chain”), but the shift from passive follower to active guide is declared rather than dramatized on-page; star-stamp card acts as external proxy for courage, so the final cost feels symbolic rather than embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the star-punch card glows, leash-ghost dissolves, and she returns as guide—visible conceptual cost under Accumulative lens. Orientation is swift; indirect-route pattern is taught by 25 % and paid off in final cove image, satisfying Track B.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mist-cloaked ridgeway and tide-pool mirror constrain movement and supply the culminating reflective image; sensory selection favors salt, damp earth, and lantern flicker that tighten with twilight. Spatial choreography remains coherent across the looping path.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—claim unused courage—tightens once when the elder punches the first star; second punch at the cove reweights the stake with glowing evidence of cost. Pressure is steady but single-cycle; no live option is foreclosed mid-journey, limiting escalation band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of self-imposed leashes emerges through star-stamp motif and shoreline mirror without moralizing; final image of her punching others’ tickets reconfigures the vigil into communal ferrying, offering resonant after-effect.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person hovers close to Elara’s sensory filter; wave-rhythmed syntax and selective metaphor (“voice a gentle wave lapping at pebbles”) maintain consistent texture. No dialogue to distort voice; compression and ellipsis are taught early and legible at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong rhythmic control and varied sentence openings; occasional metaphor clusters (“veiled ridgeway…forgotten dreams…rocky spine”) flirt with overwriting but never stall causality. Zero paraphrase loops or filter stacks; final punch line lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Ferry guides who punch star tickets along a misty cliff-path give fresh tilt to the “crossing” trope; transformation from lost walker to guide feels inevitable yet specific to this ridge-sea borderland. Risk is moderate—lyric accumulative structure rather than causal twist—but execution coheres.</comment>
