<comment>Elara’s drive to “excavate truth” is declared early and threads every beat; the micro-choice to pocket a shard of the crystal literalizes her cost. Yet her interiority never cracks—no contradictory impulse or embodied fear under the Geiger-silent trees—so the renunciation feels efficient rather than wrenched.</comment>

<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Causal chain holds: storm lull → orchard → shredded memos → buried device → myth busted. Closure is a crisp Conceptual Repricing—the “cursed” gem reframed as withheld salvation—sealed by the image of her carrying the fragment into the next storm. Cost is present but lightly felt; a hair more body-risk would clinch 8+.</comment>

<question>3</question>
<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Radiation haze, glowing apples, and the unnaturally still pocket beneath the tree are filtered through Elara’s scanner-and-skeptic gaze, anchoring orientation within 120 words. The orchard itself becomes the tool that constrains her final choice—she buries the truth again to control its release—so micro-setting charges closure.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Single dominant stake—prove or disprove the curse—tightens when the shredded memos flip the threat from supernatural to corporate sabotage. One meaningful escalation suffices, but the price (she seals the site, prolonging survivor hunger) is stated more than dramatized; a sensory hint of starving camps would sharpen cost.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Myth vs. engineered sanctuary emerges organically through the reassembled documents; no character lectures us. Final image of the “flawed” crystal reweights the premise—salvation was always there, hoarded by fear—leaving an aftertaste of squandered hope without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person POV stays tight to Elara’s empirical lens; diction skews forensic (“radioactive silt,” “isotope warnings”) rather than lyrical. No dialogue, so voice is carried by perceptual signature alone; rhythm remains steady, never compressing under storm pressure, which keeps it from 8+.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Clean, scaffold-free sentences; information density high (“shimmering particles that clung…like desperate ghosts” does double sensory work). One mixed metaphor—“seed of real redemption from the liquidation’s ashes”—is forgivable at closure; otherwise no loops or register drift.</comment>

<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Post-apple orchard sustained by quantum crystal is fresh, yet the “corporation hid salvation behind superstition” reveal follows familiar eco-corp critique. Specificity of the flawed diamond as radiation filter and the tactile paper-reassembly lift it above template; still, premise is more inventive than its political angle.</comment>
