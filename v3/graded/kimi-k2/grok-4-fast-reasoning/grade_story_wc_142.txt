<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority is vivid—her “dual allegiance” is embodied in the moment she palms the stone chip and later when she absorbs the juggler’s turmoil. Micro-choices (daubing graffiti, scaling a lantern post) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The final vote crystallizes her arc with visible cost: carnival soul preserved, but corporate order admitted. No stock phrasing; every beat is filtered through her perceptual signature.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the vote to incorporate on their own terms reweights the stakes and forecloses pure anarchy. Causal chain holds—each graffiti mural tightens communal bonds until the final phoenix image. Orientation is anchored by the second sentence; no drift. The persistent constraint (privatization deadline) shapes every tactic.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The raft city is tactile—creaking walkways, barrel sides, neon lanterns—yet never catalogued; details filter through Lira’s priorities. The foundation stone’s barnacles and salt-worn edges constrain her first decisive act (chipping it) and return charged in the final hub. Weather and spatial choreography remain coherent; no impossible positions. Micro-setting (the chip in her pocket) functions as a compass that alters choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserve communal chaos against corporate buyout—is signaled in paragraph three and escalates via each encoded mural. One meaningful tightening: the juggler’s torn loyalty mirrors Lira’s, forcing a defensive perimeter that narrows options. Cost is legible—carnival lights burn fiercer under desperation, and the vote accepts structured compromise. Agency drives every turn; coincidence never rescues.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the tension between revelry and resilience; no explicit moralizing. The phoenix mural offers a non-literal answer—rebirth through balanced loyalties—without sermon. Subtext operates in the graffiti’s hidden coordinates and the silent vote. Emotional aftereffect lingers: wild heart caged yet still beating.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited clings tightly to Lira’s perceptual signature—salt-scented air, lantern glow on wet paint. No head-hopping; even the juggler’s turmoil is filtered through her absorption. Syntax flexes with pressure: longer cadences for reflection, clipped fragments during clandestine climbs. Voice remains consistent and character-bound.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence advances story or atmosphere. No loops or scaffold—each image (spiced kelp fritters, barnacle-crusted relic) is fresh and purposeful. Metaphors (gears of masks, phoenix from planks) cohere without muddle. Rhythm modulates naturally with tension; no filler.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The floating carnival resisting gentrification is familiar territory, but the graffiti-as-code tactic and the stone chip as talisman feel specific and inevitable. Synthesis of order/intuition within carnival chaos is non-obvious and earned. Risky compression—three nights, three murals—pays off without clutter. No derivative echoes; the final vote is a fresh civic ritual.</comment>
