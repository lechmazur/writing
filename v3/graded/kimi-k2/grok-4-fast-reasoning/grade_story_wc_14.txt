<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elias’s obsession with “textures of different times” is vivid, but interior contradiction is asserted rather than dramatized; we never see him choose between conflicting values. The decision to descend is announced, not tested, so the cost feels assumed, not earned. Embodied emotion is strong early (gold-stained hands, lamp-hum matching pulse) but thins once the labyrinth becomes backdrop. Still, the sensory-specific vocation and the solitary ritual give him a memorable silhouette.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elias leaves the mountain carrying a notepad of “invented histories” whose truth-value now bears the town’s survival—visible conceptual cost. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; causality is lyric rather than sequential, but the final descent reweights earlier pattern. Orientation is clear within 120 words. One soft spot: the town’s voice-stealing blight is declared off-stage and never re-enters as concrete constraint, so the stakes feel grafted rather than tightened.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Bonsai labyrinth and flickering lamp function as micro-setting: the lamp’s dawn-hum charts time, the dwarf trees supply tactile scale for “texture collecting.” Dew-refracted light becomes the physical lens through which invented histories are literally “refracted,” so environment constrains method. Texture outweighs breadth—perfect for 700-word scope—yet mountain weather stays ornamental; a single gust or chill could have tested resolve. Spatial choreography remains clean in a one-man scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover lost time-textures to re-sound a silenced town—is signaled early, but pressure is ambient: the blight never intrudes on the mountaintop, so escalation is poetic accumulation rather than rising threat. One meaningful deepening occurs when the hum crescendos and Elias imagines “gilded whispers” returning; this reframes his scribbling as restorative ritual. However, no live option is foreclosed; he could have stayed or left without tangible consequence on the page. Cost is conceptual, not dramatized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme—that invented memory can resurrect a erased future—emerges through the parallel of gold leaf pressed into bark and ink pressed into paper, never stated outright. The final descent reconfigures the meaning of “forgery”: what began as escapist illusion ends as civic tinder, a quiet conceptual repricing. Ambiguity is preserved; we don’t know if the townsfolk will accept his tales. One decorative echo too many: “incandescent restraint” is repeated without shift in nuance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-limited stays locked to Elias’s artisan eye; perceptual signature is tactile-metallic (“gold flecks,” “slick chill of Renaissance ink”). Syntax lengthens and shortens with the lamp’s hum, creating rhythmic signature. No dialogue, so voice contamination is impossible. Occasional elevated Latinate diction (“incandescent restraint,” “conceptual repricing”) feels authored rather than character-bound, but the pattern is consistent enough to read as stylization rather than slippage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet breathable; sentences carry double duty (action + texture). Mixed-metaphor risk—“veins of the earth” beside “prismatic shards”—is rescued by the shared optic/organic field. One scaffold loop: “refract” is over-deployed as verb, noun, and metaphor in the final third, dulling the climactic descent. Otherwise, cadence modulates, paragraphs are trim, and no filter-verb clusters gum the immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Gilded stationer who “collects textures of time” via dawn hum of salvaged fluorescent tube in bonsai labyrinth is highly specific, fresh without gimmickry. The invented-history premise could have slid into mere meta-fiction, but the tactile craft detail grounds it. Risk is moderate: lyric accumulative structure instead of causal plot. Transformation test passes—swap gold-leaf for generic scribe and the emotional arc collapses. One proximity echo: the humming lamp in dawn mist nods to Ballard, but refracted through calligrapher’s optic.</comment>
