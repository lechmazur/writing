<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid—Elara’s metaphor-drunk mind feels singular—but the apology motive is declared, not dramatized until the final speech; no micro-choice shows her fighting the urge to flee or stay. Theo’s translucent-note form is evocative yet passive; he supplies lyrical replies rather than pressure. The reconciliatory hand-brush registers as earned only because the text says “reconnect we have”; prior beats never test her pride against concrete risk. Emotional hierarchy (gossip-columnist identity vs. sister guilt) stays stated, not stressed under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the lingering archive hum and falling timber re-weight the stake with undeniable cost—she leaves with “flawed peace.” Causal chain: perfume spray → induced currents → Theo’s flicker → apology → vision → parting; each step follows, though the current-mechanics are hand-waved. One continuity glitch: the bottle is “pocketed” again at the end yet was never described as retrieved from the floor after the spray. Orientation is clear by ~100 words; no lens ambiguity at close; accumulation cap not triggered.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Sheet-music archive is tactile—yellowed scores, metal bindings arcing—yet never blocks or enables action; the orchard outside supplies the ticking clock but remains off-stage. Micro-setting of the perfume bottle (filigreed, “liquid lightning”) is the prop that actually alters possibility; it meets the 9+ gate but the larger environment remains backdrop rather than constraint. Spatial tracking inside the stacks is clean. Sensory layering (dust motes as “stardust,” ozone crackle) is selective and POV-filtered.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—deliver apology before demolition—is signaled early; machinery growl at close supplies temporal tightening. Agency is verbal only: she speaks the apology; no tactical use of her exorcist skill set or the bottle beyond initial spritz. Cost is conceptual—the grove falls, Theo fades—but not felt as concrete forfeiture on her part. Escalation is situational pressure rather than causal complication; one meaningful intensification satisfies length, yet the beat set remains thin.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>“Imperfect miracles” emerges organically through the perfume (joy that burns) and the orchard/archive doomed sanctuary; no overt thesis statement. Final line—“the trees fell, but the music lingered”—offers resonant conceptual repricing without moralizing. Subtext of sibling rivalry is handled through musical metaphors that accrue rather than explain. Theme stays coherent, avoids tidy redemption, and invites counter-readings (is the column really exorcised of regret?).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature—metaphor as lifeblood—belongs unmistakably to a writer who sees headlines in ghosts. Rhythm modulates: longer lyrical sentences under calm, clipped fragments during crackling apparition. No head-hopping; diction stays within noir-columnist range. Dialogue is minimal but carries subtext (Theo’s “you come now…?” = accusation of tardiness). Filter verbs appear but are voice-motivated; no scaffold artifacts.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm is controlled; sentence openings vary, paragraphs breathe. Occasional overwritten peaks—“ethereal grit that clung…like urban fog” stacked with “shimmering elixir”—but density never stalls beats. No paraphrase loops; pronouns clean; opening and closing lines anchor and resolve. Two mixed metaphors (“notes on a staff, branching like trees”) mildly strain logic yet occur mid-scene, not at closure. Minor scaffolds (−0.2) keep it under the 9+ ceiling.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fusion of gossip-columnist and ghost-exorcist is fresh; archive/orchard sprawl-vs-memory dynamic avoids trodden urban-fantasy paths. Concept of “induced currents” as both electrical and emotional is inventive, though under-deployed. Metaphor-as-dialogue device feels specific to this sibling dyad. Risk is moderate—lyric escalation rather than plot reversals—but coherence holds. Derivative guardrail not triggered; story would collapse if professions or setting swapped.</comment>
