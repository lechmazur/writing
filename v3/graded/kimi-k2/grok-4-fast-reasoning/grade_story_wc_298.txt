<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara’s fierce-gentle paradox is embodied when she “pressed the card against a root… whispering interpretations,” a micro-choice that fuses tenderness with reckless resolve. The interior contradiction stays live: hope vs macabre bargain, enacted in tactile beats. Thorne’s guarded curiosity supplies status pressure that forces her to double-down, cementing the arc. Only the family-fire backstory is told not shown, muting full cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the card crumbles, destinies swapped, “threads of dusky resolve pulling taut” – cost is the dust itself and the irreversible rewrite. Causal chain holds: card pulse → root inscription → Thorne’s loosening → Elara’s mending. Orientation is anchored by word 60 with “catacomb orchard” and phosphor glow. One minor scaffold: “inlaying meaning everywhere” is repeated three times without new causal payload.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The root-skull lattice is not backdrop; it physically cages Thorne and later slackens as Elara etches the bargain, so environment constrains tactics. Sensory hierarchy skews tactile-earth and fungal glow, filtered through Elara’s grief-urgency. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly as she kneels, presses card, roots part. Micro-setting (charred card edge) doubles as object-anchor, charging the final dust-image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“trade destinies for peace”—is signaled early and tightened when the card’s pulse demands action, foreclosing retreat. One meaningful escalation: Thorne’s mock warning → Elara’s root-etch choice narrows options and binds both souls. Cost is visible: card disintegrates, Thorne’s form “solidified slightly,” Elara’s prior grief now shared. Pressure stays causal under lens; no coincidence resolves.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the price of rewriting grief: ash becomes shared light, love as exchange rather than possession. No thesis stated; meaning accrues through root-lover-card triangulation. Final dust-image reweights the Lovers motif without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers—whose peace, whose future?—yet complexity feels earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-limited stays locked to Elara; perceptual signature favors bone-touch and fungal gleam, never Thorne’s mind. Diction—“furnace of unyielding hope,” “hamstrung his own freedom”—carries rhythmic heat without purple drift. Dialogue is sparse, indirect, goal-driven: Thorne’s grave-rustle question tests her, her answer offers the bargain. Filter verbs minimal; free-indirect clean.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</question>
<comment>Sentence rhythm breathes with beats: long clauses for orchard crawl, fragments at card-pulse climax. Mixed metaphors avoided; “veins feeding on the dead” stays biological-consistent. One paraphrase loop: “fiercely gentle” appears four times; trim once for propulsion. Otherwise high density—each line advances image, stakes, or symbol.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</question>
<comment>Underworld destiny-barter via root-etched tarot is fresh synthesis; lovers-as-exchange flips standard resurrection trope. Specificity—phosphor fungi, ribcage root-cage—anchors novelty. Risk: idealist in ossuary could tilt gothic-pastiche, yet voice commits without wink. If names changed, root-card mechanic would still be unique, passing transformation test.</comment>
