<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elias’s compulsion to speak truth is stated more than dramatized; the only on-page cost is the involuntary info-dump about the bees, which Lira immediately absorbs without friction. Interiority drifts into abstraction (“preserve wonder amid the grind”) rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. No micro-choice shows him weighing disclosure against personal risk; the matchbox riddle is offered as flourish, not crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the city’s darkness is traced to disoriented bio-bees, a shift that reweights the tower from mythic spire to fragile apiary. Causal chain holds—blackout ➔ riddle ➔ disclosure ➔ ascent—yet the bee-explanation arrives in one expository lump rather than escalating reveals. Orientation is clear by 120 words; no lens ambiguity at end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>“Nectar dusk” and “skeletal giant” give tactile skyline menace; the booth’s flicker of lanterns narrows to Elias’s sweat-slick hands, integrating macro- and micro-setting. Tower vents emitting “faint buzzes” foreshadow the bee reveal without overt signalling. Sensory balance favors visual; scent or temperature could sharpen jeopardy. The lacquer box serves as micro-setting that charges the final image when re-closed.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can Elias safeguard wonder while forced to tell truth—tightens only once, at the matchbox beat; pressure plateaus after the bee disclosure. Lira’s ascent absorbs the revelation without pushing back, so external opposition never escalates. Cost is conceptual (mystery diminished) rather than felt on-page; no tactic is foreclosed for Elias after he speaks.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of wonder versus utility emerges inductively from bee-pollination metaphor and Elias’s toll-booth theatrics, avoiding overt thesis. Final image of “nectar dusk sweetening the air” reweights the tower’s drones as both miracle and vulnerability. Riddle’s hive/queen rhetoric invites reflection on civic cooperation without moralizing. Ambiguity survives: is wonder worth the fragility? Not yet resonantly charged.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person keeps psychic distance steady; diction (“bruised sky,” “hollow echo”) colors Elias’s perceptual bias without purple drift. Syntax lengthens during reflective beats, then compresses at the reveal (“words spilled like honey”), mirroring tension. Filter verbs minimal; metaphors stay within POV’s imaginative reach. Voice remains singular; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: longer anaphoric cadence in opening description, staccato at matchbox flick. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances image or knowledge. One mixed metaphor—“double-edged key” unlocking “truths wrapped in enigma”—momentarily blurs tool and gesture. Clean grammar, precise tense, strong verbs outweigh minor flourish.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Bio-engineered bees as living electrical grid is fresh, yet the piece leans on apian clichés (hive, queen, drone). Riddle-inside-matchbox-inside-box is a elegant nested reveal that feels inevitable once unpacked. Risk is moderate: marrying apiary lore to power infrastructure, executed without gimmickry. Could swap “tower” for any utility spire; specificity of bee-tech saves it from generic.</comment>
