<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Interiority is consistently concrete—her fingers tracing the stamp’s brass ridges embodies the archive-bred hunger for truth. The contradiction between inherited duty and the emergent “deliberate submersion” thesis is held in-scene, not alternated in summary. Final decision to re-index the world costs her the safety of accepted history; cost is legible when she pockets the stamp and feels the library’s tilt realign her stance. Single-POV focus keeps hierarchy of values tight; no label-speak under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal through-line holds: blackout ➔ stamp discovery ➔ hypothesis reframe ➔ inked seal that commits her to rewriting canon. Closure is a Decisive Change with conceptual cost—once the spiral glyph is stamped, her scholarly neutrality is drowned with the city. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are taught by line 5 and paid off when the tilted floor mirrors the tilted narrative. No teleporting props; every object is either on her body or indexed in prior beats.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: the mildewed spires and encroaching chill constrain every move—she reseals her suit because the library literally leaks. The head-lamp’s cone narrowing on the barnacled box focuses attention the way a library aisle would, but underwater pressure makes the choice to kneel tactile and urgent. Spiral shelving echoed in the stamped glyph links environment to closure image. No wasted encyclopedic lists—every sensory hit advances indexing action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—uncover untainted origins—tightens when contradictory charters force the alternative-hypothesis pivot; options narrow to “propagate lie” or “rewrite history” with her own seal now authenticating the latter. Blackout deletes external rescue, intensifying intellectual risk. Cost is visible: the inked spiral is an irreversible scholarly signature that could brand her a revisionist heretic. One meaningful escalation beat suffices at 740 words.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from archival method: history as sediment that can be deliberately sunk. Subtext operates in the stamp—once a tool of authority, now a weapon against it. Final spiral image reweights all prior “dappled” light motifs as hidden-depth clues rather than decorative ambience. No moralizing sentence closes the piece; the re-indexing imperative is left ominously open.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains calm, cataloguer’s diction—“glyphs and logs,” “cross-referencing”—that never drifts into lyrical overload. Sentence rhythm lengthens during reflection, then compresses when she acts: “She pressed the antique ink stamp” lands as a short, decisive beat. No POV leakage; knowledge stays strictly character-bound. Filter verbs (“she imagined”) are minimal and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High information density: “coral-encrusted spires pierced the eternal twilight” does world, tone, and stakes in one breath. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances either indexing progress or environmental pressure. Mixed-metaphor vigilance: “dappled resolve” recurs but pattern-taught early and reprised at closure, so reads as motif, not slop. Final line is crisp, propulsive, leaves resonance without scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sunken-library trope is refreshed through procedural archive thriller beats—indexing as underwater dive. Turning the city’s fall into intentional submersion flips standard eco-catastrophe template without breaking prior clues. Specificity of the ink stamp’s rubber pad “faded but intact” makes the object irreplaceable. Risk in hybrid sf/historical-epistemological mode pays off because closure stays legible.</comment>
