<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Interiority is sensorily rich (“perpetually surprised eyes” reflecting cosmos), but trait never complicates choice; drone insertion and lever pull are competent, not costly. No interior contradiction under pressure; closure brings wonder, not renunciation or new risk. Missing embodiment of surprise as obstacle or micro-choice keeps score sub-9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Causal chain—journal → chip → drone mapping → decoded gaps → self-mending—holds cleanly; final lever pull etches code with on-page cost (“binding her to the cosmos”). Orientation anchored by 120 w. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost; persistent constraint (now tuned to belonging frequency) shapes future. One micro-turn suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Obsatory’s dusk, domed star maps, brass telescope filter through Elara’s pilot gaze; stone “breathes” echoes, micro-setting of chip port constrains insertion beat. Spatial choreography clean; telescope/drone alignment tracks. Environment doesn’t charge final image—no stone or sky feedback to last beat—so stays below 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decode belonging frequency—signaled early. One meaningful tightening: chip anomalies reveal gaps, forcing final lever pull that forecloses anonymity. Cost legible: she is now “bound” to cosmic frequency. No secondary pressure or tangible loss, keeping escalation solid but not exceptional.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of belonging emerges via star-map fragments and chip letterpress metaphor; final hum avoids explicit moral. Subtext in “interstices between stars” reweights solitude into connection. No motif recurrence beyond chip/constellation; could deepen with earlier planted image returning. Ends with earned wonder, not statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains cosmic-filtered diction (“brilliant dimness,” “velvet sky”) consistent with Elara’s awe. Rhythm swells then contracts to crystalline final line. No head-hop; psychic distance stable. Distinct perceptual signature sustained under pressure; no experimental elision, so meets high-band criteria.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sentences vary; no loops or scaffold. Dense figurative layering (“star trails…threads from a loom”) risk purple but stay tied to POV craft. One mixed vehicle: “brilliant dimness” is self-oxymoronic yet taught early and paid off; allowed. High information density; minor modifier clusters keep it sub-9.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fusion of antique letterpress matrix with astrophysical decryption feels fresh; pilgrim frame familiar but secondary. Specificity of drone/orrery interface lifts concept above trope. Risk-taking moderate—structure linear—but premise transformed through tactile detail. Memory distinctiveness solid though not genre-bending.</comment>
