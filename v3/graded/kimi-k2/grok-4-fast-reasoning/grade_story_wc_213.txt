<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias’s quiet listening credo is embodied in every micro-choice—fixing the rope, hesitating at the switch, pulling the bell instead—earning the Earned Stasis of renouncing the siren. Interiority is concrete (“glue dried true”) and cost is felt. Passes the 9+ test via visible renunciation with on-page cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Situational lens holds: pressure tightens toward zero hour, microclimate anomalies narrow options, and the bell toll crystallizes stance. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—world pauses, bell speaks, siren silenced. No orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Cloud’s Perch is richly anchored—stone, wind, bell bronze etched with saints—yet never decorative; rope and bell are micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image. Meets 9+ requirement of environment shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“preserve sacred quiet” under solstice hush—escalates via microclimate anomalies forcing stance crystallization. Bell toll forecloses the mechanical option with visible cost. One meaningful tightening suffices per scope.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Theme of quiet vigilance over mechanical noise emerges through specific acts (repair, hesitate, ring) rather than statement. Final bell reprise reweights prior choices with cost. Subtext operates in gesture.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays rooted in Elias’s selective perception (“weathered coat flapping,” “bones vibrated”). Rhythm accelerates under stress; no head-hopping. Distinct texture and perceptual signature under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is lyric yet controlled—pine-resin glue, bronze saints etched—information density high. No loops or scaffold. Lines advance story or atmosphere without muddle. Meets 9+ ear test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Fresh angle: humble tester transforms routine siren test into bell vigil at solstice. Internal logic and mountain microclimate are particular. Synthesis feels inevitable; no derivation or fads. Meets 9+ of non-obvious synthesis.</comment>
