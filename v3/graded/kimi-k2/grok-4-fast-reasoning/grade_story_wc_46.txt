<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—wanting sky yet bound to stone—remains embodied; the glass-polishing micro-choices trace a credible shift from isolation to luminous service. Backstory intrusions (fire, mother) are anchored to present tactile cues and tilt her stance each time. The final “bridge for others” renunciation carries visible cost: she forfeits her private grotto sanctuary. Yet the villagers remain faceless, so status crucible and voice distinction bullets are dormant; the score tops at low-7 band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the polished glass reweights her life-rule “no fire” into “reflective light,” with conceptual cost—she must now stand exposed among people she once fled. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each mirrored glint tightens the pattern until dawn’s first blush crystallizes the new stance. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are clear within 120 words; no penalty. One causality hairline: the storm-fire backstory is told, not shown, slightly softening the “no fire” vow’s origin, but the vow itself governs every beat thereafter.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Grotto curves, bioluminescent fungi, and salt-thick air are filtered through Elara’s star-hungry attention; environment constrains her path and later supplies the reflective tool. Micro-setting triumphs: the glass shard’s “prismatic whispers” function as both mirror and torch, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clean—kneel, lift, stroke, stand—no impossible positions. Weather (mist, dawn blush) evolves causally with the emotional cadence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“share light without fire”—is signaled early and tested when she decides to polish and publicly display the glass. One meaningful tightening: the vow denies her the easiest illumination (torch, bonfire), forcing the reflective tactic; the cost is social exposure. Pressure accumulates rather than reverses; enough for 600-word scope. Villagers’ awe feels slightly convenient, but their reaction merely confirms, not resolves, so coincidence does not undercut.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through recurrent glass-light imagery: stillness that magnifies rather than consumes. Mother’s “light doesn’t need to burn” refrain is the only near-epiphany, but it is dramatized via the final beachside showing, not sermonizing. Subtext of trauma (fire) versus generosity (reflection) lingers without tidy moral. Final image reweights prior isolation into communal wonder, meeting the non-literal answer test.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly lashed to Elara’s body and sensory hierarchy; no head-hop. Prose adopts a wind-polished lyric cadence—“zephyr bloom,” “prismatic whispers”—that mirrors her gem-tumbling patience. Under stress (dawn emergence) syntax shortens, rhythm accelerates, then exhales into the communal line “See…,” showing modulation. Diction remains within her coastal, star-watcher lexicon; no register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template runs. Figurative density is high but patterned—wind, bloom, glass, light—taught by line 3 and paid off in the final mirror-gleam on faces. One paraphrase loop: “memories resurfaced” appears three times within 60 words mid-story (−0.2). Otherwise information density is strong; each clause adds tactile or emotional charge. No mixed metaphors or clarity breaks at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Sea-glass beacon is familiar coastal-literature territory, yet the “no-fire” constraint and gem-polishing mechanics give it fresh torque. Synthesis of trauma recovery with reflective (not consumptive) illumination feels specific to this voice. Risk is moderate—lyric accumulative structure rather than twist—but coherence rewards the gamble. Could swap names/places with minor edits, so not fully idiosyncratic, keeping score below 8.</comment>
