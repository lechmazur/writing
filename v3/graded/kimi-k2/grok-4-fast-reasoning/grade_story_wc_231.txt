<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s reclusive habit and memory-borrowing gift are vivid; the final decision to wear the flower shows visible cost. Yet his contradictory impulses stay mostly summarized (“isolation was his creed”) rather than enacted in scene, and the stranger’s off-stage absence prevents relationship pressure. Interiority is atmospheric but drifts toward poetic label-speak (“mocking his solitude”). Still, the micro-choice to pin the Edelweiss to his own coat credibly seals his altered stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of mist/flower imagery tightens until the pinning reconfigures meaning. Anchors (who/where/when) are clear within 120 words; no orientation debt. The closure beat—the keeper adopting the boutonnière—delivers Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost (“witnessed isolation felt shared”). One minor causality gap: how Elias knows the skiff existed is supplied only by memory-fragments, but the lyric contract accepts it.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dock, mist, lighthouse beam, and crumbling flower are viscerally textured and filtered through Elias’s skewed attention. The Edelweiss operates as micro-setting that ultimately constrains the final choice, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial tracking stays clean; weather actively limits visibility and amplifies tension. A few phrases (“sea’s edge bled into bruised indigo”) risk purple, but they coincide with low-action beats and don’t stall momentum.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decode the stranger’s gesture—surfaces early; pressure escalates as each borrowed gap narrows Elias’s certainty and forces the final appropriation of the flower. Cost is legible: he relinquishes neutral observation to carry another’s grief. The middle “investigation” beats accumulate texture rather than causal reversals, keeping escalation moderate. Still, under Accumulative lens the intensified imagery accomplishes the required tightening.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of isolation-as-bridge emerges through concrete relays: stranger’s unpinning → Elias’s pinning, gaps becoming shared memory. No moralizing; final image of the keeper wearing the desiccated flower reweights prior voids into communion. Subtext in quiet gestures avoids overt symbolism. A hairline slip toward thesis (“in isolation, one could borrow another’s memory...”) nicks the top band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person hovers at a psychic distance that still carries Elias’s salt-tanged idiom and perceptual tics (“eyes that darted like minnows”). Rhythm modulates with pressure—long humid clauses yield to the abrupt “But why?” No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero. Filter verbs appear but feel like Elias’s own tentative inferences, not hedging. Distinctive syntax survives the climax without flattening.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm shows purposeful cadence; sentence lengths vary to match fog-slowed observation. Metaphors occasionally stack (“mist that clung like a lover’s regret”) yet stay physically coherent and halt before the climax beat. Zero paraphrase loops; pronouns and props track cleanly. One mixed vehicle (“flower’s purity mocking his solitude”) mildly blurs agency but doesn’t cloud causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The memory-borrowing via voids in found objects offers a fresh paranormal angle, while the alpine-to-sea Edelweiss supplies a specific, non-generic talisman. Tropes of lonely lighthouse keeper and suicidal stranger are subverted by the departure-via-skiff twist. Specific coastal details (opal planks, salt-stiff hair) individuate the world. Risk is moderate—lyric fabulism rather than radical structure—but execution feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
