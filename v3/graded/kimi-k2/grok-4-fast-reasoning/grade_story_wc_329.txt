<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elara’s desire to “reawaken beauty” is stated repeatedly but never dramatized as an internal contradiction or embodied cost; she never doubts, tires, or chooses against self-interest. The locust shell functions as an external talisman rather than a pressure point that forces a value hierarchy. Because the orchard’s transformation is externally willed through music rather than paid for by a visible sacrifice, the arc feels warmly symbolic rather than personally earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Causal chain is legible: shell-spot → music → statue crack → orchard bloom, each beat a because/therefore step. Closure lands as Decisive Change with conceptual cost—the statues are “silenced forever,” mechanical order permanently displaced—so lens holds. The −0.4 gap to 8.2 reflects thin causality inside Elara: nothing she gives up or risks on the page can’t be regained; the real price is off-loaded onto the antagonist world.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Orchard, sky-bridge, and shell are concretely tracked; spatial logic survives the kinetic finale. Sensory detail is selective—sound and texture dominate, enforcing the music premise. The “tarnished wonder” tone stays consistent, filtering perception without lapsing into catalog. Environment does not physically constrain Elara’s tactics, so the 9+ gate is not cleared.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Stakes are declared early—mechanical sprawl vs. orchard magic—and tighten once when roots physically uproot anchors, foreclosing the option of coexistence. Escalation is linear, not recursively costly; Elara’s agency never meets a fresh obstacle after the first statue cracks. No tangible price (fatigue, broken bow, social exile) is exacted from her, so pressure plateaus rather than deepens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of “breaking free” emerges through cumulative imagery—husk, cracked stone, dissolved shell—rather than exposition. Final reconfiguration is legible: mechanism loses dominion, wonder returns, no moral recap required. Yet the reprise is conceptually neat; ambiguity and counter-readings are curtailed by the unambiguous victory.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Elara’s sensory filter; diction skews poetic but remains internally consistent. Rhythm swells with tempo shifts in the music beats without syntactic monotony. No dialogue means no voice contamination; POV distance is steady. Small lift for prose-as-character under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Sentence variety and information density are high; figurative language is patterned (music = pulse) and rarely over-clustered. Minor scaffold: “resonantly soft” is repeated four times with overlapping adverbs, creating a template echo that slightly dulls the finale. Otherwise clean, no mixed metaphors or paraphrase loops.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Fairy-tale eco-revival is familiar territory; the violin-as-synaptic-heart interface freshens it, as does the locust-shell amplifier. Synthesis feels specific to this world rather than interchangeable. However, the plot beats follow a standard “art defeats industry” arc without subversion, keeping it below the 8.5+ band.</comment>
