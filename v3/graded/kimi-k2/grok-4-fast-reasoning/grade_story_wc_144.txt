<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is vivid—his fingertips “reading” fractures in light and alloy—but the apprentices remain sketches; their dialogue is deferential wallpaper. The earned cost is present: the drone’s flight is his renunciation of control, yet the apprentices add no crucible pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the mended drone departs, crystallizing Elias’s choice to release guidance rather than hoard it. Causality is tight—every beat flows from damaged drone → diagnosis → patch → release—under an Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The depot’s fog, salt, and refracted dawn light are not backdrop but diagnostic tools; water basins become lenses Elias “reads” like braille. Spatial choreography is clean; lanterns, puddles, and the ship’s anchor track believably.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes are simple and legible: restore the drone or leave wanderers lost. Escalation is one deepening—each refracted warmth pattern narrows the repair path—until the final release forecloses Elias’s own need to keep the creation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of stewardship versus possession emerges through tactile action, never sermon: the drone’s flight reweights “repair” from fixing to letting go. Subtext hums in the anchor’s chain-song—every lift is also a relinquishment.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is textured, rhythmic, and consistent to Elias’s synesthetic perception: “light’s warmth pooled unevenly, mirroring the drone’s erratic feedback.” No head-hopping; apprentices’ speech is spare and deferential, keeping focalization tight.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers sensory data and mechanical detail without redundancy. Occasional lyrical flourish (“jewel in the calm dawn”) is earned by prior restraint.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>The blind mechanic who “sees” via refracted heat and alloy thread feels fresh, though the trope of the wounded maker releasing his creation is familiar. Specificity of method—using harbor water as optic—elevates it above cliché.</comment>
