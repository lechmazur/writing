<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara’s guilt-driven compulsion is visceral and embodied; the trembling hands, salt-stiff fibers, and whispered confession keep interiority concrete. The contradiction between her stated duty to “ground restless spirits” and her private wish to erase her own guilt is active in every tug of the needle. Yet the brother’s spectral “eyes pleading through the cracks” is the only moment he exerts relational pressure; his agency is symbolic, not interactive, so the relationship crucible feels one-sided. Still, her final silence after the secret is out reads as credible renunciation with cost: she inherits the quiet she once feared.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the hush shatters and spirits settle, but Elara is left holding a dim needle and a peace she must now live inside—cost is legible. Causal chain holds: jealousy → withheld warning → brother’s death → ritual unravelling → release. The “interlaced hush” is taught early as accumulated silence, so the final snap feels inevitable, not coincidental. Orientation is clean by line 5; prism sanctuary, starlight, marble floor, and her kneeling are all anchored before the 120-word fence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary is not backdrop; its refracting starlight literally supplies the halos that re-form the masks, so environment participates in the beat. Net, needle, and marble floor are tactile, salt-crusted, tracked without drift. Temperature and sound (“cool marble,” “palpable quiet pressing against her ears”) narrow to her sensory hierarchy under stress. The final image of “peace as lucid as the starlit prisms above” re-uses the setting to reweight the stake—an 8+ requirement met.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—free the brother and herself—faces one meaningful tightening: confession mid-ritual makes continued silence impossible, raising psychic cost. Agency sits with every knot she unpicks; each tug releases both silence and culpability, so escalation is causal, not declarative. The moment she names the storm she “let him sail,” the net’s resistance noticeably slackens—visible price on tactics. No reversal beyond the confession is needed; the single deepening satisfies the short-form bar.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the hush motif: unspoken guilt is the real net that traps both living and dead. Subtext resides in the salt-dark fibers—each knot a word Elara swallowed. The final image reframes silence from refuge to prison, accomplishing Conceptual Repricing without moralizing. No thematic echo is spoken aloud; the reader carries the re-weighted quiet away.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person POV stays tight over Elara’s shoulder, perceptual signature fixed on fractured light and salt-taste. Syntax lengthens during unraveling, then fractures into short clauses as the hush breaks—rhythmic control mirrors event. No dialogue appears, so voice is judged on interior diction alone; the diction stays artisanal (“woven illusions,” “salt-stiffened”) without purple drift. Free indirect thought is clean: “the sanctuary itself held its breath” reads as her sensation, not authorial exposition.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sentences carry double duty—e.g., “salt-stiffened and dark with age, parted slowly” shows fiber resistance while implying time. No loops, no scaffold, no mixed metaphors; figurative language is sparse and tested (“fractured memories” pays off when masks re-form). Opening and closing lines book-end with light imagery, creating cadence frame. A single filter verb cluster (“she felt the weight”) is justified by the intangible nature of the hush; it does not dull momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>“Mask restorer” is fresh, and marrying it to ghost-catching via a net that traps silence is a non-obvious synthesis. The prism sanctuary refreshes the trope of starlit ritual; refracted beams become the literal medium for mask-repair. Risk is taken with lyric accumulation over action, yet the pattern is taught early and closure remains legible. The concept feels inevitable in hindsight—not borrowed from familiar templates.</comment>
