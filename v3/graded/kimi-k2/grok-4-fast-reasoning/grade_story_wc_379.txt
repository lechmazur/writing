<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elara’s discerning eye and “listening” stance are shown through concrete micro-choices (sitting, following stories, prizing the locket); the quiet but visible cost—accepting others’ pain without defensiveness—lands in the final image. Interiority stays specific to her thrift-store idiom, avoiding label-speak. One contradictory impulse (curiosity vs. fear of intrusion) could have been sharpened under escalating pressure; as is, motivation is steady but not yet compounding risk.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: locket discovery → neighborhood inquiry → key reveal → mailbox opened, each step a because/therefore. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the spilled letters visibly reweight community ties, cost paid in collective tears and elapsed years. Orientation anchors within 120 words; no teleporting props. Lens (Causal) holds without ambiguity; only minor slack is the off-stage son who never complicates present action.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Courtyard is sketched with dew, bread steam, and spatial tracking; the locked mailbox functions as micro-setting that literally constrains the final choice. Sensory picks reflect Elara’s curator bias—tarnish, moth, cracked glass—integrated into action rather than catalog. Light/dawn progression mirrors emotional thaw, but stops short of overt symbolism. Weather and distance remain coherent across the procession to the mailbox.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“prove listening heals”—is signaled early and tightened when each storyteller adds a withheld letter; the mailbox’s sealed mouth embodies the cost of silence. One meaningful turn: Tomas’s reveal that the key is already in Eliza’s locket narrows options from search to act. Pressure is coherent but civil; no external antagonist raises physical stakes. Emotional cost is legible in the final spill of aging apologies.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the concrete release of letters rather than assertion; the final image of neighbors reading yellowed confessions offers a non-literal answer to “listening heals.” Subtext lives in Harlan’s gravelly pause and the bakery heir’s half-said feud—gesture carries what remains unsaid. No late moralizing; the locket’s inscription merely echoes without sermon. Complexity is present: healing is communal, not sentimental, and Eliza’s own loss stays unredeemed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person narration maintains tight psychic distance to Elara; perceptual signature favors thrift-store diction—“detritus of forgotten lives,” “sandstorm calm.” Rhythm modulates: longer lyrical cadence for dawn hush, clipped clauses when the key turns. No head-hopping; dialogue sparse but voice-differentiated (Harlan gravel, Lena water). Filter verbs are minimal and purposeful.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet textured; sentences carry double duty (action + atmosphere). No paraphrase loops or scaffold. One mixed metaphor—“breadcrumbs in the sand”—is minor and early, not near closure. Strong verb choices (“spill,” “swallow,” “gilded”) propel without purple overload.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Familiar motif of sealed letters gains freshness through thrift-store entry point and curator POV. Community mosaic feels specific to Willow Bend rather than generic small-town. Risk is moderate: quiet accumulative structure rather than twist. Could push further by letting one letter’s content complicate Elara’s belief, but current synthesis is coherent and memorable.</comment>
