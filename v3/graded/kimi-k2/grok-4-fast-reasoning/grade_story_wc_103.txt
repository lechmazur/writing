<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is vivid—his calloused hands itch to impose order while his mind quivers in reverie—but the retrocognitive trap is more concept than embodied struggle; no contradictory impulse is dramatized in the moment of release.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The causal spine is clean: fragment found → visions → disintegration → freedom. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the garden’s pulse syncs with his breath, a felt cost that reweights his stance toward time.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>The living bridge garden is rendered with selective, tactile detail—vine-woven arches, moss, groaning wood—that constrains movement and anchors the hyperbolic maze. The setting evolves from backdrop to active participant in the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>One dominant stake—touch the texture of time—tightens when the fragment traps Elias. The pressure deepens through retrocognitive immersion, culminating in a visible cost: the fragment’s disintegration and his altered perception.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: time’s erosion and memory’s fragility are embodied in the fading photographs and the fragment’s dissolution. The final image of synced pulse offers a non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is textured and consistent—lyric compression, sensory bias, and rhythmic control mirror Elias’s designer mind. No head-hopping; POV remains stable and purposeful throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive, with purposeful metaphor and no loops. Occasional elevated diction (“hyperbolic folds,” “retrocognitively”) fits the conceptual frame without register drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of hedge-maze design, hyperbolic geometry, and retrocognitive time-travel feels fresh and inevitable. The living garden as mnemonic labyrinth is a specific, grounded transformation of familiar tropes.</comment>
