<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is textured and embodied; her micro-choice to place the cicada at the pool’s edge crystallizes her stance and reweights Thorne’s future. The moment of empathy—watching the jade warm under starlight—grounds her motivation without therapy-speak. One slip: “her heart swelled with quiet empathy” edges toward summary rather than embodied cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara’s indirect foresight reframes Thorne’s transition from chasm to gradual ebbing, with the cicada’s fractured reflection as the charged image. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens; the pause thickens until the single spoken sentence reconfigures meaning. Cost is felt in the silence itself.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The grotto’s bioluminescent algae and mirrored pool are not backdrop but instruments: the water’s distortion of the cicada’s image is the mechanism of foresight. Spatial choreography is clean; the lapping edge and damp stone constrain posture and choice. Sensory hierarchy is biased to Elara’s tidal craft—starlight on jade, not tourist catalog.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Thorne’s fear of transition—is signaled early and tightened by the charged pause. Agency is Elara’s subtle act of placing the cicada; the cost is the empathic burden of seeing his scars soften. No external antagonist needed; pressure coheres through silence and reflection.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: time’s texture as layered, rough-where-we-cling, fluid-where-we-release. The cicada’s reflection fracturing into star-speckled shards offers a non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext in the pause and the single spoken line carries more weight than any exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elara’s perceptual signature—selective tidal attention, warmth filtered through chronicler’s craft. Syntax and rhythm breathe with the grotto’s hush; no head-hopping. Dialogue is sparse but subtext-rich: “Time’s texture in transition is not smooth…” distills the reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language (“stars seemed to dance within the tidal pools”) is earned and purposeful. Sentence variety mirrors the ebb and flow; no register drift. Final line anchors by image, not explanation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The tidal-pool chronicler who reads futures in reflections is a fresh angle on the seer trope. The cicada as bridge between stillness and stirring is specific to this voice; removing it would collapse the foresight mechanism. Risk lies in the quiet, accumulative design—no pyrotechnics, yet the closure lands.</comment>
