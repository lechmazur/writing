<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara’s grief-propelled vow is clear, but interiority drifts into poetic paraphrase (“reed-like sorrow”) that keeps emotion at arm’s length; no embodied contradiction is shown under pressure, and the climactic decision to sacrifice her echo is declared rather than rendered as a micro-choice with bodily cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands a Resonant Reconfiguration—her softer, sadder voice is an earned cost—and the Accumulative lens holds: each shell disclosure thickens texture until the final song frays the webs. causality is loose (How does singing literally unweave fate-threads?), but the pattern is taught early and pays off in the closing cadence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Starlit serpentine nexus is evoked with selective sensory strokes; the glowing rune-etched boulder and shell-half function as micro-settings that constrain her kneeling and listening. Spatial anchors arrive by line 5, keeping orientation clean; the final image of winds stilling recharges the opening melancholy hush.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—free her sister’s echo—signaled early and tightens when she learns her own songs feed the webs. a single deepening beat (shell’s final layer demanding her echo) narrows options, but the price is announced, not dramatized; escalation stays textual rather than visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of chosen silence versus exploited resonance emerges through the shell’s disclosures and the final hushed voice, avoiding explicit moralizing. the reed-blown melancholy motif threads without overt symbolism, and the ending’s quiet re-toning reweights prior song-images with felt cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Elara’s perceptions, syntax lengthening and compressing with the wind-song rhythm; no head-hopping or register drift. diction occasionally over-ornaments (“serpentine nexus under starlight”) but remains internally consistent and character-bound.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Strong rhythmic ear and high information density, yet metaphor strings crowd peak beats—“veins of the earth,” “reed-blown melancholy,” “cosmic hum”—blurring causality in the climax. two paraphrase loops (“echoed endlessly… echo’s origin”) dull propulsion; trimming would sharpen the final cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Fate-weaving via emotional resonance is familiar, but the canyon-echo singer whose own voice accidentally powers the trap offers a fresh acoustic angle. specificity of shell-whisper disclosure pattern and starlit labyrinth makes the synthesis feel particular rather than borrowed.</comment>
