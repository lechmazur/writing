<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s stubborn craft and embodied memory anchor the piece; his micro-choice to thread Mira’s ribbon into the quartz eye crystallizes generational stakes. Interiority is specific, tactile, and charged with contradiction—he grumbles yet persists. The final renunciation (refusing to descend until the eye gleams) carries visible cost. Only the off-stage Mira weakens relational crucible pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the quartz eye, mended with ribbon, refracts “persistence of feisty hearts” to a wanderer, reweighting the broken covenant. Causal linkage holds—because Elias persists, the orchard’s accidental sanctuary renews. Orientation is swift; spatial anchors (rafters, nave, vine pulley) remain coherent. Cost is legible in his aching body and the decade-long breach.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The cathedral-orchard is no backdrop; vines constrain movement, rain through gaps nourishes fruit, and the quartz eye’s socket dictates repair posture. Sensory hierarchy narrows to touch and glint under stress. The setting evolves—fruit ripens faster as Elias works—charging the final image. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from beam to nave floor via vine pulley.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can broken vows seed something enduring? Pressure tightens as Elias’s body protests yet he refuses descent; the orchard’s wild fruition mirrors his stubborn repair. One decisive turn—threading the ribbon—renews the covenant’s spirit without restoring its letter. Cost is embodied in aching joints and the irrevocable absence of Mira.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through image and action: vows are deciduous yet fertile; what falls can root. Subtext whispers in the ribbon’s blue dye seeping into quartz, a silent rebuttal to “non-binding” decrees. No moralizing—final image of wanderer receiving the eye reframes legacy as open-ended. Ambiguity lingers: is this renewal or mere afterglow?</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elias’s gnarled hands and sharp eyes; no head-hopping. Voice is textured—gruff mutters, stubborn light, tactile specificity. Compression is purposeful: “quartz-eye mender” condenses vocation and worldview. Rhythm accelerates with rain-patter and slows with ribbon threading, mirroring urgency and care.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet limpid: “vines heavy with fruit twisted through cracked arches” packs sight, weight, and ruin. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or pressure. Metaphors are precise—“leaking wisdom like sap”—and never strain. Final cadence slows to crystallize the reparative act without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Transforms the trope of post-apocalyptic sanctuary into intimate generational repair. Cathedral-orchard hybrid feels inevitable, not gimmicky. Ribbon-as-graft is a fresh, non-obvious solution to spiritual fracture. Risky lyric compression pays off: the ending reweights the premise without exposition.</comment>
