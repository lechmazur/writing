<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation to “graft new meaning onto old wounds” is stated repeatedly but never tested by a forked choice; her decrypting is steady, not pressured. The lotus-hearted ache is named, not embodied in a contradictory micro-action. Interiority drifts into lofty paraphrase (“tender sorrow for fragile lives”) rather than moment-specific tension. She never risks anything we can see—no withheld word, no mis-translation—so the ache stays decorative, not crucible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: twilight, mist, coral, cast-notes layer into a single cadence that culminates in the coral pocketed again—an Earned Stasis whose cost is only the ache we already had. No causal tightening occurs; the decrypting simply continues until the text stops. Orientation is clear by ~60 words and the pattern holds, so no penalty, yet the closing stasis feels preemptive rather than paid for.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Fogged skylight light and humidifier mist are tactile, bias-filtered through Elara’s coastal memory. The plaster cast becomes micro-terrain whose ridges matter to the decrypting action. Prop tracking clean: coral placed, glow caught, pocketed again. Setting steers perception but never forces a tactical trade-off, capping short of 9.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—shared anxieties of separation—is declared early but never narrowed; Jamal sleeps on, unthreatened. No beat raises the cost of mis-reading a note, so pressure stays ambient. Decrypting deepens texture rather than options; the final pocketing only seals the mood already achieved. Accumulation suffices for the lens, yet lacks a visible price that re-tools Elara’s next step.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Theme of translation-as-healing emerges through concrete action—wiping sweat to reveal script—avoiding overt thesis. Coral-as-neural-map quietly reweights “grafting” from surgical to mnemonic without line-level sermon. Final image of pocketed coral lets the ache stay open, resisting moral closure. Would climb higher if that reweighting had forced Elara to relinquish a concrete hope on-page.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person hovers at a lyric distance that matches accumulative design; free-indirect filter stays consistent. Perceptual signature strong—“shrewdly innocent eyes,” “lotus-hearted ache” are idiosyncratic without purple overload. Syntax lengthens and breathes with twilight cadence; no head-hop. Dialogue absent by design; voice remains singular and controlled, though adjective density flirts with drift in final paragraph.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm modulates effectively; no template runs. Some adjacent near-paraphrase (“fragile lives pieced together in this fragile peace”) trims propulsion. Metaphors stay coherent—coral/neurons, mist/veil—anchored to POV. Clean copy; only minor scaffold keeps the prose from full bite.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>The translator-in-wartime hospital is familiar territory; freshness lies in the coral-talisman as synaptic map, a specific fusion of reef ecology and memory. Cast-decrypting is a tactile, low-tech puzzle that avoids digital cliché. Risk is modest—no formal inversion, no POV leap—so bonus stays small. Story passes the “couldn’t swap names” test because coral and dialect notes are irreducibly local.</comment>
