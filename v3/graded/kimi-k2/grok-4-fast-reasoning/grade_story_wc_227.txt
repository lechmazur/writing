<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s contradictory impulses—doubt vs. the need to forge meaning—are embodied in trembling hands and held breath; the final quilting of regret into resolve is earned by the ritual’s cost and visibly changes him.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the exhalation that steadies the workshop crystallizes his stance, the cost is the acid still gnawing the hull, and the causal lens (ritual → meaning → survival) holds without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The acid sea and groaning brass are filtered through Elias’s urgent priorities; the workshop’s sway and sizzle constrain every move, and the final image of receding acid is charged by the ritual’s success.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>A single dominant stake—oblivion vs. meaning—tightens once when the last pockmark forces the deepest truth; the acid’s rise narrows options, and the price (the workshop still imperiled) is legible.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Kintsugi emerges organically from the ritual; no moral is stated, yet the ending reweights prior failures into golden resolve, leaving a resonant afterimage of beauty wrought from fracture.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elias’s perceptual signature—selective, alchemical, breath-held; no head-hopping, and the rhythmic rise of incantatory narration modulates with pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid, each sentence advancing image or pressure; no loops, mixed metaphors, or register drift, and the final line’s cadence mirrors the workshop’s settling sway.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The kintsugi ritual fused to a floating acid-forge feels inevitable and fresh; the synthesis of alchemical craft, memory-quilt, and dire stakes is specific to this voice and world.</comment>
