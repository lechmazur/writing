<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s skeptical drive is vivid and embodied—her fingers on Galileo’s bust, her boots sinking in mud—but the interior contradiction between rebellion and yearning for homecoming is asserted more than dramatized; the final nod from envoys feels slightly gift-wrapped rather than earned by her micro-choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the amber’s glow reweights the premise, fusing alien and human pasts. Causality is Accumulative/Textural—each footprint, statue, and raindrop thickens the pattern until the envoys’ appearance feels inevitable. One transition (door to chamber) is clean. Cost is conceptual yet legible: her skepticism must coexist with wonder.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The tower, rain-glossed stone, and red dust on footprints are selective and tactile; the sculptures of astronomers act as silent chorus, guiding choice. Micro-setting (amber in palm) constrains the final stance. Weather and stone texture mirror Elara’s shifting doubt without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can skepticism survive contact?—is signaled early and tightens as each relic and footprint presses closer. The amber’s reveal is the single deepening that reconfigures options. Agency is present (she lifts, she sets down), but the envoys’ arrival is partly situational coincidence; still, it complicates rather than rescues.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of homecoming as rebellious fusion emerges through image (amber, footprints, rain) rather than statement. Subtext is carried in silence and gesture—envoys nod, Elara smiles. Final image of rain washing the tower offers quiet conceptual repricing: purity is not return but mixture.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays close to Elara’s perceptual bias—selective attention to stone, soil, amber. Syntax is lyrical yet controlled, matching her analytical intensity. No dialogue, so voice distinction is internal; occasional elevated diction (“chemistry of homecoming”) is justified by her academic lens.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with purposeful repetition of “bronze,” “dust,” and “pulse.” Minor loop—“luminous skeptic” twice in two sentences—doesn’t dull momentum. Metaphors (tower as beacon, amber as echo) are coherent and grounded. No line-level artifacts touch the closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Post-contact pilgrimage reframed as molecular reunion is fresh; ancient observatory reborn as alien meeting ground avoids cliché. Specificity of red dust chemistry and amber biology grounds the speculative. Risky lyric compression pays off in the final image.</comment>
