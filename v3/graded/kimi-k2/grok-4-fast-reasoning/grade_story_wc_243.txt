<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is rich and embodied, yet her single decisive change—choosing to restore the covenant—leans more on inheritance than earned contradiction; a notch short of the 9+ bar.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The mosaic of twilight memories tightens to a crystallized stand, the closure beat landing under a Causal lens: ink + locket → covenant reborn with visible cost (time, memory weight).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Setting supplies jasmine-salt micro-details that guide the final act of infusion; the jetty constrains space but doesn’t pivot stakes, capping below the 9-gate.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Familiar premise (archive × memory) is re-inscribed through walnut-ink recipes and tidal covenants; synthesis feels inevitable but echoes other contemporary elegies.</comment>
