<comment>Elara’s phobias are dramatized through embodied action (tight shelves, balcony rail) and her interior contradiction fuels the final stand; however, the leap from “abandoned orphan” to full dossier of forged memories happens in one lump of exposition, blunting the arc’s credibility and capping the score.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Causal chain holds: seashell warming → cipher → exposure → trap; the mid-scene reflective block is proportionate and anchored, and the Earned Stasis ending pays a visible social cost (sirens, bound mentor). One minor causality bump: the stunt-gadget speaker is retro-introduced yet accepted under paranoia seeding, so closure remains intact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Rusted library, cliffside night, and child-sized cast form a micro-setting ecosystem that constrains movement and supplies the weaponized shelf chain; starlight mirrors the “untrustworthy heavens” without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography survives the fight, though the exterior balcony’s geography relative to interior shelves could be one notch crisper.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—proving that her vulnerability can become power—is signaled on page 1 and tightened when she rigs the cast speaker; the final public exposure forecloses retreat. Pressure escalates by protagonist agency under Causal lens; cost (loss of previous identity, mentor, and legal safety) is legible in the sirens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the concrete stunt of weaponizing fear; the “vulnerability = power” equation reframes the seashell and cast as tools rather than wounds. One soft echo in the final clause (“vulnerability, embraced, was power incarnate”) nudges toward statement, but the prior image of Marcus trussed by rusted links keeps resonance earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance, with diction that slips toward cinematic shorthand (“stars framing the damning evidence like a cosmic spotlight”) yet recovers through tactile action. Distinct perceptual signature shows in stunt-centric metaphors; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks; rhythm modulates under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>High information density—sentences carry dual duty—yet occasional modifier strings (“rusted links clanging like applause”) verge on purple; no scaffold loops, only minor paraphrase. Mixed vehicle in “cosmic spotlight” drifts outside POV lexicon but does not obstruct the closing beat, so stays within high-band tolerance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The stunt-double-with-phobias angle, identity-theft twist, and cipher-on-cast device synthesize into a fresh configuration; stunt craft repurposed as code-breaking keeps specificity high. Some tropes (studio exploitation, orphan reveal) are familiar, but grounded detail prevents swap-ability and earns the late reversal.</comment>
