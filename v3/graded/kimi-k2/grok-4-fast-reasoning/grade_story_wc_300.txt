<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elias’s shift from detached assessor to redemptive agent is sketched more than dramatized; the shell’s pull and the instant oath are declared rather than embodied. Interior contradiction is absent—no moment where professional skepticism collides with sudden faith—so the final motivation feels imposed. Still, the micro-choice to pry the pearl and press it into stone is specific and irreversible, giving a modest earned cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the pearl’s embedding reframes the cave from bunker to beacon, a Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost—the inspector abandons his metric world for an immeasurable one. Causality is thin (why this shell? why does he obey it?), but the Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each lyrical shard adds density until the final image reweights everything. Orientation is swift and spatial tracking holds.</comment>

<comment>Crystal surfaces refract lantern light into choice-blocking glare and, later, into connective filaments—setting actively charges the final image. The caves’ geography is sketched in poetic strokes, yet remain coherent enough to stage the climactic embedding. Sensory selection stays inside Elias’s professional eye without tourist excess.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can anything bridge human isolation?—is signaled early and tightened once: the pearl offers a single, irreversible shot. Pressure is abstract (echoed sorrow, radiant promise) rather than tactical, but the final act forecloses the option of leaving the caves untouched. Visible price is conceptual rather than visceral, satisfying the lens but only just.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of reconnection emerges through spiral-scripted grief and crystalline reflections, never stated outright. The ending’s shared radiance reconfigures prior imagery without moralizing. Ambiguity remains—will light truly travel beyond stone?—inviting reflection while avoiding equivalence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Third-person POV stays tight to Elias’s technician gaze; diction favors precision (“fractured rainbows,” “metric world”) yet flexes into reverence at the climax. No head-hop; perceptual signature is consistent. Rhythm subtly lengthens in the final paragraph to mimic breath-release, a deliberate cadence shift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is lyrical but disciplined: no mixed metaphors, no scaffold loops, strong verbs carry weight. Occasional elevated phrasing (“resonant hush,” “drips echoed like forgotten whispers”) flirts with purple yet stays pattern-taught and pays off in the final hush. One paraphrase loop (“abandoned hopes” twice in four lines) costs a hair.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Fusion of geologist’s utility with mystic relic feels fresh; seashell-as-archive and pearl-as-router transform familiar salvation tropes. Risk is moderate—lyric overlay on hard-SF premise—but the synthesis coheres without gimmick. Still, the shell’s lab origin is late intel, muting hindsight inevitability.</comment>
