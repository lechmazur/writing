<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s shift from spectacle-seeker to humility is credibly embodied in her handling of the butterflies and the notebook; the interior contradiction between old hunger for drama and new patience is dramatized in the moment she overlays dust mandala on neutron-star field. Still, the epiphany leans on a single summative line (“realization dawned”) rather than a final micro-choice that costs her something tangible right then; the release of butterflies reads more symbolic than consequential, capping the arc just short of 8+ territory.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: each layer of dust and rust accumulates until the final overlay reweights her perception of stellar decay. Orientation is cleanly anchored within 120 w; causality remains coherent—no teleporting props or info dumps. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the dust–star overlay makes the cost of her past hype undeniable and forecloses old methods. The beat could tighten further—one more beat showing her actively discard or delete an old simulation file would crystallize the DC/RR edge.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Storm-wrecked greenhouse is tactile and specific—salt-rusted frames, osmotic cracks, glittering shards—every detail doubles as mirror of gradual decay. The microscope jury-rigged to a solar panel and the chitinous nanostructures ground the science without exposition dump. Environment actively constrains choice: only the sheltered corner allows dust collection, and the salty air motivates the rust that informs her metaphor. Final image of twilight through breaches tightly reuses the shattered roof introduced early, earning high-band specificity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“strip needless drama from cosmic insight”—is signaled early and tightens as each dust layer challenges her old explosion-centric models. One meaningful deepening occurs when she maps fractal dust onto magnetic-field lines, foreclosing the former sensational lens; the cost is the quiet but visible shedding of her public persona (notebook now “sodden,” no mention of grants or audience). Pressure stays accumulative rather than causal, fitting the lens. A slightly sharper external risk—e.g., fear that no one will fund this slow-work—would push it above 8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: the cosmos, like the greenhouse, erodes by imperceptible degrees, and spectacle blinds us to that truth. Subtext resides in the butterflies’ fragile dust—once dismissed, now valued—mirroring her rejected self. No final moralizing; the overlay of mandala and star field lets the reader feel the reweighting. The concept is coherent yet narrowly iterated; one more mid-scene echo (e.g., a rusting grant plaque) would deepen resonance toward 8.5.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person POV stays tight to Elara, filtering description through professional astrophysicist bias—light refraction, quantum fluctuation metaphors—without head-hop. Syntax lengthens and softens as humility grows, mirroring the “gradual” concept; early sentences carry harder consonants (“shattered panes, submerging planters”). No dialogue to test, yet internal diction remains consistent. A single clause drifts toward textbook register (“chitinous nanostructures could refract light…”) but reads motivated by her expertise.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, image-dense; most sentences perform two jobs—e.g., “Glass shards glittered like fallen stars amid wilted ferns” paints scene and theme in one sweep. No scaffold loops or mixed metaphors; occasional adjectival pairs (“humid decay,” “brackish water”) stay purposeful. Filter verbs minimal; strong verbs dominate (“trudged,” “sagged,” “kindled”). One paraphrase echo—“humility kindled within her, a slow burn… / humility kindling brighter”—repeats concept, but within a short span it highlights progression rather than stalls. Final image is crisp and unforced.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fusion of lepidopteran nanostructures with neutron-star physics feels fresh and specific; not a trope mash-up I’ve seen. The insight that cosmic decay can be modeled by delicate wing-dust fractals offers a genuinely new angle on “grand scale meets microscopic.” Risk is taken—static dust mandalas risk preciousness—yet the piece keeps the science concrete and stakes personal. Transformation is evident: remove the dust or the greenhouse decay and the entire arc collapses, satisfying the inevitability test.</comment>
