<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory yearning to both hoard and release love is dramatized through tactile psychometry. The moment she presses the film to her palm crystallizes her stakes and flaws. Secondary pressure is absent, yet her micro-choice to descend with the strip earns credible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara’s vow to unearth the letters reweights the palace from mausoleum to conduit. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—density and cadence shift charge the final image. Orientation is swift; the timeline holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The projection booth is rendered with selective, sensory precision—dust motes, rusted projectors, the single bulb—each constraining movement and attention. The micro-setting of the film strip itself functions as charged environment. Spatial choreography is flawless.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—locating unused love—tightens through escalating psychometric visions that foreclose detachment. The final choice to act carries visible emotional cost. No external antagonist is needed; internal pressure suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: stored affections as spectral archive, love’s negative space as palimpsest. The final image of letters suspended between frames offers a non-literal answer—redemption through retrieval. No moralizing; complexity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lush yet disciplined, with rhythmic control that mirrors the hushed thunder motif. Perceptual signature is distinct—Elara’s synesthetic spatial imagination colors every observation. No head-hopping; distance remains steady.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; figurative language is patterned and paid off (“hushed thunder” threads through beginning and end). No loops or mixed metaphors. Occasional elevated diction fits the lyric register without register drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The conceit of unused love archived in filmic interstices is fresh and fully committed to. Psychometry as spatial cartography feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
