<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is vivid—his “spiritually curious soul” is embodied in tactile acts like cradling the lantern glass—but the shift from cosmic janitor to cosmic guardian is asserted more than dramatized; the cost of his new stance is implied rather than felt on the body.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each star-trail layers meaning until the final image reweights the premise. Closure is a quiet CR—Elias’s “stand still” moment—yet the causal bridge from shard to insight is slightly under-dramatized.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The station’s hush, the “elegant blades of forgotten light,” and the lantern glass’s warmth are selective, sensorily rich details that constrain Elias’s attention and charge the final image; spatial choreography remains coherent throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding strength in vulnerability—is signaled early and tightens through each mapped star-fall. The deepening is present but soft; the cost is conceptual rather than viscerally paid on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the star-falls’ surrender; the lantern glass’s shift from guide to mirror of Elias’s own fracture is resonant. Final whisper avoids overt moralizing, though “teach me to stand still” flirts with echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose has a hushed, reverent texture—syntax elongates and contracts with cosmic scale. POV remains stable; perceptual signature is consistent, though occasional elevated diction (“primal elegance”) edges toward register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High information density with minimal loops; figurative language is purposeful. One template cadence (“his days blurred into nights”) and a mixed metaphor (“elegant blades of forgotten light”) are minor artifacts that do not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Cosmic janitor at a forgotten nebula station is fresh; the lantern-glass shard as memory vessel is less so, but the synthesis with star-fall cartography as vulnerability map feels specific and earned.</comment>
