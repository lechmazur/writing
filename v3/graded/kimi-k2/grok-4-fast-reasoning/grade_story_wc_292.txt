<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elara’s ancestor-quest motive is vivid; her trembling fingers and locked-door decision embody the “nervously confident” tag. The copper nail beat—decoder then talisman—shows micro-choice altering tactics. Yet no contradictory impulse is staged in-scene; emotion stays singular, capping depth.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: nail reveals cipher → proves foresight → reversal granted → nailed to map as talisman. Closure carries cost—she weeps, nail permanently scars the master chart—so Exile is reversed but world still storms. Orientation clean within 120 w; one shard, one transition (dawn response) satisfies scope.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>“Sodden aftermath,” “spongey dread,” “fractured coastline” filter through Elara’s map-trained eye; station hum and green-tinged nail anchor body/tool scale. Weather presses every beat—dripping walls, lightning etching sky—guiding her urgency. Final image of nailed copper on warped map charges the closing hope with lived-in tactility.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—redeem Thorne—tightens when nail forces a public query that risks ridicule; guild’s terse “affirmation” forecloses anonymity option, visible cost in her exposed tears. Pressure escalates under causal lens: each decoded stanza increases reputational risk until the reversal locks her into new archival duty amid still-raging storms.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Emergent theme: truth’s tidal cost—exile can be annulled yet weather remains ruined, so justice is partial. Copper nail’s migration from coffin to station map reweights “reversible” as material memory, not erasure. No moralizing; final image invites uneasy reflection on whether revelation matters in a broken world.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person keeps tight psychic distance; diction—“warped edges,” “barometer stutter”—mirrors map-librarian precision. Rhythm swells with storm cadence, then stills at “tentative hope,” teaching pattern. No head-hop; register stays consistent, lyrical without purple overload.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentences vary; high-density lines (“hum of failing generators underscoring dread”) advance multiple jobs. Metaphors stay coherent—“barnacle on dying whale” sets fragility tone. Occasional adjective stacks (“jagged permanence”) flirt with excess but peak beat clarity intact; no loops or scaffolds dull closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Jet-stream apocalypse plus archival cipher feels fresh; copper nail as both decoder and penance talisman transforms standard relic trope. Reversible exile concept repurposed into post-catastrophe bureaucratic irony. Risk lies in dense lyricism, but specificity of guild-runed hex head keeps it from generic.</comment>
