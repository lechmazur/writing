<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s silence is embodied through tactile action and the final sung note, but the interior contradiction between muteness and sudden song is only gestured at, not dramatized in-scene; the cost of breaking silence is felt yet abstract.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The causal chain—wrong turn → hatch → oasis → fragment → song → rebirth—lands a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with visible cost (the irreversible shattering of his vow of silence), though the hatch discovery feels lightly motivated.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The abandoned train and bioluminescent oasis are rendered with selective, sensory precision; the halo fragment and misting hush function as micro-settings that constrain Elias’s final choice, charging the closing image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>A single dominant stake—whether silence or possibility will prevail—tightens when the fragment demands voice; the escalation is driven by Elias’s agency, but the price (loss of lifelong silence) is more conceptual than viscerally staged.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of silence-as-possibility emerges through image and action, culminating in a non-literal, resonant answer; avoids overt statement, though the final paragraph flirts with thematic echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person close narration maintains consistent psychic distance; diction is textured and purposeful, though occasional cadence repetition (“misting hush,” “whispering gleam”) edges toward template.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with only minor paraphrase loops; metaphors cohere, and no line-level artifacts intrude on the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>The fusion of derelict circus, living undercarriage garden, and celestial carousel shard feels fresh; the silent carpenter’s song as catalyst is a non-obvious synthesis, though the broader tropes (ruin-rebirth, found magic) are familiar.</comment>
