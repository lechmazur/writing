<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s quiet obsession with the trees and his method of “mapping dreams” give him a distinct interiority, but the story keeps him largely in passive observation; the final smile feels more symbolic than earned from a visible internal shift.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The causal chain—finding the sextant, deconstructing it via dream-maps, reassembling it under moonlight—lands a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the tower’s geometry is newly legible and the trees’ witness is re-weighted. Closure is on-page and carries conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stormlit tower, moonlit corridors, and the balcony’s oak-ringed vista are vividly sketched and tightly braided to Elias’s shifting perception; the healed sextant finally reveals the tower’s own hidden geometry, charging the closing image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Elias’s need to decode the trees’ silent testimony—escalates through each beat of sextant repair and culminates in a single, decisive tightening: the moment the device shows him the labyrinth’s true map. Cost is conceptual but legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of quantified sorrow and celestial witness emerges through concrete objects and actions rather than statement; the final image of “constellations of resilience” offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays close to Elias’s perceptual filter; diction is lyrical yet precise, and the patterned repetition of “mundane miracle” is taught early and paid off at closure without head-hop or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with only minor loops (“moonlight… moonlight”); figurative language is purposeful and never muddles causality. Final third is clean, allowing the closure image to land unimpeded.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The fusion of labyrinth maintenance, dream-mapping, and a healing sextant feels fresh; the conceit of “quantified sorrow” reframes familiar stargazer tropes into a quiet, inevitable synthesis.</comment>
