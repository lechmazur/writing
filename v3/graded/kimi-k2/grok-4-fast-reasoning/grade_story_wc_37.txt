<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is clear and embodied—her trembling fingers on the mica window show the cost of memory. Yet her interiority drifts toward poetic summary (“fractured mosaic of half-remembered lives”) that blurs contradiction and stalls micro-choices. The final song-ritual is earned, but earlier beats lack visible struggle that would sharpen stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the woven dawns re-form inside the mica window, reweighting the realm’s fate. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each recovered song thickens the pattern until the final cadence shift. Orientation is swift; no teleporting props. A single shard suffices.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The greenhouse’s glass panes, glowing fruits, and mica window are tactile constraints that shape Elara’s ritual. Sensory selection is urgent—cool mica, loamy earth—rather than catalog. The setting evolves as the orchard brightens, charging the final image without ornamental drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“rekindle this realm before it dissolves”—is signaled early and tightened by each recovered song. Agency is ritual action, not dialogue; the cost is the exhaustion of memory itself. One clear deepening: the mica window’s frame must be sealed with luminous paste, foreclosing retreat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of communal memory as binding light emerges through image, not statement. The woven dawns shift from lost artifact to living tapestry, reconfiguring meaning at the close. Subtext in spectral figures drawn by melody avoids moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet controlled; patterned elision (“snippets of laughter…whispers of ancient pacts”) is taught early and paid off in the final cadence. No head-hopping; POV remains anchored to Elara’s perceptual signature. Register stays consistent, even at peaks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic—“distilling elixirs from dreams and regrets”—but occasional stacked metaphors (“silken fire,” “frozen wave”) flirt with overwriting. No loops or scaffold; momentum holds. Final line crystallizes without redundancy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Mirror-world orchard of memory-songs feels fresh, though “dying realm restored by art” is familiar. Specificity of alchemical fruits and mica inversion elevates the trope. Transformation test passes: the emotional arc would collapse if transplanted to another setting.</comment>
