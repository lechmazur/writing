<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The librarian’s shifting form and quiet desperation are embodied in the moon-phase mechanic, but interiority remains more atmospheric than contradictory; the final act of “smelting” a smelt into ink is a vivid micro-choice that earns the Earned Stasis closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the librarian’s ritual of absorption re-weights the premise, turning captured identities into living text. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—each smelt adds density until the final image crystallizes the cost of eternal preservation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The tidal atrium is evoked with selective, sensory precision; glass domes, salt-slick gears, and moonlit pools constrain every motion. The creel and moon phases act as micro-settings that directly shape the librarian’s tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes—preserve wonder against erasure—are signaled early and tightened through each smelt; the librarian’s agency is the act of acceptance itself, which forecloses the option of letting identities scatter. Cost is felt in the irreversible fusion of fish and page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of preservation versus flux emerges through concrete ritual rather than statement; the final image of inked identities dancing with the moon offers a non-literal answer to the cost of immortality.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is lush yet controlled, with tidal cadences and metallic diction that mirror the librarian’s hybrid nature. No head-hopping; focalization stays locked to the titan’s sensory frame.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; figurative layering (“symphony of brass cogs,” “narrative nectar”) serves the accumulative design. No loops or scaffold, though occasional modifiers flirt with excess.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The fusion of steampunk librarian, lunar alchemy, and post-apocalyptic archive feels fresh; the smelt-to-ink conceit transforms a familiar ecological lament into a singular myth.</comment>
