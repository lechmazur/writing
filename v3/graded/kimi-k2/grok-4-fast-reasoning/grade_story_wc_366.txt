<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias’s reticence and observant nature are embodied in quiet micro-choices—adjusting the stone stack, pocketing the sea glass—but the interior contradiction between solitude and inherited duty is more summarized than dramatized in scene. The final vow to protect the chain is credible yet feels slightly under-cooked because we never witness an explicit moment of internal cost or renunciation on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The causal chain is clear: storm → lamp out → arrival → discovery of letters → decision to continue the tradition. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis: Elias relights the beacon and embeds the sea glass, accepting perpetual guardianship. The cost is felt—he shoulders Harlan’s vanished fate—though the moment could be sharper if the page showed him acknowledging that he may never leave.</comment>

<comment>Blackthorn Isle’s salt-thick air, rain-lashed glass, and spiral stone path are vivid and selective, anchoring every beat. The lighthouse itself becomes a character whose “luminescent ache” mirrors Elias’s own, and the sea glass glinting atop the rebuilt stack charges the final image with tangible specificity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—restoring the light while deciding whether to carry the unseen burden of the keepers’ chain—tightens once Elias reads the final letter. The pressure is coherent, but escalation is gentle; the story relies more on atmospheric accumulation than a decisive reversal that forecloses a live option.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: isolation answered by anonymous solidarity, safety bottled in fragile glass and words. The sea glass and letters reweight each other at the end, refracting the same ache without moralizing. Subtext hums in every silence and spiral of stones.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays close to Elias’s reticent, sensory lens; diction is maritime, weathered, and rhythmically restrained. No head-hopping or register drift; the prose modulates subtly as tension rises, compressing toward the final beacon flare.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Sentences are lean, salt-crusted, and propulsive; figurative language is sparse and purposeful. Occasional slight echo (“luminescent yet sorrowful, like sunlight piercing fog”) is the only minor scaffold, and it lands early enough not to dull the climax.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>The haunted-lighthouse trope is refreshed by the anonymous letter chain and stone-stack semaphore—quiet rituals of caretaking rather than gothic theatrics. The synthesis feels inevitable, though the premise itself is familiar; the specificity of the sea-glass beacon lifts it above stock.</comment>
