<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s interior contradiction—his wish to atone versus the reflex to control—surfaces only late and is less embodied than summarized; Tomas receives the token in silent beat, so relationship change is declared rather than dramatized. Still, Elias’s earlier miscalculation and the palpable weight of the brass pull give his final gesture credible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Charged Poise: the mist lifts, moon ticks past midpoint, Elias’s choice to hand the pull recycles apology into familial wisdom; lens is situational pressure crystallizing stance. One minor causality hiccup—earlier botched exchange is summarized off-page rather than seeded in-scene—mutes the felt cost a notch.</question>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Mist-swirled parapet and wind-bite constrain footing and staging; distances and chained spy track cleanly. Repeating “mist” and generic “storm-worn stone” verge on filler, but the low moon and sea roar directly shape the timing-of-exchange protocol.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—swap must repair Elias’s earlier failure—escalates as the moon phase tightens the moment of balance; handing the pull forecloses vengeance as live option. Cost is implicit (brother may still choose revenge) rather than viscerally enacted.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of recycling mistakes into wisdom threads through brass pull and moon-phase protocol, but final Lira line edges into explicit thesis (“recycled more than mistakes tonight—perhaps even our enmity”). Emergent resonance is strong yet slightly over-articulated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Voice has selective, brooding cadence (“furrowed hush between apology and forgiveness”) that modulates under wind and moonlight. One brief register drift—“handle it with care—not yank, but turn gently”—reads like inserted wisdom aphorism.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Most sentences advance stakes or texture; occasional lyric scaffolding (“wind howled… mist clung…”) cushions pressure without clogging. Metaphor “handle hidden compartments of the soul” is decorative but brief.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Familiar elements—misty parapet prisoner swap—are refreshed by moon-phase timing and heirloom token, but the beats still echo standard fantasy-negotiator tropes; risk level feels moderate, not bold.</comment>
