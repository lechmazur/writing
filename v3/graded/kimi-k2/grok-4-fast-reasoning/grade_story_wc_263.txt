<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara’s desire to recover lost creativity is cleanly dramatized through the astrolabe alignment and deliberate surrender; the moment her fingers tremble over the brass rings shows embodied cost. Interior contradiction is thin—no active self-doubt interrupts the lyric trajectory—so the “cage” shatters more by cosmic fiat than by earned internal fracture. Still, her micro-choice to lie down and invite risk of failure gives credible hinge for the release.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the final step into the forest crystallizes a charged poise—she carries a new canvas inside her, stardust re-ignited—so before/after is legible. Causality is soft: the astrolabe tracing provides ritual window-dressing but no concrete feedback loop that alters options; the crucial beat is simply “rest” whose success feels preordained rather than tested. Accumulative lens holds (density of auroral imagery reweights stakes), yet one might wish a sharper causal pinch to justify the ember’s flare.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Moss temperature, brass gleam, meteor streaks—selective sensory triangulation keeps the archway tactile without catalogue drift. The astrolabe operates as micro-setting; its engraved voice literalizes the cosmic invitation and steers her final repose, satisfying 9+ constraint. Spatial clarity wobbles once: “across an unwritten calendar” floats as temporal wallpaper rather than grounding elapsed action, but the sensorial weave survives.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—freeing caged creativity—threads every paragraph; the act of rest constitutes the single meaningful tightening, trading agency for receptivity. Cost is aesthetic (risk of permanent emptiness) yet only declarative; no concrete external consequence manifests if the stars refuse her. Still, the lyric escalation (auroras → meteors → internal bloom) accumulates pressure under Accumulative lens, and the final image forecloses the “barren canvas” future, so escalation reads.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of reclamation through cosmic surrender emerges via concrete pattern—star-trails rejoin her veins—avoiding overt thesis. The remembered-stardust motif reappears at closure, reweighting prior material without moralizing. One near-echo (“hidden ember”) flirts with abstraction but is grounded in brass temperature earlier, keeping sentimentality at bay.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Elara’s perceptual filter: synesthetic hearing of star-regrets, fever-vision saturation. Syntax lengthens and breathes with auroral pulses, then contracts at the decision to rest, showing rhythmic control. No dialogue to corrupt register; occasional elevated diction (“rapturous farewell”) is justified by mythic tonality taught from line 1.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm swells and ebbs; sentences open varied. Two adjacent near-repeats (“stardust woven… stardust reformed”) create minor paraphrase loop; figurative chain stays coherent, but density peaks mid-scene without payoff differentiation, costing full precision. Otherwise clean grammar, strong verbs, no scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Star-mapping as creativity unblock is familiar, yet the insistence on rest—not effort—as the activating ritual flips expectation. Specific heirloom astrolabe, auroral archway, and cosmic overhearing cohere into singular atmosphere rather than borrowed parts. Risk is moderate: lyric mythic mode committed without ironic retreat, but concept doesn’t push beyond personal catharsis to wider cultural reprice.</comment>
