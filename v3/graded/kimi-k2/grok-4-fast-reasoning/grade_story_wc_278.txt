<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s internal contradiction—wanting to silence guilt yet clinging to a hope of reconnection—is dramatized through concrete micro-choices (wiring the amber, tracing her tattoo). Guilt’s transformation into forgiveness is earned via tangible on-page cost: the firmware’s final translation that reweights her past.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration: the amber’s Stasis absorbs her guilt, reconfigures meaning, and releases her. The causal chain (letters → firmware → amber) is legible, the inferred Accumulative lens held through a cadence shift that deepens stakes without causal turns.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Laboratory details (ether jars, carved desk) constrain choices—amber port and furniture mechanics matter—and the meteor hush charges the final image. Specificity of tactile handling (wire, drawer) creates vividness that supports, not stalls, momentum.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</question><grade>Stakes tighten as guilt loops demand translation; the firmware’s decoding narrows options and crystallizes the mother’s fear into words. One meaningful deepening—the amber tether—forces a trade-off that forecloses denial.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges from conflict—guilt vs atonement—earned through specific embodied action (amber tether). The final image, silent meteor trail echoing peace, offers resonant non-literal absolution without didacticism.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><question>Distinct lyric cadence—“constellation tattooist under meteor hush”—anchors POV throughout. Compression and patterned elision taught early (silence as velvet quiet) pay off in the charged poise of the ending hush.</question>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops, precise imagery (“amber warm as skin”), and syntactic variety that mirrors emotion under pressure. High-density prose advances story without figurative clutter or scaffold; final metaphor legible and earned.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: tattooed constellations, haunted firmware, and amber entrapment converge organically. Specific risk in quiet ending is balanced by charged specificity; no direct echoes of familiar beats.</comment>
