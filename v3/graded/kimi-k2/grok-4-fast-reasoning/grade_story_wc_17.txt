<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her trembling fingers, the weight of legacy—but the shift from passive discovery to active atonement is compressed; the “map to follow” feels slightly asserted rather than earned in the final beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the negative’s inverted vision reweights the premise, turning legacy from burden to mandate. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each echo and artifact layers pressure until the final reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The ivy-choked manor is tactile and atmospheric, constraining movement and sight; the fireplace as micro-setting anchors the pivotal discovery. Sensory detail is selective, never ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes—atonement versus escape—tighten when the negative reveals the family’s complicity; the cost is the irrevocable shift from observer to inheritor of repair. One decisive deepening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of inherited guilt and ecological repair emerges through concrete objects (diaries, negative) rather than statement; the final image of “walls dreaming in hope” offers resonant, non-literal resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet grounded in Elara’s perceptual signature—sound as texture, light as memory. No head-hopping; free-indirect style stays clean and purposeful.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; metaphors (“veins of green memory”) serve mood without clutter. No loops or scaffold; final paragraph crystallizes earlier motifs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The conceit of “walls dreaming” and echo-cartography feels fresh, not gimmicky; the fusion of climate grief with family archaeology is specific to this voice and setting.</comment>
