<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira’s insurgent past and intent-to-evolve motive are declared rather than shown in moment-to-moment contradiction; she never faces a live trade-off that forces her to question or test that motive. The choice to unseal the embryo is single-track once the kite is found, so the interior tension flattens. Cost is asserted (“her rebellion…bloomed”) but not dramatized on her body or relationships. Still, the telepathic quirk is anchored in one sensory beat and fuels the discovery, keeping her above mid-band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: kite glyph → cavern coordinates → unseal embryo, each beat because/therefore linked. Closure lands a Decisive Change (embryo freed) with conceptual cost—“destiny” now mobile and uncontrolled—legible under the Causal lens. The kite’s appearance is coincidence, yet it complicates rather than resolves, satisfying the Situational allowance. Orientation is anchored by 120 words; no teleporting props or amnesia.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Steam, sulfurous mist, obsidian ledge, and mineral-veined amber are tactile and selective, filtering through Mira’s insurgent eye. Hot-spring geography stays coherent; distance from shrubs to submerged alcove tracks cleanly. The amber chunk functions as micro-setting that constrains the final act—its fracture is the decisive physical beat. One notch down because the larger reconstruction tableau is sketched only in broad strokes of “workers rebuilt bathhouses,” giving less pressure-driven detail than the immediate fissure scene.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“evolve tradition with intent” versus “sealed destiny”—is signaled early and narrows to one irreversible act: break the amber. Pressure tightens when glyphs reveal a cavern that tradition deliberately buried; unsealing it forfeits the safety of inherited hierarchy. The tightening is single but meaningful; no secondary reversal is needed at this length. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral, capping the score below the 8.8 gate.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: tradition as living root, not petrified crust. The embryo image literalizes the idea while the kite script supplies mythic depth without sermonizing. Final image—Mira carrying the pulsing embryo into the reconstruction—reweights prior material, offering a Charged Poise that invites reflection on co-created destiny. One declarative line (“ensuring destiny was not imposed but co-created”) flirts with thematic echo but is salvaged by its placement mid-story.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Mira; no head-hop. Diction—“leafy voices,” “lava-forged tool”—bears a perceptual signature tied to her geologic-insurgent worldview. Rhythm accelerates across the final beats: short clauses mirror the amber fracture. Occasional elevated phrases (“implanted destiny,” “conceptual repricing”) drift toward academic register but remain within her reflective bandwidth.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Sentences carry double duty—action, sensory filter, and world rule—keeping density high. Figurative language is selective; no mixed-metaphor clusters impede clarity. One paraphrase loop appears: “reconstruction efforts unfolded…reconstruction sites,” a minor scaffold. Otherwise propulsion is clean, with strong verbs and no filter-verb stacks in the climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fusing post-eruptive geothermal rebuilding with insurgent botanic telepathy produces a fresh mythic substrate; the embryo-as-blueprint literalizes social engineering without slipping into cliché. Kite-as-codex and plant memory network are non-obvious informatic systems that feel inevitable once revealed. Risk is moderate—lyric compression and single POV—yet the concept commits fully. Could edge higher if the insurgent past were more than backstory.</comment>
