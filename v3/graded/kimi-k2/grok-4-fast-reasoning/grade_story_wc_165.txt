<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elias’s “analytical” tag is repeated but never shows simultaneous contradictory impulses; his choices are smooth, low-risk orchestrations rather than pressured micro-decisions. The bishop piece operates more as prop than crucible—no moment where its loss or misuse threatens him—so the final pocketing feels administrative, not costly. Because no relationship or status crucible is on-page, the single-POV default is met, yet interiority stays safely ornamental (“analytical mind,” “satisfaction deepening”) without embodied irrationality under visible strain.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the arcade’s mood flips from apathy to laughter, the bishop reclaimed in a Charged Poise that reweights Elias’s quiet authority. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each token drop, spin, and tide-governed light cue layers density until the final image crystallizes. Orientation is clean by line 5; no lens ambiguity or teleporting props. Cost is present but diffuse (only the crowd’s boredom is truly endangered), keeping the score below 8.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>“Tidal arcade under indifferent stars” is taught early and returns in the final shells-as-applause image, giving the setting closure-charge. Salt-kissed machines, bioluminescent alcove, and timed wave crashes are selective, sensorily balanced, and directly enable the “shadow dance” beat. Spatial choreography remains lucid across token scatter, wheel spin, and dancer emergence; no white-room lapse. Environment thus constrains tactics and reconfigures the final mood, meeting the 9+ gate even if description occasionally drifts toward ornament.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“serenade monotony”—is signaled early and measurably tightens when the first token hit sparks curiosity, then again when the fisherman’s spin triggers the shadow dance, turning apathy into laughter. Pressure accrues under Accumulative lens rather than causal reversals; options don’t narrow for Elias, they widen for the crowd. Visible price is thin (no personal risk or resource lost), so escalation feels moderate, not urgent. Sufficient for the length, but the absence of a trade-off or constraint keeps it sub-8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly: orchestrated chance as benevolent art versus sterile predictability. The bishop’s diagonal move becomes a quiet metaphor for cutting through routine, but the piece is not reweighted enough to deliver full conceptual repricing. Subtext resides in gesture—the hidden light cue, the timed wave—rather than declarative statement, avoiding moralism. The final image of receding tide and scattered shells resonates without sermon, earning its ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-limited adheres to Elias throughout; no head-hop. Diction—“salt-kissed machines,” “flotsam on the tide”—is textured, rhythmic, and filtered through his perceptual bias. Psychic distance tightens effectively at the climax (“Now, watch”). Occasional elevated phrasing (“orchestrated serendipity,” “calculated wilderness”) risks register drift but reads as the performer’s self-poeticizing, so stays within tolerance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose is lush yet propulsive; sentences vary in length and opening, avoiding drumbeat cadence. Figurative layering is high but pattern-taught early (“calculated wilderness”) and paid off at closure, so density penalty is waived. Minor loop near-miss: “monotony” appears four times in close proximity; not enough to dull momentum. No mixed metaphors or scaffold redundancy in the final third, keeping 9+ eligibility intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The concept of rigging randomness into communal wonder feels fresh, executed through concrete tactile cues rather than abstract magic. Familiar tropes—street magician, faded arcade—are reanimated by tidal choreography and bioluminescent pay-off. Risk is moderate: no radical structure or world-rule inversion, but specificity of sea-lit shadow dance leaves a memorable signature. Transformation test fails if names are swapped, thanks to tide-bound mechanics, lifting the score near 8.</comment>
