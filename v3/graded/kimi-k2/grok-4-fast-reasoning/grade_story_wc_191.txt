<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s longing for organic past is vivid, but interiority leans toward poetic summary rather than embodied contradiction; final ascent feels inevitable rather than wrested from competing impulses.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Single-scene arc cleanly tracks from orchard breach to throne claim; ruby flake’s coded dissolve provides on-page closure with conceptual cost—human essence re-seeded in machine age.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Neon-veiled spires and bioluminescent orchard are sensory and specific; waterfall’s shifting colors constrain stealth tactics, charging the final ascension image.</comment>

<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of nostalgic futurism emerges through concrete juxtapositions (holographic ghosts vs. living fruit) rather than exposition; final image reweights loss into potential rebirth.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>7.7</grade>

<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Post-cyberpunk orchard quest feels fresh via bioluminescent fruit and paint-peel murals; synthesis of mythic throne and data-ascension avoids cliché, though tropes remain recognizable.</comment>
