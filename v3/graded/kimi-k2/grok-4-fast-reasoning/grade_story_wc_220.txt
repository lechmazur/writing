<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Harlan’s contradictory impulses—nostalgia vs. survival—are embodied in the leaf and cylinder; his final acceptance of Elara’s betrayal is earned by prior sensory decoding and costs him the fantasy of reunion. Interiority is concrete, never diagnostic. The wax leaf’s reprise crystallizes his renunciation with visible ache.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the riddle’s answer reweights the leaf from keepsake to coded signal, collapsing distance into permanent estrangement. Causal chain—cylinder → micro-text → riddle → revelation—holds without gaps. Orientation is anchored by “cracked wasteland” within 30 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The scrapyard’s rusted spires and “skeletal frames” constrain movement and echo emotional desolation; the lantern-lit shack becomes micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory selection is biased by Harlan’s bloodhound past—smell of decay, metallic taste of betrayal. No static catalog.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will Harlan bridge distance to Elara?—tightens when the cylinder’s riddle forecloses reunion, forcing acceptance of her survival-driven betrayal. Escalation is driven by his decoding agency; cost is the irreversible loss of the reunion fantasy. One decisive turn suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: memory as echo, love as encoded signal. The leaf’s reweighting from relic to cipher offers a resonant, non-moral answer—distance cannot be bridged, only reinterpreted. No final-paragraph moralizing; ambiguity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is weathered, sensory, and specific—“nostrils flaring at ghosts of decay,” “crimson veins locked in eternal fall.” No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains consistent. Compression and elision (“wild hush wrapped around him like a shroud”) are taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers sensory detail and stakes. No loops or scaffold. Metaphors (“bent fender curved like a lover’s sigh”) are precise and character-rooted. Final paragraph maintains rhythmic control without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: post-apocalyptic bloodhound decoding love via micro-etched phonograph riddle. The leaf-as-cipher twist feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without gimmickry. No derivative echoes.</comment>
