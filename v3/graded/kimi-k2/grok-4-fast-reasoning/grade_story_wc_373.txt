<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s loyalty and dread are palpable, but interiority slips into summary (“curiously steadfast”) rather than embodied contradiction. The watch-fob beats show micro-choice, yet the final cost feels narrated rather than viscerally earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Single-scene arc holds; the three false starts tighten options until the flare-dousing lands a decisive change. Closure is legible under a causal lens, though the patrol horns verge on external deus-ex-machina.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Market’s rot and lantern glow are vivid, selective, and tied to Elara’s stealth. The pier’s geography stays coherent; fog and creaking boards act as sensory constraints that shape her moves.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—father’s safety—escalates through each failed ploy, narrowing options. The flare sabotage is a visible, irreversible cost that forecloses retreat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of fragile trust among outlaws emerges through action, not lecture. The “sound of trust breaking” motif is seeded early and reprised at the flare’s hiss, though the conceptual cost could resonate deeper.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Voice is atmospheric and consistent, with sensory compression under pressure. Dialogue is sparse but functional; slight register drift in “little runners’ games” jars against pirate vernacular.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and propulsive; occasional template cadence (“she retreated… she initiated”) flattens a beat. No overwriting or mixed metaphors in peak moments.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Smuggler-daughter archetype is refreshed by the antique fob as covenant token and the sonic motif of betrayal. The three thwart attempts feel inevitable yet specific to this world.</comment>
