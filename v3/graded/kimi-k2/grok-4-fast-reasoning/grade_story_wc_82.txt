<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elias’s contradictory impulses—grief’s pull toward oblivion versus the artisan’s drive to shape light—are enacted in every micro-choice: selecting the amethyst, recalling Lira’s laughter, folding grief into paper. The final release of cranes carries visible cost: his shadow stays gone, the island keeps spiraling, loss is not erased but externalized. Interiority never drifts into label-speak; pain is rendered as thorns hidden in silk, a tactile, embodied image that reappears in the basilica’s jasmine-thick air. 9+ test met: contradiction in scene, renunciation earned, cost legible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the island’s paradoxical spiral and the last crane’s ascent crystallize options—grief can be launched but never deleted—while the missing shadow persists as unpaid cost. Accumulative lens holds: each polished gem and folded crane deepens the pattern until the final image reweights the stake. Causality is intact; no late rules or teleporting props. Orientation is taught by line 3 (“floating island tea garden”) and anchors remain stable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Glass basilica functions as micro-setting: its refracted rainbow light literally ignites the tea leaves when dream vapor touches them, constraining the release ritual. Spatial choreography is clean—workbench in nave, window for launch, vines threading panes—bodies and objects never ghost. Sensory hierarchy favors Elias’s craft priorities: the chamois’s soft song, jasmine tea scent thickening grief, lantern glow mapping silver-leaf whispers. 9+ gate met: tool (basilica light) charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“can grief be transmuted into flight without erasing the lost?”—tightens once: shadow detachment raises the cost of failure, each crane subtracts raw sorrow yet leaves the absence bare. Agency is continuous; every polishing stroke and fold is a reversible tactical choice that gradually forecloses the option of keeping Lira’s dreams uncaged. Price is visible: shadow gone, island spiraling, lanterns burning tea leaves—felt cost scales to length. No coincidence resolves; spiral is ancient rule, not luck.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from recurrent image set—light caged, paper freed, shadow excised— culminating in the non-literal answer that grief must be shaped but can never be dispelled. No explicit thesis; final image of spiraling island and ascending cranes reweights earlier lantern imagery without moralizing. Subtext rests in gestures: the tremor of callused hands confesses more than any interior monologue. Ambiguity lingers—will the cranes return?—yet stakes feel definitively re-priced.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person POV stays tightly aligned to Elias’s perceptual filter: diamond-dust song, mist-kissed paper, rainbow fire on leaves—all craft-metaphor, no tourist catalog. Rhythm swells and subsides with ritual tempo; long vowel cadences mimic polishing strokes, clipped fragments mark crane folds. No head-hop; knowledge stays bound to Elias (he cannot know if Lira receives the cranes). Experimental compression (“luminous torment”) is taught early and paid off in final flare.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Sentences carry double duty—information + atmosphere—without scaffold: “silver-leaved bushes whispered secrets to the wind” locates garden, sets hush, foreshadows recorded dreams. Mixed metaphors avoided; vehicles stay inside craft lexicon (light, glass, paper). No loops or synonym churn; each noun is specific—amethyst, chamois, dream-weave paper. Closure line breathes: “his crafty hands weaving loss into flight” ends on monosyllabic thrust, momentum released.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes familiar grief-ritual through fresh craft logic: lanterns as dream recorders, gem facets as memory gates, origami as offload protocol—no trope left untransformed. Risky paradox—descent-as-ascent—grounds emotional truth rather than gimmick; spiral mirrors the irreversible subtraction of shadow. Specificity anchor: remove amethyst polishing or basilica refraction and the crane ignition fails; story collapses without these exact elements. Resonates beyond page: reader left holding the paradox of making beauty from unlivable loss.</comment>
