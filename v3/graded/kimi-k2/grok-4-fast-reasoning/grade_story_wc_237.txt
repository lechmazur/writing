<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the crystals in her veins literalize stress in a character-specific way. The micro-choice to dip the quill in tear-ink anchors reflection to present action. The final renunciation—scars becoming luminous dust—earns its cost through prior causality. Only the elder remains too peripheral to exert relational pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the parchment glows, crystals dissolve, and the platform rocks in approval—cost is visible and felt. Causal chain holds: because she revisits superstition, therefore the runes transmute pain into story. Orientation is immediate; no prop or knowledge teleporting. The lens is Accumulative/Textural and remains coherent to the last image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The floating rock platform is not mere backdrop; its thermal sway and centuries of gale-scars constrain Elara’s ritual posture and timing. Steam from the cup, wind’s whisper, and diffused light are filtered through her selective attention. The crow-quill-as-tool functions as micro-setting that charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—transform scars into stories—is signaled early and tightened through each inscription. The single deepening occurs when stress crystals soften into luminous dust, foreclosing the path of haunted memory. Agency is Elara’s; coincidence never rescues. Cost is felt on the page: the ache of crystals dissolving is visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: pain transmuted into narrative is dramatized, never stated. The crow quill and storm runes accumulate meaning until the final glow reweights them. Subtext lives in gesture—the elder’s silent pour, the tear-ink. No moralizing; the image of dust swirling around the quill offers non-literal resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited remains stable; no head-hopping. Prose texture is lyrical yet precise—“saturated hush,” “jagged pains”—mirroring Elara’s scholar-poet mind. Psychic distance tightens under stress: “crystals prickling under her skin.” Dialogue is minimal but purposeful; the elder’s single nod carries subtext. No filter-verb clutter.</comment>

<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances story, character, or atmosphere. Metaphors are coherent—“lightning forked like angry veins”—and never muddle causality. Syntax modulates with pressure: longer breaths in calm, clipped fragments during inscription. High information density without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The premise—runes that heal when inscribed with personal tears on a floating storm platform—feels fresh yet inevitable. Tropes of magical catharsis are grounded in tactile ritual and embodied cost. The crow quill’s reprise as both childhood talisman and scholarly tool synthesizes superstition and scholarship. Specificity of “sky nomad relic” anchors the world.</comment>
