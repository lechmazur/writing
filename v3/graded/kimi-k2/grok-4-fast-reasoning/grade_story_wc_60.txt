<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara’s luminous skepticism is well-inscribed: interior contradiction, embodied emotion, and micro-choices under pressure. She acts, regrets, and reorients; growth is late but earned via the stained-glass box closure. No significant lapses—competence balanced with struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Single coherent pressure arc: breadcrumbs → fountain heart → unstick. Causal linkage tightens options; migration-pause signal works as a temporal frame. Closure lands on-page with visible cost (glass freed, city stirred).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>City fountains function as both geography and crucible: crumbling tiles guide movement, moss-locked pedestal constrains choice. Sensory economy favors vivid selective detail without clutter. Micro-setting (box base) directly ties to climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—liberating trapped memories—drives every beat. Migration pause tightens clock; geese leave, forcing Elara to act. Stakes escalate as fountains creak back to life; final release carries felt cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: skepticism tested by literal memory-flow, patience rewarded by cosmic timing. Final image reconfigures meaning without moralizing. Subtext is gesture (glow, crack) rather than assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays luminous and consistent; no head-hopping. Interior texture specific (“petrified petals,” “moss and time”). Rhythm modulates with urgency, no syntactic loops.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is clear, propulsive, and dense: “glass box unstuck, its panels blooming open” is literal yet lyrical. No loops or scaffold. Metaphor (phantom splashes) charges closure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: skeptic meets mystic via candidly magical box. Risk is low but execution is sharp; ending feels inevitable. No derivative echoes or archetype drift.</comment>
