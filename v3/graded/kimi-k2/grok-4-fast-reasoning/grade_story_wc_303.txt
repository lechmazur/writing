<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interior ache is embodied through tactile handling of artifacts; her mulberry longing is dramatized in the violin beat and leaks into her final stance. Contradictory impulses—dream vs empire—are present in scene, forcing a crystallized choice that forecloses the archive path. The change feels earned via prior causality and visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dream vs empire is threaded as causal tension; each artifact discussion tightens stakes toward the decisive play. Closure unit—the ice-violin’s song—reconfigures destiny, reweighting the promise with a felt conceptual cost. Lens (Situational) holds cleanly from inciting to final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Velvet observatory provides micro-setting pressure: heat against ice, plants whispering stakes through telepathy. The space constrains tactic—no escape from midsummer—and anchors the final charged image. Specificity is selective and tied to interior state; no static décor.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Perforated destiny is the dominant stake; coffee-stain prophecy and plant telepathy act as immediate pressures. Escalation: narrowing to play or archive, no other route visible. Cost is felt in the final note that forecloses the imperial path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Thematic question—dream vs empire—emerges from concrete stakes and resolves in the non-literal violin’s cry. No tidy moral; the mulberry ache lingers as a resonant charge. Closure image reconfigures meaning without authorial statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lyric, interior voice stays specific to Elara’s sensory register; no filter-verb stacks under pressure. Plants’ whispering is cleanly focalized, not head-hopped. Final note’s syntax accelerates, matching emotional crescendo.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is charged and selective yet occasionally drifts into decorative density (three stacked metaphors in one high-pressure beat). Loop screen finds no redundant phrasing; rhythm modulates pressure. One filter-verb cluster near the end triggers minor clarity drag.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Transparent ice violin as fate-propagation device is a non-obvious synthesis; the arctic ritual twist feels inevitable in hindsight. Specificity prevents cliché; risk is thematic rather than structural. No close echoes of prior works.</comment>
