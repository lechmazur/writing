<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s skepticism and taste-shift quirk are vivid, but her final “might carry weather” epiphany feels externally bestowed rather than earned by prior micro-choices; interior contradiction is shown early yet not fully leveraged at closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the compass locks inward, reconfiguring Elara’s self-concept with a felt cost—her prior certainty dissolves. Causal chain holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens; each sensory clue and forest vote beat tightens toward this charged poise.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Lavender bluff, glowing petals, and aurora are rendered with selective sensory economy; the micro-climates of the carriers act as living setting extensions that constrain Elara’s final stance, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—why weather-carriers exist and whether Elara is one—escalates through each sensory anomaly and forest broadcast; the final tightening is her realization that the question now includes herself, with the cost of unanswerable identity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of cosmic entanglement versus human skepticism emerges through image and taste, not statement; the final reconfiguration offers quiet resonance without moralizing, letting ambiguity linger.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lush yet disciplined, with a distinct perceptual signature—metallic fruit, ozone, honeyed lightning—that modulates under pressure; no head-hopping, consistent lyric distance.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic; occasional stacked metaphors (“veins held comet trails”) flirt with excess but never obscure causality or dull the closure image.</comment>

<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The fusion of bioluminescent implants, fungal elections, and personal weather feels inevitable in hindsight; the concept commits fully, transforming familiar eco-SF tropes into a singular vision.</comment>
