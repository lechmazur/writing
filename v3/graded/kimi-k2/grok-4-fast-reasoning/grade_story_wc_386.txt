<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s longing for “purity” is evocative but abstract; it never collides with a concrete counter-desire on the page, so her final smile feels bestowed rather than earned. Her physical scars are mentioned but not once activated in a present-tense choice, so interior contradiction stays theoretical. The absence of another live character keeps relational pressure offstage; what remains is a lone obsession that deepens but never visibly forks.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the snow globe crystallizes one perfect flake, a visual cost that reweights the entire quest. Causality is soft—dream-cameos arrive by aurora refraction rather than because/therefore links—yet the accumulative pattern is taught early and holds through the final image. Orientation is swift and spatially grounded; no lens ambiguity at the end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The glacier-shrine is tactile, pressurizing: veins of blue ice refract starlight that literally feeds the divination. The melted snow globe’s slow re-formation is micro-setting that charges the closure image. Cold, candle heat, and glass phase-change are sensory pivots that alter what is possible in the scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes—“salvage purity from wreckage”—are signaled early and deepen as cameos reveal tenderness suppressed by imperial duty. No narrowing fork or visible price is extracted from Elara herself; the emotional cost is displaced onto the ghosts who are released. One meaningful tightening occurs when the midshipman’s wonder reframes the expedition’s doom, but pressure stays observational rather than personally endangering.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme crystallizes through recurring cameos of gentleness amid ruin, culminating in the single snowflake that embodies reclaimed innocence. No character moralizes; the final image reweights the premise without declaring a thesis. The concept of “windows of connection” keeps theme anchored to concrete mechanics rather than abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person voice is stable, lyric yet disciplined, with frost-edged diction (“slushy memories of a world unthawed”) that stays within Elara’s perceptual range. Syntax lengthens and contracts with auroral drift, never clogging momentum. No dialogue appears; interior monologue avoids filter-verbs and therapy-speak.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense but not purple; each sentence adds image or knowledge. Occasional poetic stacking (“borrowed starlight filtered through fractured ice like whispers”) risks loitering, yet the rhythm always snaps forward. No loops, scaffolds, or mixed metaphors obscure causality or dull the final flake.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fusing Arctic gothic with dream-hacking ghost-whispering yields a fresh angle on Franklin’s vanished crews. The cameo device repurposes colonial ghosts as fragments of tenderness rather than cautionary props. Risk is moderate—lyric accretion instead of plot reversals—but the concept commits fully and pays off in the reconfigured snow globe.</comment>
