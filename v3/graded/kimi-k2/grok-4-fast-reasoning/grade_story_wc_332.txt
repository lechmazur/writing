<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—clutch the dream vs. release it—drives every micro-choice; the final hand-lift of renunciation is earned. Brother-loss backstory is kept under 20 % and anchored to present stimuli. No second character on page, so relationship/status bullets skipped. One slip: “she understood” is mild label-speak at closure, blunting embodied cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens taught by dawn-photography pattern; closure lands as Charged Poise—palette stills, dream set free with felt absence-cost. Causality: each sunrise capture adds pigment density until the spire image crystallizes the renunciation. No orientation debt; who/where/when clear by 60 words. One micro-turn (plate exposed → print reveals cipher) tightens stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Whispering archipelago functions as micro-setting: tide-pool mirrors, cliff darkroom, salt-saturated air constrain camera stability and chemical timing. Brass camera and stained palette recur as handled objects that charge final image. Sensory hierarchy biased to Elara’s chromatic attention—light, pigment, echo—rather than tourist catalog. Weather and rock proximity shape tripod placement, directly guiding choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—capture vs. release the runaway dream—tightens once when projection reveals the spire demands freedom. Agency: her decision to let the image fade forecloses future attempts, price paid in visible tears. Escalation is accumulative: each dawn failure adds pigment weight until the palette itself argues for release. Cost legible; no coincidence resolution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges—absence as generative light—through color chemistry rather than statement. Final image reweights earlier “luminous absence” from loss to gift without moralizing. Motif of disappearing foam recurs naturally in pigment swirl, constraining choice. Resists tidy profundity; ambiguity lingers whether brother’s laughter is echo or projection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person lyrical voice sustained with chromatic lexicon and syntactic shimmer matching Elara’s perception. No head-hopping; perceptual signature filters every noun through light-quality. Rhythm accelerates with emulsion rinse, then lengthens at renunciation. Filter verbs (“she felt”) are sparse and voice-motivated. Brass/chemical diction stays within plausible librarian-artist range.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High-density lines carry double duty: “palette returning to stillness” compresses color fade and emotional quiet. Metaphors stay coherent—light as brushstroke, absence as pigment. One paraphrase loop (“luminous absence” echoed three times in final third) but does not touch closure beat. No scaffold, clean grammar, tense stable.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Light-painting a sunrise to read a dream-cipher is fresh synthesis; trope of lost sibling transformed into chromatic release rather than reunion. Risk of magical photo-projection taught early and paid off. Specific detail—ochres blooming like heartbeats—grounds device. Could verge on gimmick but earns inevitability through palette’s cumulative stains.</comment>
