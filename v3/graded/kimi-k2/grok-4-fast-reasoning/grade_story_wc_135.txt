<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s motive to “compile fragments into meaning” is stated repeatedly yet never sharpened into a concrete risk or dilemma; interiority stays lyric-surf rather than contradictory under pressure. No micro-choice visibly forfeits an alternative path, so the final hum feels symbolic, not personally costly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each shard adds density until the trumpet hum reweights exile from loss to resilience. Closure lands as Charged Poise—cost is collective, not personal—so the price is audible but not tethered to Elara’s own foreclosure; still, the pattern taught early pays off cleanly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Ivory bones, rain-slick docks, and the brass valve create a tactile micro-setting that constrains Elara’s archival method; every find is literally underfoot. Spatial choreography stays crisp through the crowd scene, and weather residue mirrors internal tentative renewal without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Stake—“rekindle communal trust”—remains abstract; no scene beat forces Elara to risk failure or surrender an alternative. Pressure plateaus after the vision; the hum succeeds without testing her resolve against resistance, so escalation is atmospheric, not tactical.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of “navigated absences” emerges inductively from scattered objects rather than authorial statement. Final image reconfigures exile as forge, not wound, avoiding moralism, yet the insight stays communal; Elara’s private calculus is untouched, muting after-burn.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays tightly filtered through Elara’s salt-etched perceptual signature; patterned maritime diction (“whispers of the sea’s forgotten lore”) is taught early and sustained. No head-hop or register drift; rhythm swells and subsides like tide, supporting the accumulative design.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lush but disciplined: no loops, mixed metaphors, or scaffold. Occasional elevated phrasing (“reactively visionary”) nudges toward label-speak yet appears only once; overall density advances image or stakes with every sentence, earning its lyric surplus.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Post-exile archive via beachcombing shards is fresh; trumpet valve salvaged as civic defibrillator transcends familiar relic tropes. Risk lies in quiet resolution—no antagonist, no personal wager—yet the choice coheres with the accumulative, restorative lens rather than feeling evasive.</comment>
