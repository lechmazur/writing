<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elias’s guarded interiority is textured through concrete micro-choices—pocketing the lens, trembling as he draws—so the thaw feels earned. The doodle of the unlocking chest crystallizes his contradictory impulses on the page. Still, the two strangers remain sketches; their sudden trust is more symbol than crucible, trimming the top band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the shared ticket-doodle reconfigures isolation into connection with visible cost—Elias’s registrary neutrality is forfeited. Causal chain holds: lens find → eavesdrop → intervention → reciprocal doodle, each beat tightening options. One transition (shadows to bench) is legible; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Crystal forecourt’s reflective quartz and evaporating rain constrain visibility and footing, shaping Elias’s stealthy approach and the final mist-borne approval. The cracked lens acts as micro-setting that refracts doodles into narrative, charging the closure image. Sensory selection stays inside Elias’s night-registrar bias—star-torn puddles, whispering spires—without tourist excess.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—thaw mistrust—signaled in para 2 and tightened once: the eavesdrop forces Elias from observer to participant, trading his anonymity for possible rejection. Ambiguous clarity of the lens and doodles escalates risk: revelation could expose or repel. Cost is legible: the opened-chest doodle publicly relinquishes his shield.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of transparency emerges through the refracting lens and evolving doodles rather than statement. Final image—shared swirls dissolving into dawn mist—offers non-literal answer: honesty liquefies suspicion. No moralizing summary; ambiguity lingers about tomorrow’s ledger, preserving complexity.</comment>

<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-single POV stays tight to Elias’s perceptual filter; no head-hop. Prose rhythm echoes his hush-footed caution—long vowels, muted consonants—then fractures into shorter strokes during the doodle exchange. Compressed lyric diction (“crystal whispering forecourt”) is taught early and paid off in the humming crystals at dawn.</comment>

<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty: “lens…whispered of change” marries object to stakes without scaffold. Mixed metaphors avoided; cracked lens / frozen lake / melting bridge remain coherent under transparency motif. One paraphrase loop—“mistrust…thawing…thaw”—but it fuses theme to image and does not stall climax.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Post-language society told through registrar’s ledger and glyphic doodles freshens familiar silence trope. Lens-as-refractor-of-trust repurposes a mundane relic into stakes driver. Risk taken: entire beat conveyed in penciled symbols; execution lands, though archetype of lonely observer is recognizable.</comment>
