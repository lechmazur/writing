<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—her calloused hands on frost-etched rails, the shard’s silence sharpening focus—but the “retrocognitively blessed” gift is asserted more than dramatized; we see visions, not the cost of using them. The final choice to rekindle the beacon is earned by her accumulated micro-choices, yet the emotional contradiction between doubt and faith could be more embodied in-scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the beam ignites, reweighting every prior coincidence as “threads of meaning.” Causality is situational—coincidence complicates, then crystallizes—but the lens holds. Orientation is clear by line 3; no teleporting props. One minor drift: the prism’s reassembly feels slightly telescoped.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The glass humming pavilion is tactile—translucent panels vibrating with “earth’s own breath”—and its cliff-perch constrains every search for shards. Star charts and scrap astrolabe ground the sky as lived workspace. Selective sensory detail (frost, thistle seeds) mirrors Elara’s narrowed focus under pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—prove coincidences carry meaning—tightens when the prism’s absence keeps the tower dark. Each shard found is a micro-victory that raises the cost of failure; the final ignition forecloses the option to abandon hope. Agency is steady scavenging and calculation, not luck.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through the prism’s refraction: meaning is not inherent but made by human attention. The thistle-seed image bookends the arc, shifting from fragile drift to deliberate planting. No moralizing—just the charged image of light slicing a ruined horizon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays close to Elara’s perceptual filter—“her calloused hands,” “shard of hush” as felt silence. Syntax tightens under pressure: short clauses during storms, longer lyrical stretches at dawn. No head-hopping; voice remains consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet textured—“frost-etched rails,” “thistle-blown hope.” Occasional poetic stacking (“earth’s own breath captured within”) skirts purple but serves atmosphere. No loops or scaffold; information density high. One mixed metaphor—“thistle-light hope”—barely audible.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Post-apocalyptic lighthouse custodian is familiar, yet the shard of hush and retrocognitive star-mapping feel freshly combined. The prism’s refraction of meaning itself, rather than mere rescue, offers a non-obvious angle. Specificity of scavenged astrolabe and star charts grounds the concept.</comment>
