<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority leans on stock phrases (“raw solace,” “frayed nerves”) and diagnostic self-labels that dampen embodied contradiction; the accordion beat late provides a micro-choice but the forgiveness turn is asserted rather than dramatized with visible cost, so the shift feels pre-decided. Still, the river-observer vocation filters perception consistently and the brother-guilt motive stays legible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final wheezed note reweights earlier map-and-river imagery with undeniable emotional cost, satisfying RR. Causal chain is thin—graffiti line functions as coincidence that spurs interior pivot rather than earned reversal—but lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds; orientation clear by word 90. One causality hiccup: timetable scrawl is treated as revelatory yet its authorship/motive is untethered, softening the “because.”</comment>

<comment>Station flora, flaking tape, must-air, and ivy-on-skin tactile details are filtered through ex-medicine clarity; each new zone supplies one fresh sensory hook that guides slow advance. Accordion’s return recharges prior riverbank memory, giving the object micro-setting power that constrains the final image—meets 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—self-forgiveness—signals early; pressure escalates via discovery of private map references that tighten the emotional noose. Yet the decisive tightening comes from graffiti coincidence, not protagonist agency, so escalation feels visited upon him rather than wrought by him; cost is present but not visibly paid by an on-page sacrifice or trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of redirecting guilt’s current emerges through recurring water/river images and the final accordion cadence; no explicit moralizing. Subtext operates in timeline graffiti, but its anonymous source blunts irony. Resonance is palpable yet stops short of reconfiguring prior moral accounting—ambiguity remains but lacks a sting of new weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Third-limited sustains a river-chronicler perceptual signature—compass imagery, fork-talk, riparian verbs. Rhythm modulates with longer clause-rivers for calm, fragment spurts for shocks. No dialogue to test; free-indirect stays clean. Occasional elevated diction (“renunciation,” “conceptual repricing”) drifts above Elias’s likely lexicon but brief.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Strong read-aloud cadence and sentence variety; most lines carry dual duty (action + atmosphere). Over-figurative patches (“veins of green blood,” “skeletal relic”) cluster in early description without pattern payoff; one paraphrase loop (“daringly methodical” repeated twice in close succession) clips momentum. Otherwise clean, no artifact touches closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Flooded-station-as-confessional is fresh turf; pairing it with hidden river-map timetable converts infrastructure into memory palimpsest, a smart synthesis. Core arc (grief, forgiveness) is familiar, but specific chronicler toolkit and medicated/untreated perception shift give individualized glaze. Risk is moderate—structure is safe linear walk-through—but finishing on unpolished accordion squall rather than explanatory sob confers distinction.</comment>
