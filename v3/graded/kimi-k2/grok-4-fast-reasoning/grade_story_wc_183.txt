<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s twin-quest motive is vivid and embodied (swatch pressed to thigh, voice weaving). Contradictory impulses—bliss in abnormality vs. dread of erasure—co-exist, but the beat where she “smiled” at the end feels unearned: no micro-choice shows her accepting the cage, so the cost is asserted, not felt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: swatch → spoken story → fog parting → memory shift. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the ship lurches back into fog, smile crystallizing that the quest will continue inside the cage. Cost is conceptual—not yet visceral—keeping it just shy of 8+.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Salient, selective carny wreckage (rusted railing, moldy plush eyes, corroded calliope pipes) stays inside Elara’s drift-attention and funhouse-mirror bias. The emerald swatch as micro-setting constrains her final act of inscription, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover Lira before mind frays—tightens once: fog parts, revealing shore/garden, then ship yanks her back. Agency is textual invention; the tightening is clear but the price (loss of proximity) is off-stage, so pressure spikes without tangible forfeiture.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of naming-as-survival emerges through image (wilted roses of identity) rather than statement. Final smile re-weights the emerald swatch from child game to lifeline, offering ambiguous endurance—no moral spelled out. Could climb higher if the garden’s conceptual stakes had social resonance on-page.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lush yet controlled cadence mirrors Elara’s hyrbrid awe: “calliope ghosts whispering through corroded pipes.” One sustained POV, perceptual signature sharp (mist as both freedom and cage). No dialogue to test, but interior idiom stays consistent under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>High-density lines carry triple duty—image, emotion, world-rule—without scaffold. Occasional poetic overlay (“unkindled solace”) risks abstraction, but metaphor axis holds: carnival = memory palace. No loops or mixed vehicles near closure; rhythm breathes with ship lurch.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Carnival-as-liminal-memory-barge feels fresh;缝合 chimera twin and narrative-weaving rescue avoids stock rescue arcs. Risk is moderate—lyric accretion over plot—but specificity of moldy plush eyes and dress-swatch ritual keeps it from feeling generically Gothic.</comment>
