<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s contradictory impulses—tending roses vs. purging static—are dramatized in real time; the burn sequence embodies cost via blistering synthetic skin. Interiority is specific, never diagnostic. Final stance crystallizes through earned renunciation of total erasure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the miniaturized fears become fuel, not ash, reconfiguring Elias’s relation to memory. Causal linkage holds—each shard burned tightens the next choice—under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Cost is legible in the blistered chassis and the retained shard.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Glass dome, magnetic storm, and roses constrain every move; the box’s cooling metal charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy filters through Elias’s mechanical yet tactile perception. Spatial choreography is clean; no white-room drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prevent farm collapse via self-calibration—is signaled early. Escalation occurs through each shard’s burn, narrowing options until only retention of the final fear remains. Agency drives every intensification; coincidence is absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of fragmented wholeness emerges from Elias’s literal fragmentation and reassembly of memory. No moralizing; resonance arises from the cooled box’s ember glowing like a rose node. Final image reweights prior motifs without statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is distinct—measured, slightly metallic lyricism that modulates under stress. No head-hopping; POV remains anchored in Elias’s hybrid sensorium. Syntax mirrors his oscillation between precision and static haze.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; no loops or scaffold. Metaphors (rust-nostalgia, thorn-static) are precise and internally consistent. Rhythm accelerates during burns, then settles into calm hum—tight control without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of android-gothic and desert-rose pastoral; the “controlled burn of fears” is a non-obvious conceit executed with rigor. Risky compression of backstory into shards pays off in the final ember. Feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
