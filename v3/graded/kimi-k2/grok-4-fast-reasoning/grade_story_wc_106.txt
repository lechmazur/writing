<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s desire to “steal illuminated moments” is vivid, but her interiority drifts toward poetic abstraction (“destiny’s door”) rather than embodied contradiction; the final shift from thief to guardian is signaled more than dramatized, though the moonlit transformation carries felt awe.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Single-scene arc holds: flower code → portrait → moonbeam jar → cosmic map. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as moonlight rewrites the painting and Elara’s role; causality is lyric rather than tight, but the lens (Accumulative/Textural) is coherent and the cost—loss of anonymity, burden of guardianship—is legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Emerald Station’s tiles, moonlit shadows, and the velvet-draped easel are selective, sensory, and purposeful; the setting actively guides Elara’s choices (lilies bow left) and charges the final image when moonlight transfigures the portrait.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—claim a prophecy-laden portrait—tightens once: the golden hour’s end forces the grab. Agency is present but external (vendor’s bouquet, moonbeam jar); the deepening is atmospheric rather than a hard choice, yet the cost of exposure and new guardianship is palpable.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of stolen light as destiny’s key emerges through image and action, not statement; the moonlit reconfiguration of the portrait offers a resonant, non-literal answer about legacy and responsibility, avoiding moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Voice is lush, lyrical, and consistent; perceptual signature is painterly (“molten honey,” “silvery jade”). No dialogue, so no voice clash; occasional poetic density flirts with overwriting but stays within POV’s aesthetic frame.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is textured and propulsive, but stacked metaphors (“forbidden emeralds,” “liquid silver”) occasionally blur clarity; no loops or scaffold, yet a few sentences could lose modifiers without loss.</comment>

<question>8</question><question>8.0</question>
<comment>Familiar “secret prophecy art” premise is refreshed by floriography-as-code and moonbeams as literal medium; synthesis feels organic, though risk is moderate rather than bold.</comment>
