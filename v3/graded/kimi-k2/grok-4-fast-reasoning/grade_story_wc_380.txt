<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s grief-anchored motivation and gradual reclaiming of his wife’s memory feel lived and earned, with micro-choices (kneeling, digging, lantern steadiness) tracking his emotional arc. Flaws are minor: one line of premature diagnostic-speak (“a fragment of memory, deleted”) and a slight over-articulation of the memory-return epiphany. Still, his Earned Stasis at the end—accepting the cost of remembering—lands under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The whale’s death triggers a tight causal chain: beach → memory slip → salt-chamber ritual → flower recovery → closure. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the wildflowers re-weight Elias’s grief into active stewardship of the docks. No telegraphing or soft resets mar the arc’s integrity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The chamber’s gleaming salt crystals constrain every step with fluctuating gravity pockets, shaping tactics rather than serving as backdrop. Sensory anchors (cold brine, rainbow fractures) integrate into action without ornament. The environment’s final mirror of Elias’s regained memory is precise and earned.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—retrieving a deleted memory—escalates cleanly from whale-portent to flower-exhume, with one visible cost: the loneliness of remembering. The middle lacks a second hard tightening—gravity pockets don’t further complicate tactics—but pressure remains coherent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from Elias’s choice to bear the cost of memory rather than forget; no tidy moralizing. The wildflowers’ return as proof that deletion is not erasure offers a quiet, resonant closure without platitudes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays close to Elias with a tactile, salt-bitten diction and rhythmic variation under gravity shifts. One stray register drift (“crystalline growth”) is mild; dialogue (when minimal) carries lantern-lighter idiom and subtext.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive—no loops or scaffold. One filter-verb stack (“the gleaming silence that followed”) is brief; metaphorical vehicles stay coherent. Read-aloud rhythm accelerates during the dig scene and then crystallizes in the final image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Combining memory-loss with salt-crystal memory storage via gravity pockets gives a fresh synthesis; the wildcard (coffee-ground divination) feels organic because it guides the dig that unearths the flowers, not tacked on. Risky lyric mode pays off.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Elias’s lantern-lighting profession seeds early context and resurfaces in the final beat—he steadies the lantern again with reclaimed memory. Yet his choices are more reaction than driver until the dig.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The wildflowers appear first as forgotten bundle, then exhumed—fully reweighting grief into reclaimed joy in the final image. Their scent unlocks memory and charges the dock-scene epiphany.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Gravity pockets literally control how heavy the lantern feels and how clumps of earth move; they enable the dig’s risk and link body to memory physics.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade>
<comment>Fluctuation is named early and affects objects, but the rule could be applied more dramatically—once Elias nearly drops the lantern—before scoring higher.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Exhuming the parcel shifts quest into payoff, directly unearthing the memory trigger. The action is specific and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade>
<comment>Coffee-ground divination guides the dig path but mechanics are underused; a second iteration would strengthen integration.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade>
<comment>The chamber’s gravity pockets pressure movement, but the salt walls are more backdrop than tool until the final reflection, limiting full leverage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade>
<comment>Time after beaching is tracked—“by dawn” and lantern morning—but no ticking clock tightens pressure beyond natural urgency.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Elias’s need to recover memory is dramatized through lost face then the flower payoff, with visible emotional cost when remembering returns pain.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>“Gleaming silence” threads from whale days to crystal chamber and docks, modulating from eerie to reverent and landing in crystallized stillness.</comment>
