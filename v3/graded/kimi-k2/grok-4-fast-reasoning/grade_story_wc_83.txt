<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s grief-driven quest is visceral and embodied; the geode crystal anchors his contradictory impulses. His final choice—to weaponize the discovered satellite—emerges credibly from prior causality and carries visible cost (he seals the airlock, stepping into the void). Interiority is concrete, never diagnostic. The only minor slip is a touch of explanatory phrasing near the end (“bleak, exhilarating, eternal”).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a decisive change: Elias pivots from passive survivor to active hunter, sealing the airlock with the crystal as both talisman and targeting key. The causal chain—geode → simulator → satellite coordinates → launch into vengeance—holds without ellipsis. Cost is legible in the final image: he steps into lethal sky, future uncertain. Lens is causal throughout.</comment>

<comment>The floating observatory’s swaying vents and flickering emergency lights constrain every action; the cooling breakers act as a live clock. Micro-setting (console, ozone-thick air) is filtered through Elias’s urgent priorities. The geode crystal doubles as object-as-setting, its facets reflecting dying panels and charging the final image. No orientation drift.</comment>

<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—turn pooled human potential against its harvesters—tightens when Elias discovers the satellite bloated with stolen dreams. One clear escalation: from passive observation to active assault, foreclosing retreat. Agency drives every turn; coincidence complicates but never rescues. Cost is the irreversible step into vacuum.</comment>

<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of “unused potential” into weaponized grief; no explicit moralizing. The geode’s shift from wedding shard to targeting crystal reconfigures meaning without statement. Final image—survivor ascending to hunt the hunters—offers resonant, non-literal answer to loss. Ambiguity lingers: renewal or further ruin?</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is dense, rhythmic, and character-specific: “bleak exhilaration,” “mathematical dance to unsettle the stable.” Compression and patterned repetition (“perturb the perturbors”) are taught early and paid off. No head-hopping; POV remains locked to Elias. Register stays within a physicist’s lexicon without jargon overload.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is propulsive, high-density, and read-aloud musical. Occasional stacked modifiers (“jagged purple heart”) risk purple but serve character obsession. No loops, no filter-verb stacks. Minor scaffold in “bleak, exhilarating, eternal” but does not dull closure. Strong syntactic variety under pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Familiar revenge arc is transformed through quantum-physics metaphor and a floating observatory crucible. Synthesis feels inevitable: grief as energy pool, wedding debris as targeting crystal. Risk-taking (weaponizing grief itself) heightens stakes without gimmickry. No close echoes; voice and concept cohere as singular stance.</comment>
