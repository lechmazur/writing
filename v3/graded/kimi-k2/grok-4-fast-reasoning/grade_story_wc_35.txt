<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—tasting memories, absorbing regret—but the moment she kneels at the pool the text tells “remorse flooded her” rather than showing a contradictory impulse in scene. The final absorption of orbs is a decisive micro-choice, yet the cost (physical chill, psychic overload) is asserted, not embodied. Still, her chef-sensorium is specific and steers every beat; no stock phrases intrude. Enough motive clarity and sensorial particularity to clear the 7-band, but not yet the 8-band where we would feel the orbs scraping her soul in real time.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the last orb dissolves, dream closes, dawn returns—an Earned Stasis with lingering cold as visible price. Causality under Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each tasted orb tightens density until the final cadence shift. Orientation anchor (chef, fortress courtyard, post-storm night) appears within 60 words; no penalty. The buried pavilion is a sudden teleport, but the dream-logic taught early (“dream’s haze”) waives the break. One tighten only, but it reweights her palate from haunted to healed, satisfying short-form scope.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Desert fortress, flash-flood basins, bioluminescent ice-coral—details are selective, tactile, filtered through Elara’s culinary eye (“flour of half-forged breads”). The tidal pools in courtyard sand mirror the frozen rivulets inside the pavilion, creating a micro-setting recursion that charges the final image. Rain-cooled air vs. eternal frost supplies tangible temperature cost that later numbs her fingers. Spatial track clean: dunes→wall→courtyard→hidden stair→basin.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—purge accumulated remorse—signaled in paragraph two and escalates as each orb is swallowed, raising psychic cost. One meaningful tightening: the moment she chooses raw ingestion over culinary mediation, foreclosing her former method. Under Accumulative lens the density of regret orbs reweights the stake without external reversals. Cold ache in bones serves as visible price, legible at climax.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of transmuting grief into wisdom emerges through the chef’s literal tasting of memories; no explicit thesis stated. The tidal-pool motif (sand basins → ice rivulets) quietly mirrors the refining process, reprised at closure when dawn “gleams anew.” Final image of cooking to heal rather than haunt offers resonant reconfiguration without moralizing. Ambiguity remains: will new diners refill the basin?</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person hovers at a calibrated psychic distance close enough to taste “brittle as parched ground” yet wide enough to note starlit reflections. Syntax flexes with pressure—compressed clauses during orb ingestion, longer cadence during desert walk. No head-hop; POV stable. Diction stays within Elara’s culinary lexicon; even “crystalline basin” reads as her sensory category. Minor rhythm repetition (“one by one…”) is purposeful, taught by ritual context.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often does three jobs—e.g., “faint glow of rainwater pooling…mirroring the starlit sky” supplies setting, mood, and stakes in fifteen words. No paraphrase loops or mixed metaphors; vehicles consistent (sand, frost, broth). One filter-verb cluster (“she felt…she saw…”) appears mid-story but occurs outside the peak beat, so −0.3 only. Closure line is crisp, image-driven, no scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Memory-tasting chef + desert flash-flood revealing an ice-coral vault is a fresh synthesis; neither trope feels borrowed. The pavilion stores remorse as freezer-burned caviar—an image that could only emerge from this premise. Risk in marrying water and ice under dunes is acknowledged by “eternal frost,” committing to the rule. Transforms typical “buried trauma” narrative into sensory alchemy without losing emotional credibility.</comment>
