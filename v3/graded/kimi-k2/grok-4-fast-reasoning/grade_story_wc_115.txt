<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias’s reckless streak is shown through tunnel entry and radio-code “appraisal,” but the brother-abandonment guilt arrives as a late lumped confession rather than an embodied, scene-tainted undercurrent; the micro-choice of pocketing the valve is strong, yet the final surrender to memory feels narrated rather than dramatized with visible cost, so the arc tilts informed rather than earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The causal spine is clear: find relic → hear callers → meet ghost → hear confession → own guilt, each step because/therefore; the valve-as-talisman tightens the linkage and the hush-moment supplies a charged poise closure with conceptual cost. Orientation is clean within 120 words and the single transition (tunnel → chamber) is legible. No teleporting props or plot amnesia.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Rust, coal-slick air, beaded metal, and collapsing beams are filtered through Elias’s urb-explorer gaze; the valve wheel micro-setting doubles as conscience-projection and literally steers the climax. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly; weather (damp, drip) affects mood but not tactics, keeping the focus tight.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes—“swallowed truth” versus living denial—are signaled early; the ghost’s confession tightens the screw by forcing a mirror, and the valve’s burn supplies a visceral price. Agency is mainly interpretive (listening, appraisal) rather than active reversal, acceptable under situational lens, but the escalation is single-noted; one meaningful tightening, no secondary reversal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The industrial-haunting trope is re-weighted into human culpability: machinery keeps score of silence. Theme emerges through beaded steam imagery and parallel father/son failures, avoiding explicit moral. Final hush-image invites reflection without tidy lesson, though the brother tangent is thinly seeded.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-limited clings to Elias’s skeptic gaze; perceptual signature favors mechanical metaphors (“skeletal frames whispering secrets”). Syntax lengthens under dread, shortens at apparition—rhythmic control without monotony. No dialogue tag errors; the ghost’s two rasped lines carry subtext of absolution-seeking.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Most sentences dual-task; some adjective stacking (“drowsy alertness…abandoned train tunnel like a hesitant thought”) edges purple but stays POV-true. One scaffold pair (“drowsy yet alert” repeated) and a mixed metaphor (“vein pulsing with half-remembered life”) slightly dull closure intensity; otherwise clean and propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Urban-explorer meets industrial-ghost is familiar, but the valve-wheel as confession-trigger and talk-radio callers as oracle give fresh wiring. Specific mill jargon (glass-beaded steam valve) and sociological detail (late-night psychic callers) particularize the frame. Could swap names and still function, but the sensory-hardware fusion feels idiosyncratic enough.</comment>
