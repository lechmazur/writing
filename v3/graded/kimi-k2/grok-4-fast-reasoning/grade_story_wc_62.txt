<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is vivid and embodied—his chisel pausing, the ribbon unrolling, the stone yielding under pressure—yet the “fiercely meditative” trait is more asserted than dramatized in contradictory action. The final renunciation of solitary grief for collective inscription is earned, but the spectral mentor’s dialogue edges toward thematic exposition rather than pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the gravestone becomes a communal monument, the ribbon’s weave made visible in stone, with the cost of Elias’s prior isolation felt in the hush after Liora fades. Causality holds—each dusk visit tightens the braid of grief until the pattern crystallizes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The greenhouse’s humid dusk, rusted panes, and butterfly storm are selective and purposeful, constraining movement and attention; the ribbon’s colors literally catch the last light to reveal hidden knots. Micro-setting (the half-carved stone, the vines brushing glass) charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—how to shape collective grief—escalates through nightly retracings; each dusk visit forecloses the option of private mourning. The final inscription is a visible price: Elias sacrifices the neat closure of a single name for the harder, shared curve of the ribbon’s braid.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the accumulating pattern of ribbons, poems, and butterflies rather than statement; the ending’s communal gravestone offers a resonant, non-literal answer to how grief can be both shared and beautiful. No moralizing intrudes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is textured and consistent—damp earth, wilting vines, “silent thunder” of wings—without overwriting. Liora’s spectral diction is slightly elevated but remains distinct; Elias’s perceptual signature (stone dust on fingertips, ribbon colors as memory) holds throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers sensory detail or interior motion. Occasional lyric heightening (“thundering calm”) is earned by pattern and never stalls momentum. No loops or mixed metaphors mar the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The butterfly-migration frame and ribbon-relic are familiar motifs, but their synthesis into a communal gravestone feels inevitable and specific to this family’s ritual. The spectral mentorship is transformed from trope to tactile guide via the ribbon’s touch on stone.</comment>
