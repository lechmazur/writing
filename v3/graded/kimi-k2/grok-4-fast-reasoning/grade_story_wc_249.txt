<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—her contradictory impulses to obey the program and to subvert it play out in embodied drumming and spatial choices. The final renunciation (guarding the dream alone) is earned by prior causal beats and carries visible emotional cost. Secondary characters remain off-page, so relationship crucible is N/A; the single-POV focus is coherent.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elara’s quiet refusal to surrender the dream forecloses reunion yet preserves the shared memory at palpable cost. Causality is intact—each drumbeat tightens the entanglement until the final hush crystallizes her stance. Orientation is anchored early; the lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through the cadence shift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The sound wave garden is not mere backdrop; its bioluminescent vines and auric lagoon actively constrain tactics—drumming on water versus metal alters resonance. Micro-setting (the spire’s edge, the lagoon’s liquid light) charges the final image where Elara keeps vigil. Sensory specificity is selective and POV-filtered.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—salvage the shared dream—tightens via each percussive attempt that fails to restore Kai. Escalation is one sustained intensification: drumbeats grow desperate as memories dim, culminating in the hush where the dream is preserved only within her. Cost is felt in the final solitude.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: memory as rebellion against oblivion. The garden’s sonic ecology literalizes this without overt statement; the ending’s image of Elara drumming alone reweights the premise—rebellion succeeds by internalizing loss. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is lush yet disciplined, modulating from lyrical expansiveness to percussive staccato under pressure. Perceptual signature is consistent—Elara notices through sound and vibration. No dialogue, so voice purity is maintained; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; figurative language serves the sonic motif without clutter. Rhythm mirrors the drumbeats—long rolling sentences swell, then fragment under stress. No loops or mixed metaphors; final image is crystalline.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The memory-entanglement conceit is familiar, yet its enactment through percussive gardening feels fresh. Risky lyric compression pays off: the universe’s hush becomes a live constraint. Synthesis of sound-as-memory and rebellion-as-solitude is inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
