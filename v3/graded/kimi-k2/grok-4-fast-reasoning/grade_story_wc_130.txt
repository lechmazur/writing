<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elowen’s grief and scholarly drive stay coherent; her tactile tracing of bark and stone embodies the ache. Still, the text labels the loss “ambiguous” so often that interiority tilts toward thesis rather than lived contradiction, muting the felt cost at the crucial beat where she pockets the eyes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: each refracted thread thickens the pattern until the final image reweights grief as an additive term. The chipped stepping stone teaches its rule early and returns as the pivot where light threads dovetail, delivering a Charged Poise with conceptual cost legible in the glowing numerals that now map her absence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cavern orchard is evoked through dripping plinks, luminous fruit, and moonlit cracks—selective, never catalogic. The stepping stone’s fractures act as micro-setting that literally guides finger and formula, constraining the final conjuration, so environment charges the closure image as required for 9-adjacent scores.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes—“map the heartache or stay unmade”—are signaled early. Pressure escalates via accumulating light threads; the moment eyes lock the pattern, a live option (perpetual ambiguity) is foreclosed, price visible in the exposed lattice of feeling. One beat, but sufficient for this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the reframing of absence as generative variable rather than void. Final image of “hidden orchards within” offers non-literal reweighting without moralizing. Occasional “mathematics of emotion” phrasing veers toward thesis, keeping score just below the 9-gate.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person stays close to Elowen’s tactile attention; diction favors liquid consonants and mineral hardness—“crystalline tears,” “fractal echoes”—in step with cavern acoustics. No head-hop, no filter-verb clutter; rhythm tightens under spell-casting pressure, then exhales with dawn.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Most sentences carry dual duty (image + concept), but stacked epithets—“luminous fruit,” “sapphire-tinted crystal,” “infinite loops”—thicken mid-paragraph without new causality. One paraphrase loop (“orchard had grown still… silence”) and a mild template cadence in finger-motion clause; none reach closure, so cap stays sub-8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The emotional-math metaphor could feel gimmicky, yet here it grows organically from setting (fractured stone as equation) and object (glass eyes as sensors). Fresh synthesis plus the risk of lyric ellipsis pay off in a final image that feels inevitable in hindsight, earning the high band.</comment>
