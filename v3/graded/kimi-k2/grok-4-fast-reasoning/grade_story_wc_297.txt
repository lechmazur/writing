<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elara’s visionary role is vividly rooted (pun intended) and her arc—twisting prophecy into present action—earns the mantle; interiority stays tactile, not didactic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV holds; causality through scars feels inevitable; the future-arriving-early rupt is cleanly anchored and leads to a resonant reconfiguration at closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Cobalt light, dusk bleed, living bark—all concretely pressure choices; the glade’s blue glow ebbs with stakes and re-illuminates after the covenant re-ignites.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Temporal eclipse drives each escalation; choices tighten as futures collide; cost is visible when Elara funnels her essence into the link, foreclosing other paths.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Unity of realms vs individual rootedness emerges through image and action, never lecture; the re-lit covenant reframes harmony without tidy moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is ancient-yet-urgent, perceptual signature of tree-sight sustained; lyrical diction never flattens under pressure, and silence (rustle) carries subtext.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Zero loops; density high; metaphors braid roots/time without clutter; final shining scar image crystallizes with rhythmic cadence and no figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Root-bound visionary, maze clipping, covenant—specific synthesis feels inevitable; temporal rift angle offers risk that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
