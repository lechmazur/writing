<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias’s muteness and past choir trauma are viscerally anchored in the bolt discovery; the pocketing micro-choice crystallizes his new stance. Interiority stays concrete—“fragile melody hummed in his chest” bodies emotion without label-speak. The final endurance costs him the fantasy of restored song, earned by the bolt’s physical weight against skin. Choir-as-family backstory is kept ≤20 % and cued by the object itself, satisfying BRR.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias accepts silence’s price, bolt in pocket, storm still raging—cost is the foreclosed return of voice. Accumulative lens holds: ochre smudge → bolt → memory cascade → crystallized stance; each repetition intensifies the stake. Orientation clear by line 3; no teleporting props; causality intact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Cobalt walls, iced portholes, frost-rimed windows filter through Elias’s bellhop attention; environment guides his slow ascent and constrains speed. The bolt acts as micro-setting that reweights the staircase into a site of atonement. Cold is specific—metal “cold as the fortress’s heart”—and mirrors internal numbness without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: cost of safety versus lost song. One meaningful tightening: bolt discovery forces Elias to re-measure that cost on the spot; no option widens afterward. Pressure coherent under Accumulative lens; silence accumulates density until the final stance crystallizes with felt price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly from bolt’s return: refuge that heals can also ossify; acceptance, not escape, is the remaining music. No moralizing line; final “melody hummed in his chest, unspoken yet alive” reweights prior material with conceptual cost. Ambiguity lingers—hope is real yet frostbitten.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Detached, liturgical cadence mirrors Elias’s silent service; syntax lengthens during memory, shortens on stair—“He turned it in his palm”—to mimic pulse. Lexicon stays within bellhop perception; no elevated drift. Perceptual signature strong: he notices wear-patterns, ochre against cobalt, soundless breath.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>High-density lines—“fortress’s frostbitten hope crystallized”—advance both atmosphere and concept. Rhythm varies; no template cadence or paraphrase loops. Metaphors stay consistent to cold/music axis; no mixed vehicles. Clean grammar; opening and closing images form bookends without scaffolding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Voiceless bellhop in post-war ice sanctuary feels fresh; bolt as relic of silent choir is specific and memorable. Risk lies in lyric accumulation over plot, but coherence keeps it from gimmick. Could edge higher with one more concrete obstacle during ascent, yet the concept holds.</comment>
