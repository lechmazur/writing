<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elara’s grief, guilt and craft-based ingenuity are vivid; the embodied “snowmelt ardor” gives her a credible pulse. Yet her change from self-forgiveness to preservationist mission is declared rather than dramatized in-scene, so the decisive inner shift feels slightly convenient. No contradictory impulses play out live; the rope-braiding sequence shows dexterity but not wrenching choice. Still, the vocational specificity and tactile memory work keep her above mid-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: because she forgives herself she enters the sanctum; because she braids the rope the names resound. Orientation is swift (who/where/when by line 3) and closure lands with audible cost—the voices fill the void she feared. One minor wobble: the rope’s “slot” and lever appear just-in-time, a faint teleport. Overall, a clean Resonant Reconfiguration under auroral light.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Ice-runed walls, auroral leaks, and the sinew-rope create a tactile micro-world that constrains every motion; the cold literally threatens the brittle card. Sensory hierarchy is filtered through caster’s fingers—wax memory vs. freezing quartz. Spatial choreography stays intact as she kneels, unbraids, inserts. Setting is not mere wallpaper; it governs material risk and thus choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—save the names from silence—is signaled early and tethered to personal guilt. Middle beat reconfigures the rope, narrowing options: mis-thread could snap fibers and erase voices forever. Pressure is coherent but single-arc; no secondary opposition appears, so escalation is more steady intensification than twist. Cost is felt in sweat on brow and the rope’s fragility, satisfying the lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of acoustic inheritance emerges through braided rope = audible memory, avoiding thesis statements. The aurora’s glow and the caster’s thawed heart echo without moralizing. Final image of “living transcribed memory” offers quiet conceptual repricing: preservation is not archive but pulse she now carries. Ambiguity lingers—will future artisans hear?—which invites reflection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person limited stays inside Elara’s perceptual sieve: temperature, tool-weight, aurora shimmer. Syntax lengthens and shortens with task rhythm; no head-hop. Filter verbs (“she felt”) are minimal and motivated. Diction favors metallurgical and textile specificity without vaulting above her lexicon. Voice remains distinct under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentences carry double duty (action + image). Occasional modifier stacks (“translucent ice veined with luminous quartz”) flirt with excess but stay tied to craft eye. No loops or scaffold detected. Final paragraph could trim one “echo” repetition, yet momentum survives. Generally propulsive and clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fusing lost-wax craft with punch-card phonetics inside a glacial organ-cathedral is a fresh synthesis; not seen elsewhere. The rope-as-phonograph-stylus feels earned because braiding technique mirrors her mold-work. Some aurora-and-ice imagery treads familiar ground, but vocational specificity re-anchors it. Risk is moderate yet successful.</comment>
