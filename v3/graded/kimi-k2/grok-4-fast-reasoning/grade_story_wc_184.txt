<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elara’s “adaptable” and “methodical” traits stay visible—she fingers the rope, whispers incantations, re-braids—but interior contradiction is never activated under pressure; the wax seal decision feels pre-planned rather than wrestled-with, so the closure lacks felt personal cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Causal chain is legible: door → rope → seal → merge → door sealed; orientation clean by word 120; one meaningful tightening when gears stutter; closure lands as Charged Poise with conceptual cost (lost anomaly). Penalized −0.3 because the diplomat/ghost pact is asserted, not dramatized, blunting the stakes’ final bite.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clock-tower interior is sharply etched—brass gears, moonlit dust, coiled rope—each detail filtered through archivist habit; the ceremonial rope constrains the climactic weave and carries the seal’s glow into the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prevent archival erasure—signaled early; micro-turn when tower protests her touch narrows options; cost is conceptual (tower re-imprisoned, future anomalies denied) but not viscerally felt by Elara, keeping escalation solid yet not searing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>“Fables of absence” emerge organically through vanished envoys and erased treaties; the re-braided rope literalizes theme without moralizing. Final image reframes absence as preserved presence, a subtle reweighting that avoids tidy profundity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elara’s perceptual bias—callused fingers, marginalia incantations, cataloguing reflex; lyric cadence mirrors clockwork rhythm without purple drift; no head-hop or register slippage under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Elegant variation in sentence length, strong verbs (“thrummed,” “rewove,” “flickered”); one scaffold loop (“confused rhythms into harmonious clarity”) but no mixed metaphors or density clog; filter verbs minimal and motive-driven.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Fantasy archival magic feels fresh via bureaucratic relics; wax-seal-as-key and rope-as-chronicle splice diplomacy with metaphysics in a way that would collapse if swapped. Risk is moderate—portal-in-tower is familiar—but execution is specific enough to outrun template stigma.</comment>
