<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s grief is embodied and concrete; her stooped vigil and frost-numbed fingers externalize the interior wound. The micro-choice to pour starlight “heartbeat by heartbeat” onto the copper plate crystallizes her hierarchy of values—daughter-loss over self-preservation—yet the text stops short of dramatizing a contradictory impulse mid-ritual, so interior conflict is present but not simultaneous. Motivation is steady and escalating, and the final endurance (she rises with the map inside her) carries visible cost. Still, the absence of any live opposition or second voice keeps the relational crucible dark, capping her complexity just beneath the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern density (spirals, flash-illuminated shards, starlight droplets) intensifies until the copper plate reweights grief into geography. Closure is a Charged Poise—the pulsating map crystallizes inside her, foreclosing the option to remain lost. Orientation is swift: crater-orchard, solstice dusk, lone woman within first 60 words. One scaffold intrudes: “moving stillness” is invoked four times, a loop that slightly dulls the final cadence, preventing full 9-point entry.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sub-zero orchard is lived-in: bark peels, nails frost-weld to fingers, auroras shiver across bottle-glass. The crater’s impact-scars double as both geological fact and emotional palimpsest, guiding Elara’s tracing hand. Micro-setting triumphs: the copper plate’s temperature and etched constellations constrain how slowly starlight must be poured. Only the aurora light-level stays static, denying one last sensory pivot that could have charged the closure image to 9.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will she recover a navigable path through grief?—is signaled in paragraph two. Escalation is textural: each scavenged object adds cartographic pressure until rusted nails become meridians. Cost is felt (numb fingers, spent starlight vials), but because the orchard supplies no counter-force beyond cold, the pressure plateau flattens a hair before the seal. Sufficient for 8-band, not the sharper spike 8.8+ demands.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme—grief as terra incognita that can be mapped only by enduring it—emerges through image, not aphorism. The final map-pulse reframes every prior discard (nail, bottle, leaf) as coordinate points, a conceptual repricing that reweights loss as topography. No moralizing sentence intrudes; resonance lingers in the silent orchard exhalation. A fraction withheld because the heartbeat motif never acquires ironic counter-meaning, keeping complexity just shy of full 9.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person floats at intimate distance, never violating Elara’s perceptual rim: vocabulary of alchemy (“flash-paper,” “safekept starlight”) stays within her lexicon. Syntax lengthens during patient patterning, then contracts—“The paper flashed once”—to mirror flash-duration. Occasional adjective stacks (“frost-laced branches clawed at the perpetual twilight”) verge on purple but remain internally consistent with her auroral palette. Voice is distinctive, sustained, and paid off in the final copper glow.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry triple duty: sensory data, metaphoric mapping, emotional pressure—“bottle shards fracturing light into latitude lines.” No paraphrase loops; each spiral reference adds new cartographic information. Two mixed metaphors (“world held its breath... auroras paused”) risk excess but are saved by the solstice stillness conceit. Density is high yet propulsive; one clause in four could lose an adjective, keeping this just outside the diamond-cut 9-zone.</comment>

<comment>“Flash-paper alchemist” transmutes a parlour prop into cosmic cartography; the graft feels inevitable yet unseen before. Grief-mapped-as-geography reverses the typical “journey” trope: stillness generates the map. Every discard is ordinary (nail, leaf, bottle), but their meridians arrive as revelation. Risk—lyric stillness over plot kinetics—pays off in a final image that could not exist without these exact elements, earning the extra +0.3 risk bonus.</comment>
