<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elowen’s guarded nature and gift for finding lost things are anchored early and pay off when she claims the seed, but interiority drifts toward abstract self-diagnosis (“raw, unvarnished guilt”) rather than embodied contradiction under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the vortex calms, the seed is bound, and Elowen’s stance shifts from guarded isolation to quiet vigil. Causal chain holds—failed spell → shattered mirror → seed revealed → unbend enacted—though the note’s exposition slightly dilutes on-page tension.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The orchard-vortex is vivid, tactile, and directly constrains movement; ice shards and thrumming seed function as micro-setting that charge the final image. Spatial choreography stays coherent even during the spiral’s deceleration.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—uncover hidden truth—tightens when the seed’s pulse offers revelation at the cost of potential self-consumption. One clear escalation beat: the unbend widens gyres and forces stance crystallization.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of confronting unmirrored guilt emerges through concrete action (thawing the confession) rather than statement; the seed’s shift from devourer to binder offers resonant, non-literal closure without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice remains stable; perceptual signature is selective (“fruit-laden limbs,” “captured heartbeat”) and rhythm modulates with vortex motion. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive, with purposeful repetition (“unbend” refrain) and no paraphrase loops. Occasional elevated diction (“petrified mid-penstroke”) fits the mythic register without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Familiar quest-for-truth arc is refreshed by the orchard-vortex conceit and the seed’s inversion from threat to anchor. Specificity of the frozen confession note grounds the fantastical premise.</comment>
