<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elias’s desire to “rediscover lost joy” is stated early and re-activated by the orchard fragment, but his interiority drifts into lyrical paraphrase (“pensive mirth bubbling up”) rather than embodied contradiction. Micro-choice is present—kneeling, tracing, painting with light—yet none carry a tangible cost or risk; the emotional lift feels gifted by daydream logic rather than earned. The ending grin is credible, but the stakes never tighten enough to make the recovery feel wrested from him. Still, the vocation-specific sensory lens keeps him individuated.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the light-mural blooms and Elias exits with renewed resolve; the cost is the ephemeral nature of the gift—he can keep only the spark, not the scene. Causality is dream-soft—fog parts, knowledge network answers on demand—but within the declared daydream logic the sequence coheres. Orientation is swift; no penalty. Minor loop: “pensive mirth” phrase repeats without escalation, dulling the final beat slightly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The ruined orchard is viscerally grounded—rot-sweet air, moss-slick stones—and the fresco fragment functions as micro-setting that steers the climax. Light-as-paint turns the environment into a reactive canvas, letting setting constrain method. Spatial track is clean; no phantom props. For 9+ gate: while the lantern recharges the wall, the orchard itself does not ultimately block or enable Elias’s final exit; hence capped at 8.8.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—recover lost joy—remains singular and legible. Pressure escalates only via atmospheric deepening (fog, mural revival) rather than a narrowing option set; no concrete trade-off or price is extracted from Elias. The knowledge network delivers answers friction-free, so the challenge feels informational rather than adversarial. Sufficient for a lyric daydream arc but below the 8.2 gate for high-band closure support.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of art as luminous memory-transmission emerges through imagery, not thesis. The exposed-film metaphor reweights at closure when the fresco “develops in reverse,” quietly linking personal burnout to collective forgetting. Ambiguity is preserved: joy is restored yet still transient. Final grin avoids moralizing, but thematic punch is slightly softened because Elias sacrifices nothing tangible to earn it.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person drifts close to Elias’s sensorium, filtering notice through artist priorities (color, negative space). Syntax flexes with pressure—long breathless clauses during discovery, crisp closure on “grin.” No head-hop; experimental ellipses in the self-trimming meta-lines are taught early and paid off. Occasional elevated Latinate diction (“pensive mirth,” “communal haven”) edges above plausible café-daydream register, keeping it from the 9-band.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Strong rhythmic variety and concrete nouns propel the piece. Only two adjacent paraphrase loops (“lost joy…faded from his waking life, buried under commissions”; “pensive mirth…bubbling up”) create micro-drag—scaffold −0.2. Figurative chain is dense but consistent under dream lens. No mixed metaphors or filter-verb stacks in peak beat. Final third is clean, so 9+ is not disallowed.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>“Painting with light” inside a daydream-orchard fresco rescue fuses familiar tropes into a fresh configuration; the knowledge-network idea refreshes exposition without data-dump. Risk lies in the meta-textual trimming lines—acknowledging word-count—which could read as gimmick but instead underline the ephemerality theme. Specificity of mineral-reflective pigments and reverse-development lends veracity. The synthesis feels inevitable yet personal.</comment>
