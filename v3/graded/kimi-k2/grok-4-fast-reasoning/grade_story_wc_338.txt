<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s grief-driven empathy is embodied in tactile map work and silent film comparison; the final crossing into the chapel crystallizes his father’s absence as a felt cost. Interior contradiction—yearning vs. dread—remains vivid without diagnostic self-talk. Micro-choices (latch turned, door creaked) align with motive and foreclose retreat. One slip: “methodically curious” is asserted more than dramatized in the final beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the chapel door opens to a silence that reconfigures Elias’s stance toward his father’s vanishing. Causal chain—map tear → footage pattern → latch discovery—holds cleanly under a Causal lens. Orientation is anchored by the vault’s rain and the henge’s stones within 120 words. Cost is legible in the “rush of cool, silent air” that replaces speech.</comment>

<comment>The rain-scoured vault and wind-bitten moors are filtered through Elias’s professional eye; every stone and fresco crack guides his fingers toward the chapel latch. Micro-setting (the projector’s beam slicing mist) constrains visibility and choice. Sensory hierarchy favors touch and muted sound, mirroring the theme of interpretive silence. Weather and architecture evolve causally across the two time-shards.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—bridging the map’s tear to recover his father’s voice—tightens when the silent footage reveals a shifting earth outline that matches the rupture. One decisive escalation: the ground has moved, exposing the latch; retreat is no longer viable. Agency is Elias’s alone; coincidence complicates but does not resolve. Cost is the irreversible entry into a silence that may never speak back.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the tension between interpretive empathy and the muteness of the past; no character states it aloud. The whispered chapel’s silence reweights the premise: knowledge may reside in absence. Final image—the open door breathing wordless air—offers a resonant, non-moral answer. Subtext operates in the grainy flicker of silent film and the unheard “whispers.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays close to Elias’s perceptual bias—faded inks, cool stone, the hush of tape spools—without head-hopping. Syntax lengthens under reflection, then tightens during the latch turn, mirroring emotional cadence. No dialogue appears; the absence is purposeful and thematic. Register remains consistent with an archivist’s precision and a mourner’s hush.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet textured: “jaggedly, dividing the known landscapes from an uncharted void” packs map, emotion, and stakes in one clause. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances knowledge or atmosphere. Figurative language is sparse and precise—“visual poetry of wind-swept grass”—never muddling causality. Final sentence lands clean without ornament.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The fusion of archival map work, silent film forensics, and prehistoric henge feels fresh and inevitable. The “whispered chapel” concept re-energizes a familiar archaeological mystery by reframing silence as evidence. Risk lies in the wordless climax, yet it pays off by charging the final image. No derivative templates or stock metaphors intrude.</comment>
