<question>1</question>
<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Elara’s interiority pulses—"disenchanted heart," "lead crowns"—and that remembered exhale with Lyra becomes the fulcrum that flips her stance from abdication to active guardianship; the maternal impulse and the inherited crown finally integrate under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each image and sensation thickens until the grotto itself closes its wound. Closure delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara’s “enough” reweights all prior material and leaves the sky “fragile peace” sealed inside her as a felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Cobalt walls, obsidian shale, star-scented air all press against choice; the bleeding light functions as both antagonistic force and conduit to interior, constraining how she can act and charging the final “frangible” peace she carries.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The announced evacuation already declared futile and the actual sky-hemorrhage escalate seamlessly; the single tightening beat—the word “enough” that stills the bleeding—carries an unmistakable cost and narrows Elara’s options from personal escape to celestial repair.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.3</comment>
<comment>Grotesque beauty—“cobalt crystals,” “velvet darkness laced with crystalline poison”—gives the theme visceral traction. The ambiguity of sovereignty-as-caregiver (no moral slogan) lands with embodied cost in the fragile peace she now bears.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Distortional lyricism—“crowns like lead, thrones like cages”—sustains perceptual signature while remaining legible; elision and compression taught early (shared exhale as anchor) pays off in the grotto’s final pulse.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Occasional plush figurative clusters—“lacy menace,” “velvet darkness” verge on purple, but the rhythm rises and falls with Elara’s own exertion; no mixed metaphors or unmotivated diction disrupt clarity or the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Tales of star tears as environmental collapse rather than invasion weaponizes childhood folklore into environmental elegy, forging a fresh synthesis on the mythic sky-wound. The quiet inversion—queen heals cosmos, not subjects—offers non-obvious but inevitable payoff.</comment>
