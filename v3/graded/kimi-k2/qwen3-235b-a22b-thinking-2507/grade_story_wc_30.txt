<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—duty to preserve vs surrender to flux—is embodied in the micro-choice to smelt rather than hoard; the moon-phase trait constrains her cognition and visibly alters tactics. The final renunciation (letting identities migrate inward) is earned and carries felt cost. Minor slip: “weight of routine transformed into wings” edges toward unearned epiphany.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of tide, smelt, transcribe tightens through density increase until the final Charged Poise (“the creel sat empty yet full”). Orientation anchored early; closure reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost. One hairline slip: chronometer silence mentioned twice without new pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Tidal Atrium’s brass-and-salt environment actively constrains every move—low tide exposes gears for smelting, high tide lifts them into motion. The creel and furnace function as micro-settings that charge the final image. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered; no static cataloguing.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve wonder in a world without tomorrow—tightens when smelting becomes the only viable tactic; the cost is the surrender of fixed identity storage. One clear deepening: accepting contradiction as method narrows options and reweights the stake. Cost is legible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: permanence through transience, wonder via routine. Final image of the half-full moon on new scrolls offers non-literal, resonant answer without moralizing. No thematic echo in final paragraph; complexity sustained.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature—brass spectacles reflecting celestial coordinates, condensation traced like memory—maintained under pressure. Syntax modulates with tide rhythm; no head-hopping. Compression and elision taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. No loops, mixed metaphors, or register drift. Minor scaffold: “molten brass glowing like captured stars” is borderline purple but fits the lyric register and is not repeated.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of clockpunk, tidal cosmology, and refugee memory; Titan-gear librarian and bamboo creel feel inevitable, not gimmicky. Risky lyric accumulation pays off in closure image. No close echoes of familiar scenes.</comment>
