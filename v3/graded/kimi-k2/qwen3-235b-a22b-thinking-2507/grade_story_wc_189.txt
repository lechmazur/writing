<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is textured and embodied; the cicada and droplet crystallize her contradictory impulses. The final stance—returning to Kael with “quiet certainty”—is earned by the grotto’s micro-epiphany. Yet the apprentice remains off-stage, so relationship-as-crucible pressure is only implied, capping the score just below 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer thickens until the droplet’s tremor reweights the central stake. Closure is a Charged Poise—she steps back to the path with new stance and visible cost (the relinquished need to win the argument). No orientation drift; causality of insight is cleanly traced.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Grotto, cicada, and droplet function as micro-setting that actively constrains perception and choice. The bead of water refracting starlight becomes the pivot image; its texture alters her tactics. Specificity is selective and purposeful, charging the final image without clutter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to re-enter the paused conversation—tightens through accumulating sensory pressure rather than external reversals. The cost is the surrender of defensive resistance; escalation is modest but coherent under the Accumulative lens. One decisive internal shift suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of time-as-texture emerges organically from tidal imagery and cicada symbolism; no explicit moralizing. The final image of the tide “returning” reweights the earlier conflict without stating a thesis. Subtext in gesture and silence carries the emotional aftereffect.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet disciplined, with rhythmic modulation matching the slow swell of perception. Compression and patterned elision are taught early (“traced…reading…like braille”) and paid off in the droplet beat. No POV leakage; perceptual signature remains distinct and character-bound.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers texture without redundancy. Metaphors are precise (“stars…carved from ice”) and never muddle causality. Minor filter verbs appear but are voice-motivated; no loops or scaffold in the closure third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Familiar mentor/apprentice clash is refreshed through tidal chronicle specificity and the cicada’s tangential divination. The synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight; risk lies in the quiet lyric mode, which sustains clarity and stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
