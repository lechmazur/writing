<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—her fingers brushing the goggles, the remembered scent of mint—but the shift from passive observer to active keeper of the diary is asserted rather than dramatized; the final “lighter” spirit is felt, yet the cost of concealment is only implied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each floor adds luminous density until the final sunbeam unlocks the last line; closure is a Charged Poise—“something had unfolded, tender and new”—with the felt cost of ongoing secrecy. Orientation is immediate; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The ice-rimmed elevator, prismatic light, and frost-rimed balcony are selective and tactile; the goggles-as-lens reappear in the final image, constraining how Elara will now “seek scattered light,” satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding meaning beneath anguish—tightens as each decoded line narrows Elara’s emotional options; the final concealment forecloses open sharing, paying a social cost. One clear intensification suffices under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of joy as “quiet companion” to anguish emerges through concrete particulars—frozen tears, mint on a sill—without sermonizing; the final image reweights the spire from tomb to cradle in a single, resonant stroke.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Voice is consistent, lyric, and filtered through Elara’s sensory bias; slight drift toward elevated diction (“crystalline walls,” “prismatic shards”) is pattern-taught early and sustained. No dialogue, so no voice leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is musical and dense yet propulsive; occasional stacked modifiers (“frost-rimed clouds,” “cloudless blue stretched endless and kind”) flirt with overwriting but stay within character perception. No loops or scaffold artifacts.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: sky-port diary decoded by shifting auroral light inside a glass elevator; the transformation of relic goggles into a private lens feels inevitable yet non-obvious, avoiding stock steampunk tropes.</comment>
