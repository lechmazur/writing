<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Grief-driven interior monologue is raw and specific, but some “unused potential” abstractions soften contradictory impulses; geode as tactile memory anchor keeps motive visceral. One strong renunciation beat—the decision to map pools rather than merely mourn—lands with felt cost as he logs coordinates inside the warming stone’s pulse.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural pattern taught early via cooling-circuit hum and flare-aftermath details culminating in the array’s pure scream. Closure hits Charged Poise: the universe re-weighted through violet lattices and geode heartbeat—a conceptual repricing that locks both grief and new agency on the page at final line: “The hunt wasn’t over; it had just found its true compass.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Observatory hull, breaker-cool haptics, Helios storms, and geode warmth all function as constraints that steer tactics and reconfigure final image without a single generic SF placeholder. Every object carries physical logic and sensory specificity that charges the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Single, escalating stake—finding evidence that annihilated futures are recoverable—tightens through sensor calibration choices and circuit time-pressure ending in array scream and geode flare. Cost (foreclosure of earlier life) sits raw in the final viewport overlay.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of stolen futures pooled in void lattices grows out of concrete images—geode halves, violet flare, ochre storms—not declarative philosophy. Final viewport veins overlay Helios with living potential, answering thematic question through image rather than statement.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Voice remains locked in Aris’ perceptual signature—astrophysicist lexicon tightened by trauma. Syntax breathes with breaker-hum and screen-squeal crescendo, no POV slippage.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Precise yet atmospheric diction, high density without clutter; only occasional “intangibly tangible” redundancy but context renders meaningful. Rhythm glides from hush to thrum to final crystallized heartbeat.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Perturbation theory as grief-mapped stargazing, dead fiancée stone recharging—fresh synthesis of hard-science metaphor married to mourning ritual. No stock disaster tropes; emotional specificity makes premise unswap with any placeholder.</comment>
