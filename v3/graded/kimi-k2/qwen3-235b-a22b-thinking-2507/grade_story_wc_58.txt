<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s emotional contradiction between mapping absence and yearning for connection is embodied and earned; her final crystallization of healing as witness is a credible renunciation with felt cost that matches story length.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure holds: her evolved obituary drafts accumulate into a resonant reconfiguration—witnessing absence becomes the healing act—under the Accumulative/Textural lens; garden and thread anchor orientation cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Thread-as-micro-setting weaves constraint: its texture decides projection beats; decaying apples and wind-pressure texture the garden’s stakes; specificity charges the final image without generic autumn cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Single dominant stake—mapping healing landscapes—tightens as each obituary deepens choice toward witnessing rather than erasing absence; cost is visible in Varek and Silas echoes that lock Elara out of flight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</question><comment>Theme—healing as bearing witness to absence—emerges through her failing obituary edits that culminate in “lonesome splendor”; no moralizing, only reweighted meaning at closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</question><comment>Lush, rhythm-controlled lyricism; perceptual signature filters garden details through Elara’s cartographer mindset without head-hop; sensory overload sparing peaks keep voice distinct under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Read-aloud ear test passes; high information density; no loops or roadside description; “mistaking gulls’ wings for a boy’s arms” is a tight final image that anchors propulsion with felt cost.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</question>
<comment>Fresh angle: obituary as cartography of absence; transformation hinges on verifiable absences—the garden thread guiding projection—not mere existential trope; risk is elliptical but earns Charged Poise.</question>
