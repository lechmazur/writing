<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—guilt vs. professional detachment—are embodied in her frayed-wire ritual and self-correcting metaphors. The micro-choice to electrify the bottle crystallizes her hierarchy of values: apology over exorcism. Silas’s translucent presence supplies external pressure that alters their shared status. Cost is felt: the apology cannot save the orchard, only mend the fracture between them.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the orchard will fall, but the melody persists. Causal chain—perfume → current → scent bloom → reconciliation—holds without gaps. Orientation is anchored by window, lectern, bulb within 120 words. Final image reweights the premise: imperfect miracle achieved, not by stopping saws, but by making the ground fertile for memory.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Archive’s dust, ozone tang, and leaning scores function as micro-setting that constrains Elara’s improvised wiring. The lilac scent’s intensification under current turns the room into a temporary orchard, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clean: bottle on lectern, wires to grid, Silas’s hand passing through crystal. Setting evolves causally with the induced bloom.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—deliver apology before dawn chainsaws—tightens once when Elara risks electrocution to power the bottle. Agency drives escalation: her decision to splice live wires narrows options and raises physical cost. Coincidence absent; saws remain off-stage threat. Final tightening: apology accepted, but orchard still falls, forcing acceptance of irreversible loss.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: gossip as pruning, silence as arrhythmia, imperfect scent as reparative music. No explicit moralizing; final line lets chainsaw snarl and lilting melody coexist in tension. Subtext in Silas’s “You cut me down before the harvest” carries both literal and emotional accusation. Closure reweights betrayal into fertile memory without tidy absolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is distinct: ink-stained fingers, sour-note metaphors, “rustle of dry leaves” dialogue. Compression purposeful—no filler between wire-stripping and scent bloom. Free indirect style stays in Elara’s lexicon; Silas’s speech retains leaf-rust timbre. Rhythm modulates: clipped self-corrections under stress, longer cadence during scent surge.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet clear: “lilac scent flooded the room, thick and alive” does triple sensory work. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances stakes or atmosphere. Metaphors stay coherent—music, current, bloom—without mixed vehicles. Final line’s “conductor for currents unseen” crystallizes image without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fusion of gossip columnist turned spirit electrician feels inevitable, not gimmicky. Perfume-as-apology and orchard-as-symphony transform familiar tropes through specific lived detail. Risky electrical ritual pays off with earned resonance. No derivative echoes; the lilac-ghost reconciliation is fresh and grounded.</comment>
