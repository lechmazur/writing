<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s grief and artistic identity are embodied through tactile detail (ochre-stained fingers, velvet pouch). The shift from shouting pain onto walls to “umbral tenderness” is earned via Leo’s revealed notes and her final choice to paint the pavilion wall. Interior contradiction—wanting answers yet fearing silence—remains active in scene. Cost is visible: she trades raw anguish for quiet creation, foreclosing the louder mourning.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the cathedral light reveals Leo’s true intent, reweighting the mystery from botany to grief-work. Causal chain—postcards → lemon-juice cipher → etched-glass light → mural—holds without gaps. Orientation is anchored early; single transition from pavilion to cathedral is clean. Felt cost: she abandons the quest for literal answers and accepts “listening in the quiet.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Settings are filtered through Elara’s artist eye: amber pavilion slats, melting snow, cathedral’s “fractured beams of amber and cobalt.” The etched-glass window actively constrains the reveal; the pavilion wall becomes the canvas for closure. Sensory economy favors touch and light over visual catalog. Micro-setting (velvet pouch, postcard edges) functions as charged object.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</question><comment>Dominant stake—how to metabolize grief—tightens when cipher fails under normal heat, forcing the cathedral gambit. One meaningful deepening: realizing the flowers’ lesson is about trusting darkness, not solving it. Cost is the surrender of loud protest for quiet creation. Pressure remains coherent under Accumulative/Textural lens; no coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: grief’s truths bloom only in receptive silence. Leo’s notes reweight the motif from scientific curiosity to emotional instruction. Final mural embodies the insight without moralizing. Subtext in “darkness holds the gentlest light” reframes loss as tender revelation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly anchored to Elara’s perceptions; no head-hop. Syntax modulates with emotional intensity—long lyrical sentences in reflection, clipped fragments under dawning hush. Distinct perceptual signature: color-stained fingers, light fractured through glass. No dialogue, so voice coherence rests on internal texture, which holds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</question>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid; figurative language serves pressure (“dawning hush pressing around her like a velvet glove”). No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Occasional elevated diction (“umbral tenderness”) is earned by context. Rhythm breathes with scene needs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</question>
<comment>Familiar grief narrative is transformed through the postcard-cipher device and the reversal that the puzzle was never botanical. Specificity of artist-muralist vocation and cathedral glass mechanics grounds the concept. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risk in quiet lyric closure pays off.</comment>
