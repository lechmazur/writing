<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her reverence for the wing, the calloused fingers, the tears—yet the “esoteric realist” label is asserted rather than dramatized; no contradictory impulse is shown in-scene. The final stillness is earned, but the cost is more atmospheric than personal.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the monarch carries the wing, turning the cairn’s failure into a living signal. Causality is lyric-accumulative; the interrupted cadence reweights the premise. Orientation is swift; no lens drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The grotto’s jade mist and mossy floor are tactile anchors; the Luna wing becomes micro-setting that constrains the knot and later charges the final image. Sensory selection is POV-filtered and purposeful.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—honoring the monarch’s vanishing lineage—is signaled early. Escalation is a single, meaningful tightening: the gust seizes the wing, forcing Elara to witness the butterfly’s adoption of her signal. Cost is atmospheric yet legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of remembrance emerges through concrete particulars; the final image of joined wings offers a non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext is carried in gesture and silence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyric, compressed, and consistent; perceptual signature is selective and biased. No dialogue, so no voice convergence. Patterned elision (e.g., “blushing stillness”) is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet clear, with rhythmic variation and zero loops. Figurative language is controlled; no mixed metaphors. One minor scaffold—“the grotto held its breath”—is earned by tone.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise—cloud-grotto sanctuary, living signal borne by the last monarch—feels fresh and inevitable. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
