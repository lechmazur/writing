<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elena’s prosopagnosia and methodical nature are dramatized through ritual pacing and charcoal choice; the final portrait renunciation carries visible cost. Interiority stays embodied, but the late-arriving witness dilutes the crucible to exposition.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the portrait reweights memory and reopens the case under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality holds; the ribbon’s return in the stranger’s recognition crystallizes the shift with felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Quarry mist and ribbon texture constrain Elena’s ritual and final image; spatial anchors are clear by line 5. Selective sensory detail mirrors interior narrowing, though the stranger’s entrance slightly dilutes atmospheric pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—awakening empathy for Clara—tightens when Elena trades facial likeness for embodied portrait; the stranger’s tear is the visible price. One meaningful intensification suffices under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of concealment versus exposure emerges through ribbon, mask, and portrait; final image offers non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext in the stranger’s tears reweights prior material with lingering ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is painterly, tactile, and consistent; perceptual signature filters every detail through Elena’s synesthetic bias. Rhythm modulates with ritual pacing; no head-hop or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; no loops or mixed metaphors. Occasional elevated diction (“furrowed hush”) is voice-motivated and paid off in closure cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prosopagnosic portraitist solving a cold case via non-facial portraiture is fresh and inevitable; ribbon-as-essence device transforms trope. Risky lyric structure holds coherence under Accumulative lens.</comment>
