<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aelius’s interior contradiction (“incisively kind” vs centuries-old grievance) is embodied—the stiff flex of crystalline fingers, the warm ampoule against cold water. His shift from vindictive sentinel to mourner of nuance is earned micro-choice by micro-choice (thread guided, fish calmed). The stone-lip smile that ends the story is both earned and visibly felt, foreclosing the path of retribution. Yet the absence of any second on-page character keeps relational dynamics untested.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Holds the Accumulative/Textural lens to closure: density of revealed layers (Council duplicity, Gardeners’ sabotage, geologists’ nuance) tightens causal view and reframes every prior motif. Thread filament literally weaves the fracture shut—“light seeped into the fracture”—delivering a resonant reconfiguration with unavoidable cost (empathic sorrow replacing certainty). Causality loops cleanly; no teleporting props; orientation anchored in “last lie dissolved”.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Bioluminescent kelp in broken fountains, moonstone joints groaning—each sensory choice immediately pressures Aelius’s next action or memory. Garden’s underwater choreography remains coherent; no spatial drift. Final image (arch whole, coral brighter) charges closure by environment itself transforming, satisfying the 9+ micro-setting gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“truth versus liveable order”—tightens as each revelation strips away certainty and forces Aelius toward embracing fragility. One meaningful deepening: fracture threaded not sealed by force but by accepting the crack. Cost is palpable—myth of Council malice must die so city may live.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Theme (embrace nuance or perish) is never lectured: emerges from Aelius’s concrete act of threading the light through its own weakness. The ampoule’s reprise in seagrass cradle quietly reprices certainty itself. Garden exhaling “a cloud of silt that settled like forgiveness” offers resonant final image without moralizing.</comment>

<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice distinct: luminous precision of stone-water perception, no filter glut; “telepathy muted by the city’s enforced silence” encapsulates loss in a single phrase. Rhythmic rises mirror pressure—long tide-like sentences under ruined dome, then choppier fragments while handling filament. POV stable.</comment>
<question>7</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Metaphors disciplined (e.g., silt cloud as forgiveness) and always tether to physical process. Zero paraphrase loops, no scaffold. Propels by information density (glass warm despite chill, kelp animating ruins), each sentence both advances and deepens.</comment>

<grade>8.3</question>
<comment>Living-stone-telepathy guardian is familiar, but coupling that with “heal via acknowledging structural fracture” rather than grand battle is fresh enough to elevate. Specificity (moonstone joints, foxglove serum nuance) prevents trope drift; transformation test passes.</comment>
