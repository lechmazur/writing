<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s motive is clear and consistent, but interiority drifts into lyrical summary (“cheerful gloom” repeated) rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The moment she kneels and the glass flares amber is the only beat where motive, tool, and micro-choice visibly collide. Otherwise, decisions feel pre-ordained by theme rather than character flaw.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the meteor-birthed glass reframes loss as seed-of-return. Causal chain (meteor shatters path → birds carry seeds → recollectionist replants) is coherent, though the “mere hours” ticking clock is asserted more than dramatized. One clean transition (cave to coast) stays within scope.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The geode’s amethyst shards and opalescent veins are tactile, selective, and mirrored in the crater glass itself, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible moves. The cave’s glow literally guides Elara’s steps, satisfying the 9+ gate that setting constrains choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“before memory fades”—is signaled early and tightened when the glass dims. Each seed’s emotional hue raises the cost of failure. Agency is mostly interpretive (reading seeds) rather than risky action, but the final replanting forecloses the option to keep the seeds as relics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through the conceit that disappearance contains its own seed of return; no explicit moralizing. The meteor-glass reweights the premise at closure. Subtext is present but occasionally over-articulated (“paths disappeared not by choice, but when the world itself fractured”).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet anchored in Elara’s perceptual bias—she notices crystalline dust, kelp pouches, and emotional color. No head-hopping; distance stable. Rhythm modulates with urgency (“She moved swiftly…”). Occasional poetic excess (“heart humming with cheerful gloom”) slightly dilutes immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is vivid and propulsive; figurative language is mostly purposeful. Minor loops (“seeds… seeds… seeds”) and one mixed metaphor (“ghost… fly blind”) nudge it below 8.5. No artifacts in the closure beat. Strong sentence variety and sensory economy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The conceit of a “sea-foam recollectionist” using meteor glass to read whale-road seeds feels fresh and internally coherent. Combines mythic migration, post-cataclysm memory, and ecological restoration without gimmickry. Slight risk of familiar eco-fantasy cadence, but specificity of tool and bird-method elevates it.</comment>
