<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Kael’s dual allegiance is dramatized through micro-choices: the scarf adjustment, the chip pressed into Elara’s hand. Interior contradiction—hope vs desperation—drives every beat. The final stance crystallizes with visible cost: he forecloses open mediation in favor of covert resistance. Voice and motive remain coherent; no diagnostic label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: graffiti warnings → buoy meeting → reorganize plan. Closure is Earned Stasis—Kael renounces neutrality, accepting the price of covert leadership. Cost is legible in the closing image: “the weight… shifting from burden to balance.” No orientation drift; transitions are clean.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The raft city’s sensory density (salt, torches, dough) is filtered through Kael’s translator gaze. Micro-setting—the buoy, the chip—constrains the final choice. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly across the carnival lanes. Environment guides tactics rather than decorating backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserve Aethel’s soul—tightens when contracts surface. One decisive turn: from shock absorber to resistance architect. Cost is felt in the renunciation of safe mediation. Pressure escalates via causal linkage, not coincidence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of communal endurance vs commodification emerges through the stone chip’s reprise and the net symbol. No moralizing; resonance is carried by image and action. Final graffiti reweights earlier marks from warning to coordination. Ambiguity lingers—privatization still looms—but stance is crystallized.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays inside Kael’s selective perception; no head-hopping. Diction—“frayed silk scarf,” “calliope’s tune”—is character-specific. Compression in motion beats keeps momentum. Dialogue is sparse but goal-driven; Elara’s rasp carries subtext.</comment>

<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and information-dense. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances plot or atmosphere. Metaphors are grounded (“gentrification… slow seep”). Syntax modulates with urgency. Clean mechanics; no register drift.</comment>

<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Floating carnival facing gentrification is fresh; graffiti-as-code feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Stone chip as communal relic transforms from artifact to tactical anchor. Risk in blending mediation with covert resistance pays off without gimmickry. Specificity throughout prevents template drift.</comment>
