<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—fear of failure vs. fierce protectiveness—play out in real time through her combative tenderness toward Kael. The backward-walking tic embodies anxiety and is weaponized in the final beat when she stops retreating and writes Kael’s insight onto the shard. Kael’s single spoken reversal (“the exile’s in the crack”) is earned by prior mentoring and shifts Elara’s tactics. Cost is visible: she relinquishes her self-punishing stance and risks guild judgment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: every beat is linked by “because/therefore.” The inciting need—annotate the shard before dusk—drives each backward step and the tea-leaf reading. Kael’s ladder climb and crack observation force the decisive change: Elara rewrites the annotation, reversing exile’s definition. Closure lands on the page with felt cost—she trades isolation for possible guild return and accepts vulnerability.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The forgotten library’s dust, creaking swing, and fractured mirrors are not backdrop; the shard’s crack literally reframes the concept of exile. Micro-setting—the shard in her palm—constrains the final choice: she must mark its edge with new meaning. Sensory detail is selective (dust motes, tea-leaf spiral) and filtered through Elara’s anxious gaze. The playground swing’s slowing cadence syncs with the story’s tightening.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—redeem exile via shard annotation—is signaled early and tightens once: Kael’s insight narrows Elara’s options from retreat to repair. Pressure grows causally; no coincidence resolves the conflict. The visible cost is her abandonment of perpetual penance. One meaningful turn suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of reversible loss emerges from the shard’s crack and the swing’s arrested motion, not from authorial statement. Subtext lives in Elara’s snapped orders and the silent slide of the clean cup. Final image—the warm shadow waiting—reweights exile as mendable fracture rather than permanent absence. No moralizing; resonance is felt.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is precise, tactile, and emotionally calibrated: “sharp as broken glass” sits beside “tender as a bandage.” Distinct perceptual signature—Elara notices angles, cracks, spirals—remains consistent. Dialogue is sparse but goal-driven; Kael’s rough diction contrasts with Elara’s clipped archivist cadence. No head-hopping; POV stays locked.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers action, image, and interiority. Figurative language is controlled—no mixed metaphors or purple drift. Rhythm accelerates under pressure, then stills with the swing’s final creak. Zero loops or scaffold; every line advances.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Premise of “exile inscribed in mirror shards” feels fresh; the reversible concept is literalized in the crack rather than abstract. Transformation test passes: swap names or places and the emotional logic collapses. Risky structure—lyric compression, backward walking as motif—heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specificity anchors universals.</comment>
