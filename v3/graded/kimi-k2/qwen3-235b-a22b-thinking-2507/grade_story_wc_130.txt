<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the glass-eye ritual and mosaic tracing reveal her under pressure. The final insight—“absence was not an end but an interval”—is earned by prior sensory struggle and costs her the comfort of closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: silence accumulates, vectors intensify, chipped mosaic reframes grief into geometry. Closure lands with Charged Poise as the single drop reconfigures silence into tentative song; cost is the ache of patience.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Cavern orchard is tactile and luminous; the chipped stepping stone constrains her method and charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; every detail filters through Elara’s perceptual bias.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will the orchard speak again?—tightens when silence deepens and the mosaic becomes the only path. Agency is contemplative yet decisive: aligning eyes with fissures risks confirming permanent loss.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from pattern: broken geometries hold meaning. Subtext in the single gold thread and the drop’s whisper avoids moralizing; resonance is felt, not stated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise; perceptual signature—“shimmering vectors of color”—is consistent. Syntax modulates with pressure, no head-hopping; diction stays within conjurer’s arcane lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; no loops or scaffold. Metaphors (“grief pool like water in stone”) are specific and coherent. Rhythm breathes with scene needs; final sentence cadence crystallizes the hush.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: emotional calculus via chipped mosaic and taxidermist eyes. Risky lyric accumulation pays off when silence breaks; transformation feels inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
