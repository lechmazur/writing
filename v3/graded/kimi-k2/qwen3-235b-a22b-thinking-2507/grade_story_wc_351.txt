<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Aris’s contradictory impulses—engineer’s detachment vs. keeper’s empathy—surface in the tremor of his hands and the micro-choice to weep for beauty. The interior arc from detached observer to “keeper of lost light” is embodied, not labeled. The only drag is a brief “he understood then” summary that edges toward diagnostic speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the broken mirror becomes a charged window, the cost is the irreversible neural rewiring that commits Aris to endless excavation. Causal linkage holds—because he rewires, therefore the dreams stabilize and his identity shifts. One brief orientation wobble (“the moon climbed higher”) is minor.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The canyon’s silvered walls and fractured light actively constrain visibility and echo the psychic fracture; the mirror-shards double as micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective—cold light, salt tears—filtered through Aris’s engineer gaze. It stops just short of 8.8 because the canyon itself never physically limits his next move.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—resurrect abandoned dreams—is signaled early and tightened when the neural storm forces a trade-off: personal identity for custodianship. The escalation is one sustained intensification under an Accumulative/Textural lens; cost is the irreversible synaptic rewiring. No reversals, but the single deepening is decisive.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the concrete act of salvaging shards: memory’s persistence versus civilizational amnesia. The final image—the mirror against his temple—reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext in the salt-taste of tears and “quaking reverie” carries more than any statement.</comment>

<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is textured, rhythmic, and consistent with a helix-minded engineer who thinks in spirals. Compression (“chaotically precise”) is taught early and paid off in the steady-handed rewiring. No POV leakage; diction stays within the plausible lexicon of a lone visionary.</comment>

<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and conceptual information. A few ornate clusters (“silvered by the cold light”) flirt with overwriting but never stall momentum. No loops, no scaffold, no mixed metaphors in the closure beat.</comment>

<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The fusion of synaptic plasticity with dream archeology feels fresh and inevitable; the broken periscope mirror repurposed as neural conduit is a specific, non-obvious synthesis. Risky lyric escalation pays off in the final charged image. No derivative echoes.</comment>
