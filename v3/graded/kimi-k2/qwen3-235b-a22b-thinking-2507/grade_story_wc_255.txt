<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lysander’s color-blindness and tactile art practice are embodied in every beat; the reed tongue and quartz trade crystallize his flaw-driven need. Elara’s brief presence supplies external pressure without diluting single POV. The final renunciation—return of the reed—earns the cost of his “awakening” to imperfection.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of plant language and traded objects tightens until the quartz ignites the canvas. Orientation is anchored by the courtyard and phoenix ash within 120 words. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—the glowing flawed strokes reweight the premise with visible cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Cobalt shard, ash-laden air, and plant lexicon are filtered through Lysander’s grey-scale perception, constraining how he negotiates the trade. The courtyard’s objects (reed, quartz, soil patterns) function as micro-setting that directly shapes the final image. Sensory economy favors touch and scent over visual gloss.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—beauty in imperfection—tightens when Lysander stakes his most precise tool for a chance to see light within flaw. One clear escalation: the quartz’s ignition reconfigures the painting and his stance. Cost is the permanent loss of the reed’s guidance, felt when Elara returns it “barter complete.”</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the tension between absence of color and presence of texture; the glowing flawed canvas offers a non-literal answer to the quest for beauty. Subtext lives in plant arrangements and silent trades, never in exposition. Final image reweights “imperfection” as luminous without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Lysander’s tactile, colorless perception; diction favors texture and temperature. Rhythm modulates with the hush of waiting and the pulse of ignition. Dialogue is spare, subtextual, and consistent with the silent plant language.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet textured; every sentence advances image or stakes. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is sparse and purposeful. Sensory verbs are concrete—“scraped,” “brushed,” “pulsed”—anchoring the lyric close.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: color-blind painter, post-phoenix plant language, and bartered awakenings cohere into a singular vision. The quartz ignition as inner light within flawed strokes feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risky compression and lyric closure pay off without gimmickry.</comment>
