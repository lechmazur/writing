<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s guilt-to-forgiveness arc is embodied in tactile micro-choices (loosening the braid, steadying her breath), and the final bronze pour crystallizes her earned renunciation with visible cost. Interiority stays concrete, avoiding therapy-speak. The “technically gentle” trait is dramatized, not labeled. Minor: the shift from guilt to purpose feels compressed, but the final action validates the change.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single-scene causal chain: guilt → forgiveness → reconfiguration → bronze capture. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—names now live in bronze light, cost paid in frozen tears and molten risk. Orientation is immediate; no lens drift. The rope’s reconfiguration is the decisive on-page act that reweights the stake.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Icebound sanctum and aurora are not backdrop; the cold literally threatens the fragile card and dictates the “technically gentle” touch. The rope’s knots and fiber tension constrain every move, charging the final bronze mold. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered. Micro-setting (rope, card, crucible) functions as setting and tool.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve erased voices—tightens when each mis-thread could shatter the card. One meaningful deepening: forgiveness strips defenses, making the final pour a high-stakes act of love, not nostalgia. Cost is the irreversible bronze lock-in. Pressure escalates via tactile risk, not external antagonist.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of preservation-through-sacrifice emerges from the lost-wax metaphor and the final bronze constellation; no moralizing. Subtext lives in the rope’s silent knots and the aurora’s witness. The ending reweights “forgotten” to “remembered in light” without a thesis statement. Ambiguity: the voices remain unheard yet luminous—earned complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Lyric, tactile voice stays inside Elara’s perceptual signature—temperature, texture, aurora pulse. No head-hopping. Syntax mirrors her precision: long clauses for reverence, fragments under risk. Register never drifts; “snowmelt ardor” feels native to her idiom. Compression is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Zero loops, high density: “each perforation mapped a name’s resonance” does triple duty. Rhythm modulates with task urgency; no figurative muddle. Strong verbs (“plumed,” “bled,” “pulsing”) replace modifiers. Occasional elevated diction (“sanctum,” “aurora”) is justified by setting. Final bronze pour is crystal-clear action.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fusion of lost-wax craft, aurora-lit ice temple, and sonic punch-card memory feels inevitable yet fresh. The rope reconfiguration is a non-obvious mechanism that grows from Elara’s vocation. Emotional specificity (Anya’s lullaby as amber ripple) prevents generic “save the forgotten” trope. Risky lyric mode pays off in resonant closure.</comment>
