<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her “grip on reality” is dramatized through sensory hallucination and the swan’s folds. The vow to witness without judgment collides with her instinct to save the Codices, producing a credible renunciation that costs her the route to the vault. The contradiction is present but slightly underplayed; the moment of yielding could carry more visceral sting.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara steps into the collapse, sees transformation instead of loss, and returns to record the change—an Earned Stasis that forecloses rescue. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of decay, silence, and fungal rebirth reweights the stake. Cost is legible in the sealed vault and the altered swan.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The catacomb library is rendered with tactile decay—mildew, vellum rot, cold black water—yet every detail filters through Elara’s custodial gaze. The obsidian refuge and origami swan function as micro-settings that constrain her tactics and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; the fold-step-fold sequence tracks cleanly across moves.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserve knowledge vs. witness its transformation—is signaled early and tightened by the tremor. The meaningful turn is Elara’s deliberate choice to burrow through silence rather than dig, narrowing her options and accepting loss. Cost is visible in the sealed Eastern Codices and the altered swan.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: knowledge is not static archive but living decay and regrowth. The final image—glowing fungi on ruined pages—reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext operates in the silence that mends perception and the refusal to intervene, leaving resonant ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lush yet disciplined, modulating from sensory saturation to hushed reverence inside the obsidian refuge. Perceptual signature is distinct: shadows “whisper histories,” silence “blooms.” No head-hopping; focalization remains locked to Elara’s loosened grip on reality.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers decay, silence, or fold. Metaphors are precise—“reality yielded like thick fabric”—and never muddle causality. No loops or scaffold; rhythm breathes with scene pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of origami portal, regenerative silence, and fungal rebirth feels inevitable yet fresh. Familiar tropes—hidden library, magical map—are transformed through Elara’s custodial ethic and sensory looseness. Risk-taking in non-Euclidean folds pays off without obscuring clarity.</comment>
