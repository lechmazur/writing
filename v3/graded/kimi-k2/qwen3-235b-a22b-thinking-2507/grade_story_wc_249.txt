<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s grief-driven compulsion is embodied in the drumming and the desperate sustain of the lagoon vision; the contradiction between hope and the machine’s limits is palpable. The final stillness carries visible cost—her hands fall silent, the dream collapses—earning the Earned Stasis closure. Interiority is specific, never diagnostic. Minor slip: “guinea pig” label is external, not self-concept, but it doesn’t undercut motivation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each drumming beat layers density until the auric flare peaks, then the cadence breaks into sterile hum. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara’s stance crystallizes in exhausted silence, lagoon lost. Orientation is immediate; no causality gaps. One micro-turn: the garden’s color shift from blue to auric gold signals the tightening.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The sound-wave garden’s crystalline resonators and the console’s cold metal are tactile constraints that shape Elara’s drumming and the final overload. The lagoon projection is rendered with synesthetic specificity—liquid gold under starlight—charging the final vanishing. Spatial choreography is clean; no white-room drift. Environment directly limits and enables the climax.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—resurrect Lyra’s vision—tightens when the auric frequency aligns and then collapses under neural overload. Escalation is driven by Elara’s accelerating taps; cost is the irreversible loss of the shared dream. One decisive tightening: the monitors shriek, foreclosing continuation. Agency remains hers; coincidence only complicates.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of rebellion against erasure emerges through Elara’s tactile refusal to let grief be sanitized. The lagoon’s reappearance and extinction reweight the premise: memory cannot survive institutional logic without mortal cost. No moralizing; resonance is carried by the final image of silent fingers on a dead console.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with rhythmic drumming mirrored in sentence cadence. POV stays locked to Elara’s sensorium; perceptual signature is the synesthetic translation of taps into silver serpents of light. No head-hopping or register drift. Compression and elision are taught early and paid off in the flickering fade.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers sensory data or stakes. Metaphors (silver serpents, auric sorrow) are coherent and earned. No loops, scaffold, or filter-verb stacks. Final paragraph’s syntactic stillness mirrors the lagoon’s vanishing—craft serving closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The neural-lattice grief-therapy frame is fresh, and the drumming-as-code method is specific to this world. Transformation test: swapping any element (garden, lagoon, drumming) would break the emotional engine. Risky lyric structure pays off in the charged final stillness.</comment>
