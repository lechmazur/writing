<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—skepticism vs. wonder—is embodied in the tactile handling of the tooth and crystallizes in her decision to plant it as a beacon; the cost of her former certainty is felt. Finn’s shrewd innocence pressures her in-scene, forcing the micro-choice to share the story of the ivy gate. Minor slip: “shrewdly innocent” is used twice as label rather than dramatized action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the tooth reweighted from relic of betrayal to guiding star, with the garden’s moonlit sundial as the charged image. Causal chain holds—discovery of tooth → memory of bone-setting wisdom → decision to transform pain into light. No orientation drift; anchors clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Garden, bench, sundial, and splinted arm function as micro-setting that constrains movement and supplies the final beacon site. Dew, moss, and moonlight are filtered through Elara’s forgiving yet skeptical gaze, integrating atmosphere with theme. One minor spatial blur: “ancient oak” is mentioned but never located relative to the sundial.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to live with the cleft in certainty—tightens once when Elara decides to plant the tooth as public teaching tool, trading private grief for communal guidance. Cost is visible: she forfeits the comfort of forgetting. Pressure grows under Accumulative/Textural lens via density of memory and object resonance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: forgiveness as integration of fracture rather than erasure. Subtext in the ivy pattern and bone-setting metaphor avoids statement. Final image of the tooth glinting like a promise offers non-literal resonance without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Distinct perceptual signature—selective sensory focus, lyrical yet grounded diction, rhythmic modulation under emotional pressure. No head-hopping; POV remains tightly anchored to Elara. Dialogue sparse but natural; Finn’s single line carries subtext of trust.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, vivid, and propulsive; no loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated phrasing (“nostalgic innovation”) risks register drift but stays within Elara’s reflective lexicon. Strong sentence variety and paragraph rhythm support the quiet climax.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: changeling folklore reframed through parental grief and bone-setting metaphor, yielding a non-obvious angle on forgiveness. Specificity of the tooth and garden anchors universals. Risk-taking in quiet lyric closure pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
