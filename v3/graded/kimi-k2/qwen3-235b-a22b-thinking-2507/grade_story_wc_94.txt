<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas’s interiority is vivid and embodied—scar-tracing, timer-clicking, envelope-pressing—each micro-choice reveals hierarchy of values (truth over safety). Motivation (mapping scars) is clear and intensifies through escalating storm pressure. Final renunciation of timetable for internal map is earned, with visible cost (first uncensored line). Slight deduction for near-therapy framing of “cartography of pain” in reflection block.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: storm break reveals star-strewn sky while Silas reconfigures meaning—“We are the constellations we survive.” Cost is felt in the rarefied tear turned starlight and the uncensored line after five years. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of timed pauses between lightning builds density until silence itself becomes map. No orientation drift; anchors clear by 80 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Observatory dome, storm, and high-altitude cold are tactile and selective—rain lashing plexiglass, thin air rarefying thought. Setting constrains choice: storm blocks conjunction, forces internal reckoning. Micro-setting of body-as-map (scars as Orion, Capricorn) charges final image. Minor over-description of “storm-kissed wonder” slightly dilutes economy.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding truth in silence between strikes—tightens through escalating storm and timer ritual. Each timed pause forecloses avoidance; final 15-second interval crystallizes stance. Cost is the emotional exposure of speaking after years of silence. Agency resides in Silas’s decision to measure and finally voice, not in storm coincidence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: scars as waypoints, silence as truth-bearer. Subtext in envelope’s single sentence and timer’s heartbeat. Final whispered line reweights premise without moralizing. Complexity lingers—nation still broken, but internal map complete. Avoids tidy resolution; ambiguity feels earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is poet-exile: precise, sensorily dense, rhythmic (“furiously tranquil precision”). Perceptual signature consistent—stormlight, scar ridges, timer clicks. No head-hopping; POV locked. Compression purposeful (“salt into starlight”). No dialogue, so no voice convergence. Lyric elision taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is propulsive, high-density; figurative language serves pattern (lightning-scar constellations). No loops or scaffold. Minor purple patch (“storm-kissed wonder”) but does not obscure closure. Strong verbs, tactile nouns. Clean grammar; pronouns unambiguous.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: censored poet uses lightning intervals to map bodily scars as constellations. Timer-as-compass and envelope-as-oracle transform familiar exile trope. Risky lyric mode commits fully and lands. Avoids cliché; scars-as-stars feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
