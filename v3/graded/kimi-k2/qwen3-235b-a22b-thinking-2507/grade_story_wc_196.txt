<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her grief and nascent purpose feel earned. The micro-choice to catalog the button separately crystallizes her arc with visible cost—she re-enters the work she had been avoiding. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, so the 9+ quick test is narrowly missed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara’s stance toward the files shifts from tomb to “quiet promise of remembrance.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—dust motes, button, letter accumulate until meaning reweights. Cost is legible in her first smile since Daniel left.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The file room’s dust, fluorescent hum, and archival boxes constrain every move; the button itself becomes micro-setting that charges the final image. Selective sensory detail mirrors Elara’s narrowed grief. Spatial choreography is clean; no white-room syndrome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether Elara can re-engage with loss—is signaled early and tightened when the button forces her to decide how to honor Marcus’s unknown history. One meaningful deepening suffices; no external reversals required. Cost is felt in her raw re-entry to the work.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of “love persists through small tokens” emerges organically from Thomas’s letter and Elara’s final act. No moralizing; the ending image of the button in its protective sleeve reweights prior grief without statement. Complexity is honored—Marcus never learns the story, yet the reader feels the continuum.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is distinct—archivist precision laced with quiet lyricism (“dust motes swirling like forgotten constellations”). Perceptual signature is consistent; no POV leakage. Compression and patterned elision are purposeful and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; figurative language is selective. One minor loop—“dust motes” echoed in closing image—reads as intentional reprise rather than artifact. No mixed metaphors or register drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Foster-care archive + Civil War button is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis. The premise commits fully; no retreat into generic uplift. Specificity of the 54th Mass. button and Clara Chen’s lineage anchors universals. Risky compression succeeds.</comment>
