<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Aris’s motivation is vivid—grief and scientific duty fused—but interiority drifts into exposition (“his motivation burned with quiet urgency”) rather than embodied contradiction. The tapping rhythm is a nice micro-choice, yet it never forces a costly decision; it merely soothes. Closure’s renunciation is credible, but the cost feels generalized (“some losses were irreversible”) rather than personally staked.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: coral data, atlas page, and tapping rhythms layer until the final cadence reweights the stake. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Aris’s slowed taps crystallize irreversible loss. Orientation is swift; no drift. One minor causality gap: the leap from “limestone vulnerable” to “paths vanish” could be one sentence tighter.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Station, drowned reef, and atlas page are tactile and selective; the torn corner’s frayed edge mirrors coral skeleton. Environment constrains the final realization: only living coral could scaffold the paths. Sensory hierarchy is biased by Aris’s profession—sonar grids over tourist vistas. No spatial contradictions; horizon “bruised twilight” is brief but apt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—why paths vanish—is signaled early and deepened by the revelation that bleaching, not mere rise, erased them. Escalation is one sustained tightening rather than multiple turns; cost is conceptual (irreversibility) rather than viscerally dramatized. Agency is observational; the tightening is intellectual, yet it forecloses hope of restoration.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from coral death as irreversible archive loss; no moralizing. The atlas page’s journey from desperate keepsake to evidence of extinction reweights meaning. Subtext resides in the rhythm taps shifting from anxiety to elegy. Final image—“the patient… still dying in slow, eternal cycles”—offers resonant, non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is marine-scientist precise yet lyric: “salt and sorrow,” “mechanical heartbeat.” Perceptual signature filters every detail through sonar logs and dive memory. Rhythm control is deliberate; sentence length modulates with Aris’s pulse. No POV leakage; diction stays within lexicon of a field researcher.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid; each sentence layers data and emotion. Metaphors (“ocean’s memory remained poisoned”) are few and purposeful. No loops or scaffold; “periodically eternal” is repeated but thematically earned. Minor filter verb (“he recalled”) is brief and justified. Final cadence slows to single taps, mirroring closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Premise—vanished reef paths as symptom of post-ban irreversible loss—is fresh; avoids typical climate-apocalypse tropes. Atlas page as forensic relic is specific. Risk lies in quiet, observational arc; it pays off through rhythmic closure. No derivative echoes; coral bleaching witness role is personalized through dive footage memory.</comment>
