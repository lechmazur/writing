<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is vivid and embodied—his “orthogonal approaches” thinking is dramatized through concrete micro-choices (seed weighed, soil patted, room redesign planned). Motivation is consistent and intensifies: safeguarding innovation moves from abstract to embodied guardianship. No contradictory impulses on stage, but the final choice is more quiet acceptance than costly renunciation, capping the arc just short of 8+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Single-scene, single-POV default met; closure lands as Charged Poise: the seed planted becomes a living experiment whose cost is the private containment of future stench and risk. Causal lens holds: “because the note said ‘where silence flows,’ therefore he plants by the brook.” Orientation is anchored by 120 words; no teleporting props. Closure image reconfigures meaning without tidy payoff.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Brook-side clearing is rendered through tactile detail (soil, moonlit water, storm-born silence) that constrains the final choice of planting site. Micro-setting doubles as metaphoric incubator for innovation. Sensory hierarchy aligns with Elias’s selective attention; no white-room syndrome. Environment is not merely backdrop but active constraint on containment strategy.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—safeguarding space for unconventional growth—is signaled early and tightens once: wild planting risks invasion, controlled planting risks private burden. One deepening beat: the realization the seed is a “test” reframes stakes from botanical to philosophical. Agency is decision-to-plant with visible cost (future containment labor). No external antagonist needed; pressure is coherent under causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of nurturing disruptive innovation emerges organically from seed, brook, and escape-room metaphor; no direct statement. Subtext in “plant me where silence flows” reweights the brook from refuge to crucible. Final image crystallizes theme without moralizing: innovation thrives unseen, at personal cost. Resonant ambiguity lingers—who sent the seed remains unanswered, charging possibility.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias; perceptual signature is precise (“storm-born silence,” “orthogonal approaches”). Syntax mirrors his puzzle-designer mind: layered clauses, strategic repetition. No dialogue, so no voice leakage. Register consistent—slightly elevated diction fits reflective night vigil without drifting into purple.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and information-dense; each sentence advances image or motive. Figurative language is selective (“moonlight silvered the water”) and never muddles causality. No loops or scaffold; paragraph cuts are purposeful. Occasional lyrical uplift (“hush of a possibility just born”) earns its place by charging closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Corpse-flower seed as disruptive-innovation metaphor is fresh; escape-room designer as guardian of hidden bloom is non-obvious synthesis. Tropes (mysterious package, brook-side epiphany) are transformed through Elias’s vocational lens. Risky choice to withhold sender pays off by keeping focus on stewardship rather than whodunit. Specificity of “orthogonal approaches” grounds abstraction.</comment>
