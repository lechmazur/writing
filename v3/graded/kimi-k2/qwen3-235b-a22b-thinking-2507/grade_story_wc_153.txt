<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—seeking the moment of hesitation yet knowing she cannot change it—are embodied in her bleeding grip on the shard; the final renunciation of blame in favor of understanding is earned through visceral cost. Interiority is specific and sensory, never diagnostic. The only cap is that the sister remains off-page, so relationship-as-crucible is absent.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elara stands in the space where apology waited, reweighted by moonlight healing and the shard’s transformation from weapon to relic. Causal chain holds—each evocation tightens options until the final image crystallizes the cost. No orientation drift; the mangrove labyrinth is anchored early and spatially tracked.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The mangrove roots, spirits’ song, and the shard’s moonlit glow constrain every move; the root-window condensation literally shapes the quest. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered. The final moonbeam charging the healed hand is a micro-setting beat that reweights the entire journey.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding the pre-decision breath—is signaled in paragraph one and tightened by each condensation message; the spirits’ shift from lullaby to warning hum escalates pressure. The cost is the reopened wound and the felt regret channeled through the shard. One decisive tightening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the concrete: the courage to inhabit the moment before choice, not to rewrite it. The final image of moonlight sealing the cut reframes the apology as internal healing rather than spoken words. No moralizing; resonance is carried by the shard’s transformation and the spirits’ lament.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise—“labyrinth’s humid breath,” “shattered glass” face—maintaining perceptual signature under stress. Syntax modulates with urgency; fragments compress pressure. No dialogue, so no voice convergence issues.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; every image advances atmosphere or stakes. No loops or scaffold. One mixed metaphor—“weight of unsaid words thick as mist”—is minor and does not cloud closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The fusion of cathedral gargoyle shard with mangrove spirits and unsent letters is fresh; the shard’s dual role as wound and key feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric compression pays off in the final moonlit reweighting.</comment>
