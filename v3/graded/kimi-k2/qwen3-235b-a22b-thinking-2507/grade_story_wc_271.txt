<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—terror vs. the need to plant—are embodied in the freeze, the thumb on the photograph, the deliberate dig. Motivation is rooted in loss and penance, intensifying to the final renunciation: she plants knowing the cliff will fall. The pearl of stillness is dramatized as a bodily practice, not a label. Only the photograph’s edges feel slightly soft from over-handling in the prose.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the drone memory recurs with increasing density until the final cadence shift—“plant one more seed”—crystallizes the Earned Stasis. Closure lands on the page with visible cost: the cliff’s erosion and the cold trowel in her hand. No orientation debt; anchors are clear by line 3. The pattern of sensory return (gull → photograph → trowel) is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The cliffside arboretum, salt wind, and abandoned lighthouse are not backdrop; they pressure every choice—thin soil, eroding edge, automated beam. The photograph and trowel act as micro-settings that constrain tactics. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: mineral scent of the photograph trumps panoramic vista. One hairline slip: “grey-streaked hair” is generic against the rest.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will she plant or surrender to panic—is signaled in paragraph one. The tightening occurs when the gull’s second cry deepens the freeze; the photograph and trowel become somatic anchors that foreclose retreat. Cost is the irreversible knowledge of erosion and the emotional toll of staying. Agency is renunciation/continuation, not victory.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the friction between erosion and planting; no explicit statement intrudes. The final image of the stubborn bloom pushing through stone reweights the entire premise without moralizing. Subtext lives in the photograph’s softened edges and the lighthouse’s cold beam—technology replacing human vigilance. Complexity is honored: optimism is not naïveté but a conscious, costly stance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elara’s perceptual signature: wind-taste, salt-ghost of cedar, tactile ridge of the photograph. Rhythm modulates with panic—short, breathless clauses—then lengthens as calm returns. No filter-verb stacks; “she felt” is avoided in favor of direct sensation. Voice is consistent, coastal, quietly lyrical without purple drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is taut, rhythmic, and information-dense: “salt-stung earth,” “kaleidoscope of shattering glass and lace.” No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Metaphors are precise and earned (“pearl of stillness” is taught via bodily practice). Minor cadence echo in “salt air” / “salt-stung” is purposeful patterning, not artifact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Familiar trauma-gardening trope is transformed through the cliff-edge setting, the lighthouse’s automation, and the somatic-marker technique. The synthesis feels inevitable: only this character, this soil, this photograph could yield this ending. Specificity of sea holly roots gripping stone anchors universals. Risk is quiet—no twist, yet the emotional calculus is non-obvious.</comment>
