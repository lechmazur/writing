<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias’s grief-rooted resolve to heal the battlefield is embodied in every micro-choice; the pods, birds, and languages all press against his need to atone. Interiority stays concrete—knuckles white, pods rattling, salt on tongue—without slipping into label-speak. The final scattering is earned: the cost is the reef’s silence he must carry forever.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each bird response layers density until the final beat crystallizes a new concord on land. Closure is a Charged Poise—the garden’s fragile bloom against the infinite dead reef—felt cost legible in the empty sack. Orientation anchors by line 3; no drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The jetty’s narrow vastness, skeletal reef, and twilight palette constrain every move; the blooming flowers at the end physically reclaim the planks once used for war. Sensory detail is selective—salt sting, bird cries, crushed-pod dust—filtered through Elias’s veteran gaze.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: resurrect life on a salted grave. Escalation is incremental—each bird exchange tightens the weave of obligation—until the final seeds commit Elias to endless return. Cost is the irreversible silence of the reef and the lifetime of tending ahead.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges: regeneration through listening to the dead—reef, languages, birds—without sermon. The garden’s purple heads against the black sea reweight the premise: memory must root, not merely mourn. Subtext lives in bird-calls and husk-crush, never in exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is weathered, rhythmic, salt-stained; diction (“ink-black sea,” “salt-scoured battlefield”) belongs to a coachman who has hauled corpses. Compression and patterned elision (“narrow vastness”) are taught early and paid off in the final hush. No head-hop, no filter clutter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet lyrical; each sentence advances image or stakes. No loops, no mixed metaphors. Rhythm modulates—long breaths for memory, clipped beats for bird exchanges—then settles into the quiet final cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fusing dead-language necromancy with avian soil-mapping feels fresh and inevitable. The transformation of a military jetty into a seed-scatter ritual is specific, grounded, and risky without gimmickry. The concept commits fully; no retreat to sentimentality.</comment>
