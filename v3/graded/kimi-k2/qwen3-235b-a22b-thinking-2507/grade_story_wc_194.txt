<question>1</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Elara’s interior contradictions—heir vs dynasty-ender, relief vs cost—live in embodied micro-motions and silent decisions. The final renunciation lands with visible emotional price traced floor-to-shadow rather than stated aloud.</comment>

<question>2</question>
<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Densely Accumulative/Textural: every beat tightens the harmonic pattern until the brass handle reweights the entire premise. The closure—‘a quiet, necessary beginning’—is a Resonant Reconfiguration, the Veridian legacy’s moral rot re-priced on the page while Elara carries the cost forward.</comment>

<question>3</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The sepia reading room functions as micro-setting and tool: dimensional acoustics, dust-light choreography, and brass-plank resonance all become tactical elements rather than décor. Specificity in wood grain and shadow patterns charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—moral inheritance versus erasure—deepens with each tightening frequency. The escalating pressure is Elara’s rhythmic attunement itself; cost is felt when the silence after the last wave confirms that the family legacy must be ended.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme is revealed only through pattern and shadow; no moralizing speech interrupts. The ledger, crank, and dust-light become an embodied argument for the necessity of endings, re-weighted in the final golden hush.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Interior prose has precise perceptual signature—“sepia reading room,” “golden shadows gilding the floating motes”—and rhythmic modulation under pressure. Compression is purposeful; ellipsis accrues rather than obscures.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Clean lyric control; no redundant stems, no mixed vehicles in peak beats. High density—one sentence often performs setting, character, and harmonic exposition simultaneously without scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The standing-wave-as-reader device is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight; no stock paranormal trope, no echo of famous scenes. The inheritance of shame transformed through acoustics feels singular to this voice and house.</comment>
