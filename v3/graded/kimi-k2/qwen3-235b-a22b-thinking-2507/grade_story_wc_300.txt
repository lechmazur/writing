<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Aris’s shift from clinical detachment to empathic witness is dramatized through the single, costly act of relinquishing the pearl; the embodied chill of stone against his knees and the warming sphere in his palm make the interior change tactile. Interiority stays concrete and profession-filtered until the final beat, avoiding label-speak. Still, we get no contradictory impulse in-scene—only a linear replacement of one stance by another—so the change feels slightly smoothed rather than wrested.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration: placing the pearl on the spire dissolves the bunker’s emotional quarantine and forecloses Aris’s bureaucratic path. Causal linkage holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each sensory increment (cold stone, warming pearl, sighing confessions) deepens density until the final cadence shift releases the accumulated emotional light. Cost is legible in the sentence “He didn’t sign the decommission order that day,” which carries professional and existential risk.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The milky quartz that drinks light, the grit that crunches under boots, and the final crystal spire that crowns the pearl are all tactile, POV-filtered, and ultimately instrumental: the spire physically accepts the pearl and channels the release. Spatial choreography is clean; no white-room syndrome. Environment never constrains a second choice, so the 9+ gate is missed, but the setting does charge the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to entomb or release the condensed despair—tightens once, at the pearl’s handling; the choice to crown the spire visibly forecloses the safer bureaucratic option. Pressure is textural, not causal, but accumulates convincingly under the Accumulative lens. A sharper tangible price (e.g., immediate career repercussion) would have pushed the score higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: archived grief becomes communal light when witnessed rather than filed. The spiral of micro-confessions inside an oceanic object reweights the bunker’s failed survival into a shared human fragility, resolved in the final image of “light, shared and quiet.” No moralizing line intrudes; resonance is earned through concrete particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly lashed to Aris’s professional eye, diction clipped and geological until the final clause softens in parallel with his stance. No head-hop or filter-stack; perceptual signature is consistent. Rhythm modulates from cautious inspection to the release beat without syntactic drumroll.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; sentences advance at least two jobs (e.g., “the stale air… pressed against his back during the heartbeat of a hesitation” sets both atmosphere and ticking clock). One mixed metaphor—“the resonant hush… vibrated in his molars”—is minor. No loops or scaffold persist; clarity at closure remains intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The fusion of post-apocalyptic inspection report with geologic-emotional alchemy feels fresh; the cultivated pearl as stasis-engine for abandoned hope is a specific, non-obvious synthesis. Risk is taken with lyric accumulation over plot reversals, and it pays off in the final reconfiguration. Could edge higher with a sharper external consequence, but the concept is memorably singular.</comment>
