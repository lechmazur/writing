<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aris’s interior contradiction—mocking telepathy while designing it—grounds every beat; the muscovite handling and micro-choice to modulate light via his own pulse embody motive. Lena’s skepticism-turned-collaboration pressures Aris to crystallize the new protocol, their synced breathing a visible cost. The final renunciation of forced connection for somatic listening is earned and forecloses the pill path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the light rig reframed from outward projection to inward listening, with the muscovite as fractal lens—cost is the recall itself and the fragile hope in Lena’s tears. Causal chain holds: static shock → somatic echo insight → new protocol. Orientation anchored by shattered mapper and recall notice within first 120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Studio’s ozone haze, broken screen, and calibrated LEDs constrain choices: the rig must be repurposed, not replaced. Muscovite sliver functions as micro-setting and tool, its fractal veins guiding the final light patterns. Sensory selection (ozone, prismatic shards) mirrors internal fracturing and re-integration.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to salvage meaning from the pill disaster—tightens when Aris realizes the pills only amplified somatic noise. One decisive deepening: shift from forcing signals to listening to the body’s own language. Cost is the irreversible recall and the delicate, shared hope that this fragile method might work.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: true understanding arises not from imposed connection but from attuned listening to embodied signals. Subtext in Lena’s silent tear and the trembling hope refracted through muscovite avoids moralizing. Final image reweights “telepathy” into somatic conversation without a stated lesson.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: scientific precision fused with light-artist sensibility—“fractally precise paths,” “willowglass hope.” Syntax modulates with pressure, tightening during insight, breathing during collaboration. No head-hopping; POV stays locked to Aris, with Lena’s interiority inferred through gesture and synced breath.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet clear; each sentence advances image or causality. No loops or scaffold; “shattered display screen,” “ghostly trails,” “prismatic shards” are specific and purposeful. Metaphors (river delta pressure points) stay coherent. Rhythm accelerates during the protocol shift, then softens into the final image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: telepathy pill recall reimagined as somatic echo crisis, resolved by fractal optics and embodied listening. Muscovite’s mineral logic becomes literal model, not symbol. Risky choice to hinge climax on micro-muscle modulation of light pays off with crystalline clarity.</comment>
