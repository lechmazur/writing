<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas’s interiority is embodied and consistent; the needle-as-promise anchors contradictory impulses (mend vs. risk) and the final nod to the mother-infant pair crystallizes cost. The only gap is the passengers remain largely anonymous, so relationship pressure is muted.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the mended rope and aligned ferry foreclose the drift toward mudflats; the cost is the sustained vigilance and the palimpsest vow kept. Causal chain (feel drift → mend → adjust tiller) holds under a Causal lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fog, river pulse, and dripping boathouse gutters are not backdrop but instruments: the ticking gutters act as countdown, the fog forces non-visual navigation. The yarn needle even serves as micro-setting that constrains the final choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—safe crossing—tightens when the ferry slides starboard; the mending beat and tiller micro-adjustment escalate pressure and visibly foreclose the mudflat threat. Cost is the unending vigilance Silas must pay.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of “distilling complexity into essence” emerges through the rope-mending ritual and the quiet nod at disembarkation; no moral is stated, yet the palimpsest promise reweights the entire crossing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is tactile, weathered, and river-soaked; perceptual signature (“bones remembered every rutted track”) stays consistent. Compression and patterned elision (“less action than thought”) are taught early and paid off in the final tiller shift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid; figurative language is selective (“spindrift serenity”) and never clogs the high-pressure beats. No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere or action.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The ferry-as-ritual, needle-as-promise synthesis feels inevitable and fresh; the quiet, non-heroic resolution subverts typical river-crossing drama without gimmickry.</comment>
