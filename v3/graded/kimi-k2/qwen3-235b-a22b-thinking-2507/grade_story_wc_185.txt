<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid, specific, and contradictory—her exhaustion clashes with razor-sharp mapping knowledge—while her kneeling micro-choice and the final renunciation of the map create an earned, costly shift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure blooms as an inverted echo: the resonant reconfiguration (“bloom of hush”) reweights all prior noise, turning invasion into restoration; causality is compressed but intact under a lyrical lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The ice formations, body-as-tool tension, and luminous stone ground every beat; the cave’s geometry literally drives the acoustic cure, not just scenery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Invasion noise tightens options until the crack-pattern discovery becomes the decisive trade-off: risking silence over safety. The stakes contract neatly into one moment of choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme refrains from moralizing; the hush itself becomes a non-literal answer to chaos, earned through fracture patterns and exhaustion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature—cartographer’s spatial precision under duress—remains consistent; diction and rhythm tighten to match the bloom’s heartbeat cadence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>No loops, high-density lines; figurative language serves sonics (“frozen lightning”) without fogging causality in the peak bloom beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms invasion trope into acoustic restoration; the echo-chamber stone and fracture decodes feel inevitable and irreplaceable.</comment>
