<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Kai’s internal contradiction—guilt driving him forward yet anchoring him—propels the micro-choice to reclaim voice through fire’s story. Embodied emotion (“hard scars against weathered skin,” “cradled like a wounded bird”) reveals hierarchy of values without therapy-speak. The credible renunciation of solitary penance for shared vigilance lands with felt cost; minor drift into summarized childhood dilutes immediacy.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Framed by situational lens: coherent pressure (moonlit ridge, cracked box) forces stance crystallization. Closure—deciding to speak universal language of fire’s cost—reconfigures options with earned social consequence. Orientation is anchored early; one causal jump (daughter’s eyes “hollow” is asserted, not dramatized) slightly scars linkage. Meets 8.8 gate; capped by lens drift, not flaw.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Moonlight and charred valley texture each beat; the ridge offers vantage that literally guides Kai’s pivot from mourning to mission. Porcelain shards glinting through fracture become micro-setting that shapes final resolve. Occasional stock phrases (“liquid silver,” “slow dance of stars”) nudge toward decorative; still, environment constrains and charges closure effectively.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—turn private grief into community warning—grows through one decisive deepening: realization pain is universal language. No escalation cascade; single meaningful tightening suffices under situational lens. Coincidence absent; pressure remains coherent. Final image of “ridge path toward a new dawn” narrows options with visible cost on his solitude.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Theme manifests in Kai’s shift from tombstone to beacon, never stated as thesis. Subtext lives in cracked box: relic of failure now vessel of wisdom, reweighted through embodied choice. Resists tidy moral; lingering ambiguity around daughter’s trust failure adds complexity. Final line fuses “hard softness” into non-literal answer without meta-commentary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Lyrical-yet-grounded voice filters moonlight and ash through scarred firefighter perceptions; diction (“embers in the chest,” “cracked porcelain fairy”) stays within lexicon. Sensory rhythms accelerate under pressure; no head-hopping. One lapse: “broken promise” label intrudes mid-crisis, but compression compensates quickly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary from breathless compression to longer cadence mirroring Kai’s descent. Density high—each line advances memory-thread or stakes. Mixed metaphors avoided; one near-redundant ash/embers pair loops but artifact is minor. No filter-verb stacks in peak beats. Rhythm propels forward cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Soldier-parent failure trope transformed via porcelain shard metaphor specific to this firefighter’s guilt. Ridge-as-pulpit premise non-obvious among firefighter redemption arcs. Fresh synthesis: using broken dollhouse relic to guide public safety feels inevitable only at closure, not beforehand. Moderate originality cap prevents 8+ due to familiar father-daughter guilt spine.</comment>
