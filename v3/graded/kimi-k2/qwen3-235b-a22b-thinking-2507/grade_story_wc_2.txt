<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Aris’s contradictory impulses—precision vs surrender—are embodied in tactile micro-choices (calipers vs improvised chain-net). The final renunciation of the compass lands with visible cost: he abandons the very proof he sought, earning the unplanned path. Interiority stays concrete, never lapsing into label-speak. One slip: “uncertainly certain” is asserted more than dramatized until the final beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: leaving the compass crystallizes the new stance and carries felt cost (the weightless satchel). Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of fused clocks → pattern of surrender—held without contradiction. Orientation is anchored by 120 words; no teleporting props. One minor causality wobble: the admiral’s despair is inferred, not shown.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Setting is selective and purposeful: ash-choked streets, glistening stalactites, mist-beaded walls all filter through Aris’s tinkerer gaze. The collapsed bridge and waterfall mist actively constrain tactics, forcing the improvised net. Micro-setting (compass on ledge) charges the final image. No white-room syndrome; spatial choreography is clean.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—trust the unplanned—is signaled early and tightened once: the bridge collapse forces improvisation, foreclosing retreat. Cost is visible (abandoning the compass). Pressure escalates under Accumulative lens via pattern of broken clocks → pattern of surrender. No external antagonist needed; internal conflict suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of surrender to uncertainty emerges organically from clock corpses and the compass recorder. Final image—leaving the warm, vibrating compass—reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext in the “melted notes” and “listening” compass avoids abstraction. No thematic drift; ambiguity lingers productively.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is distinct: precise tinkerer diction (“calipers,” “lubricant”) modulates into lyrical awe at the falls. Rhythm tightens under pressure—short clauses during the swing, longer breaths in the cavern. No head-hopping; POV stays locked. One minor register drift: “conceptual repricing” feels academic, but occurs outside quoted interiority.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence advances image or motive. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful (“stone fangs”). No loops or scaffold; “swirling leaves” returns with reweighted meaning. Mechanics clean; no tense drift. Opening and closing lines bookend the arc elegantly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Familiar quest for lost relic is transformed through tinkerer POV and anti-resolution: the finder chooses not to keep. Clocks-as-messengers and compass-as-recorder are fresh inflections. Risky choice to end on renunciation pays off; closure remains legible. No derivative echoes; specificity anchors universals.</comment>
