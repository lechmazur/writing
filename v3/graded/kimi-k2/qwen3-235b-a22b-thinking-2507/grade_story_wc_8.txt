<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s emotionally rational stance is embodied in micro-choices—calmly reassembling wind-scattered papers, tracing the letter’s border—yet the interior contradiction between sorrow and resolve remains more asserted than dramatized. The final resolve to confront the council is credible but arrives via summary rather than a visible, costly micro-choice on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: Elara’s walk toward the town hall crystallizes stakes and reconfigures options under a Causal lens (“this one won’t spare us either”). The cost is felt—she shoulders Clara’s silence and the rose’s thorns—but the decisive act itself is off-stage, slightly blunting the before/after legibility.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The station’s ivy-choked decay is vivid and selective, mirroring moral erosion without overt symbolism. The rosebush’s final petal and the letter’s gold leaf constrain Elara’s urgency and charge the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</question>
<comment>Dominant stake—preventing a repeat tragedy—is signaled early and tightens once when Elara maps the 1898 and 2024 parallels. The cost is conceptual (town’s moral erosion) but still legible; a more visceral forfeiture would push higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</question>
<comment>Theme of noble lies emerges organically from the parallels Elara draws; the rosebush’s thorns reweight the premise in the final image. Avoids moralizing, but the closing rehearsal of her argument edges toward thematic echo, tempering resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</question>
<comment>Voice is precise, historian-cool, with rhythmic control under pressure. Free indirect style stays clean; no head-hop. Occasional elevated diction (“visceral warning”) momentarily drifts from Elara’s lexicon but does not obscure clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</question>
<comment>Prose is lean, vivid, and propulsive; no loops or scaffold. Metaphors (ivy like green veins) are purposeful and coherent. One mixed moment—“ghostly fingers urging her forward”—is minor and does not dull closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</question>
<comment>The synthesis of historical letter + modern rail revival feels fresh; the rosebush as moral barometer is specific rather than generic. Risk is moderate—quiet ending, no twist—but the inevitability of the parallel lands well.</comment>
