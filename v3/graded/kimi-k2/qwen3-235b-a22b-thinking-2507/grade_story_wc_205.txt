<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—revolutionary guilt vs. visionary hope—are embodied in her trembling recitation and the shard’s cold weight. The final renunciation (“I shattered the vase, and with it, the future”) lands with earned cost, though Varek’s ideological certainty feels sketched rather than pressured.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the shard’s demonstration reframes the mirror ritual from superstition to science, costing Elara her last hope of redemption. Causal chain holds—storm → shard placement → stabilized reflection → Varek’s collapse—under an Accumulative/Textural lens that intensifies sorrow to crystalline stasis.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The baroque asteroid’s crumbling corridors, fractured dome, and amber time-rivers are vivid and selective; the shard and mirror together function as micro-setting that constrains the final choice. Spatial choreography is clean; only the frescoes feel briefly ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—prevent renewed civil war via irrefutable truth—tightens when the storm peaks and Varek demands the shard. One decisive turn: Elara’s demonstration forecloses both factions’ dogmas at the price of her own absolution. Cost is visible in her tears and the shard’s cold final image.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: the danger of destroying what we don’t understand. The mirror ritual’s redefinition from prayer to technology reframes the revolution’s tragedy without moralizing. Final image of smooth golden rivers offers quiet, non-literal resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lush yet disciplined, with rhythmic control under pressure (“burnished sorrow,” “jagged, dangerous rapids”). Perceptual signature is Elara’s poetic precision; no head-hopping. Varek’s sneer is distinct but brief; internal coherence never wavers.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language serves pressure, not ornament. No loops or scaffold. Minor register drift in “ideological certainty” phrase, but clarity at closure remains pristine.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: temporal visibility as literal amber rivers, mirror ritual reimagined as lost science. Risky lyric compression pays off; the shard’s refraction feels inevitable in hindsight. No derivative echoes.</comment>
