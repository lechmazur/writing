<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aris’s contradictory duties—public safety vs. sacred preservation—are embodied in trembling hands and the decisive shift to trust Elara’s bypass. Interiority is concrete, rooted in tactile calculation and the weight of legacy. The final choice to activate the hidden channel is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost (renouncing modern protocol). Minor slip: “quiet certainty” edges toward tidy resolution.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—Aris’s stance crystallizes with felt cost: “They would speak for Elara’s silent compassion.” Causal lens holds: each beat (fracture check → chain measurement → vinegar reveal → bypass decision) tightens options. Orientation is anchored early; no teleporting props. One hairline slip: the phrase “dappled resolve” abstracts the moment.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The volcanic amphitheater is not backdrop but active constraint: thermal pulses shift stone, ash conceals the envelope, the spire offers the only safe path. Sensory detail is selective—brass calipers, mineral-scented exhalation—filtered through Aris’s engineering gaze. The surveyor’s chain reappears to verify alignment, charging the final image. No static cataloging; every detail pressures choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prevent reservoir breach without destroying the ruin—is signaled in paragraph one. Escalation tightens once: discovery of Elara’s bypass forces a trade-off between protocol and preservation. Cost is legible: Aris forfeits institutional approval to honor Elara’s hidden design. Pressure remains coherent under causal lens; no coincidence resolves the crisis.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of encrypted compassion emerges organically from Elara’s invisible ink and Aris’s final choice; no moralizing. The phrase “sacrifice her reputation” is summary, but the vinegar reveal and bypass activation dramatize the ethic. Final image—hand on warm stone, heartbeat synced with volcano—offers resonant, non-literal answer. Complexity preserved: no tidy endorsement of either duty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is precise, tactile, engineering-tinged: “water pressure tolerances,” “brass calipers,” “mineral-scented air.” Syntax tightens under stress—short clauses mirror stone’s exhalation. No head-hopping; POV remains locked to Aris. Occasional elevated diction (“audacity of it”) slightly lifts register but stays within plausible machinist-poet range.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence advances stakes or atmosphere. Figurative language is spare and purposeful—“volcanic sighs,” “ancient skin” envelope. No loops or scaffold. One mixed metaphor risk: “light and shadow, like the sunbeams on the fractured stone” edges purple but is saved by immediate grounding in action.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fusion of hydraulic engineering, dormant volcano, and hidden compassion cipher feels inevitable yet fresh. Elara’s vinegar-ink bypass reconfigures a familiar “save the city” plot into a meditation on invisible stewardship. Specificity of tools (chain, calipers, vinegar) anchors the fantastical frame. Risk-taking (secret channel through a volcano’s heart) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
