<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas’s “skillfully observant” trait is dramatized through concrete dust-reading and ceiling-scans that directly enable discovery; the interior contradiction between professional detachment and personal ache is shown, not told. The final act of winding the bird is earned by this established perceptual obsession and carries visible cost (he accepts the sorrow of release). Ghost-interaction stays consistent with his unflinching vocation, avoiding convenient awe. Minor slip: the “weightless burden” refrain edges toward label-speak twice, blunting full embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: dust arc → mainspring → key → letters → bird → release, each because/therefore step tightening Thorn’s tether and Silas’s agency. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—Thorn ascends, Silas’s burden eases, cost felt in the pocketed silent bird. Orientation anchored by word 80; no lens ambiguity. One hairline telegraph: the phrase “ceilings held secrets” slightly over-declares the stake before the scene proves it.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Abandoned ticket office is filtered through Silas’s technician gaze—fluorescent death, dust laminations, shelf smudges—each detail doubles as forensic clue and emotional barometer. The circus detritus (posters, cash drawer, hidden compartment) constrains movement and discovery, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clean: counter climb, shelf reach, drawer pry all track. Micro-setting (mainspring, clockwork bird) fulfills the 9+ gate by physically shaping the release beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“what ceilings hide” vs. ghost’s need for release—tightens when Silas realizes the mainspring is Thorn’s anchor. Mid-story reversal: retrieval of key shifts Silas from observer to actor, foreclosing retreat. Cost is legible: he pockets the now-silent bird, accepting permanent custodianship of sorrow. Pressure plateaus rather than spikes; one more incremental tightening could have pushed higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of hidden fractures (in plaster, time, people) emerges through recurrent ceiling/crack imagery without explicit thesis. The clockwork bird’s flight reweights “hidden” as “liberated,” offering non-literal resonance. Subtext in dust patterns and spectral frustration implies larger human neglect. Final image avoids moralizing, lets silence speak. Slight deduction for overt “weightless burden” tag.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-limited stays locked to Silas’s technician perception; syntax is precise, tactile, slightly clinical—“analyzing dust accumulation patterns”—mirroring his vocation. No head-hopping; ghost’s interior accessed only via Silas’s interpretation. Rhythm modulates: longer sentences for forensic calm, clipped fragments when cold washes over. Distinctive idiom in “seeing ghosts was never frightening, but it carried a quiet sorrow, like holding smoke.”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, high-density; most sentences perform dual duty (action + atmosphere). Figurative language is spare and accurate—“sound like distant applause” freshens without strain. No loops, scaffold, or filter-verb stacks. One micro redundancy: “familiar weightless burden” appears twice; second instance could be cut. Otherwise closure image remains sharp and uncluttered.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fuses elevator-tech gaze with ghost-story tenderness in a setting rarely paired with horology, yielding fresh synthesis. Mainspring-as-anchor and clockwork bird-as-vessel feel inevitable yet non-obvious. Risk taken in quiet release instead of horror sting; coherence maintained. Could push further into circus lore to avoid faint echo of “haunted artifact” template, but specifics (dust arc, fluorescent death) personalize adequately.</comment>
