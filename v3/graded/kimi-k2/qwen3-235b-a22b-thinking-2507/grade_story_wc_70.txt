<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s involuntary truth compulsion is embodied in the throat-tightening beat and the forced confession; her micro-choice to hand the stranger the literal riddle shows a hierarchy of values (wonder over safety) with visible cost. Interiority is specific—tracing dust on glass, the cool lacquer grounding her—but the stranger remains a device, not a crucible, so relationship pressure is absent. The final renunciation (enduring the dark to keep wonder alive) is earned by prior causality and lands with felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara’s stance crystallizes—she accepts the blackout and her compulsion as the price for preserving wonder. Causal linkage holds: blackout → riddle reread → truth spoken → stranger mobilized → Elara’s charged poise. Orientation is anchored by ~90 words; no drift. Cost is legible in the final image of the closed lacquer box in the “vast, waiting dark.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The tower’s copper collectors, the nectar dusk, and the lacquer box all constrain choice: the dead collectors force the blackout, the dusk times the scene, the box delivers the diagnostic. Sensory selection is urgent—wind sighing, ozone smell—filtered through Elara’s professional eye. Spatial choreography is clean; the grounded auto-rickshaw and service entrance track. Environment charges the final image: the city’s silence becomes “charged with possibility.”</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve wonder amid systemic collapse—is signaled early and tightened when Elara chooses to reveal the riddle despite risk. One meaningful escalation: the stranger’s arrival forces the truth compulsion into the open, narrowing Elara’s options from silent observer to active truth-teller. Cost is visible: she loses anonymity and accepts the tower’s vulnerability. Agency drives the turn; coincidence (the stranger) complicates rather than resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: wonder survives not despite but through routine maintenance and attention to overlooked details. The riddle’s transformation from “poetic nonsense” to diagnostic tool reweights the premise without moralizing. Final image—the lacquer box closed, spark inside—offers a non-literal answer: attention itself keeps the light alive. Subtext in Elara’s silence after the compulsion speaks volumes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is distinct: lyrical yet precise, with perceptual signature—“nectar dusk,” “honeyed amber,” “ozone” smell—rooted in Elara’s sensory priorities. Syntax modulates with pressure: longer cadences in reflection, clipped delivery under compulsion. No head-hopping; POV stays locked. Dialogue is spare but natural, carrying subtext (“So... the regulator? Deep core?”).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; each sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. Figurative language is selective and purposeful—“mournful sigh of wind”—without clutter. No loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary. Minor register drift in “diagnostic” feels justified by Elara’s technical role. Final line lands clean, recharging “wonder” and “dark.”</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of bee-hive collapse, involuntary truth-telling, and antique riddle-as-diagnostic feels fresh and inevitable. Tropes (post-apocalyptic blackout, chosen-one artifact) are transformed through Elara’s grounded occupation and the cost of honesty. Specificity—the lacquer box’s crimson gleam, the ozone smell—anchors universals. Risk in the lyric mode pays off: the ending’s quiet reconfiguration is earned.</comment>
