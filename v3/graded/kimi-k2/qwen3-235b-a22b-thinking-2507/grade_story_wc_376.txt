<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is precise—her fear of dishonesty is embodied in wilting, her micro-choice to whisper truth to the map is character-specific, and the final blooming carries earned cost. The trait of wilting under lies constrains every beat; the moment she admits “I’m afraid the Archive is gone” and the fragment clicks is a clean causal hinge. Secondary pressure from Ben is thin but sufficient for the word count.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the banyan opens, voices return, and Elara’s stance crystallizes with felt cost—she does not wilt but blooms. Causal lens holds: each truthful admission tightens the map until the postal plate triggers the Archive. No orientation drift; anchors are clear by 120 words. One meaningful tightening suffices.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The greenhouse’s recycled condensation and cracked aqueducts constrain movement; the zinc plate’s grid is a tactile key. Sensory detail is selective—overripe orchids mirror desperation—yet never stalls momentum. The banyan tree as living archive recharges the setting in the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover lost voices—is signaled early and escalates through each truthful admission that reassembles the map. The tightening beat (“I’m afraid the Archive is gone”) narrows options and carries visible bodily cost. Closure is earned by her candor, not luck.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of candor as restoration emerges through action: lies shred, truth rejoins. The final image of crystalline voices reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext in Ben’s too-smooth question and Elara’s silent refusal deepens the ethical texture.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise—gilded ink, sun-scorched celery—matching a calligrapher’s perceptual signature. Compression is taught early (“perpetual tremor above the toxic sky”) and paid off in the blooming cadence. No head-hopping; distance stays tight to Elara.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; each sentence advances map, body, or stakes. No loops or scaffold. Metaphors (magnetic pollen) are fresh yet coherent. Minor elevated diction (“conceptual repricing”) is absent; register stays within Elara’s plausible lexicon.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of calligrapher, wilting curse, and postal archive feels inevitable and specific. The candor mechanic transforms a familiar quest into intimate stakes. Risk in quiet, lyric closure pays off: the blooming image recharges every prior beat.</comment>
