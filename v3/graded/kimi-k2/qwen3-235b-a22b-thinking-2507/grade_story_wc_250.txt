<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The guardian’s interiority is embodied in her tactile handling of the mirror and shutters; her “spiralingly calm” trait constrains every micro-choice. The child’s shift from despair to wonder is credible because the guardian’s restraint withholds comfort and instead offers proof. Motivation is dramatized, not stated: the final closing of shutters shows the cost of leaving the child in darkness now armed with memory. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in scene, capping the score just below 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the guardian’s Earned Stasis—renouncing further contact—leaves the child changed and the dock holding “the echo of the pattern.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each shutter adjustment increases luminous density until the final cadence shift reweights the stake. Cost is legible in the guardian’s retreat into shadow, a forfeiture of continued guardianship. No orientation debt; spatial anchors are clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The rain-slicked cobalt stone and canal water constrain movement and reflect the light patterns that drive the climax. The dental mirror and shutters function as micro-setting tools whose physical properties (angle, aperture) directly shape the outcome. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered: “damp wood and riverweed” noticed only because the guardian needs to gauge silence. Environment charges the final image when the dock “held its breath,” making the setting indispensable.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—child’s fear of absolute darkness—is signaled in the opening tableau. Escalation is Accumulative: each shutter click tightens the luminous lattice, deepening the child’s engagement and the guardian’s tacit promise. The tightening forecloses the option of verbal comfort; the cost is the guardian’s self-erasure. Agency is exercised through pattern-weaving, not speech, satisfying the lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the concrete act of redirecting starlight: darkness is not erased but adorned. Subtext resides in silence and gesture; the child’s dawning wonder is the only “statement.” The final image of the dock holding “the echo of the pattern” reweights the premise without moralizing. No thematic drift; every detail serves the central question of visibility within despair.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with rhythmic control that mirrors the guardian’s calm: long sentences for stillness, abrupt fragments for shutter clicks. Perceptual signature is consistent—every noticed detail is filtered through the guardian’s tactical awareness. No dialogue; absence is purposeful and coherent. Register never drifts; diction stays within the guardian’s taciturn lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; each sentence layers atmosphere, action, or interiority without redundancy. Figurative language is sparse and exact—“liquid reflection and hushed breath” sets tone without overwriting. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. The final paragraph’s cadence shift—slow shutter closings—creates aural closure matching thematic closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The premise—using a dental mirror and derelict shutters to weave starlight for a silent child—is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Transformation test fails if any element is swapped: the mirror’s medical origin and the shutters’ decay are irreplaceable. Risk-taking (wordless intervention, Accumulative/Textural structure) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specificity of “cobalt dock after rain” anchors universals in lived texture.</comment>
