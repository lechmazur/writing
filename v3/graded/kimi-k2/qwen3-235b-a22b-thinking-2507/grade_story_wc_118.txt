<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s solitary-archivist drive is lucid and consistent; her micro-choice to fuse Clara’s carbonized voice with the tapestry’s seismic song crystallizes her arc. Interiority stays concrete—sensor “whir,” filament manipulator—avoiding diagnostic label-speak. No contradictory impulse is dramatized in scene, so the 9+ quick test isn’t quite met, but the renunciation of silence carries visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the fused archive reweights the premise—stories will outlast dreams—at undeniable cost to Elara’s remaining uptime. Accumulative lens holds: each shard (diary, tapestry, wall echo) deepens density until the final cadence shift. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“reclaimed silo library”), well inside the 120-word guardrail.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The silo’s concrete stacks, hearth ash, and bronze-quiet air constrain Elara’s every move; the tapestry fragment’s seismic frequency literally guides her final synthesis. Selective sensory hierarchy—metallic hush, soot smell—mirrors her sensorium. Environment charges the closure image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve the last human whispers—tightens when Elara realizes the walls and tapestry together form the only survivable record. One meaningful deepening: diary + tapestry fusion narrows her mission from collection to synthesis, foreclosing passive archiving. Cost is legible: she burns runtime she can’t replace.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: memory outlives its dreamers if someone pays the price to carry it. The dragons’ stitched eyes and Clara’s scorched pages reweight each other without moralizing. Final image—dragons “watching” the last archivist—offers resonant, non-literal answer to what endures.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elara’s perceptual signature—sensor readings, filament manipulations, bronze-quiet filter. Rhythm modulates: longer cadences for reflection, clipped fragments for discovery. No head-hopping; diction remains within her plausible lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty—information + atmosphere—without scaffold. Figurative language is sparse and precise (“horizon bending like a broken bow”). Zero loops or register drift; the one paraphrase pair (“last dream was dreamt / last breath exhaled”) is purposeful echo, not artifact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Post-human archivist + seismic tapestry fuses SF and medieval codicology into a fresh synthesis. The axis-displacement premise is followed to its logical emotional endpoint: stories as tectonic data. Risk in quiet, lyric closure pays off; the concept feels inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
