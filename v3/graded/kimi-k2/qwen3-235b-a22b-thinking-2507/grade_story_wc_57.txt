<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s patience is embodied in tactile micro-choices (tracing knots, adjusting fulgurite) and visibly costs him numb hands and time; the final binding of rope to seed tin is a credible renunciation that forecloses inaction. Interiority stays concrete, avoiding label-speak. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, so the 9+ quick test is narrowly missed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elias completes the rope transcription, binding method to memory with the felt cost of irrevocable commitment. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern density and cadence shift reweight the stake. Orientation is anchored by ~120 words; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The golden dock, snow, and fog are not mere backdrop; the cold stiffens rope fibers and numbs fingers, directly constraining the precision required to decode knots. The fulgurite shard and rope itself function as micro-settings that charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preservation of seed resilience—is signaled early and tightened when the decoded spiral offers a concrete path; the cost is the irreversible commitment of tonight’s labor and tomorrow’s planting. One meaningful deepening suffices under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of endurance across time emerges through the rope’s silent testimony and Elias’s patient labor; no explicit moralizing. The final image of rope-bound seed tin reweights prior material with quiet but undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with rhythmic control that mirrors the slow tide and patient attention. Perceptual signature is distinct—Elias notices “syllables in a language of necessity.” No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet clear; every sentence advances atmosphere or action. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful, avoiding purple overload even in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The fusion of knot-encoded agronomy with lightning-born glass feels fresh and inevitable; the secret-weaver lore is transformed through Elias’s tactile practice. Specificity anchors universals, and the risk of quiet lyricism pays off.</comment>
