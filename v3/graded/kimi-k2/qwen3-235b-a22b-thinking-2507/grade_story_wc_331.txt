<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s quiet obsession and embodied ritual anchor her interiority; the scarf’s vibration against her throat crystallizes her shift from seeker to guardian. The cost—solitude maintained while the miracle stays hidden—lands as Earned Stasis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the spiral placement, postcard bleed, and shelf shimmer tighten the pattern until the library breathes; closure reconfigures meaning with felt cost (she forfeits recognition). No orientation drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Scientific Poetry Library is rendered through selective sensory cues—vaulted light, pulsing spines—that constrain Elara’s precise spiral placement; the scarf’s final flutter against her skin recharges the setting as micro-object.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“find the place where stories live”—escalates via tactile warmth climbing her spine; the tightening spiral narrows options to one irreversible act. Cost is the invisible burden of guardianship.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges from analog memories bridging geometry and narrative; the final image of the charged, breathing archive offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. Complexity lingers in the unseen miracle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, modulating from hushed observation to resonant awe; perceptual signature filters every detail through Elara’s curator’s gaze. Compression and elision remain legible under the accumulative design.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose balances density and clarity; figurative language is selective (“dust motes dancing,” “ink bleed into wood grain”) and never muddles causality. Rhythm accelerates with the spiral’s completion, then exhales into stillness.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of library-as-organism and non-Euclidean memory geometry; the reawakening ritual feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risky lyric compression pays off in the final charged poise.</comment>
