<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s longing is embodied in tactile ritual (dusting moonlight, climbing tower) and micro-choice (switching from pigment to light). Contradictory impulses—clinging to absence vs. chasing reunion—play out in her daily vigil and the final decision to leave. Cost is visible: she abandons the only home that still holds her sister’s trace. Interiority is specific, never generic; the “hollow space” is felt, not labeled.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Decisive Change: Elara steps onto the causeway, path foreclosed to the library, cost paid. Causal chain—cipher → dawn → camera → coordinates—holds without gaps. Lens is Causal; each beat narrows options until only departure remains. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sea-Whisper Library, coral-windowed stacks, tide-locked causeway, and watercolor palette all constrain tactics: the causeway’s schedule dictates departure; the palette’s refractive rim is the literal key. Sensory selection (salt-bleached maps, fossilized tears) is urgent and POV-filtered. Final image recharges the palette-as-canvas motif. No white-room drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove sister alive and find her—tightens when dawn reveals coordinates. One meaningful escalation: discovery that light, not pigment, unlocks the cipher forces the irreversible choice to leave. Cost is the forfeiture of safe stasis. Pressure remains coherent under Causal lens; coincidence complicates (solstice alignment) but does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of absence-as-canvas emerges from concrete action; no moralizing. Final image—“luminous absence…a canvas waiting for the right light”—reweights prior loss into possibility without tidy resolution. Subtext in the palette’s “fossilized tears” and the whispering archipelago’s complicity. Resonant ambiguity lingers: reunion promised, not guaranteed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise; perceptual signature in “dusted moonlight from ledger pages” and “fossilized tears.” Syntax modulates with pressure—long cadence for vigil, clipped for discovery. No head-hopping; POV stays locked to Elara. Dialogue absent, so no penalty.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence advances image or tactic. Figurative language disciplined—no mixed metaphors. Minor loop risk in “whisper” repetition but serves atmospheric cohesion. Rhythm accelerates at climax: “She packed a single bag…” No scaffolding or filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: watercolor stains as light-activated cipher reframes grief as technology. Archipelago setting and sunrise photography feel inevitable, not ornamental. Risky lyric compression pays off in final image. No derivative echoes; premise transformed through Elara’s specific obsession.</comment>
