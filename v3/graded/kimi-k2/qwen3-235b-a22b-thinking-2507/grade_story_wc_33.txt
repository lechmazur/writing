<question>1</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Aris’s layered rebel-mailman identity, embodied choices (the tremor as he presents the manifest, the deliberate lightning-vial flick), and the cleanslate/slate paradox keep characterization keen under pressure; minor edge: the “broken promises heal” motive is told more than dramatized until the Elara letter beats.</comment>

<question>2</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Mosaic-causal lens: each beat—twilight drop, checkpoint stall, bottle pulse, drone release—links with “therefore” causality; late lightning-pulse overload is a clean decisive change tightening closure. Only the drone linkage to absences feels slightly less foreshadowed.</comment>

<question>3</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The cobalt arcade breathes: rust-veins pulse like wounds, drone hum jars the hush, bottle glass mists with storm-energy. The micro-setting tightens tactics—sensor overload grounds through damp tile—necessary for the ending escape vector.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—drones as last tenuous emissary of lost promises—escalates from bureaucratic stall to life-risk. Each increment (bottle-trigger, checkpoint reboot, drone launch) is origin-driven; only the cost to Aris is left slightly under-lit.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Themes of mendable promises and erasure gleam through concrete images: lightning bottled, blue tile memory, absence-linking drone. Subtext is dramatized, not stated; final silence shot through with new connection lands as earned reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Compressed lyric voice—long breathless sentences on dusty arch, surgical single-word beats “hiss”—matches escalating tension. Border-drones’ flat synthetic speech provides clean contrast; no POV leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Crisp, rhythmic line craft: “crunch of boots” vs “lead drone whir, recalculating.” No scaffold loops; occasional ornamental density (“fractured cobalt archway… torn like old wounds”) keeps under 20 % of beats without muddling. Clean propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>A drone as courier of love letters across enemy lines feels fresh; linking absences to heal promises is a non-obvious synthesis. High-risk lightning bottle gambit lands as inevitable yet specific, shifting stakes from zero-sum border to connection.</comment>
