<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction is vivid—Kael’s urge to save vs. need to walk through his younger self—but the final “labyrinth is the path now” lands as epiphany rather than embodied cost; no new micro-choice after summit. Ghost selves are atmospheric, not crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: tablet dissolves, time snaps, Kael chooses one branch. Causal chain holds: tablet guides → retracing → renouncing false selves → grounded present. Cost is the irreversible loss of the tablet and the unchosen selves.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Viaduct’s wet obsidian and shifting glow physically constrain footing and reflect splintered selves; final ordinary gray stone reweights the magical frame. Sensory detail is selective, filtered through Kael’s urgency; no orientation drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—conquer self-labyrinth—tightens when each ghost demands either rescue or rejection, narrowing to the final ascent. Escalation is internal but legible: every step forecloses a timeline branch. Tablet’s heat and dissolution mark visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of self-integration emerges from concrete retracing and rejection of false selves; final image of ordinary rain-soaked stone reweights the glowing viaduct without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: fracture remains, but choice is singular.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet anchored: “gravity a suggestion,” “darkening brightness” are taught early and paid off. Syntax modulates with pressure—short clauses at summit. No POV leakage; perception stays strictly Kael’s.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; figurative language serves pattern (“bruised dawn,” “sickly brightness”) without clutter. No loops or scaffold. Final crumbling tablet and rain merge image with closure cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fractured-timeline maze walked via procedural tablet is fresh synthesis; trope of “meeting selves” is transformed into active confrontation and renunciation. Risky lyric compression pays off in resonant final image.</comment>
