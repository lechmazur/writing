<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara’s fear-driven micro-choice—upload before pod—earns the turn; ‘bravely conflicted’ is dramatized via shivering hand on reseal then decisive key-strike. Interior contradiction sharpens every beat from trembling to smile at roar of crowd, cost visible when pod seals her as casualty.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure is Charged Poise: crowd roar crystallizes new stakes and Elara’s smile shows re-opened world. Causal lens holds—upload triggers scandal triggers assembly—no retroactive cheats. Cost is conceptual (fake self-frost) and emotional (silence broken).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Echoing library under snow constrains every movement (sound of crack, drone hum) and charges final image: snow-covered skylight letting dawn through as lies are buried. Details are filtered through Elara’s frost-numbed senses, never touristic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate cleanly from letter to upload to frozen exile; one decisive tightening when letter hits networks. Elara’s agency drives every escalation under causal lens; cost felt in pod-seal and deleted logs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of speaking the unspoken emerges from Elara’s choices and the public response—never stated but embodied in roar of crowd. Final image reframes prior silence without sermon.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Voice is precise lyric; “frost muffled the world” and “cryo-container hissed” carry textured cold throughout. Free-indirect tension tightens in sentences that shorten under pressure. No POV drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</question>
<comment>Rhythm accelerates from lyrical to staccato during upload: “zip” “delete” “hammering ribs.” No repetition loops; every sentence carries temperature, motion, or stake. Final image of roar at dawn lands clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</question>
<comment>Blending cryo- archive with clandestine whistle-blowing is fresh synthesis. Contraband truths thawing literally in ice caps gives the familiar climate thriller new bodily dread. Inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
