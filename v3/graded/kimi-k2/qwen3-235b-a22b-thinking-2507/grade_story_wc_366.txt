<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is embodied and specific—her boots swallowed by the void, the sea glass “silent echo of shipwrecks.” Motivation crystallizes cleanly: bottle childhood safety. The final renunciation—abandoning the lamp for stone messages—carries visible cost, though the causal chain from reticence to this act could be sharper.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (salt-stung darkness, frayed rope, luminescent ache) tightens the stake until the stone-cairn language reconfigures the lighthouse’s purpose. Closure lands as Charged Poise—“a lighthouse of the soul”—with the cost of permanent exile from the lantern room.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The lantern room’s iron grating, dead lamp, and brine-scent are filtered through Elara’s professional eye; the sea glass and stacked stones become micro-settings that constrain her final choice. Environment actively shapes tactics: the extinguished beam forces the shift to stone messages.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—protect the promise of safety—escalates as the lamp dies and the harbor goes blind. One decisive tightening: Elara cannot relight the lamp, so she invents the stone language. Cost is the abandonment of the lighthouse’s traditional role, felt in the “guttering flame” she cradles metaphorically.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: safety is not the beam but the chain of watchers. The sea glass and letters accrue meaning until the final image reweights them—safety now resides in anonymous reciprocity, not stone or glass. No moralizing; resonance is purely imagistic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is salt-raw and reticent, syntax mirroring Elara’s cautious tread: “dust motes hanging where the light should’ve been.” Compression is taught early (“salt-stung darkness”) and paid off in the final cadence. No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet textured: “the wind howled like a thing wounded” does double duty for atmosphere and Elara’s empathy. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances. Occasional elevated diction (“luminescent ache”) is earned by context.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Familiar lighthouse tale transformed through the stone-message language and the inversion that the keeper’s duty survives the lamp’s death. Specificity of anonymous letters and sea-glass chain feels inevitable, not gimmicky. Risky quiet ending lands with conceptual cost.</comment>
