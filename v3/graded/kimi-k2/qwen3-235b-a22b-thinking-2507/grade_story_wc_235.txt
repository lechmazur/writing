<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—"feral nostalgia clawed" and "jaded wonder" embody the split self. The envy of her younger self is dramatized in the dream and on the porch, culminating in the earned, costly embrace of both abysses. Motivation to distill chaos into narrative is consistent and drives every beat. One hairline slip: “diagnostic label-speak” in “chronologically confused dread” without immediate embodied cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the final soaring reweights the grave-knowledge and envy into “jaded wonder.” Causal linkage holds—dream → scroll → porch → flight—each beat narrowing options until the stance crystallizes. Cost is legible in the admission “I miss you” and the glow of the scroll. No orientation debt; lens is Accumulative/Textural, taught early and held.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mountain cabin, lightning-scarred pine, and birch scroll are selective and POV-filtered. The scroll’s glow in the final image constrains the choice to keep writing, charging closure. Sensory hierarchy narrows under stress—damp earth, old smoke, thin air. One minor drift: “snow-capped peaks” could be any range; specificity is adequate but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—make the unbearable knowledge bearable—is signaled early and tightened through each beat: grave → scroll → dream → porch → flight. The meaningful deepening occurs when envy is transformed into fuel, foreclosing denial. Cost is visible in the admission and the scroll’s faint glow. Escalation is coherent under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of reconciling irreconcilable temporal selves emerges from concrete particulars—grave, scroll, dream—never asserted. Final image offers non-literal answer: flight as acceptance of both abysses. Subtext in the whispered “I miss you” carries the weight. No moralizing; complexity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct—compressed, lyrical, yet grounded in ranger-cabin lexicon. Rhythm modulates with pressure: longer sentences for nostalgia, fragments for flight. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens under stress. One minor filter-verb cluster mid-scroll, but it serves the reflective beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; every line advances stakes or atmosphere. Figurative language is purposeful—“feral nostalgia,” “jaded wonder”—and paid off. No loops or scaffold; syntax varies. One mixed metaphor “temporal poison” edges purple but is absorbed by context.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Premise of confronting one’s own grave through lucid-dream chronicle is fresh and fully committed. Transformation of envy into flight feels inevitable in hindsight. Specificity of birch scroll and ranger life grounds the fantastical. Risk in lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
