<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s contradictory impulses—analytical mapping vs. emotional avoidance—are dramatized through embodied micro-choices (kneeling, punching cracks, whispering guilt). The final renunciation of cartographic detachment is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost (loss of the mother-vial). Interiority is concrete, voice-specific, and avoids diagnostic labels. Only minor: the spectral beggar remains off-page, so status dynamics aren’t tested.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias’s whispered confession reweights the premise, turning the fortress from external quest to internal reckoning. Causal chain holds—each crack-punch narrows options until the marble staircase demands personal truth. No teleporting props; the phantom punch’s rule set is taught early and paid off. Orientation is anchored by 120 words; no disorientation remains unpaid.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Starlit mist, brass spectacles, and the glowing vials constrain choices and charge the final image. Micro-setting (ticket booth marble) becomes the literal threshold. Sensory detail is selective, filtered through Elias’s mapper’s bias. Only the derelict railway district feels briefly generic before the marble staircase re-anchors.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—confront buried guilt—signaled early and tightened by each arrow-crack. Agency is exercised at every turn: following cracks, punching stone, choosing to whisper. Cost is visible (dawn dissolves the path, vial seals forever). No coincidence resolves; the marble arrow is earned by prior punches.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: maps as shields against intimacy. Subtext operates in the silence of the mother-vial and the trembling hand before confession. Final image reframes the entire quest without moralizing. Complexity lingers—guilt remains, only relocated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct—precise, slightly archaic, filtered through cartographer’s perceptual signature. No head-hopping; POV distance stable. Rhythm modulates with pressure: longer sentences in reflection, clipped fragments at the staircase. Dialogue is minimal but natural when the beggar’s whisper returns as echo.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, propulsive, free of loops or scaffold. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful (“laundry lines sagged like spiderwebs”). No mixed metaphors. Strong verbs and concrete nouns dominate. Final paragraph achieves crystalline clarity without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: urban-explorer noir meets confessional ghost story. The phantom punch and glowing vials feel inevitable, not gimmicky. Specificity of the mapper’s craft and the mother’s illness avoids generic templates. Risk-taking (no antagonist, interior climax) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
