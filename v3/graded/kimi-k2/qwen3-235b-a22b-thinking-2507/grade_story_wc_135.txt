<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the contradictory pull between archival duty and active “heartening” is dramatized through micro-choices (cleaning the valve, choosing staggered blasts). The final stance crystallizes with visible cost—she forfeits anonymity and assumes the burden of hope. Only a slight over-articulation of motive in “She would hearten” nudges it below 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each trumpet blast layers density until the final cadence reweights the city’s grief. Closure lands as Charged Poise—the last note hangs, reconfiguring silence itself. Causality is tight; no orientation debt. Cost is legible in the fisherman’s wordless gratitude and Elara’s tremor.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The ivory harbor is rendered through selective, POV-filtered detail (salt-crusted boots, tide-scoured net) that constrains movement and supplies the trumpet’s hiding place. Weather and architecture mirror interior states without overt symbolism. The lighthouse shed functions as micro-setting that shapes the final polishing scene. Only a touch of postcard lyricism in “gleamed under retreating storm clouds” keeps it from 9.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—restoring communal heartbeat—signaled early. Escalation proceeds via Elara’s agency: each unscheduled blast tightens the city’s attention and her own exposure. One clear deepening when she shifts from preservation to performance. Cost is felt but could be sharper on the page; hence shy of 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of absence-as-presence emerges organically from the trumpet’s re-voicing; no explicit moralizing. The final image—sound carrying across the harbor—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to how fragments become meaning. Subtext in the fisherman’s silent tea and children’s lip-mimicked notes deepens the resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Distinct perceptual signature: ocean-spray archivist’s salt-stung, tide-tuned noticing. Syntax flexes with pressure—“vision struck: not the trumpet’s triumphant blare, but its final, broken wheeze.” No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens under vision beats. Dialogue minimal but subtext-rich when the fisherman appears.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative language is selective and purposeful—“sound would stitch the silence.” No loops or scaffold. Minor register lift in “conceptualized Elara’s resolve” is the lone hairline slip.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Familiar post-exile return is transformed through the specific occupation of ocean-spray archivist and the reactive-vision gift. The staggered-interval strategy feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Fresh synthesis: memory as salvageable sound. Risk in lyric accumulation pays off in the final charged image.</comment>
