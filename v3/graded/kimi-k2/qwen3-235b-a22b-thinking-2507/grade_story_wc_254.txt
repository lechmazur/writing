<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses (reverence vs. transgression) play out in micro-choices—kneeling, weaving vapor, pressing shadow to quartz. The tremor of certainty anchors her arc with felt cost. No second character on page, so relationship crucible waived.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each paraphrase dissolves a boundary and deepens the pattern until the colonnade’s final translucent sigh reconfigures the city’s stance. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—cobalt atrium now beacon, not sanctum—with visible cost: the glyphs’ erasure and the city’s collective breath shift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Frozen lake, cobalt atrium, and humming quartz colonnade are not backdrop but active constraints: the ice mirrors, the colonnade vibrates, the glyphs pulse. Final image of lake holding both reflection and glow recharges the setting as charged mirror of new world.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—dissolve the sacred boundary—tightens through each paraphrase; the colonnade’s translucent sigh is the decisive intensification that forecloses exile and rewrites law. Cost is legible: glyphs blur, old authority softens, city’s hush turns to wonder.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from action: boundaries as wounds, fear guarding emptiness. No moralizing; final image of open atrium and fluid shadow-bridge offers non-literal answer that reweights premise with conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; perceptual signature filters every detail through Elara’s cloud-shadow lens. Syntax modulates with pressure—short pulses during tremor, longer cadences during weaving—without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is patterned and paid off (shadow-script, tremor, humming). No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Final crystalline chime lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Cloud-shadow poetry as transgressive art feels fresh; the synthesis of vapor-script, quartz resonance, and boundary dissolution is non-obvious yet inevitable. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
