<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kai’s interiority is embodied and specific—his trembling fingers on the lace, the sap tear—yet the final renunciation (“This cut… for the words I didn’t say”) lands with earned cost. The contradiction between pride and longing is dramatized, not summarized. One minor slip: “cerulean regret in his chest” edges toward label-speak, blunting the embodied ache.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the compass’s stillness and the new stitches crystallize Kai’s stance without tidy absolution. Causal chain holds—lace tug → beam → color → understanding → pruning—each step narrowing options. Cost is visible in the weeping sap and the fragile shawl left as offering. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The damp volcanic rock, salt wind, and antique lace function as micro-setting that constrains gesture and filters perception. The cerulean coral ledge is not just backdrop but the literal site of revelation. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions. One missed chance: the islet’s post-rain slickness could have forced a physical hesitation that mirrored moral pause.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—finding the color of unspoken apologies—is signaled early and tightened when the beam reveals the coral hue. The single deepening (lace-guided tug) forces a trade-off: symbolic sight for ongoing penance. Cost is the daily tending of wounds, made explicit in the final pruning. Agency remains Kai’s throughout; coincidence complicates but does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the bonsai/lace parallel: mending is slow, deliberate, never finished. The final image of new stitches in the frayed edge offers a non-literal answer—apology as ongoing craft. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in whether Elara will ever return. Subtext in the compass’s silence and the sap tear carries more weight than any statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is slow, tidal, and specific—“slow as sinking stone,” “salt-laden wind.” Syntax mirrors Kai’s placid rhythm; no head-hopping. Free indirect style stays clean. One register drift: “conceptual repricing” feels academic, but it occurs outside the POV’s direct thought and is brief.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid; every sentence advances image or stakes. No loops or scaffold. Metaphors are precise—“liquid sapphire,” “weeping sap like a tear.” Rhythm modulates with pressure: longer cadences for reflection, clipped cuts for action. One near-miss: “the sea holding its peace for the drowned” flirts with excess but earns its place.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fusion of bonsai craft, ghost-ship relic, and lace cartography feels fresh and inevitable. The color of unspoken apologies as a mutable cerulean is a non-obvious synthesis. Risky lyric compression pays off in the final image. No close echoes of famous scenes; specificity anchors universals.</comment>
