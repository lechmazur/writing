<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete ("hands calloused") and contradictions appear ("stoically sensitive"). The climax’s choice—to embed memory within stone while accepting inevitable loss—arises from the stated desire and embodied cost of surfacing in weighted boots. Still, motivation drifts toward thematic articulation ("archeologist of abandoned dreams"), a faint therapy-label at peak tension that blunts the 8-barrier.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Holding an Accumulative/Textural lens: because/density linkage carries from weighted boots, inkwell retrieval, and cornerstone breach to the charged poise of sealing dreams inside repair mortar. Orientation is clear by line 6. The final image (“sutured present to vanished past”) reweights prior particulars with felt labor; cost is unmistable on the page. Some minor ellipsis in time under water is tolerated under this lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Setting is vividly selective (“salt crusted brass fittings,” “filtered light” underwater) and becomes micro-setting when silt resists each lever of the pry bar. Ten-foot depth is tracked across bodies and tools to constrain every pull of oxygen. Environmental grief is mirrored—not overlaid—in echoing silence. Senses are hierarchized through Elara’s surveyor’s eye; no factual or spatial drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake anchored from line 2: retrieval or surrender of submerged dreams. Tightening comes when the watercolors appear—loss is no longer abstract; the choice shifts from documentation to re-embedding. Escalation under Accumulative lens: density of artifacts rises and forecloses simple cartography. Cost (stone-mortar labor, surfacing in weighted boots) is tactile and legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</question>
<comment>Theme of memory vs. inevitable erasure emerges entirely from action (copying watercolors, sealing cavity) without thematic statement dump. Final image reconfigures absence into living stone—“interlaced absence woven into renewal”—earning ambivalent resonance. No late moralizing; subtext operates in mortar sealing the void left by dances. Wisely avoids sentimentality through tactile detail.</question>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited perceptual signature is distinctive and sustained. Syntax elongates underwater resistance (“resisting like cold silk”) then compresses in pry-bar sequence. Zero head-hop; filter verbs are voice-motivated. Dialogue absence is coherent—only necessary sounds (“stone grated like bones breaking”) intrude. Diction matches Elara’s methodical cadence; no sudden jargon.</question>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</question>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies across sentence length; no looped stems or synonym churn. Density remains high without purple overwrite. Opening line anchors tone (“salt crusted brass fittings”) and final line lands as closure image (“hushed blaze of work complete”). One minor stock phrase—“like bones breaking”—triggers a hairline −0.2, still within excellence.</question>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</question>
<comment>The “underwater ruins + memory archeology” trope set is redeemed by fresh occupational specificity (shore surveyor protocols, historic preservation mortar inserts). Synthesis makes ruin-gazing inevitable rather than gimmick. Small penalty remains: dream-archeology motif drifts toward literary cliché, preventing 8+ originality.</question>
