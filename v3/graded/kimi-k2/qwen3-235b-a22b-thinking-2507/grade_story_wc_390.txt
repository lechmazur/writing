<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aris’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“a physical ache in his molars”), motives escalate under pressure, and the final renunciation—pouring his will into the key—carries visible cost. The single flaw is a touch of diagnostic self-awareness (“logically emotional response”) that edges toward label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: every beat is a because/therefore chain from faltering harmonics → key insertion → vibrational matching → earned stillness. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost—Aris slumped, coat stained, Tower’s song now his burden.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina is not backdrop but antagonist: groaning floes dictate tempo, dictate tactics, and finally fall silent under the new harmonic. The obsidian key and Tower stones act as micro-settings that constrain every adjustment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—protect the sonic lattice—is signaled in paragraph one and tightened by the vanishing sunset clock. One decisive turn: Aris’s micro-adjustment of the key forecloses retreat and locks the ice into stillness at visible physical cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of adaptation-as-absolution emerges through concrete action, not statement; the final “peaceful song” reweights the opening dread without moralizing. A hairline slip: “sonic absolution” edges toward thematic label in closing clause.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, tactile, and pressure-responsive: syntax tightens (“ice shards raining”) under stress, breathes during the harmonic resolution. No POV leakage; every perception is filtered through Aris’s engineer-ear.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is selective and purposeful (“jagged teeth gnawing”). One minor loop—“the Tower shuddered violently… violent shudder” in adjacent clauses—keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The ice-bound lighthouse tuned by a human voice is a fresh synthesis; the crypt keeper’s key repurposed as tuning rod transforms familiar tropes. Risky sonic metaphysics are fully committed to and paid off in the final resonance.</comment>
