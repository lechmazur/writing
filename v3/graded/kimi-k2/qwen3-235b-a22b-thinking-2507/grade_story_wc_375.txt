<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—perfect recall vs. blank page—drives every beat; the moment she kneels to repair the lock her micro-choice crystallizes the hierarchy of values (art over fear). Embodied emotion (“tears traced clean paths”) and charcoal-stained fingers ground her arc. The final sketch is earned because the lock-fix literalizes the internal repair; cost is the terror on the revealed self-portrait.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the cave’s hum modulates to gentle pulse as Elara’s stance shifts from paralysis to release. Causal linkage holds—because she mends the lock she uncovers the buried self-portrait; therefore she can draw again. The cost is the exposed terror on the charcoal sketch. Orientation is anchored within 120 words; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The cave’s bioluminescent quartz and metallic case are not backdrop; they constrain movement and supply the literal tools (crystal sliver) for the decisive repair. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—“auroral sorrow” mirrors internal ache. Final image dims to “gentle pulse,” recharging the opening sorrow with earned quiet joy.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will she draw again?—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening: the lock’s repair forces confrontation with the suppressed self-portrait. Cost is the terror on that sketch; escalation is internal but legible under Accumulative/Textural lens as density of memory and light intensify.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of creation-through-fracture emerges from the lock, the torn canvas, the broken artist. No moralizing; the final image of the cave’s dimmed pulse offers non-literal resonance. Subtext in the grandfather’s riddle (“nine for the lives a portrait touches”) quietly reweights the premise without exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct lyric texture—“charcoal-fingered,” “auroral sorrow”—remains consistent; no head-hopping. Compression (“the laughter fading above wasn’t an ending”) teaches the pattern early and pays off in the final line. POV modesty maintained; Elara never knows more than the reader.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet clear; each sentence advances image or stakes. No loops or scaffold. Metaphors (“cave breathed cold silence”) are precise and internally coherent. Rhythm modulates with pressure—short clauses under stress, longer cadences in reflection.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Familiar “blocked artist” trope is transformed through mnemonic curse and living cave. The broken lock as test rather than barrier feels fresh. Specificity of 7-2-9 code and charcoal under fingernails anchors universals. Risk in lyric mode pays off without obscuring causality.</comment>
