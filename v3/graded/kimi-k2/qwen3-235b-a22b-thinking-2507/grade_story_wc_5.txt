<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—scarred hands, frost-numbed breath, the tactile dread of flash-paper—yet her contradictory impulses (yearning vs. renunciation) stay mostly summary until the final sealing. The cost of mapping Lina’s heartbeat is felt in the wax of “frozen tears,” but the micro-choice that exposes this cost arrives late, capping the score just below 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern-building in the orchard, eclipse hush, and the etched flash-paper spiral tighten toward the Resonant Reconfiguration of the sealed vial. Closure lands with visible cost—“wax of frozen tears”—and the lens never wavers. A hairline slip: orientation is complete by ~130 words, just past the 120-word gate.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The withered orchard, subarctic crater, and eclipse silence are not backdrop but instruments: the frozen earth’s slow pulse becomes the grid onto which Lina’s heartbeat is mapped. The storybook plate’s summer orchard is the counter-image that charges the final vial. No environmental detail is wasted; each constrains or enables the alchemy.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve Lina’s heartbeat against extinction—is signaled early and escalates through the eclipse’s “moving stillness.” The final sealing is a decisive narrowing of options: once the vial is sealed, the map is fixed and the chance to alter it is gone. Cost is legible but slightly abstract; a more visceral forfeiture would push higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory as fragile cartography emerges through concrete acts—spirals of trash, etched flash-paper, sealed starlight—never stated. The final image reweights the entire orchard: a “tiny, safekept sun” in a dead world. Subtext operates in silence, breath, and the negative space of the pattern.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is granular, tactile, and weather-bitten: “gnarled hands,” “moth-wing” paper, “cold as the void between stars.” Syntax slows to glacial patience, then tightens in the sealing beat. No dialogue, yet the narrative idiom is unmistakably Elara’s. One minor filter-verb cluster (“she felt”) keeps it from 9+.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet aerated: each noun carries sensory load, each verb advances action or atmosphere. Metaphors are precise—“sun a black coin rimmed with fire”—and never overstay. A single mixed metaphor (“liquid obsidian, cold as the void”) is forgivable. No loops or scaffold; rhythm modulates with eclipse tension.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Flash-paper alchemy to trap starlight-echoes of a dead child’s heartbeat in a subarctic orchard during eclipse is a synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk—using literal trash as mnemonic circuitry—pays off without gimmickry. Familiar tropes (lost child, eclipse magic) are transmuted through Elara’s specific grief and craft.</comment>
