<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aris’s contradictory impulses—yearning to quantify emotion yet recoiling from the flood of borrowed grief—are embodied in the moment they drop the fragment and choose to “carry” rather than solve. The final micro-choice (setting the harvest notice in their own breath) is earned and carries visible cost: relinquishing the shield of mathematics. Interiority is specific and sensorily grounded; no stock therapy-speak intrudes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Aris’s stance flips from analysis to bearing witness, crystallized in the gas-lamp image. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each absorption of emotion intensifies pattern until the mathematics dissolve. Cost is legible in the line “the work remained” after the stars vanish. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The topaz workshop’s ozone-and-sugar air and the drawer of fractured ampersands constrain action—Aris must hide the fragment among the ‘e’s and later return it there. Micro-setting (the lead type slug, the lantern) is handled with tactile specificity and reappears to charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; no white-room syndrome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—how to live with borrowed emotions—tightens when the fragment threatens to infect the press; Aris’s renunciation forecloses the analytical path. One meaningful deepening occurs when collective empathy collapses the equation. Cost is felt in the line “their own breath,” marking a forfeiture of detachment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: empathy is not solvable but must be borne. The halo fragment’s shift from tool to reminder reweights the premise without moralizing. Final image of the gas lamp in starless dark offers non-literal resonance—knowledge reconfigured, not explained. No thematic echo in the closing lines.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct—compressed, synesthetic, slightly arcane—mirroring a typesetter’s mind. Rhythm modulates with pressure: longer clauses collapse into staccato gasps during the fragment’s assault. No POV leakage; sensory bias remains Aris’s throughout. Experimental elision (“lucid turbulence”) is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers action, sensation, and concept. No loops or scaffold; “indigo ink and the residue of other people’s voices” does triple duty. Metaphors (starlight captured in lead) remain coherent and grounded. Final paragraph breathes appropriately after the fragment’s assault.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: letterpress shop as crucible for empathy transfer, star-death as emotional vacuum. The fragment’s inversion of grief into nervous-system data feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring closure. No derivative echoes.</comment>
