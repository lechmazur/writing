<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael’s quiet drive is embodied in tactile mapping and the whistle test; the final resolve to walk the revealed path is earned by years of pattern study and the immediate crack. Interiority stays concrete—no therapy-speak—and the reed whistle as inherited burden complicates his choice. The only minor drag is a brief “ghost of the lost expedition” summary that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a decisive change: the crack reveals the hidden map and Kael chooses to follow it, cost crystallized in “sunwashed dread intensifying.” Causal lens holds: because he sounds the whistle at the precise fracture geometry, therefore the path appears and his options narrow to one—walk toward the watchers. No orientation debt; anchors are clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The turtle-shell city is not backdrop; its scutes, fractures, and acoustic properties directly enable the climax. Sensory selection is urgent—sun-bleached glare, chalk dust vibrating—mirroring Kael’s narrowed focus. The environment literally cracks open to constrain his next move, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understand the watchers—is signaled early and tightened when the map arrowing toward them becomes visible. One meaningful escalation: the whistle’s note moves from hypothesis to key, forcing the irreversible crack. Cost is felt immediately in the dread that “pressed down like the weight of the turtle shells overhead.”</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Theme of silent language emerges organically from shell patterns and whistle resonance; no explicit statement. The final image—Kael resolved to confront the watchers—reweights the city from archive to active conduit. Ambiguity lingers without confusion: are the watchers invitation or trap?</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is precise, tactile, and idiosyncratic—“stylus biting into chalk-dust,” “carapace fragment.” Syntax tightens under pressure: short clauses mirror the crack’s sharp release. No POV drift; perception stays filtered through the cartographer’s trained eye.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is lean yet textured; every sentence advances map, atmosphere, or tension. No loops or scaffold. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful—“sunwashed dread” earns its keep. Rhythm accelerates into the crack, then settles into the final resolve.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The turtle-shell city, cartographer of fractures, and whistle-key synthesis feel inevitable yet wholly fresh. Risky compression—pattern language as grammar—pays off without gimmickry. The premise could not survive transplantation; specificity is the engine.</comment>
