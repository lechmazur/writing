<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is embodied and specific—trembling hands, saltwater memory, the lullaby breathed into silence. The contradiction between mending others while remaining broken is dramatized in the moment she must ground her own brother’s echo. Micro-choices (needle slip, thumb prick, whispered lullaby) reveal hierarchy of values with visible cost. Only the “broken mask restorer” label feels slightly external; the rest is lived.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each loosened knot thickens the hush and reweights the sanctuary’s quiet. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Earned Stasis—where Elara accepts the unending work, her own fracture now part of the balm. Cost is legible in the final image: steady scarred hands against accumulating quiet. Orientation is immediate; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prism sanctuary, starlight, and crystalline walls are not backdrop; they refract moonlight into trembling rainbows that mirror the fracturing/ mending theme. The centuries-old net functions as micro-setting, its knots constraining every motion of needle and breath. Sensory selection narrows to tactile cold, salt taste, and spectral shimmer under pressure. Final image of dust motes in “interlaced hush” recharges the setting as living balm.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—grounding restless spirits—tightens with each knot: first a stranger, then her brother’s echo. Agency is renunciation/endurance: she keeps unravelling despite personal cost. The storm memory surges as burning silence, forcing a micro-turn where she must share the lullaby. Cost is felt in the ache that lingers after her brother settles.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from action: silence as accumulated weight, release through acknowledged truth. The lullaby breathed into the hush reframes despair into gentle remembrance without moralizing. Final image of sanctuary’s “richer” quiet offers non-literal answer—healing is ongoing, shared, never complete. Subtext in spectral eyes, whalebone button, and scarred hands avoids abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise: “interlaced hush,” “solidified shadow,” “prism’s tear.” Syntax mirrors Elara’s careful needlework—long sentences for contemplation, fragments under panic. Perceptual signature filters every image through her restorer’s gaze. No POV leakage; even the brother’s recognition is conveyed via her breath-borne vibration.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; each sentence layers image, emotion, and world-rule. Metaphors (“silence like holding solidified shadow”) are exact and never mixed. No loops or scaffold; “accumulated silence” recurs with shifting temperature and weight. Rhythm accelerates during the brother’s emergence, then exhales into the final cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: mask-restoration skill repurposed to mend net-bound spirits; silence treated as tangible material. The whalebone button and lullaby ground the fantastical in intimate detail. Risky lyric compression pays off—the final image reweights all prior motifs. No derivative echoes; the premise feels inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
