<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses—yearning for escape yet clinging to sanctuary—surface in micro-choices (adjusting the wick, deciphering the microdot). The final shift from passive keeper to active orchestrator is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost (exhaustion, new identity). Old Man Chen remains off-page, so relationship crucible is N/A.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara’s stance crystallizes from isolation to orchestration with felt cost (“slumped against the cold glass”). Causal lens holds: microdot specs → beam adjustment → freighter saved. No orientation drift; anchors set by line 3. One meaningful tightening when the sea “sings backwards” triggers the decisive act.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lighthouse, storm, and Devil’s Teeth are rendered with selective sensory detail that constrains choice (narrow beam path, slick stairs). The beam itself becomes micro-setting/tool that charges the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent; weather directly affects tactics. No generic placeholders.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Elara’s identity shift—signaled early. Escalation is causal: storm intensifies → freighter threat → beam override. One decisive tightening when the “sea sings backwards” forces the microdot solution. Cost is visible exhaustion and irrevocable role change. Coincidence (storm timing) complicates, does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of “open secrets” emerges organically: the microdot’s hidden-in-plain-sight knowledge becomes salvation. Final image of dawn “bleeding grey” reweights earlier isolation into purposeful orchestration without moralizing. Subtext in Chen’s fortunes and the beam’s shadow walk invites reflection on visibility vs. understanding.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</question>
<comment>Voice is distinct, salt-crusted, and technically precise (“focal lengths, aperture settings”). Perceptual signature filters every detail through keeper’s priorities. No head-hopping; POV remains tight. Compression during storm (“Fingers flying…”) matches tempo. Dialogue minimal but natural when present.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</question>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and propulsive. No loops or scaffold. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful (“sea sings backwards”). Technical terms are accurate and character-bound. Final paragraph’s cadence shift mirrors emotional release. No artifacts in closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: spy-tech microdot repurposed as nautical rescue manual, fortune-cookie wisdom as tactical code. Lighthouse beam transformed into dynamic warning signal. Specificity of keeper’s expertise grounds the fantastical twist. Risky structure pays off; no derivative echoes.</comment>
