<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s contradictory impulses—flight vs. stewardship—are embodied in the satchel and the charcoal, culminating in the spiral that reclaims the train. The interiority is specific, never diagnostic, and the final renunciation carries visible cost. Minor slip: “polished calm” is repeated rather than deepened under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the spiral reweights the entire inherited trajectory, cost legible in the deliberate walk toward town. Causal lens holds—each beat (tracing lion, opening satchel, drawing symbols) tightens options until the final stance crystallizes. No orientation debt; transitions are clean.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The circus train’s rust and scavenger marks constrain Elias’s choice of medium (charcoal on metal) and charge the final spiral. Sensory detail is selective—cold sweat rust, bruised purple dusk—filtered through his territorial eye. Micro-setting (the engineer’s door) becomes the charged canvas.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—break the circling path of violation—is signaled early and tightened when Elias chooses to mark, not loot. The act of dissuading scavengers narrows his future to stewardship, with the cost of abandoning flight. Pressure escalates under causal lens; no coincidence resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the territorial grammar of circles and borders; the final spiral offers a non-literal answer to why paths return. No moralizing—just the reweighted train as waypoint. Subtext lives in the shift from stolen currency to respectful symbols.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elias’s perceptual filter; diction (“lawless frontier,” “quiet syntax”) matches his hybrid tech-bandit lexicon. Rhythm modulates with pressure—long reflective sentences contract into the spare final walk. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and motive. No loops or scaffold; metaphors (rust as cold sweat) are precise. The final spiral gleaming in moonlight lands clean, no overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of startup failure and inherited highway robbery feels inevitable; the territorial-marking resolution is fresh, not gimmick. Specificity of foreign bills and charcoal nub anchors universals. Risk in quiet ending pays off.</comment>
