<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s single-minded drive to find Leo is vivid and embodied; her micro-choice to lie to Vance crystallizes stakes. Interiority stays concrete, but the final beat (“Now you know”) lands as statement rather than earned cost, blunting the arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the archive’s hunger exposed, Leo’s fate revealed, Elara’s stance crystallized. Causal linkage holds—numbers → fragments → truth—yet the cost feels more conceptual than visceral on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The sterile glow of the archive and the frayed mission patch anchor the micro-setting; both constrain choices and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; sensory selection reflects Elara’s tunnel-vision urgency.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—rescue Leo’s consciousness—tightens as each fragment reassembles. Agency is Elara’s script launch; the price is Vance’s exposure and the archive’s notice. One clear escalation beat suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges: memory as consumable commodity, absence as presence. The patch and numbers reweight from personal grief to systemic horror. Subtext in Vance’s fear lands cleanly; final line avoids moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elara’s perceptual signature—data anomalies, cold ache. No head-hopping; diction is controlled, rhythmic. Vance’s single line carries subtext without voice slippage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, high-density; no loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated diction (“sensed absence,” “digital echo”) skirts purple but remains voice-consistent. Final image is clear, propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The “deleted files live on as consumed fragments” conceit feels fresh; tropes of missing-person and evil archive are transformed through Elara’s specific grief and the numeric trail. Risk is coherent, not gimmick.</comment>
