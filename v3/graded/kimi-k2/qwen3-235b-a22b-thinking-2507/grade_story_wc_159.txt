<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—methodical caretaking versus the ache of foxglove regret—play out in embodied micro-choices (humming, pressing ear to floor). Her final renunciation of immediate repair in favor of tending the next fracture shows earned stasis with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the cracked bamboo tube, now cradled in her apron, reconfigures the stakes—broken vessels hold songs better. Causality under Accumulative/Textural lens holds; each orchid saved intensifies the pattern of inevitable loss.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The opal shelves and crystalline corridors constrain every movement; the cracked chime’s jagged geometry literally channels sound. Setting charges the final image when the library “breathes” around her, a living archive whose glow reweights the premise.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve “Amaris,” the last unconditional love—tightens through escalating decay. Each saved name costs stamina and time; the final exhaustion forecloses immediate rest, making the cost visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory as living fracture emerges through the cracked bamboo’s paradox: damage amplifies resonance. No moralizing; the ending image of foxglove regret settling in her bones offers non-literal, weighted reflection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with rhythmic control under pressure (“liquid gold,” “cloud-drift”). Perceptual signature is consistent: Elara notices through touch and sound, never tourist-catalog visuals. No head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. No loops or scaffold. Figurative language is selective—opal shelves “glowed like captured sunsets”—and pays off in the final supernova image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Premise of extinct feelings archived in glass orchids feels fresh, synthesized through tactile caretaking rather than abstract concept. The cracked chime as amplifier is a non-obvious turn that feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
