<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Silas’s interiority is embodied—limestone on skin, grit in breath—and his contradictory pull between solitary stone-craft and communal memory is staged through each ribbon he ties. Corvin’s spectral presence presses him toward shared ritual; the interplay of regret and resolve is specific, never summary. The micro-choice to turn stone-carved loss into a living butterfly vessel pays off the established flaw: he “carves only individual sorrow,” yet ends with collective grief in motion. Final cost is visible in the mingling of tears and limestone.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, each ribbon-and-butterfly beat stacks memory density until the vaulted rafters become a vessel. Causality is elliptical: the spectral nudge “look up” triggers spatial reconfiguration rather than external plot turns. Final Resonant Reconfiguration is the mosaic of monarchs cupping the vanished table—cost felt in Silas’s first tears since burial. Closure is earned; no orientation drift; greenhouse anchors remain stable.</comment>

<comment>Greenhouse frame, ivy weight, skeletal canes, and migrating monarchs are tactile and constraining; Silas threads ribbons only where plant scaffolding permits, so setting guides choreographed movement. Micro-detail—fig tree fracture, shattered propagating case—accumulates to charge the final collective image. Butterflies as living rafters function as micro-setting-cum-vessel that reconfigures space itself. No exotic physics; greenhouse rules hold.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake: to discover a shareable form for unspeakable loss. Escalation is pattern-deepening: every ribbon tied narrows solitude and widens communal shape until the monarch vessel forecloses private memorializing. External complication (migration timing) intensifies pressure rather than supplies miraculous rescue. Visible price: final tears plus renunciation of stone permanence in favor of fragile wings.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Theme—grief as communal architecture rather than solitary inscription—emerges through ribbon ritual, living mosaic, and ghost mentor’s marble-cool counsel, not didactic statement. Each poem returns reweighted (private text becomes scaffold for airborne ritual). The ending denies tidy consolation: the vessel is beautiful because it must remain temporary. No final-paragraph moralizing; resonance carried by image alone.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose has lapidary precision: limestone grit, polished river-stone coolness, chisel-mark whispers—concrete diction never drifts from grave-stone lexicon. Rhythms swell and contract with respirations—meditative, then thundering calm—mimicking breath of butterflies overhead. No head-hopping; Corvin’s voice slips inside Silas’s perception as weathered marble murmuring. Filter verbs spare; each verb carves image: “unspooled,” “swirling,” “cupping.”</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or boilerplate; every sentence does two jobs (image + motion). Figurative diction (wings like stained-glass, grief as vaulted cathedral) is disciplined, no mixed vehicles. Momentum rises through clipped syntax during tying action, then opens into long, liturgical sentence for final vessel. No register drift; diction remains artisan-gravecarver grounded. Punctuation clean; pronoun “he/Elara/Corvin” always legible.</comment>

<grade>9.3</question>
<comment>Butterfly migration reimagined as collaborative memorial architecture rather than symbol of mere transience. Mentor-ghost instructing by absence instead of answers feels earned inversion of wisdom trope. Family poem-exchange transmuted into airborne choreography collapses private ritual into ecological collective—a fresh synthesis absent cliché. Specificity of limestone grit and indigo dye prevents abstract sentimental drift. High risk sustains payoff.</comment>
