<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Aris’s interiority is embodied and consistent, but the “accidental prophecy” trait is asserted rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses; the final renunciation of empire is felt yet leans summary, not micro-choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the volcano’s hush and the child’s healing reconfigure stakes with felt cost. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern holds, though causality between firefly release and mountain stilling is lyrical rather than rigorous.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Black sand, glowing tide pools, and bottled light are vivid and selective; the beach’s mineral water and phosphorescence directly enable the mission and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—child’s fever vs. night risk—tightens once when Aris kneels to gather shards and feels the tremor ease. Cost is the risked journey and the broken bottle; escalation is modest but coherent under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of transformation-through-small-acts emerges organically from firefly light and volcanic hush; final image reweights prior motifs without moralizing. Subtext is quiet but present in the fisherman's smile and toddler’s calm.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet anchored in Aris’s destitute perspective; sensory diction (“gritty sand,” “electric buzz”) is character-bound. No POV drift; rhythm modulates with scene pressure. Occasional elevated phrasing is pattern-taught early.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; occasional stacked metaphors (“silk brushing stone,” “humming heart”) risk overwriting but serve the accumulative texture. No loops or filter-verb stacks; grammar clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of destitute philanthropist, bottled lightning, and volcanic prophecy; familiar tropes are re-weighted through tactile detail and cosmic timing. Risky lyric structure pays off in closure image.</comment>
