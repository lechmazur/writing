<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s insomnia, painterly vocation, and survivor guilt braid into every micro-choice; the trembling fingers, oilskin coat, and final refusal to paint war wounds all embody her contradictory need to both remember and forget. The brooch triggers a credible shift from isolation to tentative re-engagement, and the cost—loss of her former artistic mission—is felt in the last beat. Interiority stays concrete, never lapsing into label-speak. Only the brief historian scene dilutes direct pressure, keeping her just shy of 9+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elara renounces painting the wars and sketches rain trails instead, a visible pivot with felt cost. Causal chain holds—rain exposes brooch → brooch forces confrontation → map offers new purpose—under a Causal lens. Orientation is swift; no teleporting props. The blueprint hand-off is a mild convenience, but the final image reconfigures meaning cleanly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The tidal island’s weather, causeway, and dune collapse actively shape Elara’s path; the rain literally carves the trail she follows. Sensory detail is selective—salt-crusted windows, turpentine reek, warm amber—filtered through her sleepless bias. The brooch and map function as micro-settings that constrain her final choice. Environment and object together charge the closing sketch.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether Elara will keep drowning in past trauma or find a new form of witness—tightens when the brooch forces her to confront Kael’s legacy. One clear escalation: discovery of the map redefines her artistic labor from memorial to reconstruction. Cost is visible in the final refusal to paint war wounds. Pressure stays coherent under Causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of “salvaged hope amid ruin” emerges organically from rain, amber, and map; no moralizing. The fossilized fly and unearthed aquifer quietly reweight the premise: life and water can still be found beneath devastation. Final sketch embodies this without statement. Subtext in Havel’s refusal of payment and Elara’s wry smile deepens complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is painterly, insomniac, salt-stained: “turpentine and stale coffee,” “haggard awe.” Syntax mirrors her frayed rhythm—long, breathless clauses under rain, then quiet cadence at rest. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent. Dialogue with Havel is spare, subtextual, and distinct from Elara’s interior stream.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every image does double duty (“salt-crusted windows” = setting + body). No loops or scaffold; figurative language is precise. Occasional elevated diction (“crystallized in amber”) fits her artistic lexicon. Final paragraph slows rhythm to match the tide of sleep—earned deceleration.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Post-climate-war setting and amber relic feel fresh, not generic dystopia. The convergence of enemy brooch and victim’s map reframes familiar trauma narrative. Specificity—fossilized fly, hydrologist Kael—anchors universals. Risk in quiet, non-violent closure pays off; transformation test passes.</comment>
