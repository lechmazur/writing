<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas’s guilt is embodied in tactile ritual and micro-choice (kneeling, sifting, fist closing on the watch hand). The contradictory impulse—seeking truth he once buried—drives every beat, culminating in Earned Stasis: he renounces further fabrication, the cost etched in his bleeding palm. Interiority stays concrete; no therapy-speak. Only the absence of a second on-page character prevents higher-band crucible dynamics.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each beat links because/therefore from manufactured lie → haunting → driftwood search → watch-hand discovery → irreversible renunciation. Closure is a Decisive Change: Silas turns from the sea, path foreclosed. Cost is visible—“the sharp edge biting into his skin.” Orientation is anchored by line 3; no drift. One minor ellipsis (how he knew which shore) is motivated by lyric compression and does not break linkage.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The cobalt terrace, dusk light, and salt-stained driftwood are filtered through Silas’s regret, narrowing perception to textures that accuse him. The watch hand functions as micro-setting that constrains the final choice—its bite literalizes cost. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful; no cataloguing. Environment does not merely mirror mood but supplies the mechanism (driftwood messages) that enables the climax.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—uncovering Elara’s fate—tightens when the watch hand proves his complicity in her death. Escalation is causal: each sifted fragment raises the chance of confronting guilt; the discovery forces renunciation. Cost is palpable in the bleeding fist and the irrevocable turn from the sea. No coincidence resolves; pressure is coherent under the causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the particulars of erasure and accountability; no explicit moralizing. The watch hand reweights the premise, making the social cost of false memory undeniable. Final image—man carrying “the sieved hush within him”—offers resonant, non-literal answer to the cost of withheld truth. Subtext operates in gesture and object rather than statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct, tactile, and regret-soaked; syntax lengthens under reflection then tightens at the discovery. No dialogue, so evaluation is on narrative texture: perceptual signature is consistent, diction stays within Silas’s plausible lexicon. Compression (“sieved hush” as recurring motif) is taught early and paid off in the final line. No POV leakage or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet clear; every sentence advances image or stakes. Rhythm modulates with emotional pressure. One minor loop—“sieved hush” repeated within four lines—does not stall momentum. No mixed metaphors or purple patches. Strong verbs and concrete nouns dominate; no scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Premise—black-market memory forgery—feels fresh and is grounded in specific occupational detail. The driftwood-message mechanism is inventive yet plausible. Transformation test: story would collapse without Silas’s exact guilt and the watch hand’s history. Risk in lyric compression pays off; no derivative echoes detected.</comment>
