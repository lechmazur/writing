<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—ghostwriter of intimacy yet emotionally sealed—is embodied in tactile micro-choices (tracing damp wood, anchoring the first silk strand). The shift from vessel to participant is earned through visible cost: she relinquishes anonymity and curated distance. One slip: “hollowness fill” abstracts the transformation rather than dramatizing it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the woven arch becomes Charged Poise where shared secrets replace her solitary ones. Causality holds: each passerby’s contribution tightens the tapestry and forecloses her ghost-role. Cost is legible—“I want to belong” now exposed on blue silk.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lotus temple, rain-washed stone, and lily pond are filtered through Elara’s need for stillness; the archway’s forgotten surface becomes the literal loom. The thrush’s nest micro-setting constrains her pattern choice. One missed beat: weather’s effect on materials (silk in rain) isn’t exploited.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—replace borrowed intimacy with authentic connection—tightens as each anonymous strand narrows her retreat. The single deepening beat (child’s dandelion, couple’s rope) escalates communal claim over her private craft. Cost is visible: her own secret is now public filament.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the tension between curated and lived connection; the woven arch reweights the premise without moralizing. Final image of “thousand tiny voices” offers non-literal answer to the central question. Avoids tidy moral by leaving the thrush’s approval ambiguous.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays close to Elara’s perceptual bias—selective attention to textures, light, and hush. Syntax mirrors her careful, tactile rhythm; no head-hop. One register drift: “inevitable whimsy” edges toward authorial label rather than her idiom.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is vivid yet efficient; raindrops “catching fractured light” and “secret architecture” carry double duty. No loops or scaffold. Minor density spike: “prismatic quiet” and “prismatic hues” in close proximity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Fresh angle: love-letter ghostwriter seeks authentic connection via communal weaving. Transforms familiar “found family” trope into tactile art ritual. Risk is moderate but coherent; no gimmickry.</comment>
