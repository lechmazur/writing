<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is embodied and contradictory—her silent polishing of the bowl is a micro-choice that reweights her stance toward Chen and her own loss. Chen’s grief is legible through the worn birthing-clamp screw and his deliberate avoidance, but the final nod feels slightly under-motivated; more tactile hesitation would sharpen the cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara’s silent act crystallizes a shared recognition that “the scentless world wasn’t empty.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each drip and polished surface layers pressure until the fog lifts and the shop exhales. Cost is felt in the mutual relinquishing of spoken grief.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The brass rim, fogged glass, and birthing-clamp screw anchor the scene; the clepsydra’s slow drip constrains the emotional tempo. Micro-setting (the bowl, the screw) charges the final image when Elara places the polished brass beside the relic, reweighting both objects.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Elara’s need to “unveil ordinary miracles” without scent—tightens through her shift from passive observation to active polishing. The tightening is quiet but decisive: her choice forecloses retreat into solitude and risks vulnerability with Chen. Cost is the exposure of her own occluded grief.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through tactile absence: scentlessness becomes a medium for shared silence rather than loss. The final image of fog lifting while the clepsydra drips offers a non-literal answer—miracles reside in mutual recognition, not sensory recovery. Subtext in Chen’s avoidance of the screw and Elara’s polishing of the bowl is precise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet grounded in sensory specificity: “damp wool and aged brass,” “knuckles whiten.” Free-indirect style stays close to Elara’s perceptual signature; Chen’s single line carries subtext. Rhythm modulates with pressure—long sentences in reflection, clipped fragments under the lamp.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers texture without redundancy. No loops or scaffold; figurative language (“cathedral of time”) is sparing and earned. Minor elevated diction (“occluded views”) fits Elara’s former profession and does not intrude at peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The fusion of aromatherapist-turned-anosmic seeker and midwife-turned-horologist feels fresh; the birthing-clamp screw repurposed as paperweight is a specific, non-obvious synthesis. Risk is taken in the scentless conceit, and it pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
