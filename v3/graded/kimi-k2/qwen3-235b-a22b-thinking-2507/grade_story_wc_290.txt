<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s claustrophobia and prudence/adventure tension are embodied in micro-choices (testing silt with the compass, fighting the urge to flee). The final “hollow victory” stance crystallizes her cost, though the interiority occasionally drifts toward summary (“she felt the weight of all she’d sacrificed”).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: she secures the key yet forecloses personal rest. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each beat thickens dread until the organ’s chord suspends the mutiny. One causality wobble: the organ’s subterranean reach is asserted rather than taught early.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stone corridors that “breathe” and starlight through fissures anchor place while mirroring Elara’s panic. The compass as micro-setting constrains tactics; the final image of the broken spiel against the moon recharges the nexus’s longing. Spatial choreography stays coherent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—retrieve the Chronos Key to save villages—is signaled early. Pressure tightens when the compass locks onto harmonic resonance, forcing the choice to risk collapse. Cost is visible: the nexus reasserts chaos the instant the organ fades.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of healing as more than mechanical repair emerges through the organ’s grief-laden hope and Elara’s recognition that “some mutinies were born of longing.” The final walk toward the broken church offers a resonant, non-moralizing answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is textured, rhythmic, and filtered through Elara’s sensory panic (“shadows pooled like spilled ink”). Compression is purposeful; no head-hopping. Occasional elevated diction (“wistful rebellion surged”) slightly drifts from embodied stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is vivid and propulsive, with high information density. A few near-redundant phrases (“spatial mutiny here meant corridors could twist shut… distances lied”) and stacked metaphors in the climax marginally blunt impact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Familiar quest premise is transformed by the organ’s subterranean hymn and the mutiny’s emotional rather than malevolent nature. Specificity of the compass-as-anchor and the fallow-period lull give the piece a singular, memorable tilt.</comment>
