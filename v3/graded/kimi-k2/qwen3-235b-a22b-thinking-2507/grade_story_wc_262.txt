<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—“to find where unused love is stored”—is clear and consistent, but interiority drifts into lyrical abstraction (“vault of yearning”) rather than embodied contradiction. The final choice to absorb the love is credible, yet the psychic cost is asserted more than dramatized. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible waived.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the love is relocated into Elara herself, with the theater’s demolition as felt cost. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of images and cadence shift reweight the stake. Orientation is swift; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The projection booth is rendered with tactile specificity—“dust and decaying celluloid,” “cold metal of the projector”—and the hollow behind the screen becomes the literal storage site, constraining the final transfer. Micro-setting (cavity behind screen) functions as charged object.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—salvage unused love before demolition—is signaled early. Escalation is one deepening: realization that love is stored between frames, not elsewhere. Cost is the impending loss of the theater, felt but not sharpened through micro-choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of love’s persistence in overlooked spaces emerges organically from the accretion of letters and interstitial frames. Final image—“carried in her spatially imaginative soul”—reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext is strong; slight drift toward abstraction at climax.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical, consistent, and POV-locked; perceptual signature favors synesthetic spatial mapping. Rhythm modulates with tension. No dialogue, so no register drift. Occasional elevated diction (“psychometry,” “interstitial”) fits the seer persona.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; metaphor occasionally stacks (“liquid light”) but never muddles causality. No loops or scaffold. Strong sentence variety and sensory economy. One mixed metaphor—“hushed thunder”—is minor.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Premise of love archived in film gaps feels fresh; synthesis of psychometry, cinema decay, and spatial imagination is non-obvious. Risk in lyric mode pays off. Avoids cliché, though “crystal gazer” archetype is familiar.</comment>
