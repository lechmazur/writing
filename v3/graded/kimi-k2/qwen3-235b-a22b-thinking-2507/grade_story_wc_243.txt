<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the locket photo and ink ritual anchor contradictory impulses of grief and hope. The final micro-choice—handing the vellum to the girl—earns its cost through prior beats and visibly forecloses the path of solitary preservation. Minor slip: “haunted euphoria” is slightly diagnostic label-speak, but it lands within two lines of embodied cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the covenant is regenerated in the girl’s pocket, cost paid by Elara’s relinquishment of the pressed lupine. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of pressed objects and scent-memory tightens until the final cadence shift. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The jetty’s splintered planks and blooming lupines constrain every action—Elara kneels where flowers break through wood, the girl touches the same splintered edge. Twilight’s bruised palette charges the final image without ever stalling momentum. Micro-setting (locket photo as portable past) also constrains choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserve small moments before demolition—tightens once when Elara decides to give away the pressed flower, trading personal archive for communal memory. Cost is the tangible loss of the artifact she just created. Pressure escalates under Accumulative lens via sensory density and ticking dawn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the tension between preservation and transmission; no moralizing, only the silent reweighting of the lupine’s meaning when it passes to the girl. Final image answers the central question—how to save what cannot be saved—without stating it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise; perceptual signature filters every detail through Elara’s archivist gaze (“walnut ink staining her fingertips like earth-born constellations”). Rhythm modulates with emotional pressure; no head-hopping. Dialogue is minimal but natural and goal-driven.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers scent, texture, and memory without redundancy. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is patterned early and paid off. Minor elevated diction (“regenerated covenant”) is voice-motivated and consistent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Familiar premise—last night before demolition—is transformed through the specific occupation of walnut-ink archivist and the covenant of proximate causes. Risky lyric compression succeeds because pattern is taught early and closure remains legible.</comment>
