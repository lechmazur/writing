<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied (“his body a vessel for the land’s ancient song”), but the decades-long backstory is summarized rather than dramatized, keeping the score just below the 9-band gate.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the arrowhead’s return to dust crystallizes the new stance—navigation without movement—at visible cost (renunciation of physical travel). Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern taught early and paid off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Bone towers and dust motes are not mere backdrop; their acoustic properties and layered time constrain the skimmer’s method and charge the final image. Micro-setting (arrowhead) also functions as setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—stillness as navigation—tightens when the arrowhead’s pulse replaces stone-skimming; the cost is the renunciation of motion itself. One clear escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of stillness-as-journey emerges organically from the skimmer’s embodied practice; the final image of “home in every place at once” offers non-literal resonance without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded in the POV’s weathered perception; patterned elision (“centuries of layered dust”) is taught early and paid off. No head-hopping; perceptual signature distinct.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; figurative language serves the accumulative design. One minor loop (“pulse left wandering” echoed twice) keeps it from 9.0.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of geomancy, ornithomancy, and stillness; the arrowhead-as-compass feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes without obscuring closure.</comment>
