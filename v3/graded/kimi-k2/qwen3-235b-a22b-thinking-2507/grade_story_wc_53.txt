<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s regret and scavenger drive are embodied in tactile micro-choices (kneeling, pocketing shards), but the interior contradiction between hope and erosion is more summarized than dramatized in scene; the final renunciation lands with felt cost yet leans on abstract phrasing (“hollow certainty”) rather than a concrete forfeiture.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each fragment gathered tightens the emotional density toward the charged poise at the lagoon’s center. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration—ghost dissolves, path foreclosed—yet the cost is more atmospheric than materially legible on the final line.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The kinetic lagoon’s fractured stillness is vivid, selective, and mirrored in Elara’s boots crunching glassy silt; the suspended water and shattered carousel frame constrain movement and echo internal fracture, charging the final image with conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—retrieve 100 fragments to negotiate with her ghost—is signaled early; each shard collected incrementally raises emotional cost. One clear tightening at 99/100 forces the final wade; cost is felt in the trembling hands and the ghost’s dissolution, though escalation is more accretive than sharply causal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of eroded ambition and the price of looking away emerges through concrete particulars—warped film, weeping woman, child’s laugh—without moralizing. Final image of Elara turning “toward the shore… compass pointing nowhere” offers resonant, non-literal reweighting of prior motifs.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric, compressed, and consistent; perceptual signature filters every detail through Elara’s regret-soaked lens. Patterned elision (“chronologically confused”) is taught early and paid off in the mirrored younger self; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information-to-sentence ratio; occasional poetic layering (“regret coiled in her chest like cold wire”) risks overwriting but stays within pattern. No loops or scaffold; final paragraph maintains clarity and cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Carousel-as-memory-extraction device and suspended lagoon feel fresh; familiar tropes of ghost-negotiation and regret are transformed through tactile scavenger ritual. Specificity of disposable-camera shards as memory vessels is non-obvious and integral to closure.</comment>
