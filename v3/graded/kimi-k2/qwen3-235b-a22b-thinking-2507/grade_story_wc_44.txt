<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is embodied and specific—calloused thumb, steady breath, sweat bead—while her quiet ache for Varn and planetary stakes coexist without contradiction. Micro-choices (chisel angle, key tension) reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. The final renunciation—accepting Varn became guardian, not victim—earns closure with visible cost: she lays the key beside the shadow-shard, foreclosing reunion. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphany intrudes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: every loop closed is a because/therefore linkage narrowing options until the final click reconfigures knowledge. Closure is on-page—shadow-shard materializes, cost is the irreversible acceptance that Varn is sealed within the earth-spirit loop. Orientation anchors by line 3; no teleporting props or retroactive patches. The orrery’s scars teach the pattern early and pay off at the decisive beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Observatory’s fractured dome, brass astrolabes, and corroded runes are vivid yet selective, filtering through Elara’s scholarly gaze. The micro-setting of the orrery itself constrains every tool choice and charges the final image when its gears turn smooth. Spatial choreography is coherent; no impossible positions. Weather (cloud-sea sigh) affects mood without cliché.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preventing isle-shattering eruption—signaled early. Escalation is causal: each corrected rune tightens the noose of possibility until the final loop snaps shut, foreclosing the option of finding Varn alive. Cost is palpable: the shadow-shard confirms Varn’s self-sacrifice. No coincidence resolves; agency drives every beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: knowledge as stewardship, shadows as gifts not absences. The spoon-bending backstory reweights from domestic oddity to planetary warning without exposition. Final image—key beside shard—offers resonant, non-literal answer: understanding reseals grief into duty. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in the hum of the stable isle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is precise, tactile, slightly archaic without pastiche—“liquid starlight,” “runes meant to stabilize”—matching rune-scholar POV. Syntax tightens under pressure: short clauses during chisel work, longer cadences in reflection. No head-hopping or filter-verb clutter. Dialogue absent, so no voice leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and propulsive; every sentence advances story or atmosphere. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful—“moonlight bled,” “dust motes dancing”—never muddling causality. No loops, synonym churn, or scaffold. Rhythm modulates with scene tension; final paragraph slows to crystalline closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: spoon-bending as harbinger of runic collapse, noon-shadows as earth-spirit nourishment. Clockwork orrery mapping ley lines instead of stars feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Transformation test fails if names/places swapped—details are irreducibly specific. Risky quiet ending lands with conceptual cost.</comment>
