<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—boots magnetized, grip on yoke, the cold arrow tip against pulsing warmth—yet her contradictory impulses (claim vs. listen) remain implicit rather than dramatized in scene. The final renunciation of “trophy” for “tuning fork” is earned and carries felt cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test despite the slight under-drawing of internal conflict mid-scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the broken arrow reweights the premise from weapon to resonator, making resilience a gathered echo rather than a seized prize. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of water, stone, and memory tightens until the final image reconfigures meaning with undeniable conceptual cost. No causality breaks; every beat advances pattern or knowledge.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The inverted rivers and floating arches are not backdrop; they actively constrain navigation and force the final epiphany. The crystalline sap and glowing saplings charge the closure image, making environment, tool, and body inseparable. Spatial choreography is flawless; sensory hierarchy mirrors Elara’s urgent priorities.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“discover the source of resilience”—is signaled early and tightened once when the arrow tip’s vibration harmonizes with the planet’s memory, foreclosing the option to extract or exploit. Cost is visible: Elara pockets the tip not as conquest but as listener, accepting the humility of echo over ownership.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: resilience as remembered endurance rather than extracted resource. The broken arrow’s transformation from failed weapon to tuning fork offers a resonant, non-moralizing answer. No thematic statement intrudes; the final image of “whirling silence now singing” reweights all prior material.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct—compressed, lyrical, yet precise: “gravity-defying branches heavy with luminescent fruit.” Perceptual signature stays consistent under pressure; no head-hopping or register drift. Purposeful elision (no dialogue) is taught early and paid off in the charged silence of the ending.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is propulsive and dense: every sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Rhythm accelerates with the saplings’ growth, then breathes into the final cadence. Figurative language is selective and purposeful; no overwriting in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The inversion-hour orchard planet with memory-storing stone feels inevitable yet wholly fresh. Tropes of “quest for secret power” are inverted: the power listens back. Specificity of sap-pulsing saplings and magnetized boots anchors the concept; removing any detail would collapse the logic.</comment>
