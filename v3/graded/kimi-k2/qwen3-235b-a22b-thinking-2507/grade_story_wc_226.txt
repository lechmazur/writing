<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael’s interiority is vivid—calloused hand, quartz warmth, memory of children’s giggles—yet the “innocently mischievous” trait is asserted more than embodied in the final beat. The contradiction between fear and mercy is dramatized in the quartz raise, not summarized. Vanya’s micro-softening is credible, but her reversal feels slightly compressed; still, the cost of Kael’s stance is legible in the shared tears and the canyon’s new harmony.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the elders’ decree dissolves into spectrum under refracted light, with conceptual cost (the ritual now carries both song and silence). Causal chain holds: poetry sessions → confrontation → quartz refraction → Vanya’s command. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no drift. One transition (Vanya’s emergence) is clean. The ending beat crystallizes options without tidy resolution.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The bone towers and mist are not backdrop; their acoustic properties create the stakes (echoes fray the world-fabric) and the final canvas for the light shards. Spatial choreography is tight—quartz, spire, canyon walls track cleanly. Sensory hierarchy favors sound and light, reflecting Kael’s perceptual bias. The setting constrains the climax by turning silence from rule into spectrum.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—silence vs. voice—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightened when Vanya demands retraction. Escalation is causal: each poetry session raises stakes until the quartz act forces a public reconfiguration. Cost is visible in Vanya’s tears and the guardians’ new mandate. No coincidence resolves; the refracted light is earned by prior setup.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the collision of silence and refraction; no explicit moralizing. The final image of “fragile, multifaceted harmony” reweights the premise without stating a thesis. Subtext lives in gesture: Vanya’s tears replace her earlier sternness. The canyon’s “living breath” reframes enforced quiet as suffocation, earned through embodied stakes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise—“forged hush,” “splintered light dancing”—consistent with Kael’s artist-eye. Compression is taught early (“echoes that bounced…like trapped ghosts”) and paid off in the final spectrum. No head-hopping; focalization stays locked to Kael until Vanya’s tear-streaked moment, which is externally observed. Syntax modulates with pressure: longer cadence for mist, staccato for the crack of quartz.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; each sentence layers image and stakes. No loops or scaffold; “weathered by endless echoes” and “shard of cool quartz” are specific and non-generic. Metaphors stay coherent—light as possibility, silence as cage. Rhythm accelerates into the final refraction, then exhales with “the canyon exhaled.” Clean mechanics throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The premise—poetry as literal refraction against sacred silence—feels fresh and inevitable. Tropes of the rebellious artist and stern elder are transformed through the quartz-light mechanic and the canyon’s acoustic metaphysics. The risk of lyric density pays off in the charged final image. No derivative echoes; the synthesis is singular.</comment>
