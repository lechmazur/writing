<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's contradictory impulses—guardian duty vs self-reckoning—show through her tactile handling of the urn fragment and the risky message embedding; her final stance of patient waiting is earned and carries visible cost in the form of ongoing exposure. Interiority is specific, though brief recourse to "texture" as label slightly dulls the peak. A bit more embodied contradiction at decision point would have lifted this into 8+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is clean: the shard snaps into gear, time speaks in her own voice, and the charge crystallizes—“They hid the chroniton core.” Causality held; lenticular accumulation delivers decisive reconfiguration under Accumulative/Textural lens. Cost is felt in the gold flare and in the fresh ad she must keep writing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Environment, silo, urn, gear, all return with shifted weight; the green silo's final glow charges the closing image. Sensory choice is spare but purposive, orienting without clutter. One micro-slip: “baking sun” arrives late without prior weather set-up.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</question><comment>Dominant stake—recover the silo's heart while evading surveillance—tightens once when the gear confirms the trail, foreclosing passive compliance. Agency shifts from keeper to bridge-builder. Cost visible in her next encoded ad.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</question><comment>Theme of salvageable past resonates through the urn-ash voice and the emerald pulse. Yet a faint “message from Before” sentence near the end nudges exposition that edges toward thematic label. Mostly earned, slight echo of prompt-speech blunts the 8-band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Voice sustains perceptual specificity: “ash whispering,” “spider-silk” speech, controlled lyricism without drift. Tense and POV stable; no head-hop. Compressed cadences fit pressure without opacity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</question><comment>Prose is vivid, largely free of loop; only minor template repetition (“holding...holding tighter”) at one beat. High information density; every line bears multi-use load. One mixed metaphor—“time thicken”—slightly muddies, not enough to distort closure effect.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</question><comment>Reconfiguring memorial ash into a time-capsule key is fresh, coherent, and specific. No close echoes detected; synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight. Minor deduction: garage-sale encryption as method isn’t wholly unprecedented but is transformed with emotional stakes.</comment>
