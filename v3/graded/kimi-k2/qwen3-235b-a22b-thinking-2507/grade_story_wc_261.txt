<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Aris’s contradictory impulses—healing vs. reopening—are embodied in tactile micro-choices (coffee-ring divination, tunneling through ivy). The final renunciation is earned by prior causality: the hourglass’s failure forces him to accept his scar as testament rather than wound. Interiority is concrete, though “closure seeker” label appears once too cleanly. Flaws complicate choices without safety-hedging.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the scar shifts from problem to testament with felt cost (loss of plant-telepathy). Causal chain—melting hourglass → frantic tunneling → silence → realization—holds under Accumulative/Textural lens. One minor slip: “meteor hush” is introduced late but serves the final cadence. No orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lighthouse tower, fern, hourglass, and scarred body function as micro-settings that constrain choice. Frosted hourglass’s vanishing ice charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective (antiseptic, ocean sigh) and filtered through Aris’s medical gaze. Spatial choreography is coherent; no white-room syndrome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve telepathy to read scars—tightens as hourglass melts. Agency: frantic tunneling to save the miracle, ending in renunciation when it fails. Cost is visible: silence replaces plant-voices. One meaningful deepening; coincidence (meteor shower) complicates but does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges from specific particulars: scars as living stories, not wounds. Subtext in ivy’s “secrets buried in woody veins.” Final image reweights premise without moralizing: scar becomes testament, not pathology. Avoids tidy closure; ambiguity lingers in ocean’s sigh.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct—medical precision braided with lyrical compression (“sterile scent,” “meteor hush”). Perceptual signature filters every detail through surgeon’s gaze. No dialogue; interior monologue stays within POV lexicon. Rhythm modulates with pressure: longer sentences under anesthesia fade to staccato lunges.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each line advances story or atmosphere. No loops or scaffold. Figurative language is controlled (“dawn bled pale gold”) and never muddles causality. Strong verbs (“spilled,” “lunged”) replace modifiers. One minor register drift: “neural trauma” feels clinical in peak beat but fits character.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: plant-telepathy + scar-reading + Arctic hourglass feels inevitable in hindsight. Tropes (magical object, grief-healing) are transformed through surgical specificity. Risk-taking in lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. No derivative premise drift.</comment>
