<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Silas’s silence and guardianship are embodied in every beat; the astonishment, the mute resolve, and the final acceptance of keeperhood all flow from prior causality. Interior contradiction surfaces in the tension between guarding the box and the ghosts’ demand, resolved by Earned Stasis with visible cost—his lifelong silence must now deepen into active listening. No stock phrasing; each micro-choice (tracing dew, sitting before the box) reveals hierarchy of values. Flaw: the “astonishment” label is asserted more than dramatized in body.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the covenant is re-weighted from broken to waiting, with the cost legible in Silas’s perpetual silence and the desert’s breath held. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of ghostly signs and box-glow intensifies until stance crystallizes. Orientation is anchored early; no teleporting props. One minor drift: the priestess backstory is delivered in a reflective block that slightly dilutes present pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The scorched oasis, broken hives, and stained glass box function as micro-setting that constrains every move; the ghosts’ avoidance of the shed and the honeycomb cell in dew directly shape Silas’s choice. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered (ash under bare feet, fractured light). Weather and spatial choreography remain coherent. Only the lavender fields feel ornamental, never revisited under pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve the weight of unspoken words—is signaled early and tightened when the ghost child’s gesture forces Silas from passive guarding to active listening. Escalation is one deepening under Accumulative lens; no reversals needed. Cost is felt in the lifelong silence he must now intensify. Agency is renunciation/attention rather than action, fitting the mute premise.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of unspoken memory anchoring the world emerges organically from the covenant, the box, and the ghosts’ plea. No moralizing; the final image of fractured light weaving through ash offers non-literal resonance. Subtext operates in gesture and silence; the child’s traced sigil and dew cell carry layered meaning. Complexity is honored—covenant is “tangled,” not solved.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet controlled, with rhythmic variation and purposeful compression (“tranquilly perceptive recluse,” “mute eloquence”). Perceptual signature is distinct—Silas reads the box through fracture and light, never exposition. No head-hopping; POV distance remains consistent. Occasional elevated diction (“tangled covenant”) is earned by mythic register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; every sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. Figurative language is selective (“trapped fire,” “ghosts drifting like dying candles”) and never muddles causality. No loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary. One mixed metaphor—“weight of unspoken words press against his ribs”—is minor and does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Premise of mute beekeeper guarding sealed utterances in a post-Scorch wasteland is fresh yet inevitable. Ghosts as memory-messengers, covenant as living obligation, and box as vessel synthesize into singular vision. Risk-taking in silence-as-action pays off. No close echoes; specificity anchors universals.</comment>
