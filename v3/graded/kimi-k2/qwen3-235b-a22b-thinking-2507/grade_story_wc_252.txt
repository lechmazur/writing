<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—shore duty vs. sea nature—are dramatized in the tightening grip on the scrimshaw and the final step into water; the transformation is earned by prior embodied memories and costs her human identity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the rising whale-song, glowing scrimshaw, and emergent island tighten the texture until the final reconfiguration dissolves her human form; cost is the severing of all land ties, felt in the last look at the docks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The sublittoral fringe is not backdrop but pressure: wet stones under bare feet, water rising to waist and chest, guide each step toward detachment; the island’s shimmer and emerald realm charge the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—claim her sea nature—escalates through scrimshaw warmth, whale call, and island light; one decisive tightening occurs when she wades past chest-deep, foreclosing land life with visible cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of self-birth emerges through concrete particulars: whalebone, gills, tail; final image of sanctuary beneath waves offers resonant non-moral answer to “who am I?” without overt statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lyrical, salt-tinged diction and rhythmic cadence mirror Elara’s tidal mindset; perceptual signature is consistent, no head-hopping, and voice modulates with rising water and heartbeat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet textured; every image advances stakes—no loops, no filler. Metaphors (“sigh made visible”) serve pressure, not ornament, and clarity remains intact through transformation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Familiar mer-folk arc is refreshed through dock-worker specificity, whalebone scrimshaw as heart-key, and accumulative rather than causal drive; risk lies in lyric compression that pays off in final reconfiguration.</comment>
