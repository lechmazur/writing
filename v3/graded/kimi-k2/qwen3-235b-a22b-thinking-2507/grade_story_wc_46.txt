<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the contradiction between her shattered dreams and her earthbound purpose is dramatized through tactile micro-choices (weighing glass, polishing). The final renunciation—offering light without fire—earns its cost via the remembered funeral shard and the tremor in her hands. Minor slip: the phrase “gloriously, gently aloft” edges toward tidy uplift.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each polishing stroke layers density until the final image reconfigures the village’s night. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—starlight pooled without flame—whose cost is the irreversible surrender of her last shard. Orientation is anchored early; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The serpentine grotto’s damp walls and salt drip constrain her movements and echo her grandmother’s absence; the sea glass itself becomes micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered. One minor drift: “zephyr bloom” is lovely but slightly generic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—flameless light for a fire-fearing village—is signaled early and tightened through each polishing beat. The final display glows with visible cost: Elara gives away the last fragment that once consoled her grief. Pressure escalates via texture, not reversals, fitting the lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: memory as renewable light, stillness as vessel. The grandmother’s aphorism is earned through embodied ritual, not asserted. Final image of pathways glowing without combustion offers a non-literal answer that reweights the premise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise; perceptual signature is star-watcher exact (“liquid jade,” “crushed emeralds kissed by moonbeams”). Rhythm modulates with pressure—long breaths in the grotto, clipped urgency at the square. No head-hopping; POV modesty intact.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and memory without redundancy. Metaphors are coherent and grounded in the scene’s materials. One minor loop: “reflectively vibrant” appears twice in close succession.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The premise—polishing ocean scars into starlight—feels inevitable yet fresh. Transformation of grief into communal illumination avoids sentimentality through specific, irreversible cost. No close echoes; the synthesis is singular.</comment>
