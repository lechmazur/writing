<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—steady hands vs. war-drum heart—and her micro-choice to remove mittens and align the Cap is embodied and costly. The “furiously tranquil” state is dramatized, not labeled, and the final smile carries earned, visible cost. No contradictory impulses are shown in scene, so the 9+ quick test is narrowly missed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the Vault reseals and Elara “touched eternity,” a conceptual repricing with felt cost (drop of meltwater). Causal lens holds—every beat because/therefore—without ambiguity. Orientation is anchored by ~120 words; no teleporting props.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The icebound atrium is not backdrop; its groaning heartbeat and starlight axis constrain the ritual and charge the final meltwater drop. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven, selective, and purposeful. Environment directly shapes the climax, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—save the seeds—signaled early; pressure tightens when entropy reversal demands absolute stillness. One decisive tightening: mis-alignment would scatter hope. Cost is the burn of cold on bare skin and the irreversible transfer of “lived earth” into her.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of “borrowed time” emerges from the tactile weave of bark, seedpod, river-stone—never abstract assertion. Final image of the single meltwater drop reweights the premise without moralizing. Complexity lingers: salvation and loss coexist.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; perceptual signature filters every detail through Elara’s seed-saver gaze. Syntax modulates with pressure—short clauses under risk, longer breaths during sync. No head-hopping; elision is taught early (Frost Phoenix absence) and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet clear; every sentence advances story or atmosphere. Metaphors are fresh (“frost feathers,” “ghostly imprint”) and coherent. No loops, scaffold, or register drift. One hairline slip—“cathedral of frozen silence” skirts cliché—keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Frost Phoenix, entropy reversal, and seed-memory vortex synthesize into a fresh, inevitable whole. The transformation test passes: swap any element and the story collapses. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
