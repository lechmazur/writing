<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—grief-numbed craft vs. the fragile spark to “teach withering to bloom”—is embodied in tactile micro-choices (tracing the locket, folding vellum cranes). The final stance crystallizes with visible cost: she forfeits memorializing death to cultivate life, signaled by the pressed petal returned to her. Motivation stays rooted in her craft and loss; no stock epiphanies intrude.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the projected light reweights the observatory’s purpose from cosmic indifference to civic nurture. Causal chain—stencil → coordinates → curtains → lantern projection—holds without gaps; the cost is the irrevocable pivot away from her former art. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no lens ambiguity at end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The observatory’s brass telescopes, grimy dome, and velvet curtains are not backdrop but tools that constrain tactics; the gantry and gears enable the final projection. Sensory detail is selective—dust motes, aged paper, rain-lashed Tuesday—filtered through Elara’s grief-narrowed perception. Micro-setting (locket, vellum stencil) also constrains choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“teach withering to bloom”—is signaled early and tightened when Elara risks her last reserves of spirit to align the curtains. One decisive turn: she redirects the lantern outward, trading private mourning for public illumination. Cost is the exposure of her fragile hope to the city’s gaze; no coincidence resolves the tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of resurrection-through-attention emerges from concrete acts: seed-embedded lockets, origami coordinates, light projected onto overlooked weeds. No moralizing; the final image of glowing cracks in pavement reweights prior grief without statement. Subtext operates in the silence after the light blooms.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is precise, tactile, grief-tinged: “calloused finger,” “hollow refuge,” “subdued ardor.” Syntax tightens under pressure—short clauses as she climbs the gantry. No head-hopping; POV stays locked to Elara’s selective perception. Dialogue absent, appropriate to solitary focus.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is lean yet textured: “dust motes dancing in the single shaft” does double duty for atmosphere and Elara’s stasis. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or motive. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful—“moth wings” spark, “rock bottom’s chill.” Clean mechanics.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: Victorian mourning jewelry, astronomical observatory, and urban guerrilla gardening braided into one arc. The “curtains of intention” trope is transformed from occult device to civic projector. Risky final image—light graffiti of flowers on tenement walls—pays off emotionally and thematically.</comment>
