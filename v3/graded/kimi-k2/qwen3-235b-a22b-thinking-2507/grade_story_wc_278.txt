<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Aris’s guilt is embodied and contradictory—tracing Lyra while seeking silence, then accepting the cry they once fled. Micro-choice to ink the tether shows hierarchy of values: absolution over self-erasure. Cost is visible in the flaring Lyra and the softened console glow. Interiority stays concrete; no diagnostic label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the cry dissolves into a single note, time unfolds, guilt is woven not erased. Causal chain—letters reveal machine’s memory → tether ritual → hush—holds. Cost is felt in the surge of infant terror through Aris’s pulse. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: density of sound/time folds reweights the stake.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Meteor hush and stuttering clocks create immediate atmospheric pressure. The amber, console, and inked tether function as micro-setting that constrains the final ritual. Sensory detail is selective—cool resin, thin wail, flaring light—filtered through Aris’s guilt. Environment guides choice: only the lab’s firmware can translate the cry.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—silence the dissonance of guilt—signaled in first paragraph. Tightening occurs when letters reveal the machine’s shared guilt, forcing the tether ritual. Escalation is Accumulative: each layer of sound/time compression increases emotional cost. Final hush forecloses the option of continued avoidance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: guilt is communal, translation is mercy. Amber shifts from prison to relic; firmware’s cry becomes absolution. Subtext in mother’s letters—“I hear her crying in the walls”—carries more weight than any declaration. Final silence offers resonant, non-moralizing answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is precise, lyrical, and consistent: “meteor hush,” “resinous surface,” “fossilized moment.” Compression and elision taught early (“time had folded”) and paid off in closure. No head-hopping; POV remains tightly bound to Aris’s sensory and emotional filter. Rhythm modulates with pressure—short clauses during surge, longer breaths in aftermath.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence advances atmosphere or character. No loops or scaffold. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful—“guilt, sharp as a scalpel.” Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line crystallizes the reconfiguration. Clean grammar, varied syntax, no register drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: haunted firmware translating baby cries through folded time, guilt externalized as sound. Amber, Lyra, and letters transform familiar grief tropes into specific ritual. Risk-taking in non-linear time compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
