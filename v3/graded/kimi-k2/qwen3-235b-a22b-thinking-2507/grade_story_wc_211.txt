<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elias's drive to archive emotions is embodied through tactile details (trembling fingers, burning wax), and the immersive action that reawakens childhood memory carries clear stakes. His final scream is costly, yet the contradictory impulse—pity versus duty—stays abstract. Interior monologue leans toward explanatory rather than raw contradiction at the climax.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of emotional density increases until the glass apples crystallize the archive's purpose. Closure reweights the premise (“...not to save...but to contain the moment they ceased to matter”) with undeniable conceptual cost. Scene orientation secured early in fog-drenched orchard.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Skyscraper orchard, apples turning to glass, and phonograph roots all constrain tactics and charge the final image. Sensory details are selective—fog velvet, decay perfume, shattered obsidian—filtering through Elias’s professional eye. Geography tracked cleanly; no spatial drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Central stake clarifies after silence: archive as tomb. One deepening fold—the child’s prophecy realized—is foreshadowed and lands at cost. Agency: Elias’s decision to replay the shaving causes the world’s shift to glass, paying the price of his own archive (loss). Tension tightens credibly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</question>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: preservation becomes complicity in death. Subtext carries through glass apples, wax dust, and Elias’s final unsaved scream. No moral summary intrudes; closure image resonates the cost without didactic statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</question>
<comment>Third-person limited diction balances scholar precision with sensuous texture (“velvet disquiet,” “silk rustle”). Distinct POV signature through perceptual filtering. No drift in register; compression taught early (“a ghost’s sigh”) and paid off in final reprise.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</question>
<comment>Sentences advance multiple threads while maintaining rhythm; rare moments of purple lift serve the climax. No paraphrase loops or scaffold. Only minor over-description near glass apples, not enough to dull closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</question>
<comment>Synthesis of phonograph prophecy, urban rooftop orchard, and archival death rattle feels fresh. Childhood shard threaded to final glass image without gimmick. Specificity of curator’s Linear B oath and phonograph needle craftsmanship grounds the invention.</comment>
