<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Silas’s calm intuition and shadow-thread skin are vividly embodied; the shards of empathy compel each micro-choice. One break: Kael’s interior is told, not shown when his fist “trembles,” but the cost is dramatized on the ice and suffices for this scale.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal lens throughout: “they needed mirrored glimpses to stitch time’s tear” triggers the plot; each shard fetch because/therefore locks. Closure lands with earned stasis—joint lantern line lights the bridge; cost is visible in Silas’s shadows now hosting collective fear. Slight orientation wobble (orchard mirror geography) waived as disorientation is paid off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lighthouse orchard, groaning floes, and vintage mirrors are selective and body-scaled; each prop constrains motion (e.g., apple roots wedging final shard). Atmosphere pulses through the sensory hierarchy: “apple trees sighing above groaning ice” layers sound and weight without exposition. One minor telescoping (“clifftop above floes” vs “below lighthouse”) lightly strains spatial clarity but does not break immersion.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—empathy mapped onto safety—is announced early and escalates through causal shard retrieval; trust frays and rewinds visibly once projected vision arrests Kael’s fist. Cost crystallizes on the ice: shared patrol agreement and lantern-lit cliff path, legible social coin expended. Intensification is one decisive turn, adequate for 600–800 scope.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of fractured empathy rebuilt mirrors itself in shattered crystal and re-stitched trust; no thematic thesis voiced, resonance delivered in final lantern image. Subtext is cleanly carried by mirror visions rather than explanation. Slight uplift from orchard mirrors as motif that reconfigures the final stance (“tiny lighthouses”).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>A distinct lyric density—“shadow-laced peacekeeper,” “weighted breath before reply”—sustains voice without drifting into purple. POV locks in Silas; psychic distance compresses during shard search then widens to absorb collective lantern light. Dialogue is minimal yet purposeful (“voice became a steady beacon”) and avoids self-narration.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is kinetic, propulsive: no paraphrase loops, syntax tightens with urgency (“breaths held in the weighted breath before reply”). Information often dual-loads—every shard carries metaphoric and plot freight. One near-redundancy “weighted breath…breath” recurs but pattern is purposeful.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Fresh frame: broken empathy crystal as social GPS is non-template. Mirrors that trap temporal shards feel inevitable yet un-mined. Transformation of orchard from “watchtower above chaos” to “bridge over chaos” reframes setting rather than resorts to genre tricks.</comment>
