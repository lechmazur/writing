<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is embodied and specific—her fingertips “reading” water ripples to map the drone’s fault is a vivid, character-defining micro-choice. Motivation (decode feedback to guide her daughter) is clear and intensifies through the repair. The final smile and drone’s departure crystallize earned stasis with felt cost: her labor becomes the child’s safe passage. Minor slip: “magnetic calm” is repeated without deepening contradiction, keeping her just shy of 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single-scene causal arc: tear → diagnosis → patch → flight. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—drone lifts at the exact bell toll, reweighting the depot’s fog into vectors of safety. Cost is legible: Elara’s solitude deepens as the ship leaves. No orientation drift; lens (Causal) holds cleanly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Depot’s “mist-coated” iron and leaky pipe are tactile constraints; the chipped basin becomes a micro-setting that literally shapes the repair method. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—sound of chains, smell of ozone—anchoring blind perception. Final drone exit recharges the fog as navigable space. Slight over-reliance on “grey watercolors” cliché prevents 9.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—ensure drone can guide the ship—signaled early. Escalation is the narrowing of feedback into precise location; the patch is the decisive act that forecloses failure. Cost: Elara’s isolation as the ship departs. Pressure coherent under causal lens; no coincidence resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of perception beyond sight emerges organically from Elara’s method and gift. Subtext in the drone’s silent promise to her daughter carries emotional weight without statement. Final image—drone vanishing into vent—offers non-literal answer: intention can navigate uncertainty. Avoids moralizing; complexity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is tactile, rhythmic, and POV-locked: “fractured wing… cool and sharp against her skin.” Perceptual signature—sound of droplets, electromagnetic hum—remains consistent. No dialogue, so compression and sensory diction carry the load. Final cadence shift as drone lifts is cleanly earned.</comment>

<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid: “iridescent polymer film, thinner than a moth’s wing” does triple duty—image, function, theme. No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances. Minor elevated diction (“sonorous chime”) slightly above Elara’s lexicon, but fits ceremonial moment. Closure line is crisp.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: blind engineer using water refraction to repair a drone that will refract fog into safe passage. Tropes (blind seer, gifted artisan) are transformed through grounded technical detail and maternal stakes. Risky choice to keep second character off-page pays off via charged object. Feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
