<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s motives crystallize through micro-choices—the library exit, the hidden card—showing motive pushing to action. Silent students’ fears are dramatized as pressure rather than interior exposition, making the renunciation feel earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A clear causal lens: silent fear—>covert plan—>magnetic grotto—>dawn mural. The ending’s Charged Poise reweights meaning while remaining strictly character-bound, with cost visible in the girl’s tear-streaked face.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The library-cobalt window, grotto magnetism, and mist all pressure tactical choices and visually charge the final mural image. Specific objects (pawn, hairpin) function as micro-settings constraining moves.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Pressure escalates from personal fear (failing exams) to collective risk (council surveillance); each beat raises stakes—stealth placement, synced display, child’s tears—ending with felt communal cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The theme emerges through the quiet, light-based reclamation rather than proclamation; the dawn tree offers non-literal reweighting of history that invites reflection without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Voice remains consistent in interior POV; sensory filtering shows Elara’s precise, tactical mindset. Amplified-quiet tone is modulated by pressure, culminating in the crystallized hush of the windows.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Precision in sensory verbs—“low thrum felt in bones”—and rhythmic compression under pressure; zero scaffolding or figurative muddle. Sentence-level propulsion carries tension to the closing image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The silent mural rebellion offers a non-obvious synthesis of library secrecy and starlit technology; risky use of magnetism pays off as a fresh tactical angle without gimmickry.</comment>
