<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the fossil’s warmth dissolving her isolation is a concrete micro-choice. The final renunciation—pocketing the fossil and accepting her role as translator—carries visible cost (loss of personal talisman). Minor slip: “factual mysticism” edges toward diagnostic label-speak mid-climax.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the cave’s emotional archive reweights Elara’s mission from data-gathering to voice-giving. Causal chain holds—fossil’s levitation is foreshadowed by its warmth and diary echoes. Cost is legible in her trembling log entry and the fossil’s stillness once removed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Coastal cave is tactile—boots sink in silt, visor fogs, tidal pool mirrors heatmap. Micro-setting (fossil levitating in brackish water) constrains the final choice and charges the image. Orientation anchored within 120 words; no spatial drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—becoming the voice of the unknown—tightens when the fossil’s levitation forces Elara to reinterpret her tools and purpose. One meaningful deepening: spectrometer shifts from mapping to translating. Cost is the fossil’s loss of private magic once shared.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of continuity-through-empathy emerges from the heatmap’s color arc and the fossil’s bridging role. Final image (maps now include spectral conversations) offers non-literal answer without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo; resonance arises from sensory particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is precise, scientific yet lyric—“salt-scoured winds,” “subterranean echoes”—consistent with sensory cartographer POV. No head-hopping; perceptual signature filters every detail through professional bias. Rhythm modulates under pressure: short clauses during spectrometer calibration, longer cadence in reflection.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers sensory data and emotional charge. No loops or scaffold; “factual mysticism” is the only elevated diction moment. Strong verbs—“flared,” “calibrated,” “dissolving”—drive momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fusion of climate-science tools with emotional archaeology feels fresh; fossil-as-beacon trope is transformed by geothermal logic and heatmap mechanics. Risky speculative premise commits fully without exposition dump. Specificity of kelp-forest scent and elm-vein warmth anchors universals.</comment>
