<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses—rebellion against forgetting vs. acceptance of invisibility—drive every micro-choice. Kael’s silent counsel crystallizes her stance without diluting her agency. The final renunciation (playing the silence alone) carries visible cost: she remains unseen yet validated by the harbor’s song. Minor slip: “joyful sorrow” is named rather than dramatized at the very end.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the flute’s note reconfigures the harbor’s silence into music, proving the premise with undeniable conceptual cost—she will stay forgotten. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each mapped silence layers density until the final cadence shift. Causality is tight; no orientation debt. The cost is legible in the final image: Kael dissolves, Elara stands alone with the flute.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The luminous harbor moonlight is not backdrop but instrument: it pools where Elara chalks her scores, constrains visibility, and charges the final flute note with silver resonance. Micro-setting (pier planks, buoy knock, foghorn echo) is tactile and choice-shaping. Spatial choreography is flawless; no white-room drift. The camera and flute function as extensions of setting, grounding every beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove silence is a language—tightens through each mapped interval until the flute turns absence into sound. Escalation is accumulative: chalk marks → fishermen’s pause → crystalline tone. The final tightening forecloses public recognition; cost is the perpetual invisibility she accepts. Agency is hers alone; coincidence never rescues.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: silence as generative, not empty. The flute’s note is the non-literal answer—music born of absence. Subtext saturates gesture: Kael’s dissolving departure, Elara’s solitary stance. No moralizing; complexity lingers in the joyful sorrow she plays. Motifs (camera, chalk, flute) reweight themselves without authorial nudge.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, modulating with tidal rhythm. Sensory selectivity (salt sting, brass chill) is character-bound. Sign-language dialogue is rendered as clean, goal-driven action beats. No POV leakage; every image filtered through Elara’s yearning. Final sentence’s cadence mirrors the held note—compressed, resonant, earned.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is taut, rhythmic, and image-dense. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances stakes or atmosphere. Metaphors (liquid pearl, suspended wing) are fresh and coherent. One micro-slip: “ghost conducting symphonies” edges toward cliché but is redeemed by context. Closure line is crystalline.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise—mapping silence into music via empty camera and chalk—is non-obvious and fully committed. Transformation test: swap any element and the story collapses. Risky lyric structure pays off in the final flute note. Specificity (Leica III, 9.3-second foghorn echo) anchors universals. No derivative echoes.</comment>
