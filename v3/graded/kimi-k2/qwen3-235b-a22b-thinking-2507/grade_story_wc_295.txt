<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses (solitude vs. communal burden) surface in the dream and telescope beats. The final renunciation—“We lift together”—is earned by prior causality and carries visible emotional cost. Minor slip: the mentor’s vanishing is summarized, not dramatized, slightly blunting the relational crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the telegram’s rhythm decoded into “Carry not alone” reweights the entire quest. Causal linkage holds—dream glyphs → star pulses → translation—under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Cost is legible in the tear-pricked eyes and the final inscription.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Observatory chill, brass telescope, and daylily imprint are selective, sensorily rich, and tied to choice. The telescope and telegram function as micro-settings that constrain decoding tactics. Only the temple interior risks a brief white-room lapse before glyphs activate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decode before monsoon erasure—tightens when Rho Lyrae’s pulse matches the dream glyph sequence, forcing the communal insight. One clear deepening: from solitary burden to shared lifting. Cost is felt in the relinquishing of lone-hero identity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of communal burden emerges organically from star-cipher mechanics and dream ritual; no moralizing. The final image of ink “stitching loneliness” offers non-literal resonance that reweights prior glyphs and telegram. Subtext in the daylily’s ghostly imprint carries unspoken grief and legacy.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with controlled rhythm under pressure (“heart hammering against her ribs”). Perceptual signature—astronomer’s lexicon filtered through dream logic—remains coherent. No head-hopping; POV distance stable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is patterned and paid off (“starlight and shadow”). No loops or scaffold. Minor register drift toward the poetic in “midnight solace” is voice-motivated and consistent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of lucid dreaming, variable-star cryptography, and communal labor history. The daylily telegram as cipher key feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risky lyric compression succeeds without clarity loss.</comment>
