<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Leo’s skepticism and curiosity are embodied in tactile micro-choices (kneeling in cold muck, straining to lift the valve). The final shift from mockery to custodianship is earned by the radio confession and the valve’s weight; cost is the literal burden he shoulders at dawn.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Leo’s stance flips from dismissive to keeper-of-truth, signaled by the dawn exit with the valve. Causal chain—radio confession → valve recognition → ghost shift passage → acceptance—holds cleanly under a Causal lens with felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The tunnel’s wet stone, rust, and muck are filtered through Leo’s explorer priorities; the valve’s brass and beads become micro-setting that constrains his final choice. Spatial choreography is tight—no impossible moves—and the dawn emergence re-weights the gloom.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth versus denial—tightens when the radio caller confesses and the valve materializes. One decisive escalation: Leo lifts the valve, feels twelve lives, and can no longer walk away. Cost is the crushing lightness he now carries.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of guilt made tangible emerges through the valve’s beads and the ghost shift’s hush; no moralizing, only the image of Leo exiting with the weight. The swallowed truth is re-priced from rumor to personal responsibility without a thesis statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is geologist-precise, skeptical, then quietly awed; perceptual signature shows in “beads clicking like counting bones.” No POV drift; compression and elision (“the tunnel seemed to exhale”) are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence advances discovery or atmosphere. No loops or mixed metaphors; rhythm modulates with pressure. Final image—“the valve wheel slung over his shoulder”—lands clean, no scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Familiar ghost-story frame is inverted: the skeptic becomes the haunted custodian. The beaded valve as confessional relic is a fresh inflection; transformation test fails if swapped, confirming originality.</comment>
