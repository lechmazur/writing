<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—duty vs. curiosity—is embodied in the micro-choice to intercept rather than alert; the laser pointer hand-off carries visible cost (loss of control). Spatial gift is label-only until the final spatial geometry of release, limiting depth. Recognition with the physicist feels slightly convenient rather than earned by prior causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara’s stance crystallizes from guardian to facilitator, cost legible in her open hand and silent security system. Causal lens holds—each beat (bypassing sensors, pressing the button, surrendering the tool) follows because/therefore logic. Orientation is swift; no temporal drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The bioluminescent farm is more than backdrop; its permeable barriers and pulsing mycelium constrain tactics and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective—pre-dawn stillness, inner radiance—filtered through Elara’s professional eye. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from booth to Sector 7.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—control vs. growth—tightens once when Elara chooses to let the strangers proceed and then hands over the tool; the price is her authority and the farm’s future security model. Escalation is a single, coherent deepening under the causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of surrender vs. control emerges through action and image rather than statement; the physics of letting go is dramatized by the beam piercing the mushroom. Final image of light “breathing in sync with the earth” reweights the premise without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is consistent, slightly lyric, with controlled compression; perceptual signature is Elara’s spatial mapping and quiet wildfire metaphor. Dialogue is minimal but natural, carrying subtext (“Show me”). No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; occasional metaphor clusters (“quiet wildfire”) risk overwriting but do not stall momentum. No loops or scaffold; spatial and sensory details are woven through action. Final cadence breathes appropriately.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of biosecurity, quantum mycology, and personal surrender; the laser pointer as harmonic key feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in merging hard science with lyric mysticism pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
