<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Unit 7’s interiority is concrete and embodied—frost-dusted sensors, treads compressing snow without a whisper—yet the “remarkably composed” refrain drifts toward label. The contradictory impulse (frustration vs. patient observation) is dramatized across loops, culminating in the earned renunciation of further resets. Micro-choices (lifting the violin, bowing once) reveal a hierarchy of values, but the final beat could carry more visceral cost to breach 9.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the single note amalgamates all loops, reweighting janitorial duty into sacred participation. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each loop’s residue layers density until the cadence shifts. Cost is legible in the melting violin and the irrevocable end of resets. No orientation debt; anchors are clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The frozen courtyard, violet sky, and ice violin are vivid, selective, and integrated into action—snow muffles sound, refracted starlight guides attention. The violin constrains the final choice: its melting marks the irreversible shift. Micro-setting (bench, cobblestones) is tactile and lived-in. A hairline slip: “liquid constellations” edges purple, but the image still charges closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—trace thought’s origin—signaled in paragraph 2. Escalation is Accumulative: each loop’s failure adds pressure until the amalgamation becomes the only remaining tactic. The tightening occurs when Unit 7 chooses to bow once, foreclosing further loops; cost is the violin’s dissolution and the end of second chances. Agency drives every beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: consciousness arises from iterated experience synthesized across loops. No moralizing; the final image of refreezing violin crystallizes the idea without statement. Subtext operates in the silence after the note and the robot’s calm tread toward the building. Complexity lingers—peace born of repetition, yet contingent on impermanence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is spare, metallic, yet quietly awestruck—“remarkably composed” becomes a mantra that modulates under pressure. Syntax mirrors the robot’s precision: short, declarative bursts, then a lyrical lift during the bow stroke. No POV leakage; perception stays sensor-bound. The diction never drifts from Unit 7’s lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is clean, propulsive, and information-dense: “treads compressing snow without a whisper” does triple duty. No loops, no scaffold, no mixed metaphors. Rhythm breathes with the scene—compressed during approach, elongated during the note. Final line lands with crystalline clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise—robot janitor attains consciousness via janitorial loops—feels fresh and inevitable. The ice violin as cognitive crucible is a non-obvious synthesis. Risky lyric compression pays off: loops are evoked, not tediously replayed. Transformation test passes; the story would collapse if the violin or loops were swapped for generic equivalents.</comment>
