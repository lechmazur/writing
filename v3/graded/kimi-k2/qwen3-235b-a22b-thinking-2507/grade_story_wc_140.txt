<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elias’s hunger for memories—‘how grief felt like wet sand’—grounds motivation in specific desire; the layering of overheard fragments shows motive sharpening into archival purpose. Internal contradiction (existence nullified by paperwork yet physically alive) animates every quiet crawl, nail-scoring of metal, and refusal to abandon the label. The final decision to embed the poison label in mud is a micro-choice with visible cost: an offering that both congeals and perpetuates their stance. The ‘ghost’ aura never slips into abstraction; embodied hunger remains tethered to tactile hunger for texture.

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Plot’s engine is accumulative/textural: each fragment adds palimpsest layer culminating in climactic ‘my brother didn’t drink poison’ that crystallizes causal certainty. Closure arrives not as causal reversal but as charged poise: pressing label into earth is Earned Stasis—renouncing conventional identity to become perpetual archivist of the erased. Lens holds without drift. Cost is felt: relinquishing reclaimable past for indefinite witness.

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Container labyrinth is not backdrop but tactile constraint: heights force climbs, mud sucks boots, tides physically gate paths. Salt sting in eyes and crushed-glass fear texture are integrated into choice pressure. The poison label’s corroded edge serves micro-setting that charges both memory texture and final offering. Ground is selective, urgent, and always filtered through Elias’s scavenger perception.

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—to recover what obliteration erased—tightens via each testimony gathered; each new whisper narrows escape routes until the only viable response is permanent witness. Escalation occurs under Accumulative lens: density of fragments increases emotional weight, ending crystallizes foreclosure of ‘a normal name’. No false reversals, no coincidental resolution; only deepening recognition that naming is now choice, not right.

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Theme of systemic erasure emerges organically from repeated bureaucratic lies (‘industrial accident’) versus dockworker whispers; no explicit thesis. Final image—press label into mud—reweights past not as salvage but as foundation, creating open resonance. Subtext lives in silences: ‘They dumped the evidence at high tide’ carries more murder than any headline. No moralising, only stark material gesture that refuses forget.

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</question><comment>Third-person lens is consistent and perceptually claustrophobic, mimicking Elias’s scavenger filter. Diction salted (‘brackish’, ‘salt crust’, ‘calloused’) feels of the port. Compression taught early: ‘each fragment is a shard of truth’ primes reader for fragment collage without further exposition. No voice leakage or register drift under final pressure.

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Prose carries muscular rhythm: varied sprints and long breathers mirror tidal surges. Specificity (‘faded label torn, chemical name blurred by rain’, ‘wet earth offering and marker’) cuts cliché. No loops or near-duplicates; filter verbs kept low. Ear test succeeds read aloud.

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</question>
<comment>Fusion of bureaucratic annihilation and noir scavenger quest is fresh; transformation lies in archive-as-body. ‘Texture of memory as sand and splintered wood’ feels specific to voice. Derivative guardrail avoided—no stock orphan detective; identity is choice not revelation. Non-obvious synthesis lands inevitable in hindsight.
