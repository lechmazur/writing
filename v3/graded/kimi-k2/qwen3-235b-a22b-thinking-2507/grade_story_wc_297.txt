<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—dreams of harmony vs. literal root-binding—is embodied in every beat; her micro-choice to bleed into the scar reconfigures both stance and covenant with visible cost. The final kneel in communion, not bondage, earns the shift. No stock phrasing; emotion is muscular and specific. One slip: “anxious elation” repeats as label, not embodied pulse.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each scar-link and root-tremor tightens the weave toward the golden intersection. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—roots lift her, covenant reknits—cost is the blood and the irreversible mingling. Orientation anchored by word 60; no drift. One causal ellipsis (how the clipping “remembers”) is forgiven under lyric pattern.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Cobalt glade, dusk indigo, and the root-scar interface are tactile constraints; the topiary clipping doubles as micro-setting and tool. Sensory hierarchy narrows to heartbeat and soil vibration under crisis. Drone buzz overhead provides temporal anchor. Final image of clipping planted in golden light charges the reconfiguration.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake: heal the covenant or remain root-bound. Pressure escalates via each scar probed and root tightened; the tightening culminates in the single golden flare that forecloses retreat. Cost is blood, pain, and irreversible fusion with the land. No external antagonist needed; internal/external stakes interlace cleanly.</comment>

<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of reconciliation vs. dominion emerges through soil, blood, and maze memory—never stated. Final image of the clipping as “seed against her palm” reweights all prior wounds into possibility. Ambiguity lingers: drones still buzz, covenant fragile. No moralizing; resonance is visceral.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is lush yet precise, modulating from hush to thrum under pressure. Free-indirect style stays rooted in Elara’s sensorium: “root-tethered bones could feel.” No POV leakage. Syntax mirrors pulse—long coils tighten into clipped final lines. One register drift (“conceptual repricing” not in Elara’s lexicon) is absent; diction remains character-bound.</comment>

<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every image advances. Metaphors are coherent—roots as serpents, covenant as eclipse. No loops or scaffold. Rhythm accelerates into the final flare, then exhales. Minor tic: two adjacent “anxious elation” uses dull the peak by 0.1.</comment>

<comment>Premise—future arriving early, covenant via maze-topiary—feels inevitable yet fresh. Synthesis of eco-fantasy and intimate ritual is specific to this voice. Risky lyric compression pays off in closure. No derivative echoes; the maze’s living contract is transformed, not borrowed.</comment>
