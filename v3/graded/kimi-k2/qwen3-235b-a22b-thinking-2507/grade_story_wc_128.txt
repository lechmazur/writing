<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Aris’s shift from profit-driven broker to empathetic initiator is credibly seeded in prior debt to Mateo; Elena’s grief is embodied in the trembling locket. The micro-choice to draft “Project Silent Currents” crystallizes a new value hierarchy with visible cost to his former identity. Interiority avoids therapy-speak, though one stock phrase (“profit alone had never sparked…”) slightly dilutes specificity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: mistaken envelope → recognition of wrong address → revelation of Mateo’s act → Aris’s reparative plan. Closure is a Charged Poise: the locket returned to Elena under fading stars reconfigures both futures. Cost is legible—Aris forecloses the purely mercantile path—though the final beat could sharpen the material stakes he now risks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Library garden’s salt breeze and lantern-lit stone walls ground the scene; the locket functions as micro-setting that constrains Elena’s grip and later Aris’s promise. Sensory detail is selective—jasmine scent, starlight on silver—supporting tone without clutter. One minor spatial drift: “across the garden” then “near an oak table” could tighten orientation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—honor invisible labor—surfaces once Aris sees the photo. Escalation tightens through each testimonial added to the list; the final plan forecloses the option of silent profiteering. Cost is felt but abstract; a concrete risk (lost contract, union blowback) would push higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of compassion as circulating current emerges through Mateo’s rerouted medicine and Aris’s archival atonement. Subtext lives in the envelope’s misdirection and the locket’s silent testimony. Final image reframes prior material without moralizing, though the phrase “cycles could turn, one story at a time” edges toward thematic echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Narrative voice carries a precise maritime lexicon (“cargo manifests,” “stevedores”) filtered through Aris’s shrewd perceptual bias. Rhythm modulates from clipped calculations to softer cadences under Elena’s grief. Dialogue is sparse but goal-driven; Elena’s whispered question lands as subtext. No POV drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and propulsive; sentences advance plot or atmosphere without scaffold. Occasional lyrical lift (“night-blooming jasmine scented the air”) is earned. One minor loop: “he’d found a current worth steering by” echoes “cycles of compassion” phrasing. Otherwise clean, vivid, and read-aloud ready.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Familiar premise—atonement through storytelling—is refreshed by maritime logistics and the misdelivered bureaucratic envelope. Specificity of union tensions and archival practice resists generic uplift narratives. The final reconfiguration feels inevitable yet not groundbreaking; risk is measured, not bold.</comment>
