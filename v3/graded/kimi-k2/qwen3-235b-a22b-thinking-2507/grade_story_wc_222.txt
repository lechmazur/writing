<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Silas’s “chivalrous thief” identity and apprentice motive are embodied through micro-choices (the starlight offerings, the acorn thank-you) that reveal reverence under pressure, but interior contradiction is mild—fear is stated but never threatens his next move, so the cost feels more decorative than earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: swap-of-the-Knight triggers the sky-righting cascade, and the lens is causal throughout—“because sky is wrong → therefore amend with chess pieces.” Cost shows in the groaning ice and the backward sundial shadow snapping to still; no leaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>“Diamond-dust snow,” “voidstone King vibrating,” and the fracturing violet sky embed place, peril, and physics; the sundial-lid shadows double as temporal stakes and navigational tool, constraining Silas’s last move and charging the restored dawn.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—the fracture of the heavens—is announced visually and escalates as the sundial eats half its face; the swap each narrows time and raises physical risk, culminating in a single, irreversible trade that carries its payment in cracking ice.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of sacred play emerges via dramatized ritual (offering, acorn token), culminating in a wordless image: Silas walking “home through the mended sky.” The meaning is felt, not told, and reframes theft as restoration rather than taking.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Silas’s sensory filter (“frost-bitten brass,” “heart pounding exhilaration”). Distinct lyric diction in rhythmic, compressed syntax never tilts into exposition; POV modesty kept.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Highly compressed, vivid, propulsive lines; occasional poetic reach (“stars bleed downward”) is anchored by physical stakes. Slight filter-churn in “cautious abandon demanded moving through fear” could prune for peak sharpness, yet does not cloud closure.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Reverses the heist trope—from theft to amendment—using secret-hollow chess pieces inside an ice-clock mechanism. The specificity is inseparable from the story logic: remove any element and the sky-fix fails. Fresh synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</question>
