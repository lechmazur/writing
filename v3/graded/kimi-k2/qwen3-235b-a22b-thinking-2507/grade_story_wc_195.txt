<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Torin’s interior contradiction—guilt vs. the vow to guard possibility—is embodied in the trembling hand on glass and the counter-clockwise trace; the final unsnapping is earned by the Oracle memory and visibly costs his withdrawal. Minor slip: “shivering bliss” edges toward label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (frost, violet light, geometric ink) thickens until the lattice unsnap tears open a thousand dawns. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—possibility floods the greenhouse with felt cost: Torin’s blurred vision and hitched breath.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Greenhouse glass, moon-ivy lattice, and glowing cereus are not backdrop; the negative spaces between vines literally guide Torin’s fingers and constrain the final gesture, charging the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Dominant stake—“guard the cradle of possibility”—is signaled early and tightened once: the unsnapping forecloses retreat into silence and releases raw potential at visible bodily cost (knees buckling, breath hitching).</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of salvaging potential rather than preserving a single future emerges organically from the Oracle’s dying murmur to the lattice reversal; the final thousand dawns offer a non-literal, resonant answer without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Voice is knightly yet lyric, tactile yet compressed; perceptual signature shows in “orchard dust and the peculiar, clinging residue.” No head-hop; diction modulates under stress (“trembling, beautiful shapes”).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Prose is dense but purposeful: “luminous night-blooming cereus pulsed with soft violet light” does triple sensory work. No loops, no mixed metaphors; rhythm accelerates into the tearing-silk cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</question><comment>Fresh synthesis: marionette diagrams as living cipher, entropy as greenhouse frost, knight turned gardener of unborn futures. Risky lyric compression pays off in the final unsnapping.</comment>
