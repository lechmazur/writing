<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is character-specific and embodied, but his final renunciation registers more as a beatific release than a contradiction actively felt in the moment. The cost—“the cloak pooling at his feet”—is legible, yet the interior struggle stays elegant rather than raw.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The closure beat—dropping the cloak and the shard’s image—lands as Charged Poise under Accumulative/Textural lens: the accumulation of doubts reweights choice and meaning with cost. Moment-to-moment causality is coherent; only a slight easing in tension on the last beat keeps it shy of 9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The lighthouse, dawn sea, and chimes function as micro-setting and object-setting that constrain mood and choice, especially when the chimes’ “D natural, the tone of beginning,” anchors closure. The setting feels tactile—salt air on exposed neck—yet stays secondary to interior stakes, limiting score to high 8-band.</comment>

<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—own conscience vs false certainty—is signaled early. Pressure tightens through Elias’s recollection of Mrs. Gable and the chimes’ urgent pattern, forcing the choice to drop the cloak. Cost is visible and stakes escalate under Accumulative/Textural lens; the final image crystallizes without external cop-outs.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme—nuance versus certainty—emerges cleanly from Elias’s lived moment rather than abstract lecture. The hollow shard as “vessel waiting to be filled” reweights prior material in a resonant non-literal answer; no final moralizing intrudes.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person close focalization is tight, lyrical, and specific. Syntax modulates with emotional intensity—wind “bled grey into the sky” vs short “salt-laced wind whipped.” Internal vocabulary never exceeds plausible lexicon; no head-hop or POV leakage. Distinct stylistic signature under controlled pressure.</comment>

<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; every sentence works double duty of character and atmosphere. Occasional slight lyric surplus (“cloak woven from every maybe”) inches toward overwriting in a high-pressure beat, nudging downward by a hair, yet the final passage sustains crystalline clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The conscience-for-hire premise, doubt cloak, and hollow mirror shard form a fresh conceptual frame that could tilt gimmicky but lands grounded via specific stakes and embodied consequence. Final D natural reprise feels inevitable; risk enhances coherence rather than calling attention to itself.</comment>
