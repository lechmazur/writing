<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—dread vs resolve—are embodied in tactile micro-choices (tracing nail, murmuring stanzas). The final renunciation to stay is earned by the causal chain of deciphering the nail’s purpose, with visible cost: isolation deepens. Interiority stays concrete, but a touch of diagnostic self-awareness (“nervously confident resolve”) nicks the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the nail reweights exile from shame to honor. Causal lens holds—each stanza decoded narrows options toward the keel truth. Cost is legible in the final image (“she wouldn’t leave”). Minor orientation drift in first 120 words (who/where slightly delayed) holds because disorientation later charges the fogged station mood.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Weather station’s decay (warped doorframe, failing generator) constrains her choice to remain; the copper nail functions as micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered. Missing 9-band because environment does not physically alter the final beat—she decides to stay, but station itself doesn’t force the choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore grandfather’s honor—tightens when decoding the nail’s true purpose forecloses escape. One meaningful deepening: realizing the coffin was the keel marker. Cost is felt in the decision to endure Arctic isolation. Pressure coheres under causal lens; no reversals, but single turn suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of “honor through preservation” emerges organically from the nail’s redefinition. Subtext operates in the stanza’s double meanings and the silence between groaning ice and generator. Final image offers resonant non-literal answer: copper nail as key, not relic. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers in the screaming wind.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is textured, rhythmic, and consistent—lyric compression taught early (“spongey dread,” “verdigris-coated”). Perceptual signature is map-librarian precise yet emotionally porous. No POV leakage. Diction stays within plausible lexicon; occasional elevated phrasing (“conceptual repricing” moment) is earned by pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; every sentence advances atmosphere or plot. No loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful, though “spongey dread” and “wounded wind” flirt with excess. One mixed metaphor (“dread…like damp insulation”) slightly muddies, but clarity at closure remains intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: climate-data librarian + Arctic gothic + coded maritime poetry. Tropes (cursed nail, honor quest) are transformed through specificity of map-librarian skills and weather-station isolation. Risk in lyric density pays off; no close echoes. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
