<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas’s interiority is vivid—his storm-glass reading, calibrated humming, and memory of the derailment all reveal layered motives. The “fluidly logical” trait is dramatized through micro-adjustments of pitch and pole, not asserted. Cost is felt: he renounces fares and risks shattering the terrace to re-tune silence. Only minor reserve: the mentor’s quoted maxim edges toward convenient wisdom.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single-scene causality holds: because yesterday’s crash fractured the prisms, therefore Silas now pilots a sound-healing ritual. The closure beat—humming at 35 dB until the vial clears—delivers an Earned Stasis that forecloses further intervention tonight. Spatial/temporal anchors arrive by line 5; no orientation debt. Lens is causal throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The drifting prism terrace is not backdrop but instrument: its “thinnest” heart dictates where Silas must hum, and its glow shift confirms success. Sensory selection is POV-filtered—light hues on his hands, milky agitation in the vial. Environment constrains the final choice; meets 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: prevent a second acoustic fracture. Pressure escalates as the vial’s cloudiness spikes, forcing the calibrated hum. Agency is continuous; no coincidences resolve. Cost is the solitary vigil and the risk of catastrophic failure—visible in the prisms’ “honeyed” afterglow.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through action: silence as a living balm rather than absence. The prisms’ shift from “vaulting hush” to “cradle” reconfigures meaning without moralizing. Subtext resides in the child’s soft laugh absorbed safely—an embodied proof of success.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited remains locked to Silas’s perceptual field; no head-hopping. Syntax mirrors his precision: “fluidly logical” cadence in measured clauses. Diction is restrained, technical when needed (“35 decibels”), lyric at closure. Voice coherence survives peak pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet textured: “transient hues,” “vaulting hush,” “honeyed light” all earn their place. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Rhythm modulates with the humming crescendo. Metaphors stay coherent; no mixed vehicles.</comment>

<comment>Acoustic terraforming via gondola and storm glass is fresh, yet grounded in tactile detail. The conceit reframes trauma therapy as literal sound engineering. Risk—manipulating silence at the edge of fracture—heightens stakes without gimmickry. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
