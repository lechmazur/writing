<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Eli’s decisions—staying when Mara collapses, using the vial, trusting scent over sound—spring from a layered interiority that forecloses safer paths. His contradictions (fear vs faith, shouting vs whisper) perform in-scene, not in summary. Endpoint: he earns renunciation of noise as effective action with felt cost—silence that saves the Marigold—and the closure is anchored by character choice, not happenstance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: scent-guided turn averts shipwreck while charging the final image with crystallized cost (loss of Mara’s shout gospel, solitude in fog). Inferred lens: situational pressure crystallizes stance; the final beat reconfigures what “communication” means. Orientation holds concise: island, post-heat wave, Eli alone, decision point at line 21/42.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Cobalt walls’ damp exhale and warped lens physically constrain the final operation; fog thickness modulates visibility and thus stakes. Micro-setting—a cracked lantern and scent vial—function as tools that enable/foreclose tactics. Setting evolves: heat damage supplies reason lamp cannot blare, forcing scent maneuver. High-brand for specificity without clutter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—save the Marigold—drives every beat; scent as silent signal tightens options once shouting fails. Causal escalation: heat-damaged lens → dead horn → scent gamble → turn calamity. Mid-scene pressure rise (Ship drifts, fog thickens) forces single decisive whisper with visible cost if tactic fails.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme—love travels farthest when unheard—emerges from Eli’s earned renunciation of raised voices, reweighted by final quiet victory. Consistent subtext in scent’s nonverbal plea. Final image of cork re-corked beside warm stone offers non-literal answer: tenderness measured in withheld sound, not broadcast heroism.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature filters all detail through Eli’s synesthetic bias (scent = vibration) and compressed lyric diction. Patterned recurrence of “garden’s breath” and cork handled tactilely under pressure satisfy lyric mode taught early and closure earned.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Exceptionally tight line-level craft: varied sentence cadence mirrors calm/fog transition without loops or overwritten patches. High information density, zero scaffold paragraphs, figurative language purposeful (violets = intent concentration) and leashed. Clean mechanics; no consistency breaks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lighthouse mythos with olfactory rescue; scented rescue beacon feels inevitable post-heat-damage premise. Specific, grounded choices (warped lens blocking light, garden perfume as compass) transform familiar trope. Insistently quiet climax risks but works—assertive originality without gimmickry.</comment>
