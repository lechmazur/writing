<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael’s interiority is vivid—his “gentle radical” stance is embodied in tactile micro-choices (sifting ash, pressing the tessera). The contradiction between empathy and steel resolve is dramatized, not labeled, and the final stance crystallizes with visible social cost as the crews lower their tools. Minor slip: “cradle empathy in arms of steel” leans toward slogan, but the surrounding action redeems it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the plaza’s meaning flips from cursed ground to *Rahma al-Nasr* with undeniable conceptual cost. Causal chain holds—tessera vision → stepping-stone key → naming act stalls demolition. Lens is Causal; each beat narrows options until the renaming forecloses erasure. Cost is legible in Varr’s faltering sneer and the crews’ dropped tools.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The ash-dusted plaza, warm stones, and shattered sky are filtered through Kael’s urgency; the tessera and stepping stone act as micro-setting that literally constrain his next move. Spatial choreography is clean—east colonnade, fountain bed, torchlit dusk all track. The environment shifts from scar to threshold, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth vs. erasure—is signaled early and tightens when the vision reveals hidden mercy. One decisive turn: placing the tessera completes the script, foreclosing demolition that night. Cost is social and political; the council’s narrative of pure vengeance is undercut. Escalation is causal and sufficient for the length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of “aberrant mercy” emerges organically from the suppressed memory and the renaming act; no moralizing lecture intrudes. The final image—the plaza breathing beneath the shattered sky—reweights the entire narrative without explicit statement. Subtext in Varr’s silence and the crews’ stillness carries the conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet grounded; sensory diction (“ash-dusted,” “cool ceramic biting”) is character-specific. Compression and elision are purposeful—retrocognitive jump is taught early and paid off. No POV leakage; interior monologue stays within Kael’s lexicon. Dialogue with Varr is spare, subtextual, and advances the standoff.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers action, image, and stakes. No loops or scaffold; metaphors (“shattered sky,” “arms of steel”) are controlled and recharged at closure. Rhythm modulates with pressure—longer cadence in reflection, clipped urgency during the tessera fit. Minor elevated diction (“retrocognitively”) is justified by the speculative premise.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of retrocognition, mosaic key, and suppressed mercy feels fresh and inevitable. The plaza-as-memory-device transforms a familiar post-war reckoning into a specific, non-obvious angle. Risk in the lyric speculative mode is fully earned; closure remains legible and charged.</comment>
