<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The tutor’s silence-driven ethos is dramatized through tactile micro-choices (aligning the board, fingerprinting the dent) and a final renunciation of return; interior conflict between loyalty and beauty is embodied rather than told.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal linkage holds under the Accumulative/Textural lens: each celestial observation compresses into a charged stasis at twilight, reconfiguring exile as generative. Closure lands when the alignment reveals the covenant’s hidden clause, earned by months of silent correlation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Twilight nexus is vivid, selective, and purposeful—the magnetic hum physically vibrates in his bones, constraining where he can stand and how the board aligns. Constant sensory tether anchors who, where, and when.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Exile’s solitude tightens into a single crystallizing choice: to offer the discovered beauty instead of demanding reinstatement. The covenant breach creates escalating moral pressure that forces renunciation with visible cost.</comment>
<question>5</question>
<grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the contradiction—broken oaths versus the resilient beauty of difficult play—and is recharged in the final image of “hope in melancholy dark.” Reinforces complexity without tidy moralizing.</comment>

<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with a distinct perceptual signature: celestial bodies are read as knight paths, silence as calculus. Controlled rhythmic variation carries emotional intensity without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose shows high information density, zero loops; figurative language is selective and purposeful—“the king’s slow advance” is metaphor tethered to sunset pulse. Strong read-aloud rhythm supports quiet intensity.</comment>
<question>8</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Synthesizes chess cosmology and covenant politics in a non-obvious way; the beauty-of-difficulty ethic feels inevitable and specific. Hopeful melancholy earns its charge in the final reconfiguration.</comment>
