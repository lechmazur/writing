<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas’s grief-rooted need to feel useful is embodied in every sweep of the broom and every press of the yellow glass; the storm forces a credible, costly choice to endure rather than flee, aligning motive with action. Interiority is specific—star-dust under nails, “shattered glass” heart—yet the final beat of polishing brass with glittering knuckles crystallizes the earned stasis. Minor slip: “spiritually curious” is stated more than dramatized beyond the empathy ritual.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Silas’s decision to stay and buffer the storm reweights his vulnerability from flaw to vessel, with the dawn image of “captured constellations” on his knuckles as felt cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each sweep and meteor trace layers density until the storm’s stillness reframes the ash as sacred aftermath. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The derelict observatory, brass mounts, and chilled lantern glass constrain every move; the storm’s wind and rain physically test Silas’s stance. Micro-setting—the shard held before the eyepiece—functions as both tool and emotional lens, charging the final image. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: grit under nails, rain-lashed shutters narrowing perception to survival.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve the chronometers or preserve himself—tightens once when the storm slams the dome. Escalation is situational pressure that forces stance crystallization; Silas’s stillness amid chaos is the decisive act that forecloses retreat. Cost is the bodily risk absorbed and the dawn exhaustion legible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of strength-through-vulnerability emerges from the meteor’s yielding and Silas’s mirrored endurance; no moralizing, only the final image of star-dust glittering on broken-knuckled hands. Subtext in the yellow glass’s shift from harsh glare softener to dawn prism reweights grief into stewardship. Resonance lingers without tidy resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded: “cosmic janitor,” “ash of dead stars,” syntax mirroring the slow sweep of broom and sky. Perceptual signature is consistent—Silas notices light, entropy, and the grit that outlasts flesh. No dialogue, so no register clash; compression and patterned elision (“He cleaned to feel useful”) serve cadence and are paid off in the closing prayer-strokes.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; each sentence layers image or stakes. Occasional elevated diction (“primal elegance,” “spiritually curious”) slightly drifts from the caretaker’s lexicon but does not obscure clarity. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is selective and purposeful, culminating in the crystalline final line.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fresh angle: a caretaker of obsolete instruments who tends cosmic aftermath rather than discovery. The shard of yellow glass repurposed as empathic lens feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risk in lyric stillness pays off; no derivative echoes.</comment>
