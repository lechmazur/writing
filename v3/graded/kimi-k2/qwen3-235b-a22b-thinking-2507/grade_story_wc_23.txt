<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aris’s grief is embodied in brass seams and solder burns; contradictory impulses—cling to memory vs. build a counter-signal—co-exist in every micro-choice. The final ignition of the censer with their tears crystallizes a renunciation that costs the last relic of Elara, earning the closure under Earned Stasis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the beam reverses migration and Aris accepts perpetual exile with the censer foot now inert. Causal linkage holds—each midnight call tightens the build—until the moonless ignition reweights the premise with undeniable cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The station’s seized hydraulics and cracked dome physically constrain every move; the censer foot doubles as micro-setting that must be welded to the gyro’s spine, charging the final image when its bronze cools to “inert” yet still guides ships home.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prevent mass wreck on Black Reef—tightens as moon wanes and censer dims. One decisive escalation: weld relic to antenna, reversing migration at the cost of the last tangible memory. Agency drives every beat; coincidence only complicates.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of grief-as-navigation emerges through concrete acts: soldering memory into signal, steering through loss rather than around it. Final image of stars as “beacons, not wounds” reweights the premise without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is tactile, metallic, salted: “hands cobbled from mismatched skin grafts and polished brass.” Rhythm modulates with pressure—compressed diction under solder burns, lyrical lift at moonfall. No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every line advances craft or stakes. Occasional lyric swell (“moonlight bled through the cracked observation dome”) is earned by context. No loops, no mixed metaphors; clarity intact at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: maritime ghost-story meets maker-culture grief ritual. The censer foot as lunar compass for the dead is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Risky structure—disembodied phone oracle—pays off by crystallizing cost.</comment>
