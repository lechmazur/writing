<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—her trembling fingers, salt-crusted boots, and the “shadowed elation” that flickers between doubt and triumph. The contradiction between her dismissive mutter (“broken light means nothing”) and the visceral fear that slithers in is dramatized, not told. The final laugh that turns to relief shows earned change, though the herald’s off-page pressure keeps relationship dynamics thin.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the “broken” light refracts into stronger dawn, reweighting the premise with visible cost—Elara’s knees in salt water, the wick white-hot. Causal chain holds: storm jolts lantern → light scatters → Elara re-steers via the same physics. Lens is Causal; every beat tightens options until the horizon bleeds gold.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The emerald lighthouse, glass wick, and rain-slick dome are not backdrop but instruments: the wick’s housing angle decides success or ruin. Sensory hierarchy narrows to touch and glare under crisis; the dome’s “slick” surface later becomes the accidental mirror that saves the beam. Micro-setting (the wick as crucible) constrains the final choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—forge dawn or drown the world—faces a single, escalating test: rogue wave jars lantern, scattering light. Agency is continuous micro-adjustment; each tweak alters shadow flow. Cost is the wick’s white-hot strain and the herald’s dissolution, felt on the page. One tightening suffices; no coincidence resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the physics of brokenness: fracture as amplification, not failure. The final image—gold bleeding over water—reweights “ancient shadows” from threat to pigment. No moral is stated; the reconfiguration is conceptual and legible. Subtext in the herald’s laughter shifts from mockery to relief without exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is tactile, salt-stung, and rhythmically controlled: “shadows trailing her like loyal ghosts” crystallizes the final poise. Compression is taught early (“long after the last print newspaper”) and paid off when that silence is rendered irrelevant. No head-hop; perceptual signature stays anchored to Elara’s strained breath and flickering doubt.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “light flared, bending through the glass wick via total internal reflection” carries three jobs—action, physics, stakes—in one clause. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is sparse and precise. Rhythm accelerates under storm pressure, then exhales into the final dawn image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The fusion of lighthouse optics with mythic dawn-forging feels inevitable yet fresh; the “broken light” twist reconfigures both physics and metaphor. Risk in blending hard science with elemental magic pays off without gimmickry. Specificity of the glass wick’s angles anchors the fantastical in tactile reality.</comment>
