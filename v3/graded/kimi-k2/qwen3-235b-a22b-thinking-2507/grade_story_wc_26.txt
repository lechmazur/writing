<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—cataloging hope while unknowingly feeding the shadow—drives every micro-choice; the river-stone memory she injects is a visible, costly renunciation that forecloses the naive shared dream. Interiority is embodied in calloused fingers and the stone’s warmth, not labels. The luminous regret is earned, not stated.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the shadow’s metamorphosis reweights the premise that shared hope is unambiguously good. Causal chain—discovery of negative imprint → decision to isolate & inject memory → metamorphosis—is tight. Cost is legible in the “harder-won, solitary ember.” Lens: Causal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The blooming library, cloud-sea dusk, and petal-like shelves anchor and constrain; the river stone’s earthy scent and weight function as micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory selection is POV-filtered (spectral parchment, ink-rooted knowledge). Spatial choreography is coherent; no white-room drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve hope’s true shape—faces a single decisive tightening: the realization that fighting the shadow feeds it. Escalation is causal and visible; the cost is the forfeiture of effortless communal light. No coincidence resolves; agency drives the metamorphosis.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the concrete paradox: shared hope incubates its own negation. Subtext lives in the stone’s unshareable memory and the final “ascending pollen” image. No moralizing; the ending’s silver light reweights the premise with conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Voice is distinct—lyric compression, tactile diction (“spectral parchment,” “ink-rooted knowledge”)—and remains stable under pressure. Perceptual signature is sharp-eyed dusk noticer: selective noticing of light shifts, negative space. No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates with emotional intensity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</question>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative language is purposeful, never purple. No loops or scaffold; rhythm varies naturally. “Metamorphose” used once, correctly. Final image crystallizes without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</question>
<comment>The premise—shared dreams as weather—feels fresh, and the inversion that hope itself breeds shadow is non-obvious. Specificity (spectral parchment, cloud-sea dusk) prevents generic drift. The metamorphosis twist is inevitable in hindsight yet surprising, grounded in prior particulars.</comment>
