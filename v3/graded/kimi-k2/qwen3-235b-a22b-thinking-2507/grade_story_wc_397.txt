<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—seeking death yet laboring to hear endings—are embodied in the shovel’s scrape and the parasol’s sting; the final stance crystallizes with felt cost as she trades escape for presence. Interiority is specific, never diagnostic. The fold in patience bends rather than breaks, earning the earned stasis of listening without flinching.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each beat layers sensory density until the glacier’s sigh reweights the stake. Closure is a Charged Poise—she stands listening, options reconfigured, cost legible in the parasol tip against her palm. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina is not backdrop but instrument: the groaning ice, windborne solace, and parasol’s incongruity constrain every choice. Micro-setting (parasol tip) charges the final image. Sensory selection narrows under crisis, then widens to the distant glacier, all filtered through Elara’s loosened grip on reality.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—learning the sound of endings—tightens once when the crack beneath her feet reveals she was already inside the ending. Agency is attention, not escape; the cost is the surrender of her timeline. Escalation is textural: density of sound and ice until the glacier’s sigh reweights everything.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the tension between waiting and listening; no moral is stated. The parasol’s reprise and the glacier’s sigh offer a resonant, non-literal answer: endings are not to be fled but inhabited. Subtext hums in the ice’s groan and the wind’s solace.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded; perceptual signature is Elara’s loosened reality—edges blur, whispers echo. Syntax mirrors her wavering focus, then steadies as she listens. No head-hopping; compression and elision are taught early and paid off in the final vibration.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet clear; figurative language is selective and purposeful. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances. The final image—“a high, pure vibration in the ice”—lands with crystalline precision.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The euthanasia-tourist premise is transformed through Arctic disaster relief and the parasol’s surreal return. Risk-taking (loosened reality, glacier’s sigh as closure) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Specificity anchors universals; the story could not swap settings without collapse.</comment>
