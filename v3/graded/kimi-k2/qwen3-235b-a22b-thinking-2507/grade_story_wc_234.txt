<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s internal contradiction (desire to bottle grief vs awakened understanding that presence > capture) is embodied and coherent, but the pivot feels marginally abrupt due to compressed interiority near the climax, and Kael’s function is mostly expository without added status pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure is cleanly delivered: Elara caps the vial and surrenders capture, accepting un-bottled grief as shared weight. Causal linkage from failed experiment → revised epistemology is explicit and carries felt cost in Kael’s tremor and their shared shoulder warmth.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Tactile specificity of ember nexus, obsidian seat, cinder glows constrains their stance and pacing; the nautilus shell’s evolving texture charges the final transfer of grief. Spatial anchors arrive within first 120 wds; caldera heat keeps decision pressure live.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Single dominant stake—capture the moment—tightens when the attempt backfires, foreclosing alchemy as a way forward. Cost is visceral (Kael’s whisper, shell’s useless vibration). Escalation is modest but sufficient for the length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through images rather than assertion: the failure of glass stars vs the sufficiency of living contact. Moment-to-moment sensory detail reweights the notion of “eternity” without overt lessonizing.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is textured and consistent—scientific-meets-romantic diction that matches Elara’s POV (density, logarithmic) yet collapses into raw hush when Kael speaks. Prose rhythm breathes with scene pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Affecting line-level rhythm, compact metaphors, and purposeful information density. Occasional near-purple flourishes (“microature stars humming against her ribs”) flirt with excess but never obscure action.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Grieving alchemist confronting death with an unoriginal trope is rescued by specific object logic (nautilus as light funnel) and the reframing of alchemy into an ethics of presence rather than capture. The inversion feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
