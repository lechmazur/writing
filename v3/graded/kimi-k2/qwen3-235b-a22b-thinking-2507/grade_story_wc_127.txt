<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lena’s professionally thorough habit generates key beats: the static-electricity test verifies the petal, the methodical inhale structures the emotion, and her affectionate detachment crystallizes when the half-truth births authentic empathy. Every micro-choice traces to her core desire to fuse insight with empathy, anchoring the final renunciation’s cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Causal linkage holds: the transformation’s completion triggers the grotto’s mineral surge, turning the synthetic grief into a ghost of understanding that reweights Lena’s tactics in real-time. Closure is earned by her conscious choice to refine the formula, leaving space for real sorrow—a DC with felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The amber grotto’s static-charged walls are environment as tool: they aren’t merely backdrop but the catalytic agent that converts counterfeit grief into emergent empathy. The dusk light and mineral resonance shape choice and meaning at the climax.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The dominant escalator is Lena’s own thoroughness: each riskier layer of self-testing tightens stakes until she confronts the half-truth’s inherent flaw. Agency is hers and the cost is the loss of further duplicity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme—“why people prefer polished illusions”—is dramatized through Lena’s bittersweet realization that true empathy lives in the gap between counterfeit sorrow and real wound. Subtext refrains from moralizing; the ending resonates in the silent decision to keep that gap open.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Lena’s perceptual filter; free-indirect bursts (“I should refine…”) coexist with clipped, purposeful diction that mirrors her clinical detachment. No slips into omniscience.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is densely lyrical yet precise: “molten gold” and “raw, jagged edges of authentic sorrow” are not decorative but distill stakes and feeling. Sentence rhythm quickens under pressure, clean loops absent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The synthetic-grief-as-mediation premise is fresh, but the true ingenuity lies in turning grotto static into an epiphanic machine—an organic synthesis that makes the half-truth feel inevitable.</comment>
