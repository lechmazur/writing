<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Maya’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her trembling hands, the grit on her cast, the seashell’s warmth—yet the “vulnerability is power” epiphany edges toward therapeutic summary rather than dramatized contradiction. The micro-choice to film the confession is earned, but the prior beat of decoding the cipher feels slightly convenient, blunting the flaw-driven struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each beat (cipher discovery → decoding → filming) tightens options under the midnight deadline. Closure lands as a Decisive Change—Maya’s public accusation—with the felt cost of irrevocably burning her bridge to Lena and the studio. The rusted library anchors time and place early; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The rusted library’s skeletal shelves and indigo sky create a charged micro-setting that mirrors Maya’s broken state; moonlight on cracked marble literally guides her to center stage for the recording. While evocative, the setting doesn’t physically constrain her choices—she could have filmed anywhere—so it charges atmosphere more than tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove sabotage and reclaim agency—escalates through each beat: blurred cast → decoded proof → filmed accusation. The tightening is causal and irreversible; the cost (career suicide if disbelieved) is legible on the page. One meaningful turn suffices and lands.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: brokenness as weaponized truth. The seashell’s whisper and the smudged cast reweight from childish comfort to evidentiary lynchpin. Final image of “trembling felt like strength” avoids moralizing, letting resonance linger.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is tactile and specific—“rusted library groaned,” “cast smudged with childish scribbles”—with rhythmic control under stress. Compression (“Tide turns at midnight”) teaches the cipher pattern early and pays off cleanly. No POV leakage; interior monologue stays within Maya’s lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is selective and purposeful. Minor loop risk in repeated “trembling” and “whisper,” but momentum never stalls. No mixed metaphors or register drift; final paragraph crystallizes without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Familiar revenge arc is refreshed through stunt-double subculture and child-code decryption. The seashell-cipher fusion feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risk-taking (aquaphobic stuntwoman weaponizing water-damaged evidence) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
