<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictions feel lived—her chains both prison and anchor, her patience versus the pounding wall. The embodied drive to plant seeds for a future she may never see powers every micro-choice with concrete stakes, culminating in a credible and costly renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The narrative thread tightens relentlessly: every beat (arrow-alignment, piano keys, counter-drawer, planted seed) is driven by “because/therefore” causality under siege. Closure lands as Earned Stasis—her body shields the last seed as the vault collaps—cost felt and irreversible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The carnival’s skeletal prizes and crumbling skylights are no mere backdrop; the broken piano bench, ticking wall collapse, and scorched earth all constrain and time Elara’s choices. The final collapse reprises the rusted counter in ruin, locking setting to closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible from first sentence: seeds must survive the siege. Pressure sharpens with every mortar burst until the ceiling beam crashes. Each beat—chain drag, spectral alignment, planting—narrows the path and raises the price. Agency exacts an unstinting physical cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Resilience blooms quietly from particulars: beetle-fletching, drought-resistant barley, jewel beetles extinct just as hope is. No moralizing coda is offered; the final scent of rain re-prices loss and survival alike.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vibrant sensorium (“dust motes danced,” “smoke and surrender”) and rhythmic compression under siege retain distinctive cadence throughout. One minor “shattered” echoed too closely knocks 0.1, but controlled voice and clean POV hold.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Laser-tight sentences; figurative language serves not decorates (“showering her in debris”). Zero synonym loops, no register drift, seamless prop tracking. Occasional soft filter “tasted of smoke” is fleeting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade>
<comment>Post-apocalyptic gardener in carnival crypt—synthesis is both obvious and utterly fresh. The extinction-fletched arrow re-appears as trowel, re-authoring its purpose with a quiet turn that feels inevitable only in hindsight.
