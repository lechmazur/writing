<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is textured and embodied; the amber pendant’s shift from chain to bridge is dramatized through micro-choice. The final gesture with Mara crystallizes a credible renunciation with felt cost. Minor slip: “fossilized in resin” edges toward label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of drip-formed circles reweights the viral-shame stake, culminating in Charged Poise when Elara proffers the pendant. Orientation anchored early; closure beat lands on page with visible emotional cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Moss-draped server racks and honeyed hush are selective, sensory, and constrain Elara’s refuge; the pendant and drip pattern act as micro-settings that charge the final image. No spatial drift; environment guides choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—shame transformed—tightens once via the fractal pattern revelation; Elara’s agency drives the proffering beat. Cost is legible but could be sharper; still meets single-turn escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of broken beauty emerges organically from moss, drip circles, and pendant; final image reframes shame without moralizing. Subtext in Mara’s silent return of the pendant deepens resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct lyric texture—“honeyed hush,” “emerald velvet”—remains consistent under pressure. POV stable; no head-hop. Dialogue minimal but subtextual when it appears.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language disciplined to pattern. One paraphrase loop (“honeyed hush” twice in close proximity) nicks perfection. No artifacts in closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Post-digital moss garden and viral-shame crucible feel fresh; transformation of server racks into living sanctuary is specific and inevitable. Risky lyric mode pays off without obscuring clarity.</comment>
