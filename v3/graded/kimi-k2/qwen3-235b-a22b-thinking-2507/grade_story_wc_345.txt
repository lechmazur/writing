<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Kael’s desperation and flicker of hope are embodied in frost-scraping and hammering heartbeats; his final micro-choice to rally the colony is credible. The ghost’s motivation remains abstract, but its “strangely trustworthy” aura is dramatized through Kael’s visceral response. Secondary characters are sketched rather than crucible-tested, yet the collective shift from strangers to family is felt in the communal labor. Cost is visible in calloused hands and exhaustion.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each ghost message tightens options (check junction → share ration → dig here). Closure is a Decisive Change—water gushes, stakes pivot from death to life—with collective cost in spent bodies. Orientation is swift; no teleporting props. Minor ellipsis in how survey logs suddenly matter, but the beat lands.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Frost, nebula light, and floating rock arches are selective, sensory, and tied to mood. The orchard’s bedrock becomes a tactile constraint once the fissure is probed. Final image of nebula light pooling in water recharges the setting with conceptual cost. No object or micro-setting constrains a final choice, capping at 8.8 gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—survival against drought—signaled in paragraph one. Escalation is single but meaningful: each chalk message narrows tactics until the last forces a literal dig. Agency is collective yet driven by Kael’s relay; luck complicates but does not solve. Felt cost in exhaustion and shared labor.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme of communal salvation emerges through action, not sermon: strangers become family by answering the ghost’s silent call. The nebula’s “respite” shifts from distant promise to literal water, a resonant reweighting. No overt moralizing; ambiguity lingers in the ghost’s disappearance. Hope is brambled—painful yet persistent—echoed in the blooming metaphor.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Kael’s sensory filter; diction is spare, cold, urgent. No dialogue, so voice is carried by rhythmic compression and selective detail. Occasional lyric lift (“nebula made manifest”) is earned by prior grounding. No POV leakage or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and propulsive; no loops or scaffold. Metaphors are sparse and purposeful (“hope like brambles”). Sentence lengths vary with urgency. Minor filter verb (“seemed to pool”) does not stall momentum. Clean grammar and spatial tracking.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Familiar tropes—ghost guide, dying colony—are refreshed by the orchard planet’s floating arches and the nebula-water fusion. The chalk-message mechanic is simple yet non-obvious. Emotional specificity in communal labor lifts the piece above template. Risk is moderate but coherent.</comment>
