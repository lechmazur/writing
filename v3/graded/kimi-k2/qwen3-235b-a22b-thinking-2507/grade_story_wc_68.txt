<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Phil’s “rationally rebellious” stance is embodied in the tactile spoon-work and the silent confrontation with Kael; the interior contradiction between preservation and futility is palpable. Yet the final beat feels more posture than choice—he places the cog back but no new option is foreclosed, so the cost is muted.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Single-scene, single-POV default met; causal lens holds as each scrape of silt tightens the argument against Kael’s myth. Closure is a Charged Poise: Phil’s refusal to yield crystallizes the stakes and reconfigures the social cost, though the physical cost is only implied.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The flooded sewer’s layered silt is not backdrop but forensic tool; the lantern beam, brass teeth, and spoon all constrain Phil’s tactics and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; the trench wall’s strata are tracked without drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—truth versus myth—signaled early and tightened when Kael kicks silt into the trench. One meaningful deepening: the sediment layers visibly narrow Kael’s certainty. Cost is social (Kael’s retreat) rather than personal, keeping it just shy of 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically from the sediment and cog: knowledge versus narrative convenience. Subtext in Kael’s glance at the trench wall carries the weight. Final image reframes the ruins as navigable or lethal depending on which story prevails—resonant without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is precise, slightly archaic, filtered through Phil’s drowned-library erudition; perceptual signature is consistent. Dialogue is spare but carries subtext (“Keep your ghosts”). No head-hopping; distance remains steady.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information yield per line. Occasional near-repetition (“rationally rebellious” twice) is minor. Metaphors stay coherent; no loops or scaffold intrude on the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Flooded post-plague sewer archaeology feels fresh; the chronometer cog as forensic instrument rather than ornament is a sharp inflection. Tropes of drowned worlds and knowledge keepers are transformed through Phil’s obsessive stratigraphy.</comment>
