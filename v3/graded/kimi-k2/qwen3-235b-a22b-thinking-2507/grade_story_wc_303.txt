<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid, rooted in Elara’s plant-telepathy and research past, driving every beat. Renunciation yields earned stasis, but secondary characters (General Vorlag) remain off-page agents rather than crucible, damping relational pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Situational lens holds: coherent pressure from approaching troops and a tight celestial clock force stance crystallization. Closure is Charged Poise—“a future she’d propagated in time”—with felt opportunity cost as Elara releases the violin; no teleporting props or causal holes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Velvet observatory, refracting crystal violin, and midsummer garden all anchor cleanly and affect tactics (propagation site, moon phase, hiding place). However, garden spatial choreography during bloom-severing is lightly abstract, keeping environmental constraint from fully clinching a higher band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve dream vs. empire) is explicit and tightens through clock and troop threats. Propagation succeeds but yields tangible cost (violin taken)—a narrowing of options—but escalation relies more on external deadline beats than an on-page confrontation, holding score mid-high.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</question><comment>Theme of destiny as cultivation rather than possession emerges organically through seed imagery and renunciation. Final garden image “pulse beneath the soil” reweights dream without moralizing; mulberry ache threads nicely, yet theme is more signaled than interrogated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical, compressed yet legible. Distinct POV bias in botanical telepathy (“the cereus shrieked of root rot”) and sensory specificity reads individual. Near-perfect control under pressure; only minor drift into elevated poetic cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</question><comment>Rhythm breathes with scene urgency; sentences advance without scaffold. Selective metaphors (“humid midsummer night”, “snowflake on a sword’s edge”) serve pacing. Occasional stacked images in garden sequence are slightly dense but do not blur causality at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Familiar tropes (magic violin, telepathy, botanical solution) are made fresh via provenance-research POV and propagation metaphor. Specificity (ice crystal, Starlight Bloom) outweighs derivativeness, but invention is incremental rather than seismic.</comment>
