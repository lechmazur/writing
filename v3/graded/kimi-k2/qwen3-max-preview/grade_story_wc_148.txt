<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The son’s motivation—threading his own story before discovery—drives every beat; the embodied dread in “palms slick against the rust” and the kneel to the first spectral hand crystallize his arc. Interiority stays concrete, but the father’s “noose of mistrust” is asserted more than dramatized, trimming depth. Closure choice—sealing truth into the lens—carries visible cost and earned renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the beam reframed to carry voices forever, with the boy’s spent slump as felt cost. Causal chain (lattice → fracture light → summon witnesses → seal truth) is tight; no teleporting props. Orientation is immediate; lighthouse geography holds across climbs and landings.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The lighthouse’s salt, rust, and copperlight repose constrain every move; the lattice-as-micro-setting literally alters the lens mechanism. Sensory selection narrows under urgency—“wind gnawed,” “brine and candle wax”—anchoring POV. Final image of the beam folding space recharges the setting as active agent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth versus erasure—tightens when the lattice’s impossible light forecloses denial; the boy’s agency drives escalation. Cost is visible: spectral chorus absorbed, body slumped, reputation doomed. No coincidence resolves; pressure coils until the beam’s reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of silenced truth becoming luminous emerges through action, never sermon; the lattice’s final glow reweights the premise without a moral tag. Subtext hums in “copperlight repose” shifting from menace to benediction. Resonant ambiguity lingers—madness or miracle—earned by concrete struggle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise—“time itself hesitated”—with rhythmic control that accelerates up the stairs and exhales at the end. Perceptual signature is consistent: the boy notices salt, rust, and trapped breath, not tourist details. No head-hopping; interior texture coherent under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, propulsive, and loop-free; each sentence layers image and stakes. Figurative language (“folding space like origami”) is apt and brief. Occasional elevated diction (“crystallized final moment”) stays within the mythic register taught early. No artifacts touch closure.</comment>

<comment>Folklore inversion—cry-wolf lineage weaponized for truth—feels inevitable yet fresh. The lattice repurposed as truth-engine is a non-obvious synthesis that grows from prior particulars. Risky lyric structure pays off in the final reconfiguration.</comment>
