<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is richly embodied (“bones as tuning forks, lungs as bellows”), but the final reversal hinges on an external recording rather than an interior choice; cost is felt yet not fully earned by prior contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing—identity rewritten with visible cost (“the self she had been denied”); causal lens holds from cylinder insertion to irrevocable walk; one smooth transition from archive to clocktower.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Sepia reading room is micro-mapped—mahogany table, brass teeth, yellowed spines—each object constrains motion; the gramophone itself becomes the final pivot, charging the exit.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake (truth vs dynasty) tightens when personal identity eclipses political ruin; agency is exercised in the deliberate turn of the crank; cost is the forfeiture of her assumed self.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of silence as both weapon and inheritance emerges through image (gramophone) and action (listening louder); final reweighting of “heir” vs “ender” offers resonant ambiguity without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct—lyric, tactile, and disciplined; perceptual signature (“sepia,” “bruised violet”) remains coherent; no head-hopping; compression taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; metaphors (“golden shadows pooled like spilled honey”) are selective and purposeful; zero loops or scaffold; cadence accelerates with crank turns.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of dynastic thriller and acoustic mysticism; the gramophone as confessional oracle transforms familiar tropes; risk is high but clarity intact.</comment>
