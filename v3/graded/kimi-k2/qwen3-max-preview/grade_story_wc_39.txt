<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical yet grounded in embodied ritual (jar-capture, cork-wax sealing); the poet’s contradictory impulses—self-erasure vs. generational bridge—surface in the silent gift-giving. Motivation intensifies from survival to redemption via the music-box repair, a micro-choice that visibly costs his solitude. Final renunciation (leaving the loft and legacy) is earned by prior causal chain. Minor: we never witness a genuine mistake that compounds, keeping him slightly too competent for full 9+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the poet’s disappearance crystallizes the stakes—continuity over authorship—felt in the girl’s clutching the jar. Causal linkage holds: each jar uncorked for the music box tightens the thematic gear until the final gift forecloses his presence. Cost is legible in the empty loft that “hummed when the wind blew just right.” No orientation drift; mosaic shards are legible and cohere under Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Salt-wind, dunes, and loft are vivid but selective; the loft’s “feral” decay and the music box’s brass tarnish constrain repair choices. Micro-setting (glass jars as sonic reliquaries) functions as both tool and shrine, charging the final image. Weather (ice-groaning dunes) tightens the last dawn’s urgency. Missing one deeper sensory anchor—smell of wax or rust—to hit 9+.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—becoming translator—escalates through each jar exchange; the music-box revival is the decisive tightening that proves the method and raises the cost of anonymity. Pressure remains coherent under Accumulative lens: every captured sound increases communal claim on him. Final disappearance is renunciation with felt cost. Could be sharper if one jar failed to work, forcing adaptation.</comment>

<comment>Theme of gleaned redemption emerges from tactile ritual rather than statement; the poem on the wall is meta-commentary but framed as artifact, not sermon. Subtext in doorstep gifts—“they didn’t know who sent them”—carries generational longing without exposition. Final image reweights prior motifs: silence translated into song, absence into presence. Avoids tidy moral; ambiguity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Lyrical third-person limited sustains salt-stung diction and rhythmic cadence; perceptual signature notices “threadbare quilt,” “spidery script.” No head-hopping; POV distance stable. Compression (“gleaned from wreckage… silence… heartbeats”) is taught early and paid off. Dialogue minimal but voice-specific when child speaks.</comment>

<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language disciplined to jar, loft, dunes. No loops or scaffold; sentences vary in length and stress. Occasional elevated diction (“sonic reliquaries”) fits the elevated ritual register. One mixed metaphor—“meaning pools like tide-water in hollows”—barely grazes clarity, not enough to mar closure.</comment>

<comment>Premise of bottling sounds for intergenerational translation is fresh and fully committed; no prior template matches. Transformation test: cannot swap jars for any other object without breaking causal logic. Risky lyric structure pays off in resonant closure. Specificity of “First Light Over Dune Seven” etches memory.</comment>
