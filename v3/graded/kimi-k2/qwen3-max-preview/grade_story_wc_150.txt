<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is textured through soil under nails, root-cradled wrists, and the whispered “Show me what you measured,” all anchoring her contradictory need to both listen and re-orient. The arc from cautious enchantment to weeping at the chime is embodied, not labeled, and the cost—permanent exile from diaspora into orchard custodian—lands with the roots that cradle her like a returned child. No stock phrasing; every micro-choice (trowel, brushing moss, fitting the final stone) externalizes the hierarchy of values. The only slip is a hairline moment of overt thematic self-diagnosis in “Faith, she understood…,” but it is brief and does not rupture the prior causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the sundial’s shadow realigns, petals fall clockwise, the orchard exhales a bone-chime, and diaspora ends in rooted stasis—cost is the life-path foreclosed. Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout: each artifact (toy, blade, locket) layers density until the final cadence shift reweights communal time. Orientation is taught early via gnarled roots threading femurs; no teleporting props or retroactive patches. The final image crystallizes options without explanatory filler, satisfying the 9+ cost-proof test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard is not backdrop but antagonist-ally: roots steady Elara’s wrists, petals fall upward against gravity, the dial’s misalignment mirrors spiritual drift. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—she smells damp loam before she sees quartz, attention guided by purposeful wandering. Micro-setting (sundial base, ancestor stones) constrains the final choice of re-orientation. Spatial choreography is immaculate; no floating bones or drifting niches.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore communal faith by re-orienting time—is signaled at the sundial whisper. Escalation is textural: each unearthed artifact thickens the pattern until the final stone forces the decisive crystallization. No external antagonist needed; pressure is orchard-remembered vs. diaspora-forgotten. Cost is visible: she forfeits onward travel, sleeps rooted, villagers’ songs now tethered to her stillness.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of exile: diaspora ends not in return to house or flag but in tending a shadow-cast of time itself. The sundial’s re-pricing of faith as daily rhythm, not monument, is shown through petals spiraling clockwise—no moralizing sentence distills it. Subtext resides in the orchard’s gentle root-curl: approval offered only to reverence, not demand. Final image of “shadow cast anew each dawn” reweights all prior burials into germination without stating thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays latched to Elara’s perceptual filter—erosion-scoured glyphs, scent of damp loam, root-cradled wrists—no head-hop. Syntax lengthens in calmer digs, compresses at the chime beat, mirroring cardiac rise. No dialogue, so voice carries entirely through textured, character-bound diction: “soil from three continents beneath her nails.” The lyric pattern (petals upward → downward spiral) is taught early and paid off at closure without obscuring causality.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative vehicles stay coherent: roots as fingers, time as bent root, petals as clock-hands. Information density is high—“locket holding a pressed forget-me-not” does genealogical, emotional, and temporal work in eight words. No mixed metaphors or register drift; final chime sentence is short, percussive, earned.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: diaspora return grafted onto ossuary orchard, faith restored via shadow rather than soil. The inversion of petals falling upward then clockwise is a specific, non-obvious image that feels inevitable once sprung. Risk is taken with quiet magic—roots cradle wrists, orchard exhales—yet world-rules remain consistent. Slight proximity to “bones blooming” trope keeps it just sub-9.</comment>
