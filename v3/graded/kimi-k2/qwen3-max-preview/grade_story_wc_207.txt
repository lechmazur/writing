<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elira’s eccentricity is shown through tactile choices—tasting lagoon water, leaving the compass—yet her interiority occasionally drifts into abstract self-analysis (“rewrites her sense of scale”) that softens contradiction. The final renunciation is earned, but the cost is more atmospheric than embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elira steps into the passage, the stone “sighs,” and the way seals—an irreversible reconfiguration with felt cost. Causality holds under Accumulative/Textural lens; each sensory intensification tightens the stake until surrender is the only option.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The lagoon’s black water and breathing limestone constrain every choice; the compass’s final resting place on the shelf crystallizes the ending. Sensory selection is ruthless—petrichor as memory, inverted constellations—guiding action rather than decorating it.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—finding where explanations fail—is signaled early and tightens through each sensory hinge; the final step into the passage forecloses escape. Agency is renunciation rather than conquest, with the cost legible in the sealing stone.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the tension between rational mapping and sensory surrender; the compass’s inversion from north to “moments of surrender” reweights the premise without moralizing. Final image of the stone eyelid offers resonant, non-literal closure.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet disciplined: “petrichor distilled, the breath of earth remembering its own becoming.” Perceptual signature remains consistent; no head-hopping. Compression and elision are taught early and paid off in the final hush.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and propulsive; figurative language is selective and purposeful. No loops or scaffold. Minor register drift in “psychometry read” (noun-as-verb) is voice-motivated and legible.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The petrichor collector descending into a breathing stone world feels inevitable yet fresh; the compass pointing toward surrender rather than north is a non-obvious synthesis. Risk-taking in sensory epistemology heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
