<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is textured and embodied; the chronicler’s tactile attention to tide and cicada reveals her stance. The final shared silence crystallizes a micro-choice—presence over resolution—earning cost without tidy epiphany. Motivation (“texture of time”) remains abstract, slightly blunting stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory shard layers the central stake until the closing pause reconfigures the couple’s options. Closure is a Charged Poise—the held breath before speech—whose cost is the foreclosed certainty of either leaving or staying. Orientation and causality remain intact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Grotto’s wet stone, dripping stalactites, and starlit pool are not backdrop but instruments: the chill water climbing her wrist and the cicada’s star-caught curve constrain the final stillness. Micro-setting (jade cicada as pocketed compass) charges the ending image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: can love survive migration? Pressure tightens through silence rather than argument; the pause itself becomes the crucible. One meaningful deepening—the shared inhalation—narrows options to “not tonight,” with felt relational cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of transition emerges through texture, not thesis: cicada, tide, and held breath all enact thresholds. Final image reweights earlier motifs without moralizing, inviting reader to feel the granular cost of liminal time.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet disciplined, with rhythmic variation matching tidal cadence. Perceptual signature—salt scent, barnacle tremor—remains consistent and character-bound. No head-hopping; companion’s interiority is implied through gesture and silence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers texture without redundancy. Metaphors (moonlight as memory shards) are precise and purposeful. Zero loops or scaffold; final line lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Familiar elements—tidal meditation, lovers’ pause—are transformed through sensory specificity and the cicada’s granular metaphor. Risk lies in quietness; it pays off in resonant, non-literal closure.</comment>
