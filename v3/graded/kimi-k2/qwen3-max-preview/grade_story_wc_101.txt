<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elira’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“thumb worn smooth by decades of prayer and protest”), but the story withholds her contradictions; her motives are stated rather than dramatized in tension. The final renunciation—passing the bell without claiming credit—earns its cost, yet we never see her wrestle with the temptation to reveal herself.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each midnight run layers pattern until the bell’s single ring crystallizes the covenant. Closure is a Charged Poise—the ridge’s future is reconfigured without a single shouted slogan, and the cost (perpetual anonymity, endless labor) is felt in the final image of Elira walking back into the dark.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The terra-cotta arbor is more than backdrop; its cracked tiles and frost feathering constrain every basket carried and every breath taken. The bell’s placement on the stone table recharges the setting at closure, making the ridge itself the archive of memory and promise.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—intergenerational survival under sanctions—tightens through scarcity and the risk of exposure. Each heavier basket and new coin in dough marks escalating cost; the final bell-ring is agency crystallized, not coincidence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete acts: anonymity as covenant, not secrecy. The final image of the bell waiting for “a successor” reweights every prior delivery into a non-literal answer: solidarity outlasts regimes. No moralizing intrudes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet grounded in tactile detail (“rustle of cloth-wrapped loaves”). The collective “we” in the final paragraph is earned, not head-hopped; compression and patterned elision (“Not here. Not while…”) teach the rhythm early and pay off in the bell’s single note.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; every sentence layers texture without loops. Metaphors are precise (“frost feathered the ridge”) and never muddle causality. Minor scaffold in the sanctions exposition is strategic and brief.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The premise—anonymous mutual aid as insurgent memory—feels fresh because the ridge’s specific rituals (reed baskets, silver coin in dough) transform familiar tropes. The bell’s evolution from relic to relay baton is inevitable in hindsight yet non-obvious.</comment>
