<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and specific—his “frugal” trait is embodied in selling his cloak for lamp oil and eating barley cakes. Contradictory impulses (rationalist vs devotee) coexist in scene, culminating in the tremor of recognition that costs him comfort. The final renunciation—no fame, only the tile’s quiet charge—earns its cost through prior causal chain. Minor slip: “empirically ironic” is asserted rather than dramatized in a single beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the astronomer’s “Confirmed” crystallizes a stance that forecloses worldly ambition. Causal lens holds—each schematic line is a because/therefore step toward the resonant frequency. Cost is legible in forfeited cloak, bread, and anonymity. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Cracked ziggurat terrace, chalk dust on obsidian, bronze door—each detail is filtered through the astronomer’s priorities and constrains his movement. The palace’s “memory of incense and war cries” mirrors his internal austerity vs grandeur tension. Micro-setting (tile on dais) charges the final image. No spatial contradictions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—sealing the covenant—tightens when the tile hums and options narrow to “note the wavelength or not.” Escalation is accumulative: each chalk line adds density until the harmonic moment. Cost is visible in bodily tremor and material privation. No external antagonist needed; pressure is situational and internal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the friction between rational measurement and wordless devotion. Subtext resides in silence, chalk dust, and the neutron-star pulse of unseen value. Final image reweights prior material: devotion encrypted in arithmetic becomes the palace’s buried heartbeat. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is precise, ascetic, yet lyric—syntax mirrors the astronomer’s patient exactitude. Perceptual signature is mathematically sensuous: “constellations mapped not in stars but in silence.” No dialogue; internal monologue stays within lexicon of ratios and angles. Patterned repetition (“empirically ironic”) is intentional and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet aerated: “time slowed like syrup under moonlight” compresses atmosphere and stakes. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or pressure. Metaphors are coherent and physics-respecting. Occasional elevated diction (“celestial mechanics”) is justified by POV expertise.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fusion of Babylonian ziggurat, magic square, and radio astronomy feels inevitable yet fresh. Devotion-through-equation reframes mysticism as undiscovered physics without gimmickry. Specificity—blind monks grinding lenses—anchors the premise. Risk in blending genres pays off in resonant closure.</comment>
