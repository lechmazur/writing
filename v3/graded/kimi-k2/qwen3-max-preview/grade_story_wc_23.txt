<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The navigator’s moon-phase physiology is embodied (joints stiffen, thoughts sharpen) and directly constrains her midnight calls; her choice to “wait, listen, build” under waning moon shows earned restraint with visible cost—she once walked into static and still bears ringing ears. Interiority is concrete, never diagnostic; her tactile ritual with the censer foot anchors motive and memory. The final stance—singing coordinates into wind—crystallizes her values without tidy resolution. Minor: no second on-page character, so relationship crucible not tested.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: atop the gantry she sings coordinates that “carry them… to absences,” reconfiguring the station’s purpose from abandonment to resonance. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each midnight call adds a thread until the tapestry reweights loss as orientation. Cost is legible: she forfeits mechanical certainty for moon-tuned intuition. Orientation is anchored by word 40; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The rusted gantry, broken dish array, and silt-buried censer foot are not backdrop but tools—the bronze foot’s ghost-hum vibrates up her arm and settles behind her sternum, charging the final image. Sensory selection (diesel-choked jasmine, weeping gate) filters through her grief-sharpened attention. Micro-setting (the censer foot) constrains her timing and anchors the reverse migration ritual. Spatial choreography remains clean across the single scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: to reassemble orientation after the station’s surrender to entropy. Pressure tightens when moon-phase physiology forbids ill-timed calls; each midnight dial adds a thread until the final gantry song forecloses mechanical navigation forever. Agency is renunciation—she chooses resonance over repair, paying with permanent uncertainty. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the concrete ritual: loss is not erased but mapped as faithfully as presence. The reverse migration—seepage of echoes rather than resurrection—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to grief without moralizing. Subtext lives in static lullabies and bronze hums. Final image reweights the premise: abandonment becomes recalibration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; perceptual signature (“patina bronze censer foot like a rosary of forgotten altars”) fuses tactile devotion with cosmic scale. Rhythm modulates with moon phases—compressed during waning, expansive at full. No dialogue, so no register clash; internal texture stays coherent. Patterned elision (“not resurrection. Resonance.”) is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; every sentence layers image, memory, and motion. Figurative language is selective—no mixed metaphors in peak beats. Occasional alliterative cadence (“seepage… seeping-back”) serves ritual pulse rather than ornament. Zero loops or scaffold; high information density without clarity loss.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise—navigator tuned by moon phases charting the inward tide of loss—feels fresh yet inevitable. Tropes (abandoned station, midnight calls) are transformed through embodied ritual and bronze memory. Specificity (diesel-choked jasmine, broken sundial) grounds the cosmic frame. Final reconfiguration of coordinates from numbers to scent/shadow crystallizes originality.</comment>
