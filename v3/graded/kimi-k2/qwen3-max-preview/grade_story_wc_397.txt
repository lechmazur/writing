<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—curiosity vs. surrender—are embodied in her tactile use of the parasol tip; the final renunciation of euthanasia is earned by the prior listening arc and carries visible cost in her changed stance. Interiority is specific, never diagnostic. Minor slip: “terminally curious” flirts with label-speak but is immediately dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the glacier’s sigh reweights her quest from seeking death’s sound to hearing transition’s music. Causal chain (fall → chime → shelf collapse → drift) is tight; cost is the swallowed marina and her solitary floe. Lens holds as Accumulative/Textural throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The drift-ice marina is not backdrop but instrument: groaning hulls, black ice, calving bergs all constrain movement and supply the acoustic revelation. The parasol tip functions as micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“learn the sound of endings”—tightens when the glacier’s collapse forces a stance crystallization: she chooses transition over termination. Pressure escalates via the audible shear; coincidence (slip on ice) complicates but does not resolve. Cost is the lost marina and forfeited euthanasia path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: endings are thresholds, not termini. The glacier’s maternal hum and unraveling lace reconfigure the premise without moralizing. Final image of humming atop shrinking ice offers non-literal, resonant answer to the central question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; perceptual signature (“gripping reality loosely”) colors every observation. Compression and patterned elision (“sound of lace unraveling thread by thread”) are taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates with pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, propulsive, and read-aloud musical. Figurative language is selective; no mixed metaphors or loops. Sentence rhythm mirrors the creak-and-sigh soundscape. Minor scaffold in “salt and surrender” phrase is outweighed by overall control.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—“euthanasia tourist seeking acoustic death”—is fresh and fully committed. Glacier as maternal lullaby transforms familiar eco-catastrophe into intimate metaphysical reckoning. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
