<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The knight’s interior contradiction—stoic silence vs. yearning for possibility—is embodied in every micro-choice; the unsnapping sequence dramatizes surrender with visible bodily cost. Motivation remains rooted in murmured allegiance, intensifying as the stakes shift from isolation to conduit. The final laughter crystallizes earned change, foreclosing withdrawal with felt price.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the knight’s final stillness reweights the cosmos and his own stance. Causality holds under Accumulative/Textural lens—each gesture thickens possibility until the vortex answers. Threads descend because he offers, not commands; cost is the irreversible openness now humming in his marrow.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Greenhouse glass, mercury roots, and phosphor-bark constrain movement and supply luminous nectar that reverses under ritual pressure. Spatial choreography stays exact: vines balance, fruit bursts, threads weave—each detail charges the final image. The orchard is both crucible and chorus, inseparable from the transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—capture possibility—tightens through escalating surrender; each pattern narrows options until stillness is the only viable act. Pressure is coherent, driven by the knight’s agency; no coincidence resolves. Cost is the permanent permeability now coursing through him.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: possibility is not seized but allowed to pass through. Subtext lives in gesture, silence, and the orchard’s luminous response. Final image of dawn-as-new-grammar reweights all prior motifs without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, modulating from metallic restraint to liquid surrender. Syntax loosens in tandem with joints; diction stays within the knight’s arcane lexicon. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent and charged.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and propulsive; every sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. Metaphors are coherent—frost-flame, thawing-ice laughter—without overwriting. Zero loops or scaffold; clarity never falters under pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses alchemical orchard, marionette cosmology, and silent knight into a singular vision. Risky lyric structure pays off: the unsnapping redefines physics and self. Fresh synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
