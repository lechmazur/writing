<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied—her “teeth tingle,” “boots crunch”—but the final renunciation (packing the coil and walking away) feels slightly under-motivated; we see the cost but not the internal contradiction that makes leaving the awakened city inevitable.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the towers “sang on without her,” crystallizing the shift from seeker to conductor. Causality is tight—every beat flows from tuning the fragment to the city’s mechanical resurrection. The cost is palpable in her relinquishing ownership of the miracle.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The rusted gantry, frost-glazed metal, and gorge mist are not backdrop; they constrain footing, amplify sound, and finally become the resonant body of the instrument. The Hollywood fragment’s chrome edge and the moon’s honey-gold light charge the final image, making setting inseparable from action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—finding genesis inside endings—tightens through each failed echo until the lunar perigee clock forces the decisive tuning. Agency is continuous; each micro-choice (discarding assumptions, syncing gloves) escalates stakes and exacts the cost of letting the towers live on without her.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: manufactured stardust and cosmic silence mirror each other, proving endings breed beginnings. No moralizing; the final spiral of fragment motes reweights the premise without a word, letting the image carry the conceptual repricing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise—“serenely electric,” “shard of hush”—and stays locked to the interpreter’s perceptual bias. No head-hopping; compression (“She didn’t weep. She smiled.”) modulates rhythm under pressure. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing”) is earned by context.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, propulsive, and loop-free; every sentence layers sensory, emotional, and thematic work. Metaphors are coherent—“silence carved like a blade”—and never stall momentum. Minor scaffold appears in the repeated “serenely electric,” but it is pattern-taught and pays off in the final sync.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The fusion of Hollywood kitsch with cosmic signal hunting feels fresh and inevitable; the fragment’s manufactured origin vibrating with background radiation is a non-obvious synthesis. Risky lyric structure holds together under the accumulative lens, yielding a singular artistic stance.</comment>
