<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elira’s interiority is vivid—her olfactory synesthesia and bark-fiber journal anchor a singular perceptual signature. The seed’s dormancy and bloom force her to act (replanting the husk) with visible cost (accepting impermanence). Minor slip: “wisdom flows not in spite of chaos, but because of it” edges toward thesis-statement rather than embodied contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: scent density and communal mood tighten until the bloom’s reek reweights the village’s stance. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—stillness-through-surrender crystallized in the wilted husk replanted in recycled paper. Cost is legible: the flower will not bloom again in her lifetime, anchoring serenity in loss.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The greenhouse’s moss-wrapped shelf and swaying rope bridges constrain movement and attention; the corpse flower’s stench becomes the micro-setting that forces communal reorientation. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—Elira tastes moss before dawn. Final image of the husk wrapped in doodled paper charges the setting with conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—cultivating serenity within motion—escalates as collective doubt crests and the bloom’s stench dissolves arguments. One meaningful tightening: the odor forces villagers to confront grief/fear, narrowing options to apology and shared stories. Cost is communal and felt, though slightly diffuse across the village rather than personally paid by Elira.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from scent-as-truth: grief as fertilizer, fear as root-depth. The corpse flower’s decay-revelation reweights earlier “wildflower hush” into earned stillness. No moralizing; final image of replanted husk in doodled paper offers non-literal answer to serenity-through-surrender.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lush yet disciplined; synesthetic diction (“smell the anxiety”) and rhythmic control mirror Elira’s perceptual bias. No head-hopping; free-indirect style stays coherent. Compression in final paragraph (“wildflower hush, each leaf a page”) crystallizes tone without clutter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; figurative language is selective, never muddled. Minor loop: “wildflower hush” appears twice but serves cadence shift. No filter-verb stacks or scaffold. Final line’s syntactic hush lands cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: olfactory herbalist + corpse flower as communal truth serum + wrapping-paper journaling. Treetop village and tide-thought metaphor feel inevitable, not ornamental. Risky stench-as-revelation pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
