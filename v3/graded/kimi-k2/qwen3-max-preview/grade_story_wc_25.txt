<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lena’s gait-reading skill is embodied in every step and choice; the coin’s weight and the map’s folds force her into a quiet, costly decision that aligns with her whisper-over-shout ethic. Interiority is precise and sensory, never diagnostic. The final act of slipping evidence to Ruiz crystallizes her values with visible social cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single-scene causality holds: coin discovery → map → keyhole → overheard confession → silent transfer. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—truth is re-routed, Delgado’s fate sealed off-stage—felt cost is the burden of complicity Lena now carries. No orientation debt; every spatial move is tracked.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Storm-static, rust-streaked containers, and the gantry’s sodium lamp all constrain movement and perception. The labyrinth itself is tactile, lived-in, and the coin/map double as micro-setting objects that charge the final image. Spatial choreography is flawless.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can Lena expose corruption without violating her creed of quiet action? Pressure tightens as the coin drags her deeper; the overheard confession is the decisive escalation. Agency is hers in the silent transfer; cost is the moral weight she accepts.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: silence as a sharper blade than noise. Subtext lives in footfalls, coin vibrations, and the final whispered justice. No moralizing; the ending image of Lena descending “light” reconfigures power without a word.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Lena’s sensorium; gait signatures and storm hiss are filtered through her trained ear. Rhythm modulates with tension—short percussive clauses during ascent, longer breaths on the gantry. No head-hopping, no register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and information-dense; every line advances plot or atmosphere. Figurative language is spare and precise (“storm’s electric growl,” “folded truths”). Zero loops, zero filter-verb stacks, no scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: noir port thriller meets geomagnetic myth, grounded in a maintenance worker’s embodied expertise. The “key with no apparent lock” subverts heist expectations into a quiet surveillance coup. Risky structure pays off—no siren ending, yet stakes feel absolute.</comment>
