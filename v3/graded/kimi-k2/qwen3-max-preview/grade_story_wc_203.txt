<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The technician’s motivation—discovery rather than repair—drives every micro-choice; embodied emotion (“brushed dust from his knees”) and the final whispered “I see you” crystallize a credible renunciation with felt cost. Interior contradiction is subtle but present: his professional detachment versus paternal empathy. The pearl button and child’s drawing function as charged objects that tilt his stance, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the act of witnessing reconfigures the ghosts’ hold on the space and the technician’s own burden. Causality is tight—each observation (dust swirl, mainspring reflection) directly enables the final revelation under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Cost is legible in the “weightless burden” he now carries. No orientation debt; anchors are clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The ticket office is rendered through purposeful sensory triage—popcorn/sawdust scent, moonlit brass reflection, water-stained ceiling tile—each constraining the technician’s next move. The mainspring barrel becomes micro-setting that literally reveals hidden footsteps, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is flawless; no impossible positions. Environment actively shapes tactics, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—uncovering what neglect conceals—tightens through each beat: dust patterns narrow to the ceiling tile, the drawing forces a stance crystallization. Escalation is driven by the technician’s agency (prying tile, angling barrel) with visible cost: the “weightless burden” he accepts. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length; no coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from particulars: ghosts as unburied stories, neglect as violence. The pearl button and child’s drawing reweight the premise without moralizing. Subtext in the final “C_R_U_” marquee and the single water drop resonates beyond plot. No thematic drift; the ending image reconfigures meaning without a stated moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct—technical precision (“horologist’s mainspring barrel”) braided with lyric attention (“dust curled away like fleeing children”). Perceptual signature is consistent: every detail filtered through the technician’s observant bias. No head-hopping; POV distance remains stable. Rhythm modulates with pressure, climaxing in the whispered “I see you.”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; every sentence advances story or atmosphere. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful—no mixed metaphors. Zero loops or scaffold; no filter-verb stacks. The final water-drop sentence is syntactically perfect and tonally pure. No artifacts in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise—ghosts as dust disturbances, a repairman as witness—feels fresh yet inevitable. Specificity of the circus fire of ’78 and the pearl button grounds the concept. Risk in the quiet, non-confrontational closure pays off. No close echoes; the synthesis of technical craft and spectral grief is non-obvious.</comment>
