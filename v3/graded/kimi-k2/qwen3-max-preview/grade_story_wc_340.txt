<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical and embodied, but the servant’s contradictory impulses are stated rather than dramatized in scene; the final acceptance is tender yet feels slightly pre-ordained rather than wrested from pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the diary’s last line reframes the entire ascent, and the cost—grief absorbed, not solved—is felt in the crystalline tears that refuse to fall. Causal linkage is light but coherent under an Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>The icebound spire, elevator shaft, and frost-rimmed seams are vivid and selective; the goggles act as micro-setting that constrains perception and charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean, though the tower’s exterior scale remains slightly abstract.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Stakes are internal—seek joy beneath anguish—and tighten once when the cipher is deciphered; the deepening is lyrical rather than causal, but the felt cost of absorbing grief is legible. Agency is contemplative, not active, yet still forecloses denial.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically from the captain’s diary fragments and the servant’s ascent; the final line reweights sorrow as companion, not enemy, without moralizing. Subtext is carried in silence, frost, and the cracked lenses.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Voice is consistently lyrical, with a perceptual signature attuned to frost, brass, and refracted light; no head-hopping. Compression and elision are purposeful and paid off in the final image.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is musical and dense; occasional stacked metaphors (“prismatic shards,” “lantern left burning”) flirt with overwriting but never dull momentum. Rhythm modulates with ascent; no loops or scaffolds.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The icebound diary tower and grief-as-companion angle feel fresh; the goggles-as-cipher device is elegant. Risk is moderate—lyric accumulation over plot—but the synthesis is specific and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
