<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Quiet, single-POV interiority shows contradiction in scene and an earned renunciation—“I don’t know”—that forecloses her data route with audible cost. Scholar’s weathered innocence threads into micro-choices. Only flaw: one stock metaphor “ghost-utterance” blunts interior specificity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Lyrical fragmentation taught early as accumulative pattern reweights stakes at closure via panoramic echo question: “What grows now?” Closure lands with conceptual repricing—silence gains syntax—under Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation anchored at dawn immediately.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Library as micro-setting constrains acoustics and supplies diagnostic echo resource; each relic (crystal, rafters) charges the final image. Select sensory details felt through silent hush. Occasional generic “mud-room of dawn” phrasing slightly dilutes specificity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: decode patterns of decay. Harmonic interrogation of crystal tightens options until pause/refrain becomes renunciation, changing stance from knowledge to listening. Pressure coherent under Accumulative lens. Late reveal of growth system is abstract; modest deduction.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of growth vs. entropy emerges through concrete sonic archaeology, culminating in realization: silence has syntax. Final whisper reconfigures scientific quest as open listening—non-literal, resonant, without tidy moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Reticent scholar’s voice filtered through physical acoustics, controlled breathy syntax, zero dialogue yet compression feels deliberate and purposeful. One instance of elevated phrase “sonically reflective quality” catches in ear.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>High-density, crystalline sentences propel without loops; musical syntax echoes acoustic content. Sensory pattern of sight/sound integrated cleanly. No figurative muddle during peak beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: crystal as diagnostic tool versus natural silence, everyday lyric reweights grand theme. Quiet renunciation reveals new option—listening for the next question—impossible without sonic describe-as-show.</comment>
