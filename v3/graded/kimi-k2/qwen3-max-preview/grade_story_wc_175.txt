<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical yet concrete; the “transiently rooted” paradox is embodied in every micro-choice (bowing without touching the monarch). Motive—honoring overlooked histories—drives the ritual, and the final renunciation (leaving the shrine to dissolve) carries visible cost. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, only serene acceptance, so the arc is more stance than struggle. Still, the character feels irreducibly individual.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each knot and pause thickens the pattern until the final image reweights the stake—beauty without audience. Closure is a Charged Poise: the monarch’s lift-off crystallizes the covenant’s cost. Orientation is immediate; no causality breaks. Rain-loosening and wind-scattering are taught early as inevitable dissolution, so the ending payoff is earned.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The grotto’s gold-green vapor and moss hollow are tactile constraints: the stump dictates the spiral’s shape, the mist limits duration. The moth wing and monarchs function as micro-settings that charge the final image. Sensory selection is urgent—light “fractured,” ferns “curling inward as if shy”—and every detail filters through the POV’s devotional attention. Environment actively shapes the ritual’s possibilities.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: dignify vanishing before erasure. Pressure tightens via the ticking migration—each knot is a race against forgetting. Agency is renunciation: she refuses permanence, accepts dissolution. Cost is legible in the bow that will unravel by dawn; no external antagonist needed. One meaningful deepening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the tension between permanence and impermanence; the spiral shrine is the argument. Subtext lives in gesture—bowing without touching, knots tied to loosen. The final image of the monarch lifting the “weight of a history briefly remembered” reweights the premise without moralizing. Complexity is honored: beauty can exist without witness, yet still be a form of resistance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct: lyrical compression, devotional cadence, precise perceptual signature (“blushing stillness,” “interrupted cadence”). Syntax mirrors the ritual’s slow breathing; no head-hopping. Elision is taught early—history’s forgotten names—and paid off in the vanishing shrine. Register remains consistent; no filter-verb clutter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid; each sentence layers image and idea without redundancy. Metaphors are coherent—moth wing as “ghost of flight,” knots as “quiet rebellion.” No loops or scaffold. Rhythm accelerates subtly at the monarch’s descent, then exhales into stillness. Line-level control supports the accumulative design.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise—temporary shrines to honor erasure—feels fresh and inevitable. Tropes of vanishing and witness are transformed through tactile ritual and ecological urgency. The synthesis of monarch extinction, ephemeral art, and devotional practice is specific to this voice. Risk lies in the quiet ending, but it lands with conceptual cost. No derivative echoes.</comment>
