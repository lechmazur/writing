<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elira’s interiority is precise—her “quiet grit” and “ethereal grit” refrains crystallize her stance. The micro-choice to thread counter-frequencies at 2:17 a.m. is embodied and costly (lost sleep, isolation). Flaws (overconfidence in pattern-recognition) drive the risk she takes. Closure shows earned endurance: she stays in the booth, accepting perpetual vigilance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because she decodes the tricksters’ method, therefore she destabilizes it. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“dim glow of the university radio station”). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—her whispered “Try me again” crystallizes ongoing defiance with felt cost (no victory, only vigilance).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The radio booth’s “yellowed astronomical charts” and salvaged capacitors constrain every move; the Cold-War transmitters literally enable the vector. Sensory detail is selective—subsonic vibrations “rattle her molars.” Micro-setting (charts, headphones, oscilloscope) functions as crucible. Final image of new chart pinned to corkboard recharges motif.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake: prevent psychic civil war via subversion of subliminal signal. Tightening occurs when she patches the counter-frequency—live option foreclosed (no committee backup). Cost is legible: permanent solitary vigilance. Escalation is causal and irreversible: tricksters’ signal “writhes, weakened, then retreated.”</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: hope as active interference against manufactured despair. Subtext in “cosmic tricksters” reframes salvation as weaponized manipulation. Final whisper reweights premise—hope is not passive but a disciplined, lonely practice. No moralizing; resonance carried by image of new chart.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elira’s perceptual signature—technical diction (“waveform signatures”) filtered through embodied fatigue. Rhythm modulates with tension: long sentences for reflection, staccato for patching. No head-hopping. Voice remains coherent under pressure; “ethereal grit” becomes mantra.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; no loops or scaffold. Metaphors (“tuning a poisoned violin”) are precise and earned. Sensory specificity (“rattled her molars”) replaces generic dread. Minor over-writing in “cosmic tricksters” phrase but does not dull closure. Clean grammar and tense.</comment>

<comment>Fresh synthesis: SETI trope inverted—alien contact as psychological malware. Subsonic frequency warfare is grounded in plausible neuroscience. Risk-taking in quiet, non-violent resistance pays off. Specificity of Cassiopeia pulsar and Cold-War transmitters anchors premise. Transformation test: story collapses if elements swapped.</comment>
