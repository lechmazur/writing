<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elira’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her mechanically warm resolve, the scar she doesn’t remember, the 2.7-degree lever adjustment—yet the adjacent-Elira beat is the only moment of visible internal contradiction. Motivation is consistent and intensifies, but the cost (risk of losing the present) is implied rather than dramatized on the page. The single POV keeps focus tight; no relationship crucible is required.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the final image of “time breathes sideways” reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost. Causal linkage holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each sensor recalibration and lever shift layers density until the lateral fold crystallizes. Orientation is anchored early; no teleporting props or plot amnesia.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The methane sea, magnetic nexus, and roosting xenomorphs are not backdrop but constraint: the nexus bends light, the twilight hush times the lever pull, the xenomorph wings mirror the fold. Micro-setting (gantry, comet-iron lever) constrains the decisive action. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered; no static repetition.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“prove time moves sideways”—is signaled in paragraph four and tightens through each calibration beat. The lever pull is the single meaningful turn that forecloses safe withdrawal; cost is the adjacent self’s terror and the lingering ozone-cinnamon scent. Pressure escalates via density increase rather than multiple reversals, fitting the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the nexus-as-pivot image: time as lateral breath rather than forward flow. Subtext operates in the xenomorphs’ synchronized curiosity and the mechanically warm scent that “hadn’t happened yet.” No moralizing; the final line offers a non-literal, resonant answer that reweights all prior material.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is distinct—mechanically warm, precise, slightly lyrical—anchored in Elira’s perceptual signature. Syntax tightens under pressure (“She gripped. The station exhaled.”). No head-hopping; POV distance remains stable. Dialogue is minimal and subtextual when present.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers sensory, conceptual, and emotional data without redundancy. Metaphors (“light fractured—not shattered, but peeled”) are precise and internally consistent. Zero loops or scaffold; no register drift. Final image is crystalline and uncluttered.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The sideways-time premise is a fresh synthesis of holographic principle and avian magnetoreception, rendered through Elira’s idiosyncratic obsession. Risky structural choice—single continuous scene, lyric density—heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Specificity of comet-iron lever and chroniton drift prevents generic feel.</comment>
