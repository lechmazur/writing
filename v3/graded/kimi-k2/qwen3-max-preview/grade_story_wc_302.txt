<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The veiled dreamer's interiority is rich, embodied, and contradicted (thief’s guilt vs exhilaration), yet her final choice—“silence shaped like acceptance”—feels abstract; earlier causality is sound, but the cost paid is more conceptual than visible.

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A Resonant Reconfiguration lands as she becomes the archive; propagation-delays and recursive rearrangement of shelves constitute a clear Conceptual Repricing. The drive lens (Recursive/Accumulative) never wavers, yet cost is more atmospheric than concrete.

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The glowing misted shelves, shifting grammar, and watch are fully integrated; the mirrored library itself constrains every move and charges the final image; spatial logic tightens until she merges with it.

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The dominant “quest for unspoken words” tightens steadily through reversed shelves, glyph-scars, and frozen watch; each discovery retroactively reshapes prior reality, narrowing options under the recursive lens, though emotional price is more felt than enacted.

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The theme of speech, regret, and recursion emerges organically from specific scents and glyphs; resonance lands in the cracked mirror without overt moralizing—quiet, earned, unforgettable.

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical, sensorial prose pulses with distinct rhythms (“propagation delays meant her documentation rippled backward”); voice remains consistent and pressure-matched throughout, even under its recursive logic.

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>No loops or redundant scaffolding; every sentence serves atmosphere or plot, density is high, and final cadence is impeccable.

<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>A non-obvious fusion of metaphysical archive and recursive time feels inevitable in hindsight; risk-taking (watch that reverses time, library that eats its seekers) enhances clarity rather than obscuring it.
