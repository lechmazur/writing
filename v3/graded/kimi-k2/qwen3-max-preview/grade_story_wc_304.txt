<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The mortician’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her trembling hands, reverent breaths—but the scholar remains a cipher; no contradictory impulses surface in-scene, and the final renunciation feels pre-ordained rather than earned under fresh pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration: the emerald chip’s steady glow crystallizes the captured instant, and the cost—her own future surrender—is legible in the final drift. Accumulative/Textural lens holds; each lyrical shard layers toward the hush that reweights all prior stillness.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The grotto’s liquid photons and condensed skylight actively constrain movement and supply the only light for the ritual; the emerald chip refracts that light into trembling geometries that charge the final image. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“capture one last spark before oblivion”—is signaled early and tightens through the infusion beat; the cost is the scholar’s bodily cessation and the mortician’s eventual self-offering. One meaningful deepening suffices under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of lucid witness at the edge of dissolution emerges from concrete particulars—the chip’s forest-green pulse, the held breath before thunder—without moralizing. Final image of drifting lanterns reweights the premise with quiet conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is lush yet disciplined, its cadence mirroring the aurora’s slow swirl; perceptual signature is unmistakable—“cloud-moth silk,” “powdered starlight.” No head-hopping; compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and musical, each sentence advancing atmosphere or ritual precision; no loops, no mixed metaphors. Occasional elevated diction (“latent resonance,” “threshold of stillness”) is voice-motivated and never muddies causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fusion of mortician-beautician with aurora-chip preservation feels inevitable and fresh; the concept of bottling the pause between breath and silence is non-obvious and fully committed to. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
