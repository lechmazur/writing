<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Deckhand’s cheerful endurance under cosmic stakes is vivid; the interior contradiction (hope vs. vanishing) is embodied in brass-polishing and radio-tuning micro-choices. Motivation crystallizes on-page—“every soul deserved a single, solid world”—and the final renunciation (no cheer, just return to work) carries felt cost. Minor: captain’s reappearance is more emblem than crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the merged ferry appears, passengers relieved, deckhand tips cap—world reconfigured, cost legible in his quiet acceptance of endless re-knitting. Causal lens holds: each vanishing tightens pattern → radio tuning → harmonic beacon → convergence. Orientation crystal-clear; no teleporting props.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Salt spray, phosphorescent pebbles, coral arches dripping starlight—all filtered through deckhand’s tactile labor. The grotto’s ozone thickness and bioluminescent eels trace equations that constrain his tuning choices. Final image of wake “shimmering with ghostly ripples” recharges setting as lingering cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake: restore singular timeline for vanished souls. Pressure escalates via each ferry blink-out; deckhand’s agency narrows to harmonic stitching. Cost: sleepless, foodless, perpetual stewardship—visible in “didn’t sleep. Didn’t eat much.” Final tightening merges seven ferries; no coincidence resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges from action: transience as stewardship, not tragedy. Subtext in silent captain’s wet eyes and upward-trickling sand reweights “permanent transience” without sermon. Motif of braiding time threads resonates through radio patterns and starlight drips, culminating in quiet acceptance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lyric, sea-salt cadence mirrors deckhand’s resilient optimism; perceptual signature in noticing “grain of the wood frame” and “glyphs shimmer only in moonlight.” Compression taught early (“When clocks run sideways, you’ll know”) and paid off. No head-hopping; POV distance steady.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose propels: “salt spray misted his sun-browned face” compresses setting, body, mood. Rhythm flexes with urgency—short beats during convergence, longer lyric lines in grotto. Minor filter-verb cluster (“he realized then”) but does not stall momentum. Clean grammar, no loops.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Quantum-ferry oscillation feels fresh yet inevitable; trope of time-slips transformed into cosmic maintenance work. Specificity of “commuter schedules aligned with quantum tides” grounds abstraction. Final image of upward-flowing sand reconfigures hourglass trope with conceptual cost. Risky lyric structure holds.</comment>
