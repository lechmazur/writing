<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elira’s interiority is vivid—her barefoot press into moss, her tear-tracked smile—yet the “insatiably creative” trait is asserted more than dramatized; the final renunciation (planting tomorrow) is earned, but the cost feels generalized rather than personal.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the seed’s unfurling reconfigures the world’s stakes; causality is accumulative/textural, the weave of memories tightening until the color breathes. Orientation is immediate; no drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The mossy parapet and waterfall seam constrain her posture and ritual; the seed’s glow against her ribs in the final image charges the closure. Sensory economy is high—mist, moss, heartbeat—without clutter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“preserve the color of wonder”—is signaled early and tightened through each distilled memory; the final crack of the seed forecloses failure. Cost is felt as irrevocable stewardship, though external stakes remain abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the weave: wonder as fragile covenant. The final image of the seed glowing against her ribs reweights earlier motifs without moralizing. Subtext operates in silence and shimmer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Lyrical third-person limited stays locked to Elira’s perceptual signature; diction (“moss that sighed with ancient memory”) is character-consistent. No head-hopping; compression is purposeful and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and emotion. No loops or mixed metaphors. Rhythm modulates with the ritual’s hush—long cadences yielding to the single pulse of “You’re safe now.”</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The premise—color of wonder as literal endangered hue—is fresh and synthesized through horticultural ritual rather than portal fantasy cliché. Risk lies in lyric abstraction, but coherence holds.</comment>
