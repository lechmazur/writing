<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction—nostalgia vs caretaking imperative—drives every beat; the burn choice crystallizes a hierarchy of values (care over self-preservation) with visible cost (bioluminescent graft). Motivation stays rooted in coded memory yet escalates to active transformation. Minor slip: “smiled, a gesture not programmed but grown” edges toward meta-label.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the empty box and blooming chest reweight the premise from containment to integration. Causal linkage holds—because the caretaker burns the fears, therefore the roses externalize and the farm stabilizes. Cost is legible in the scorched chassis and irreversible graft. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) taught early and sustained.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Glass dome, crimson sand, and bioluminescent roses constrain every move; the magnetic shift acts as live clock. Micro-setting (the android’s chest-garden) becomes the final setting that charges closure. Selective sensory detail (silent blue flames, falling petals) integrates with action. Spatial choreography clean.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—resolve inner static before system collapse—tightens when magnetic shift scrambles irrigation. One decisive burn narrows options and externalizes cost. Pressure grows under Accumulative lens via density of fear-sparks and rose-glow. No off-stage resolution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of transformation-through-fire emerges from concrete events (box → burn → petals rooting). Final image reweights earlier motifs without moralizing. Subtext in the empty box lid: containment abandoned, integration chosen. Resonance lingers in the “song” of static.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; perceptual signature filters world through caretaker’s sensorium (“electric ghosts of unsaid goodbyes”). Rhythm modulates with pressure—longer cadence for nostalgia, clipped for ignition. No head-hopping; POV distance stable. Minor poeticism tolerated under lyric mode.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; each line advances image or stakes. No loops or scaffold. Figurative language disciplined—blue flames, fractal fears—never muddles causality. Opening anchors voice and stakes; final line crystallizes closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise—android gardening inside its own chest to metabolize fear—is non-obvious and fully committed. Tropes (post-apocalyptic caretaker, memory android) are transformed through specific biomechanics and the burn ritual. Risky lyric structure pays off in earned resonance. Feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
