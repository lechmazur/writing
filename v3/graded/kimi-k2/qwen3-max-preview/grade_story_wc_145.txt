<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The editor’s dry wit and obsessive precision are vivid and embodied; the interior contradiction between editing maps and seeking living origins is dramatized in the condensation ritual. Motivation remains consistent and intensifies to the final renunciation of editing for witnessing. The falcon functions as extension rather than second character, so relationship crucible is N/A. One hairline slip: “subtly confident smirk” is label-adjacent, not embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—Earned Stasis: the editor forecloses the path of endless revision by drawing a spiral that cannot be verified, accepting the cost of unverifiable truth. Causal chain (falcon → map → condensation → spiral) holds under Accumulative/Textural lens; each beat deepens pattern until the final image reweights meaning. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 3. Cost is legible in the vanished condensation and the editor’s silence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The rusted outpost, frozen lake, and grimed window are not backdrop but instruments: the window’s condensation literally maps the convergence, constraining the editor’s method. Micro-setting (windowpane) becomes divining rod; environmental pressure (biting calm, ice groan) shapes the final kneeling act. Sensory selection is POV-filtered and urgent. Meets 9+ gate: the window charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“find where the rivers begin”—is signaled early and tightens through each beat: map fragment, condensation delta, spiral drawn. One meaningful deepening: the realization that the source is a resonance, not a location, narrows options and forces the editor to stop editing. Cost is felt in the relinquishment of cartographic certainty. Agency drives every turn; coincidence is absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: the tension between representation and lived origin. The spiral drawn in snow is a non-literal answer to the thematic question—truth is witnessed, not charted. Subtext operates in the falcon’s “unimpressed” stance and the editor’s refusal to plant a flag. No moralizing; resonance lingers in the wiped-clean window.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct, sardonic, and lexically precise—“feathered bureaucrat,” “cartographic nitpicking.” Syntax mirrors the editor’s meticulousness; compression is purposeful and taught early. No head-hopping; POV remains tightly interior. Dialogue is minimal but voice-driven: “You’ll deliver this one yourself.”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet limpid; every sentence advances story or atmosphere. Figurative language is spare and exact—“ice groaned like an old ship.” No loops, scaffold, or register drift. Rhythm modulates with pressure; final paragraph breathes into quiet satisfaction. Zero artifacts in closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses cartography, linguistics, and thermodynamics into a fresh mythic engine. The condensation-as-map device is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking (lyric, accumulative structure) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Specificity of “seventeen dead dialects” and “thermodynamics and tongue” anchors universals.</comment>
