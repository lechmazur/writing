<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Archivist’s interiority is vivid—her “preemptively nostalgic” ache is embodied in every gesture—but the piece withholds a decisive micro-choice that would crystallize cost; she measures shadows with empathy yet never alters her path, so the arc remains observational rather than crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final inscription along a raindrop’s refraction reweights the premise, making her own erasure legible. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each shadow-length deepens the pattern—yet the causal link between observation and this ultimate gesture is implied rather than dramatized, a hairline slip.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Observatory and crystal forecourt are not backdrop but instrument: the solidified fog cracks underfoot, the refracting droplets become archive. Environment constrains every beat—shadows measured on glazed pavement, storm-hum in the bones—culminating in the charged image of her name bent inside a raindrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—sculpting identity from vanished cultures—tightens through each lengthening shadow; the cost is felt as the archivist absorbs collective grief. No external reversal, but the internal deepening is coherent; the final short shadow of the Arch of Unfinished Questions forces her recognition of finite time.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the tension between preservation and surrender: cultures choose oblivion, the archivist chooses inscription, yet both are subsumed by storm. The ending image—name written in refracted light—offers a non-literal answer: identity is not fixed in stone but in the bending of memory itself.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet disciplined, each sentence tuned to the archivist’s synesthetic perception: “thunder growled beneath her like a drowsing beast.” Patterned elision (“preemptively nostalgic”) is taught early and paid off; no head-hopping, no register drift. The prose’s cadence mirrors the slow creep of shadows.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences are dense, propulsive, and artifact-free; figurative language is selective and purposeful. No loops or scaffold; every clause advances atmosphere or interiority. Minor risk of overwriting in “fossils of feeling,” but the phrase is earned by prior sensory layering and does not stall momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The conceit—memory archived in rain-refracted stone rather than books—feels inevitable yet fresh. Shadow-length as metric of mourning is a non-obvious synthesis; the Sky-Singers’ surrender to storm reframes elegy as collaboration with forgetting. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
