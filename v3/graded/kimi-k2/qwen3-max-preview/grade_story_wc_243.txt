<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The archivist’s interiority is precise and embodied; her micro-choices (brushing planks, opening locket, dipping pen) reveal motive and cost. The contradiction between grief and reverence is dramatized in the moment, not summarized. The final smile carries earned renunciation—she forecloses mourning in favor of witness, paying with perpetual labor.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the covenant is regenerated through the act of writing itself, with salt, ink, and laughter as proximate causes. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—each remembered detail reweights the stake until the final image crystallizes. Cost is legible in the phrase “she would return tomorrow, and the next twilight”—an open-ended vow that forecloses rest.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The blooming jetty’s salt-crusted planks, lantern-lit jasmine, and tide-sigh constrain her posture and pace; the locket’s warmth against her collarbone charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy is character-bound—she notices what serves preservation. Spatial choreography is clean; no floating anchors.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserving small moments against erasure—is signaled early and tightened through each clause she writes. The pressure is accumulative: every memory steeping in ink narrows the future to perpetual transcription. The cost is felt in the open-ended commitment, not a single decisive beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the tension between institutional forgetting and intimate remembering; no moralizing statement intrudes. The covenant’s regeneration is dramatized through concrete acts—writing, closing the locket, walking home—rather than abstraction. Final image of lanterns “trembling like fireflies” reweights prior motifs with quiet, undeniable cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet disciplined; syntax modulates with emotional pressure (“ink smelled of forests and endings”). Perceptual signature is distinct—she reads planks like braille, smells salt in memory. No head-hopping; POV remains tightly anchored to the archivist’s sensorium.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but never purple; each sentence advances image or stakes. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is purposeful and coherent. Rhythm breathes with the scene—long sentences for memory, short pulses for action. Minor slip: “steeped the memory in metaphor” edges toward meta-commentary but is earned by context.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The premise—an archivist regenerating covenants through walnut ink and proximate causes—feels fresh yet inevitable. Tropes of memory and loss are transformed through sensory specificity and occupational detail. The final reconfiguration is not a twist but a deepening of established pattern.</comment>
