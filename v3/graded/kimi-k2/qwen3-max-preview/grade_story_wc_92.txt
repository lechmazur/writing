<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“her silhouette sharp… fingers tracing… bronze quill holder—cold, heavy”), but the protagonist’s contradictory impulses remain implicit rather than dramatized; the final choice is foreshadowed yet lacks a visible cost on the page, capping the score below 8.8.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration—she completes the planting of the geometric manifesto, foreclosing the path of inaction; blackout lifting with “slow, silver seep” crystallizes the before/after of the silent revolution. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of angles and blackout pressure tightens to the final image with felt conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Twilight fort, blackout, and sundial plinth are rendered with selective sensory detail that constrains her movements and times her alignment of the gnomon; the bronze quill holder functions as micro-setting that charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“spark a silent revolution”—is signaled early; pressure tightens through blackout and guard proximity, forcing precise timing of the coded angles. One meaningful deepening: blackout lifts just as she finishes, underscoring irreversibility. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral, keeping score below 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of silent resistance through geometry emerges organically from action and image; final “silver seep” reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext operates in the hush of boots and shadows; ambiguity lingers without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet controlled, with rhythmic variation that modulates with tension; perceptual signature is consistent (“winking hush of someone who knew the world was listening”). No head-hopping; diction stays within plausible lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; figurative language is purposeful and pattern-taught (“geometric ciphers only the initiated could read”). No loops or scaffold; occasional elevated diction is voice-motivated. Final image is crystalline.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: a covert revolution plotted through sundial angles during a blackout. Specificity of bronze quill holder and coded shadows transforms familiar spy-revolution tropes into something inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
