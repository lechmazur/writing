<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Coachman’s quiet, embodied resolve—cracked hands, seed-weight, throat-listening—grounds his arc; the renunciation of speed for sprout-time crystallizes with felt cost. Interior contradiction (memory vs mercy) is present but lightly dramatized; a single micro-choice (heel-crush of pods) carries the turn. Voice stays individual, never generic.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single-scene Accumulative/Textural arc: each crushed pod, bird answer, and tongue-click tightens the pattern toward the Charged Poise of the wagon rolling away beneath sprouting absence. Orientation is swift; closure image reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost. No causality break.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Jetty’s moss-furred planks, tidal scent, and dusk-bruised sky constrain every kneel and scoop; the seed pods themselves become micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective, filtered through the coachman’s ritual attention. Spatial choreography is clean; no white-room drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restoration versus erasure—tightens through each linguistic exchange with birds; the deepening is the shift from collection to burial, foreclosing retreat. Cost is the surrender of forward motion for patient return. Escalation is accumulative, not causal, and sufficient.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of “submerged concord” emerges through the concrete ritual of seed, ash, and tongue; no explicit moralizing. Final silhouette between ruin and rebirth offers resonant non-literal answer. Subtext lives in bird verbs and the silence after song.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is textured, archaic yet tactile—“latent green scream,” “salted through cracks in stone”—with rhythmic control that breathes with dusk. No head-hopping; POV stays locked to coachman’s perceptual signature. Compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image, action, and theme without loops. Metaphors are coherent and grounded (“brittle as forgotten vows”). Zero scaffold or redundancy; final line trails dusk like a shawl—perfect cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fusion of post-battle gardening, dead-language bird diplomacy, and twilight ritual feels inevitable yet wholly fresh. Synthesis arises from specific, lived detail rather than gimmick. Transformation test: could not swap elements without breaking emotional logic.</comment>
