<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied ("fingertips brushing the cold brass," "pulse matched the darkroom timer"), but the poet’s final stance—refusing to open the envelope—rests more on ritual than on a visible cost that alters her options. The contradiction between furious and tranquil is stated, not dramatized in a single decisive beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the vigil in pause crystallizes into a conscious, costly refusal ("she would open it tomorrow—or perhaps never"). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural; the pattern of ritualized stillness intensifies until the final image reweights the premise. No orientation debt; anchors are clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The stormlit observatory is not mere backdrop; its glass eye, lightning, and vents shape the poet’s sensory narrowing and provide the final charged image. Micro-setting (brass timer, rusted locker) constrains her movements and ritual. Environment and tool jointly charge the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving the last uncensored poem—tightens through ritualized delay. The pressure deepens when the timer hits zero and she still refuses; the cost is the perpetual suspension of voice. Agency is renunciation, not action, and the price is legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: censorship becomes self-censorship, silence becomes cartography. The final image—"her own unredacted sky"—reweights every prior scar without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture (pressing envelope to chest) and withheld speech.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with storm-kissed diction ("ink-stained hands of censors") and rhythmic control that mirrors the timer’s cadence. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent and character-specific.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, musical, and propulsive; figurative language is disciplined to the storm motif. One minor loop—“storm-kissed wonder” used twice—barely grazes the closure beat. No scaffolding or mixed metaphors.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The conceit of mapping scars as constellations feels fresh; the observatory-above-clouds frame and the timer-as-metronome are non-obvious syntheses. Risky lyric compression pays off in the final reconfiguration.</comment>
