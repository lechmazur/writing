<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority is embodied and specific; claustrophobia is shown through shallow breaths and tactile squeeze. Motivation—"to stand by the unremembered"—drives every beat and the final choice to stay until water rises. Micro-choice to place the gold fleck is earned by prior memory and costs her exit margin. No contradictory impulses are dramatized, so the 9+ quick test is not fully met.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the chamber’s harmonic convergence returns presence to the lost, with the spent gold fleck as felt cost. Causal linkage holds—tidal clock, fleck activation, and descent all tighten toward this moment. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (“coastal collapse…swallowed”). No lens ambiguity; Accumulative/Textural pattern taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Environment constrains every move: fissure width, rusted stairwell groans, rising tide. The gold fleck itself becomes micro-setting that charges the final socket. Sensory selection is urgent—salt on tongue, cold metal—filtered through spelunker’s priorities. Final image of moonlit sea reweights the facility’s memory.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—return presence to the unremembered—tightens as tide creeps in. One meaningful deepening: the Phase Transition Chamber’s activation forecloses retreat. Cost is visible on page: “the gold fleck…crumbled into dust.” Agency drives escalation; coincidence only complicates via tide.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of remembrance emerges through concrete images—laminated child’s drawing, humming cables—never stated. Subtext in the silent gratitude of flickering technicians. Final image of cables now “carrying remembrance” reweights premise without moralizing. Complexity preserved: world will forget again.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is textured, lyrical, yet precise: “salt-crusted spoons lying beside petrified sandwiches.” Perceptual signature filters every detail through spelunker’s body and memory. No head-hopping; single POV held. Compression like “crashing hush” is taught early and modulates with pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density—“steel ribs now fused with limestone and time.” Metaphors are coherent: “arteries of a world that forgot its own pulse.” Rhythm accelerates with rising water. No register drift; diction stays within spelunker’s plausible lexicon.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Premise—using abyssal pressure chamber to return lost memory—feels fresh and inevitable. Tropes of ghost signals and sunken labs are transformed through specific emotional stakes and the gold fleck’s monastic origin. Risky lyric mode heightens coherence without gimmickry.</comment>
