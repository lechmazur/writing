<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The mender’s contradictory impulses—shame, defiance, tenderness—are alive in every tactile choice (honeyed spoon, ribbon stitch). Her interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak. The final micro-choice (climb again with honey/thread/hope) crystallizes a hierarchy of values with visible cost: she accepts perpetual uncertainty rather than forced forgiveness. Daughter remains off-page, so relationship-as-crucible is implied, not dramatized—cap stays just below 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each gathered vow thickens the emotional density until the daughter’s fresh vow reframes the stake. Closure lands as Charged Poise—ribbon + green scrap coiled in fist, reconfiguring options without sentimental reconciliation. Cost is legible: she commits to an open-ended repair cycle, forfeiting rest. Orientation is clear by line 8; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Cathedral-orchard is not backdrop; its recoiling branches and honeyed vow-fruit actively resist or enable her tactics. The hair ribbon functions as micro-setting, its fray and pulse constraining the final stitch. Sensory hierarchy mirrors POV—optical tools, sticky honey, dew on cheeks—never tourist catalog. Spatial choreography is clean across ladder climb and doorway thorn.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—bridge generational wisdom before erasure—tightens when the daughter’s vow literally recoils from retrieval. One meaningful deepening: the vow “I will never understand you” shifts the task from collection to coaxed adhesion, foreclosing easy absolution. Cost is visible: she sleeps under altar, fist clenched around unopened vow. Pressure stays coherent under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves anything.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through accreted vows and tactile repair tools rather than thesis: wisdom is iterative, sticky, unfinished. Final image of green scrap reweights “accidental wisdom” without moralizing. Subtext in honeyed spoon—parental seduction, not force—carries unspoken apology. Ambiguity lingers: return is not reconciliation, only renewed possibility.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to mender’s perceptual signature—lenses, light refraction, tool weights. Syntax shortens under stress (“She sighed, then grinned.”). Humming motif threads mother-to-daughter memory without head-hopping. No dialogue, so voice distinction across speakers not tested; internal voice remains singular and rhythmic.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence. Figurative language is selective—vows like leaf, ribbon like captured sky—never clogs high-pressure beats. Information density high: one sentence often performs scene, emotion, world rule. Zero paraphrase loops; “forgotten bag’s contents” only repeated when narratively necessary.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fusion of optician-craft and orchard-of-oaths feels inevitable yet unseen before. Vows as deciduous fruit literalizes emotional litter without allegorical heaviness. Risk: honeyed spoon instead of magic spell—domestic tool elevated to ritual—pays off in tactile credibility. If swapped to generic fantasy wand, entire beat collapses.</comment>
