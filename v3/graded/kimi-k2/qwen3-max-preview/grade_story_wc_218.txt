<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Arlen’s terminal diagnosis and “brazen calm” are embodied in every copper twist; the diary sketches and sparrow rescue dramatize his motive without exposition. Interiority stays tactile—salt-softened leather, tremor-free fingers—yet the flaw (denial of decay) never blocks his agency. Final renunciation—binding the diary to the branch—earns its cost in breath and legacy. Minor slip: villagers remain off-page silhouettes, so relationship crucible is thin.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each copper-guided growth adds density until the orchard itself becomes the closure image. Orientation is immediate—bare feet, mist, Pillar Seven—and the final binding of the diary delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost: “Let the rain read it.” No causality breaks; every beat advances pattern or stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The living stone pillars and copper-wrapped oaks are not backdrop but active constraint—roots cradle stones, lizards sun on warmed metal, Spiral Stair births a fawn. Sensory hierarchy is caretaker-biased: dew-cooled copper, moss pulse, bird pause. Final image—diary lashed to the highest branch—recharges the entire setting as archive and cathedral.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—time running out—tightens through each dawn session; the six-month clock is implicit but legible. Escalation is accretive: every copper coil is a small wager against mortality. The freeing of the sparrow and the final climb crystallize the cost without external antagonist. One wished-for beat: a sharper material loss (tool, stamina) to push tension past 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of interspecies respect emerges from concrete acts—copper geometry, sparrow rescue, raccoon inspection—never from slogans. The diary’s final elevation reweights the premise: knowledge belongs to rain and roots, not humans. No moralizing; the orchard’s ongoing life is the non-literal answer. Subtext hums in the copper’s quiet conductivity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays rooted in Arlen’s perceptual signature—botanical precision, salt-tanged patience. Syntax lengthens during calm work, compresses at breath’s end. No dialogue, yet the prose carries caretaker idiom: “copper conducted intention.” Voice modulates with physical decline without slipping into sentimentality.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet aerated: “mist clung…like a veil” does one job and exits. No loops, no scaffold; each sentence advances growth, stakes, or texture. Figurative language is spare and accurate—lizard scales “like living coins.” Final paragraph’s cadence slows to match shallow breath, then releases into orchard rustle.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The fusion of terminal illness, bio-architecture, and interspecies diplomacy feels inevitable yet fresh. Copper-guided living wood is not steampunk ornament but ethical praxis. Transformation test: swap copper for rope or caretaker for gardener and the emotional arc collapses. Risky quiet ending lands with conceptual cost.</comment>
