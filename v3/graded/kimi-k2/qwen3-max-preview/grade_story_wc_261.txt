<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elira’s contradictory impulses—reading scars vs. sealing them—surface in embodied micro-choices (touching scar, kneeling to seed). Interiority is concrete; the final renunciation of “closure seeker” is earned by the seed’s dissolution and felt cost. Minor: the telepathy trait is asserted more than dramatized in choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the seed merges with the scar, rewriting her vocation. Causal chain (ivy intel → coffee-ring clue → tunnel invitation → seed translation) holds; hourglass restart marks cost. One minor ellipsis: how the tunnel “opens by invitation” is more lyrical than legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Tower, cellar, and cathedral crypt are anchored early; the hourglass and scar function as micro-settings that constrain final choice. Selective sensory detail (damp, fossilized roots) mirrors interior shift. Spatial choreography is clean; ivy’s tremor links exterior to interior without confusion.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—translate, not resurrect—is signaled in scar-reading and tightened when the seed’s memories force renunciation. Escalation is driven by her agency at each beat (touch ring, enter tunnel, accept seed). Cost is visible: the seed dissolves into her, rewriting the scar’s story.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: closure is a fiction; stories continue. Subtext resides in the hourglass restart and spiral of sand. Final image (spiral of rings) reweights earlier motifs without moralizing. Complexity is honored; no tidy thesis is stated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric remains stable; perceptual signature is plant-tilted (“roots murmured secrets”). Compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure. No dialogue to judge; internal voice is coherent and character-specific.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic; figurative language is purposeful (meteor hush, spilled-ink silence). No loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing” zone) stays within lyrical register. High information density; every sentence advances image or stakes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: botanopathic scar-reader, coffee-ring cartography, displaced miracle as seed. Tropes are transformed through grounded specifics. The final spiral reconfiguration feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risky lyric structure heightens meaning without gimmickry.</comment>
