<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Motivation ("descend into necessary darkness") anchors interiority, but agency stays diffuse—no concrete micro-choice after stitching. Embodied ache ("luminescent ache of transformation") earns body cost, yet the portraitist’s portrait remains interior; no externalized flaw compounds the mistake. Relationship crucible absent (second character never joins). Earned stasis reads as resignation rather than active foreclosure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each shard adds density without strict causality. Closure unit (“stepped onto the tapestry… felt the luminescent ache”) provides Charged Poise with cost—the walls’ cocoon reframes prior collapse. However, the Mentor’s vanished mid-scene incident lacks on-page follow-up, and the Tower’s lingering float feels narrated rather than dramatized, blurring cause/effect clarity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Salt-crusted windows, damp stone floor, tarot box splinters anchor immediately; spatial choreography stays coherent under collapsing lighthouse. Micro-setting (tarot box stitched to parchment) constrains physical choice—she must kneel to stitch, so lighthouse geometry tightens. Sensory narrowness under collapse is character-biased rather than tourist catalog.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake (“rebuild coherence from fragments”) escalates via tactile steps—stitching, stepping. Micro-turn: inversion of staircase and sea. Cost is physical (stitched papercuts, bare feet on salt) and conceptual (world-rule rewrite). Tension peaks but the final image reframes rather than narrows options—a conceptual rather than causal crescendo.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme of fracture-as-wholeness emerges from the act of stitching, not statement. Tarot motif returns reweighted: box breaks, contents become materials for creation. Questions (“Can silence be stitched?”) pay off as non-literal image: stitched silence on eyelids. Refrains from moralizing; ambiguity sticks in the vertical sea.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Diction is painterly yet precise: “splintered edges,” “dust whispering forgotten alphabets.” Syntactic rhythm modulates with scene pressure—long cadence in rumination, clipped during “step onto the tapestry.” Slight risk of thematic echo in rhetorical questions, but they function as interior palette rather than meta-commentary. No POV drift confirmed; interiority stays intimate throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Paragraph cadence breathes; each sentence multi-tasks (description + mood + choice constraint). Minor loop: “walls began to close in” echoed twice within twenty words early, but pattern not systemic. Information density high; almost no filter verbs. Imagery maintains clarity without overwritten purple. Ending sentence “walls… still crumbling” lands crisply on closure image.</question>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: lighthouse library as collapsing metaphysical studio; tarot-as-art-supply. Collapse of reality treated via stitching rather than exposition—an organic inversion. Specificity (ozone smell after mentor vanishes) grounds abstraction. Feels inevitable that her medium must become paper + thread rather than paint. Minor tropes (tower, lighthouse) redeemed by interior execution.</question>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Her choices to stitch, step, and paint inside her eyelids drive every beat; remove artist and story ends.</question>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Broken box reassembles in closure after serving as needle-case, thread-holder, and literal frame—physical plot engine reweighted.</question>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Reality fractures directly alter available actions: staircase inverts, sea reorders, silence becomes stitchable.</question>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.5</grade>
<comment>Rhetorical questions act as prompts for imagery but lack direct decision consequence; still seed stitched-silence payoff.</question>

<question>9 E</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Redesign is the central continuous action tying every paragraph: stitching maps to world-building; remove and coherence collapses.</question>

<question>9 F</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Untangling threads literally stitches story; mechanics (pulling silver needle) govern how world can be rearranged.</question>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Library’s vertical architecture and salt-damp floor forces kneeling posture which defines sewing space—constrains options under collapse.</question>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</question>
<comment>“When the walls closed in” acts as final countdown beat but lacks tracked increments; more felt duration than clock.</question>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.0</question>
<comment>Motivation frames every risk: embrace darkness or nothing; embodied pain pays price (“pain was the price”).</question>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</question>
<comment>Tone glimmers consistently (salt, moonlight) and amplifies to luminous ache at transformation, synchronizing inside light with collapsing architecture.</question>
