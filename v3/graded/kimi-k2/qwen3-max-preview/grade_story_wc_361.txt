<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“trembling not from cold but from the weight of his absence”), yet the courier’s decisive release of the pendant feels slightly under-motivated—no prior beat shows her weighing its loss against the wonder-seed she’s just planted. Micro-choices (fork in path, handing over casket, freeing pendant) are present and escalate, but the final renunciation would land harder if earlier beats had tested her attachment more explicitly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Single-scene arc with clear orientation by line 3; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the courier releases the pendant and walks away empty-handed, cost legible in “humming a lullaby only the wind remembered.” Causal linkage holds under Accumulative/Textural lens: each beat layers resonance until the final cadence shift. One minor drift: the Hollow-Market detour is accepted without on-page friction that might sharpen the trade-off.</comment>

<comment>Frost that “sang,” lanterns “stitched from moth-wing silk,” and the pendant-as-micro-setting constrain every move; the ridgeway’s auroral glyphs literally re-route her path. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered (“sky bled violet and emerald”). Final image—pendant dissolving into the last auroral ripple—charges the closure with undeniable specificity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—deliver oracle’s last breath before dawn—tightens via the fork decision and the dawn clock. Pressure grows through the pendant’s warming pulse and the child’s wonder, but the external deadline never collides with the internal choice; the delivery completes off-stage, muting the cost of the detour. Still, the courier’s agency in choosing wonder over efficiency is legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: wonder is cultivated, not inherited, refracted through the courier’s relinquishment. Subtext in the child’s whisper (“It remembers”) and the mentor’s ghost-memory avoids overt statement. Final image reweights the premise—routine becomes myth without moralizing—earning quiet resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with rhythmic control (“boots crunching brittle frost that sang”). Perceptual signature is courier-specific: relic-handler’s tactile vocabulary, aurora-reader’s synesthetic sight. No head-hop; compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure. Dialogue is minimal but child’s line carries subtext.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; figurative language is selective, never clotted. Minor loop risk in “wonder” repetitions, but each reprise gains new charge. Sentence variety and paragraph cuts serve pacing. No line-level artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: dragonfly-wing pendant as wonder-seeding tuning fork, aurora as living text, courier as myth-gardener. Tropes are inverted—relic not hoarded but released, mentor absent yet generative. Risky quiet ending lands cleanly, reconfiguring meaning without gimmickry.</comment>
