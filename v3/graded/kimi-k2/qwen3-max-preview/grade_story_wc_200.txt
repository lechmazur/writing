<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Collector’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her micro-choice to harmonize rather than banish crystallizes her arc. Croc-tooth and flute act as extensions of motive, not props. Final “luminous ache” shows earned cost without tidy redemption. No secondary on-page characters, so relationship crucible N/A.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the gorge’s song realigns, laughter re-enters the world, and the collector’s fuller descent carries felt cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each spectral layer tightens the pattern until the final amber glow of the tooth. Orientation is immediate; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Echo Gorge is not backdrop but instrument; its warped harp resonance constrains every tactic and charges the final integration. Sensory detail is selective, wind-snag and stone-song filtered through collector’s ear. Micro-setting (tooth, flute) likewise shapes choices. No spatial drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—re-weaving laughter into sorrow—is signaled early and escalates via spectral confessions layering over harp distortion. Collector’s agency drives the softening of dissonance; cost is the ache she carries downhill. One meaningful tightening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from concrete action: grief as companion, laughter as sibling. Final giggle downstream reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext lives in tooth’s amber glow and the woman’s whispered thanks. No thematic drift or sermonizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, syntax mirroring the gorge’s cadence. No head-hopping; POV remains anchored to collector. Compression (“modestly fearless beneath a sky blushing”) is taught early and paid off. Distinct perceptual signature throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence advances image or pressure. Metaphors are coherent—harp, tooth, mercury—without purple overload. No loops or scaffold. Minor elevation in register at “luminous ache” is earned by context.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Premise of geology-as-instrument and collector-as-harmonizer feels fresh yet inevitable. Transformation of familiar grief tropes through specific sonic metaphor and embodied cost. No derivative echoes; risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
