<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“cracked bells tumbling down stone stairs”), motives are consistent, and the final renunciation is earned. The contradiction between seeking answers and refusing to speak is dramatized through the shell-cello ritual. Minor slip: the sister remains off-page, so relationship crucible is inferred rather than staged.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): she stops retelling and accepts silence, with the compass shattering as visible cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each hum layers pressure until the final image reweights the premise. Orientation is immediate; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Observatory shards, wind, and slanted light are filtered through her tactile priorities. The half-finished cello functions as micro-setting that constrains her posture and choice. Final image of glittering dust scattering over the cliff charges the ending with environmental echo.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will she keep rewriting the past or let it go—tightens with each hum until the compass needle locks downward. Agency is renunciation; cost is the shattering of her tools. No external coincidence; pressure is internal and coherent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: the riddle is not cosmic but the silence we bury. Subtext operates through gesture—cradling the cello like an infant, the shell cracking like a heart. Final hum offers non-literal, resonant answer without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet controlled, with perceptual signature in “choir of forgotten astronomers” and “thirsty parchment.” Syntax modulates with pressure—long sentences for ritual, fragments for the crack. No head-hopping; POV remains tightly interior.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; each image does double duty (“dust motes dancing in the observatory’s slanted light”). No loops or mixed metaphors. Occasional elevated diction (“ephemeral compass”) is voice-motivated and consistent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise—grief decoded through resonant objects—is fresh, not gimmicky. The shell-cello pairing feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric compression pays off in the final hum bracelet. Specificity throughout prevents template drift.</comment>
