<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority is embodied and specific; the weaver’s micro-choice to calcify her own locket at the end crystallizes her paradoxical entrapment with visible cost. Motivation remains consistent: service as both prison and purpose. No stock phrasing; the “boundary-lessly trapped” contradiction is dramatized, not declared.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the weaver’s self-calcification forecloses personal freedom while honoring duty. Causal chain holds—lamp activation, burden transfer, recursive self-application—under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Cost is legible in the final image: she lights the lamp “for herself,” sealing her own weight.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Bronze grotto, starlight, and residual lamp heat constrain every beat; the oxidized walls echo past sorrows and guide the calcifying geometry. Micro-setting (the lamp’s brass rim temperature) alters tactile choices. Final image recharges the grotto’s memory as the weaver shelves her own fossilized silence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—bearing others’ burdens—tightens when the weaver must bear her own. One meaningful deepening: after calcifying the father’s letter, she turns the lamp inward. Cost is felt in the hush that “settles over her,” narrowing future options to perpetual service.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through recursive symmetry: grief transformed into geometry, survival through crystallized sorrow. Subtext in the lamp’s unlit warmth and the weaver’s refusal to smile charges the final image. No moralizing; the ending reweights the premise that bearing pain is both prison and vocation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; fractal metaphors taught early and paid off at closure. Perceptual signature—spirals no eye could follow, whalebone reverie—remains consistent. No head-hopping; the father’s dialogue is spare, subtextual, filtered through the weaver’s stance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers sensory and emotional data without redundancy. Metaphors (drowned fireflies, hibernating leviathan) are coherent and pattern-taught. No loops or scaffold; final paragraph’s cadence mirrors the recursive fractal, crystallizing momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Transforms the trope of the sorrow-eater into a geometric ritual with specific material constraints. Fresh synthesis: calcification as compassionate crystallization, not erasure. Risk in lyric recursion pays off; the premise would collapse if any element were swapped.</comment>
