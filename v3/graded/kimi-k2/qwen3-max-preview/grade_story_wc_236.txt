<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—aromatherapist without smell—grounds every beat; her micro-choice to offer the clock to the pregnant couple crystallizes her new stance with visible cost. Ren’s status as mentor is cleanly legible, but his dialogue drifts into sage aphorism (“broken clocks still hold time”) that slightly flattens status tension. The final renunciation of scented identity is earned through tactile, auditory mapping shown in scene. Voice convergence under stress is minor but keeps this just outside 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the screw’s redefinition from clamp to fulcrum reweights Elara’s vocation under Accumulative/Textural lens, cost felt in her throat-tight swallow. Causality holds—each beat adds density to “witnessing vs. smelling” until the final bow externalizes the shift. Orientation anchored by line 3; no debt. One tightening beat suffices; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Water-clock shop body-tracks cleanly; fog and leaking reservoir echo Elara’s occluded perception while constraining her pacing. The midwife screw functions as micro-setting that alters her conceptual stance—qualifies for 9+ gate. Selective sensory detail privileges touch and sound, filtered through anosmic bias. Spatial choreography remains coherent across counter, window, and floor positions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“how to practice presence without scent”—tightens when Ren reframes the screw, foreclosing her self-fraud narrative. Escalation is textural: each image adds weight until the final offering; cost legible in her changed gait. No causal reversals required under Accumulative lens. Persistent constraint (permanent smell loss) shapes every tactic.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through tactile re-pricing of “miracle” from aromatic to witnessed; no final moralizing. Subtext resides in silent screw, fog, and cracked clock—objects that accumulate meaning without exposition. Final image of bowed offering reconfigures stakes without statement. Minor aphoristic risk in Ren’s dialogue keeps this shy of 9.5.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited adheres to Elara’s anosmic perceptual filter; syntax lengthens under contemplation, shortens during touch. No head-hopping; Ren’s interior remains opaque. Distinctive rhythmic control in “whisper of metal on metal, the drip… the distant chime.” Filter verbs are sparse and motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose density high—single sentences perform atmosphere, character, and theme. No loops or scaffold; metaphor vehicles consistent (“bronze frame open like a ribcage”). One mixed risk—“miracles threaded through this iron” verges on abstraction but saved by embodied context. Final paragraph breathes with sentence variety, no drumbeat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: anosmic aromatherapist + horological repair shop births unforced metaphor for alternative sensing. Midwife screw re-cast as fulcrum is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Risk in lyric accumulative structure pays off via coherent closure. Slight proximity to “broken clocks” trope dampens total novelty.</comment>
