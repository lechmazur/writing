<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied; the clairvoyant’s contradictory impulses (fear vs. wonder) play out in real time. Motivation to “magnify everyday magic” is stated early and re-activated at closure, though the micro-choice to accept the shadows feels slightly under-cued. Relationship pressure with the pilgrim is minimal—he functions more as mirror than crucible—so the score caps shy of 8.8.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the pearl darkens, the shadows still, and the cave’s hum re-weights the premise. Causality is accumulative/textural—each beat thickens resonance rather than narrows options—yet the final image crystallizes meaning with felt cost. Orientation is clear by line 3; no lens drift. One minor ellipsis (why the pilgrim’s eyes change) is left open but does not break causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The crystal cave is both environment and instrument: its acoustics, luminescence, and pulse directly shape every beat. Micro-setting (the pearl against skin) constrains the clairvoyant’s decision to reveal or withhold. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered—sound vibrates “through bone and breath.” Spatial choreography is clean; no white-room drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to use the pearl—tightens once when the cave responds to the pilgrim’s kneeling. Escalation is textural: each harmonic layer raises the cost of denial. Agency culminates in the clairvoyant’s quiet acceptance, foreclosing the option to banish the unseen. Cost is legible in the pearl’s extinguishing glow.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: the small, overlooked magic includes the very shadows the clairvoyant feared. Subtext operates in gesture—the pilgrim’s hand, the pearl’s silence. Final image reframes “darkness that makes the light feel brighter,” re-weighting the premise. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise; syntax mirrors the cave’s layered harmonics. POV remains tight third; no head-hop. Dialogue is spare but carries subtext (“You feel it too”). Diction stays within the clairvoyant’s lexicon; no register drift. Compression (“She hadn’t seen this”) teaches the pattern early and pays off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid; each sentence layers image and emotion. No loops, no scaffold. Metaphors are integrated—“ink spilled in water”—and never strain physical logic. Rhythm accelerates with the cave’s thrum, then softens to the final hum. One near-repeat (“she hadn’t intended… she hadn’t seen this”) is purposeful echo, not artifact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Familiar tropes—clairvoyant, crystal cave, magic pearl—are transformed through sensory specificity and thematic inversion. The unseen forces as “quiet between notes” feels fresh. Risk lies in the quiet, accumulative structure; it succeeds without gimmickry. No close echoes of famous scenes.</comment>
