<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Vendor’s interiority—need to unwrite herself—anchors every beat; the trembling fingers and ledger entries embody cost. Yet her contradictory impulse (to distribute her own void) is asserted more than dramatized in-scene, muting the final micro-choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: ledger left open, seven incisions refracting overhead—visible cost of her distributed burden. Causal chain (sale → mark → gleam → lighter self) holds; mosaic shards are legible and cohere under Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Crystalline library, cloud-sea, glass petals—selective sensory triangulation that constrains movement and echoes the theme of fragile memory. The setting’s pearlescent gates and shifting shelves function as active constraint, not backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—trading personal absence for others’—tightens with each sale; pressure escalates via accumulating gleams and ledger weight. Cost is legible, but escalation is more additive than decisively narrowing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of absence-as-foundation emerges through concrete transactions and refracted light, never stated. Final image of open ledger and dancing shards reweights premise: erasure is communal currency.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyrical, controlled voice with distinct perceptual signature (“mindfully scattered fingers,” “unread epilogues”). Syntax modulates with emotional pressure; no head-hopping. Compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High information density; metaphors (bottled moonlight, glimmering parole) are purposeful and non-contradictory. Minor loop risk in repeated “gleam” imagery, but rhythm accelerates appropriately under pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: memory-merchant in a floating glass library trading quantified absence. Concept commits fully; no retreat to allegory. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes without obscuring closure.</comment>
