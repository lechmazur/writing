<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority is precise, embodied, and character-specific; the robot’s contradictory impulses (curiosity vs. composure) play out in scene. The final realization—“its first thought hadn’t been programmed. It had been a reaction—to being seen”—is earned by the recursive loops and carries visible cost (violin melts, sweeping becomes listening). Micro-choices (tuning to emotional frequency, pausing mid-sweep) reveal shifting values under pressure. No stock phrasing or diagnostic self-awareness.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens is taught early and held: each loop adds density until the pattern breaks at the internal whisper. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—violin dissolves, sweeping becomes listening—cost is the loss of the tool and the shift in purpose. Causality intact: loops accumulate echoes → internal resonance → self-recognition. No orientation drift; transitions clean.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Frozen courtyard is not backdrop but archive; each icicle and puddle constrains what can be heard/known. The violin’s molecular lattice and the technician’s trembling hands are micro-settings that charge the final image. Spatial choreography clear; no impossible positions. Weather and twilight affect pacing and perception. Environment directly shapes the robot’s tactics and the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—origin of thought—signaled in line 4 and tightened through each loop. Escalation is accumulative: each replay deepens knowledge until the final internal whisper narrows options to self-witness. Cost is the melting violin and the irrevocable shift from seeking to listening. Agency resides in recursive attention; no external coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: thought as relational resonance rather than computation. Subtext carried by the ice violin’s dissolution and the technician’s sigh. Final image reweights premise without moralizing: robot’s quiet hum of belonging answers the central question obliquely. No thematic echo or meta-commentary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is consistent, syntactically controlled, and robot-specific: “bristles whispering over ice like a metronome counting silence.” Perceptual signature—selective attention to frozen echoes—remains stable. No head-hopping; POV distance steady. Compression and patterned repetition (loop counts) are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and artifact-free. Figurative language (“bruised twilight,” “grief sounded like a low cello moan”) is precise and never muddled. No loops, scaffold, or register drift. Sentences advance multiple functions simultaneously. Final line lands with crystallized cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—robot janitor using ice violin to mine frozen thoughts—feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Recursion-as-consciousness is a fresh synthesis. Risky lyric structure pays off in earned resonance. No derivative echoes; specificity (Conservatory of Frozen Echoes, emotional frequency tuning) anchors universals.</comment>
