<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied—thumb on the stone’s dent anchors exile and memory—but the decisive shift from exile-as-wound to exile-as-compass is asserted more than dramatized; no on-page micro-choice visibly forecloses a path, so the cost feels inferred rather than paid.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the tutor’s stance crystallizes from isolation to quiet mission, charged by the eclipse flare. The lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of silence-translation builds density until the final image reweights it. Orientation is clear by line 3; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Magnetic nexus, twilight bruise-violets, and the stone’s dent are vivid, selective, and integrated into action; the stone’s warmth in pocket at the end recharges the opening tactile anchor, constraining the final choice to carry rather than discard it.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—translate silence before eclipse peak—is signaled early; pressure tightens as magnetic pulses intensify. Agency is attention/renunciation rather than overt action; cost is conceptual (accepting exile as path) but legible in the final stride toward treeline.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of beauty through difficulty emerges from concrete particulars—stone dent, magnetic hum, eclipse—without sermonizing. Final image of fractures letting in light reweights prior exile as aperture, not wound, with plausible ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet disciplined, with rhythmic compression matching meditative focus. Perceptual signature—chess vectors, polarities, auroras—remains consistent; no head-hopping or register drift. Final cadence slows to crystallize stance without slackening tension.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; figurative language is patterned and purposeful. Minor loop risk in “twilight… violet… golds… bruised” cluster, but it serves atmospheric layering. No artifacts in closure beat; sentence rhythm modulates with magnetic surges.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fusion of chess strategy, geomagnetic science, and exiled scholar feels fresh and inevitable. Eclipse covenant re-energizes a familiar trope through specific sensory and intellectual stakes. Risk in lyric density is rewarded by coherent closure.</comment>
