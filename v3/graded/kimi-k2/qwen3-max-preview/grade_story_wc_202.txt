<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The translator’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“soles remembering rope burns”), motives escalate from personal validation to client healing, and the final micro-choice—handing over the lens—carries visible cost (loss of the memory-scent). One hairline slip: the historian’s on-page reaction is reported rather than dramatized, blunting relationship pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the historian’s stance toward grief is reweighted by the lens revelation, cost is felt in the spent amber glow and the translator’s forfeited memory. Causal chain holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens; each shard adds density until the final image crystallizes. Orientation is swift; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The alchemist’s market is tactile, selective, and purposeful—rope bridges sway like veins, gears tick like heartbeats—while the attic micro-setting (triptych, lens, table) constrains the decisive act. Sensory hierarchy mirrors the translator’s professional priorities; the final image recharges the rooftop sway in the city’s oblivious pulse.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—unfastening calcified grief—is signaled early and tightened when the lens’s amber glow forces a trade-off (memory for revelation). Agency drives escalation: translator chooses to surrender the memory, narrowing future options. Cost is visible but could be sharper if the historian’s response were on-page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: erased histories are not tragedies but living continuums. Subtext operates in the translator’s barefoot walk and the lens’s dimming—gesture over statement. Final image of the child’s crayon door reweights the premise toward hope without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with rhythmic control (“hummed with suspended lanterns and whispered barter”). Perceptual signature is consistent: the translator notices through texture, scent, and hidden brushstroke faces. No head-hopping; compression and elision are taught early and paid off in the final whisper.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; every sentence layers image, character, or atmosphere. Metaphors are coherent (“veins between towers”) and never muddle causality. One minor loop: “not merely glass; it’s an anchor…” restates prior knowledge, but it occurs early and does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The premise—trading memories for forgotten lullabies via a cracked lighthouse lens—synthesizes familiar tropes into a fresh, non-obvious angle. Specificity of the monk’s triptych and bureaucratic erasures grounds the fantastical. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
