<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied; the dye master’s contradictory impulses (to steal yet seek truth) are dramatized through tactile handling of the wing and the borrowed heartbeat. Micro-choices—watching the old man, deciding to cultivate her own fractures—are visible and costly. The final refusal to explain the fabric’s effect is an earned renunciation that forecloses the path of easy answers.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the fabric’s living shimmer crystallizes the new rule that magnetism is angle, not volume. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—each sunrise adds density until the final image reweights the premise. Cost is felt in the dye master’s silence and the patrons’ wordless tears.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The floating tea house, moss ledge, and valley mist are selective, tactile anchors that constrain movement and frame observation. The wing itself functions as micro-setting, its ridges bending light and choice. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—why some lives catch light—is signaled early and tightened through each sunrise’s micro-epiphanies. The final fabric test forces a trade-off: revelation without explanation. Pressure escalates via pattern intensification rather than causal turns, fitting the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: magnetism is the quiet explosion of authentic fracture. Subtext operates in silences, humming, and the wing’s vanishing color. The ending offers a non-literal answer—fabric that responds to gaze—without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with rhythmic control (“dazzling from one view, vanishing from another”). Perceptual signature is biased toward light and silence; no head-hopping. Compression is taught early and paid off in the final image.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; sentences often do two jobs. Figurative language is coherent—no mixed metaphors. Minor loop risk in “quietly explosive” repetition is offset by purposeful intensification.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Synthesis of donor heart, morpho wing, and floating tea house feels inevitable and fresh. The angle-of-light insight reframes familiar metaphors of authenticity. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
