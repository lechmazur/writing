<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is specific—"grief scraped her soul to marrow"—and embodied in tactile acts like burnishing coordinates with her thumb. Motive is consistent: reroute sorrow, not erase it. The final renunciation (leaving the locket unclaimed) is earned by the pattern of prior releases. Minor: no contradictory impulses shown in scene; emotion is steady rather than volatile.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the observatory curtains stir miles away, confirming her work’s resonance. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—each origami drop deepens the pattern until the final reconfiguration. Causality is intact: every release forecloses her presence yet expands the map of ache. No orientation drift; anchors clear by line 4.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Observatory’s shuttered dome and weighted silk curtains function as micro-setting that constrains visibility and choice. Brass locket and paper ephemera are handled repeatedly, their textures grounding action. Twilight-colored folds and “hum of absence” create sensory hierarchy keyed to grief. Setting evolves with each departure, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can grief be rerouted into bloom? Pressure tightens through each folded offering—every crane forecloses her own presence while widening the map of possible healing. Final tightening: she leaves the locket, accepting permanent anonymity as cost. No external antagonist; conflict is internal and cumulative.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from pattern: constructed artifacts can carry authentic weight. Subtext in the empty locket and unstated names refuses tidy moralizing. Final image—library steps, crane gone—reweights prior coordinates as living testimony. Resonance lingers without explicit statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise: “time pooled here like spilled ink” teaches the observatory’s rule. Syntax mirrors the maker’s meticulous hand—measured, tactile. No dialogue; interior monologue stays within her lexicon. Compression (“She never signed them. Never lingered.”) propels momentum.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Zero loops; every sentence advances image or motive. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful—“curtains of intention” crystallizes the setting’s agency. High density: “ephemera soaked in other people’s endings” compresses grief, economy, and ritual. Rhythm modulates with scene needs; no scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—mourning jewelry maker mapping grief via origami coordinates—feels fresh yet inevitable. Tropes of “breadcrumbs for the broken” and “withering to bloom” are transformed through tactile craft. Specificity of receipt paper, wristbands, and exact coordinates grounds the concept. Risk in quiet ending pays off with resonant reconfiguration.</comment>
