<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is sensorially rich and embodied; the absorption of languages through skin is dramatized in each beat. The final renunciation—leaving the ring—earns its cost because every prior step was guided by its pull. Yet the arc tilts toward epiphany rather than contradiction, missing a deeper internal clash.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the stillpoint reconfigures meaning and the ring’s glow absorbs silence with undeniable conceptual cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds; each musical breadcrumb intensifies until the final cadence shift. Orientation is swift and the mosaic shards cohere.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ultrasonic forest is not backdrop but instrument: trees vibrate at frequencies that guide her feet and constrain tactics. The platinum ring and moss beneath it act as micro-settings that charge the final image. Spatial choreography is precise; every chime and pulse is anchored in place.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding the stillpoint to map emotional depths—is signaled early and tightened by each absorbed note. The cost is felt when silence swallows the forest’s thrum and she leaves the ring behind. One deepening suffices; no reversals are needed under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the equation of grief and joy as harmonics of one note; no moral is stated. The final vowel-shaped gratitude arises from the concrete experience of silence. Subtext lives in the ring’s faint glow and the forest’s resumed song.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; perceptual signature is tactile and synesthetic. Patterned elision (“languages lived in her nerves”) is taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; the blind mapmaker’s inner ear remains the sole focalizer.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers sensory and emotional information. No loops or scaffold; metaphors stay coherent. The final line’s “vowel shaped like gratitude” crystallizes without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses synesthesia, cartography, and sonic ecology into an inevitable whole. The stillpoint as absence rather than monument is a fresh inflection. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
