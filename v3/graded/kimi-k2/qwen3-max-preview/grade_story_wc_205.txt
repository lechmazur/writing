<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The revolutionary’s shift from militant to translator is embodied in tactile micro-choices—fingering the shard, covering mirrors—each charged with visible cost; his contradictory impulses (restore vs. reimagine) coexist in scene, not summary. The final renunciation of triumph for translation is earned by prior causality and carries felt loss.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the storm-mirror method crystallizes a new stance—“alive…in translation”—with undeniable conceptual cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds; each lyrical beat deepens the stake of remembering until the final haiku reweights the entire arc.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid salon, low-gravity dust, and chrono-wind are selective, purposeful, and filter through the POV’s grief; the shard and mirror-coverings act as micro-settings that constrain tactics and charge the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“against forgetting”—tightens through each accumulative beat; the mirror-covering tactic narrows options and forces the crystallized stance. Cost is legible in the final haiku’s surrender of triumph for stewardship.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the revolutionary’s arc: memory as rebellion, translation as legacy. The final image reframes prior violence into quiet custodianship without moralizing, inviting reflection through purposeful ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct lyric texture—compressed haiku, synesthetic chrono-wind, velvet comet-tail silk—remains consistent and character-bound. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is sharp and pressure-responsive.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid; figurative language is patterned and purposeful, never muddled. Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Final haiku lands with crystalline clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</question>
<comment>The synthesis of visible time, mirror superstition, and shard linguistics feels inevitable and fresh; the transformation of a fallen revolutionary into a custodian of lost syntax is a non-obvious angle executed with conceptual integrity.</comment>
