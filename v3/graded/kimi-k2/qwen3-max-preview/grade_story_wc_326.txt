<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aris’s contradictory state—legally dead yet biologically alive—drives every micro-choice; the porcelain shard as tactile anchor and the heartbeat count as embodied cost keep interiority concrete. Motivation (“fetch wisdom from failure”) is dramatized, not declared, through the defragmentation ritual. Final renunciation of redemption in favor of honoring residue lands as earned stasis with visible sting of shard against palm.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single-scene arc under Accumulative/Textural lens: ink-bloom pattern teaches itself early and culminates in Resonant Reconfiguration—ghosts “arranged, not fixed.” Orientation anchors by line 3; no causality breaks. Closure beat (“wisdom…in the honoring of its residue”) carries undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Observatory’s frost-laden opal dome, marble floor, and dormant consoles constrain barefoot movement and focus perception. Snowdrift pressure and crystalline instruments mirror internal stasis. Porcelain shard functions as micro-setting that charges final image. Selective sensory hierarchy (cold, ozone, burnt sugar) supports urgency without clutter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—retrieve wisdom from systemic failure—tightens through escalating ink pattern that forces stance crystallization: accept imperfection rather than repair it. No external antagonist needed; pressure is coherent and internal. Cost is the sting of shard and the irreversible bureaucratic death.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the residue of error: “Failure…is the seam where truth leaks out.” Subtext carried by ink mandala and porcelain sliver avoids moralizing. Final image reweights premise without statement—wisdom found in honoring fracture, not erasing it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited voice maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature is precise, scientific yet haunted (“frost feathered the glass like breath on a mirror”). Syntax modulates with pressure—long lyrical sentences calm, fragments spike during ink climax. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language disciplined to pattern (frost, neural branches, star maps) without overwriting. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Sentence rhythm mirrors heartbeat count. Clean mechanics; only minor filter-verb clusters in reflective beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fusion of bureaucratic death error with digital ghost archaeology feels fresh; trope inversion grounds cosmic stakes in intimate shard. Risky lyric accumulation pays off in final mandala. Specificity of “opal dome under three meters of snow” anchors universals. No derivative echoes.</comment>
