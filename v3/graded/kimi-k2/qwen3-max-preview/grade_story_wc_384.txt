<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elira’s interiority is rich and embodied—her trembling fingers, the thorn pricking her thumb—but the final beat of “wisely released” feels slightly over-articulated, nudging the score below 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The causal chain is airtight: stolen thorn → forged clause → scroll exhales → drought ends. Closure lands as Earned Stasis with visible cost (key dissolves, thorn roots itself), satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The marble sanctuary’s aurora, dripping stalactites, and rose-bud finale constrain every move and charge the final image; no detail is ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Pressure tightens through each stroke of the brush; the scroll’s resistance and the accelerating drip create a single, meaningful escalation culminating in irreversible release.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The theme of absolving inherited guilt emerges organically from the altered scroll; the final unfurling rose offers a resonant, non-moralizing answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The lyrical third-person voice is consistent, textured, and character-biased; no head-hopping or register drift, even under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; only a single near-loop (“stalactites drip” repetition) keeps it from a perfect 9.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The fusion of calligraphy-as-magic, comet-glass keys, and guilt-bound ecology feels inevitable and fresh; no stock fantasy scaffolding.</comment>
