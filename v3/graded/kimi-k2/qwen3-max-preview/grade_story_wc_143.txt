<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The inspector’s quiet ache to witness and her decision to keep vigil rather than merely document are embodied in micro-choices (brushing frost, lowering camera, whispering farewell). The interior contradiction—wanting to archive yet refusing to look back—charges the final image with felt cost. No secondary characters on page, so relationship crucible waived. Earned renunciation lands cleanly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the inspector’s stance crystallizes from documentation to elegy, foreclosing any future return. Causal linkage holds—chemical timer, thermal spike, grain fall—each beat narrows options until silence claims the summit. Orientation anchored by 3rd paragraph; no drift. Cost is legible in the whispered “You outlasted them all.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Regolith crunch, visor fog, and thermal spike at dawn constrain action and timing; the hourglass itself functions as micro-setting that dictates the final beat. Selective sensory hierarchy (visual, then imagined hiss) mirrors narrowing attention under pressure. No spatial drift; bodies and objects track cleanly. Environment charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—bearing witness to the last message—tightens once: from photographing to keeping vigil. Agency shifts from data-gathering to elegy at the moment the grain dissolves; cost is the unbridgeable gap between message and audience. Pressure coheres under Accumulative/Textural lens; no coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through the hourglass’s chemical elegy: ingenuity that outlives its audience. Subtext in the label “Beauty intact” and the unheard harmonic resonance reframes human persistence as both triumph and futility. No final moralizing; resonance arises from the empty auditorium image. Complexity lingers without tidy resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Distinct perceptual signature: professional precision (“cryo-stabilized film”) braided with lyrical melancholy (“dawnlit melancholy”). Syntax modulates—long reflective sentences compress into the spare final whisper. No dialogue, so voice coherence judged through interior texture alone. Register consistent with solitary lunar technician.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>High density: “chemical sigh meant to outlast its audience” performs three jobs—metaphor, exposition, thematic weight. Rhythm breathes with scene needs; no loops or scaffold. Metaphors are precise (vacuum as auditorium). Final line resolves by image that recharges earlier motifs. Zero artifacts in closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise—obsolete lunar hourglass releasing a message no one can hear—is non-obvious and executed with scientific specificity. Tropes of abandoned tech and last witness are transformed through chemical elegy and unheard harmonic. Risk in quiet ending pays off via Charged Poise. Specificity anchors universality; story would collapse if relocated.</comment>
