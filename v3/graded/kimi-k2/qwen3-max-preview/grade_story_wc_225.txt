<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is textured and embodied (“fingers fidgeted productively,” “trembled—not from fear, but from recognition”), and the final stance is earned by the prior winnowing. The only minor drag is the backstory paragraph, which slightly dilutes present pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the mirror accepts “I see you,” the fog dissolves, and the village exhales—cost is the irrevocable self-witness. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds; pattern of tapestry-mending mirrors interior repair and tightens meaning without causal reversals.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Platinum labyrinth and time-frozen village are anchored early and constrain every move; the “woven hush” itself becomes a tactile antagonist. Final image of rain coaxing seeds re-weights the frozen world—setting actively participates in closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—self-forgiveness—tightens through each tapestry decoded; each frayed thread narrows her options until the mirror confrontation. Cost is felt in the irrevocable self-recognition; no coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of absolution through pattern and repair emerges organically; no moralizing, only the quiet re-knitting of threads and self. Final rain image reweights the entire frozen world without stating a lesson.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with rhythmic control that modulates under pressure. No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains the tutor’s chess-attuned noticing. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing”) is earned by context.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances image, character, or atmosphere. Metaphors are coherent and purposeful; no figurative muddle in peak beats. Read-aloud rhythm is supple and intentional.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fusion of chess logic, tapestry repair, and suspended-time village feels fresh and inevitable. Risky lyric compression pays off in the final reconfiguration; no derivative scaffolding.</comment>
