<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied; the compass rose warms against her chest, the pencil stroke “stitches time.” Contradictory impulses—stay/leave, record/accept—co-exist in scene. The final renunciation (closing the book, turning away) carries visible cost: she forfeits re-entry to “normalcy.” Only minor slip: the grandmother’s aphorism drifts toward label-speak, blunting edge.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: sketching the violet filament reconfigures her stance from confusion to curator-of-the-unmappable, cost paid in permanent exile. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each charcoal stroke layers density until the sky “breathes differently.” Orientation anchored by 80-word mark; no teleporting props. One hairline lapse: “echoed silence” is named twice in adjacent sentences, a micro-loop that slightly dulls the final cadence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Time-dilation deck, frost-misted glass, and chronal-charged compass rose constrain every choice; she can’t leave without abandoning her tools. Star-smears and “hollow resonance” integrate into action—she steadies wrist against the glass to draw. Spatial choreography clean: body, pad, pencil, filament tracked without drift. Environment directly charges the final image: the deck’s silence turns companionable only after the sketch absorbs the anomaly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—turn confusion into exploration—tightens when the violet filament appears: witness or ignore. One meaningful deepening: sketching it commits her to permanent pariah status. Cost legible: she forfeits escape to normal time. Pressure stays accumulative; no causal reversals required. Could edge higher if the filament had counter-agency that fought the pencil; as is, escalation is steady but one-directional.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from particulars: family sky-mapping custom mutates into cartography of temporal rupture. Final image—closed sketchbook, companionable silence—reweights “true north” as internal curiosity rather than celestial fix. No moralizing; resonance lives in the act of witnessing. Ambiguity lingers: did the sketch stabilize time or merely honor its distortion? Complexity intact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise: “stars wheeled overhead in slow, silent arcs,” “temporally stretched like taffy.” Perceptual signature filters cosmos through draftsmanship—light is “teardrop of brilliance,” silence has texture. Rhythm modulates with pressure: long cadences stretch, then shorten when the filament appears. No head-hopping; diction stays within her artisan lexicon. A single cadence hiccup (“echoed silence” echo) keeps it from perfect.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry triple duty: sensory data, emotional charge, world rule. No paraphrase loops; each metaphor extends the temporal metaphor without contradiction. Strong verbs—“glided,” “smear,” “stitch”—propel. One strained vehicle: “frozen fire” for starlight on brass is mixed, but recovered immediately. Closure line breathes cleanly, no scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Familiar trope—lone survivor after time-stop—made specific through ancestral star-sketching ritual and charcoal-as-stitch praxis. Compass rose that pulses to heartbeat而非magnetism refreshes the wayfinding motif. Risk: lyric stillness over plot kinetics, yet coherence holds. Transformation test fails if names change, proving the concept is now irreducible to generic.</comment>
