<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elric’s contradictory impulses are rendered in lyrical, embodied detail (“apprentice of wonder” against the physical slog up the spire). The internal shift from conquest to surrender is foreshadowed and paid—“heart drumming a rhythm older than kingdoms”, then kneels in reverence—yet a slight summary gloss on learning chess language flattens immediacy by half a beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands: the decisive act is the final swap that reconfigures the living sky and world below. Cause trails cleanly from command ↦ swap ↦ sky mends; cost is visible as Elric’s spent exhaustion and relinquished “old truths”. Drive lens (Causal with lyrical texture) holds across the ascent, swap sequence, and denouement—no leaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The spire, Obsidian Table, and sundial each constrain movement and decision (brass lid reveals swap command; table governs the real stakes). Specificity of wind-taste and fracturing ice never stumbles into set-piece wallpaper; instead, every detail either guides Elric’s grip or reflects tension in the mutable sky.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.2</question><comment>Dominant stake—whether the wrong sky will right itself or collapse further—grows through physical fatigue and moral choice until the swap narrows options irrevocably. Each step up the spire tightens the rope between playfulness and world-shaping consequence; price—Elric’s relinquished treasures and lifelong study—is paid on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The work marries theme to motif: the urge to play with the unknown becomes literal as cosmic chess is remade. No overt statement preaches; instead, the lullaby echo and righted heavens reweight the central question. The aftereffect lingers in quiet exhilaration rather than dogma.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</question>
<comment>Lyrical third-person limited stays close to Elric’s perceptual signature—“breath sharp as glass”, “static and snow on tongue”—without slipping omniscience. Syntax flexes naturally from climbing urgency to near-liturgical release. Pronoun and anchor clarity never wobble.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Rhythm scales with altitude and stakes; climactic swap glides without scaffolding. Small stutters—“hand-carved by long-dead sages” followed immediately by “hand-carved from moonwood” (adjacent echo that repeats concept)—shave only a hair from otherwise polished ear and propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</question>
<comment>The heist-gone-mystical genre is twisted into a non-violent prayer game whose outcome is rewriting cosmology. Fresh inflection: swapping secrets inside chess pieces becomes literal engine of reality repair. One point lost only because the chivalrous thief archetype remains recognizable, albeit deepened.</comment>
