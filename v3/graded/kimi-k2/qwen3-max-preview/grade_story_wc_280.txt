<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The ghost’s yearning for encore and refusal to fade is vividly embodied; her final choice to release herself into the orchard’s sapling carries visible cost. Interiority is synesthetic and specific, but the absence of contradictory impulse in-scene keeps it from 9+. Motivation is coherent and escalates to the climactic renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the ghost’s self-dispersal into the sapling reconfigures possibility for others, with felt cost in her vanishing. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of echoes and blossoms taught early tightens to final cadence. Orientation is clear within 120 words; no causal breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The orchard’s fracturing timelines and synesthetic flora are selective, purposeful, and constrain the ghost’s tactics; the fountain and sapling charge the final image. Spatial choreography remains coherent despite magic. Environment is indispensable to closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—luring possibility from despair—tightens when the ghost spins the coin and chooses release; the cost is her own dissolution. Escalation is driven by her agency under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of art’s afterlife and generational transmission emerges through concrete echoes and the sapling’s bloom; no moralizing. Final image reweights prior motifs without statement. Subtext in the coin’s silence and the ghost’s whispered “Grow” resonates.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical, synesthetic voice is consistent and character-bound; patterned elision (“not with feet but with echoes”) is taught early and paid off. No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates with emotional intensity. Distinct perceptual signature throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet clear; metaphors serve atmosphere without muddle. Rhythm accelerates into the final release. Minor loop risk in “echoes” repetition is offset by purposeful patterning. No artifacts touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise of a post-burned opera ghost seeding future performers through synesthetic orchard is fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric structure pays off in closure. Transformation of familiar ghost trope through specific lived detail and cost.</comment>
