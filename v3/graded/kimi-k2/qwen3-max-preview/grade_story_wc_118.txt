<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The historian’s interiority is rich and embodied—her fingertips “reading whispers,” her palm sensing the wall’s hum—yet her decisive pivot to descend and weave is announced rather than dramatized, muting the cost of that choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the historian’s new purpose crystallizes with felt cost (“she would learn to weave…with testimony”). The causal chain from diary phrase to tapestry insight to tomorrow’s descent is legible and tight under an Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The reclaimed silo’s cold hearth, ash, and humming walls are vivid and selective; the tapestry fragment functions as micro-setting that constrains her final choice, charging the ending image with literal faint glow.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—mending the world’s torn causality through story—tightens once the diary links the displaced axis to the tapestry’s dragons; the cost is the historian’s irrevocable commitment to descend into the underlibrary, foreclosing a life of mere observation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: memory as living thread, stories as stitches in a wounded cosmos. The final smile and glowing dragons reweight the premise without moralizing, leaving a resonant afterimage of fragile hope.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with a perceptual signature attuned to tactile whispers and temporal slippage; rhythmic control supports the bronze-quiet tone without ever drifting into purple excess.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; figurative language is disciplined, metaphors coherent. Only minor scaffold (“she often stared…”) and a paraphrase loop around “waiting” slightly dull momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of medieval tapestry dragons as cosmic repair-weavers with a post-human librarian-mender is fresh, inevitable, and risk-taking; no close echoes, and the concept commits fully without gimmickry.</comment>
