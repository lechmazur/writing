<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied—knees buckling, trembling precision—yet the final shift from fear to resolve feels slightly under-motivated; the “why now” hinge is implied rather than dramatized. The aromatic caution trait is consistently applied and visibly constrains action. The micro-choice to repurpose the UV lamp crystallizes values, but the cost of that repurposing is more asserted than felt on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the empty vial glowing from resonance reweights the entire premise under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The pattern of scent → memory → visible glyph is taught early and paid off in the final image with undeniable conceptual cost. No orientation drift; greenhouse anchors are clear within the first 120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The greenhouse is not mere backdrop; its preserved extinct plants supply the moral pressure that forces the UV reveal. Micro-setting details—glass panes, moss-stained tiles—constrain movement and echo internal brittleness. The UV beam slicing the mist becomes the final charged image, fulfilling the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will she dare uncork grief?—is signaled early and tightened by the single act of opening the vial. The visible glyphs crystallize the cost: once released, the memories cannot be re-bottled. Escalation is driven by her agency under the Accumulative lens; no external coincidence intrudes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: grief as curator, not enemy. The final line reframes the entire narrative without moralizing. Subtext operates in the silent glow of the empty vial, which reweights every prior beat. No thematic echo in dialogue; insight is earned through embodied experience.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; perceptual signature filters every detail through olfactory caution. Syntax modulates with pressure—long sentences for reverie, fragments for shock. No head-hopping; POV remains tightly interior. Occasional elevated diction (“aromatically cautious”) is justified by character expertise.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers scent, memory, and light without redundancy. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is disciplined to the olfactory motif. Final paragraph’s cadence mirrors the settling of perfume, achieving closure rhythmically.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of olfactory memory, UV revelation, and grief brokerage feels inevitable yet fresh. The extinct-plant greenhouse repurposed as a cathedral of revelation is a non-obvious angle that heightens stakes. Risk in lyric compression pays off; no derivative templates detected.</comment>
