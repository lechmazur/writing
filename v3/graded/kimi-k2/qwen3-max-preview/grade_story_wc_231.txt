<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the Edelweiss acts as a charged object that tilts his stance. The final renunciation—keeping the truth from the sea—earns its cost through prior causality. Minor slip: “softly persistent” is asserted more than dramatized in micro-choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the lantern beam reconfigures meaning while foreclosing official report. Accumulative/Textural lens holds; gaps in waves and mist tighten stakes without causal turns. Cost is legible in the final image—truth withheld, isolation endured.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Opal dock and mist constrain Silas’s ritual stance; the Edelweiss functions as micro-setting that charges the final photograph pairing. Sensory selection is POV-filtered and purposeful. One minor drift: “pearlescent planks” edges toward ornament.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—decode the stranger’s gesture—tightens through nightly ritual until memory shard reweights it. Agency is attentional; cost is the decision to guard rather than reveal. No visible material loss, so just shy of 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of borrowed memory emerges from concrete handling of objects and gaps; final image reframes the Edelweiss as testament without moralizing. Subtext in the photograph pairing carries conceptual cost. Resists tidy closure while remaining coherent.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct, coastal-gothic, lyric yet precise; perceptual signature in “salt clinging to abandoned gloves.” Rhythm modulates with pressure; no head-hopping. Compression like “mist curled around his ankles like a question” teaches pattern early and pays off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density—“the sigh in a rusted hinge” does triple duty. Metaphors are coherent and grounded. One near-purple line “shimmered under a veil of mist” but context justifies. Closure image is clean and propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: alpine Edelweiss carried to maritime death, decoded through sensory gaps. Transformation test passes—story collapses without this pairing. Slight risk in lyric mode pays off; no close echoes detected.</comment>
