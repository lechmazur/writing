<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Kael’s contradictory impulses—surrender vs. re-engagement—are embodied in the silent handling of the jar; the final renunciation of ownership is earned by prior interior struggle. Micro-choice of placing palms to glass crystallizes the shift from numbness to presence. The duplicate’s refusal to inherit pain provides external pressure that alters Kael’s stance. Interiority stays concrete, avoiding label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the custody battle dissolves because Kael relinquishes claim, visible cost is the loss of any future self to inhabit. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—tension built through harmonic layering of opposites until the final image reweights meaning. Orientation is taught early; temporal disorientation serves the metaphysical frame. No causality breaks; history-rewrite rule stays consistent.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The floating rock dojo’s moss-slick stones and ink-black cloud sea anchor space and mood; the jar’s bioluminescent pulse becomes micro-setting that constrains the final act. Sensory selection narrows to touch and light under crisis. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly as the duplicate steps from unbroken glass. Environment mirrors internal thaw without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—defeat emotional numbness—tightens when vivifying the brain threatens to re-imprison Kael in identity. One decisive deepening: the duplicate’s spoken refusal forces Kael to surrender ownership, foreclosing the path of self-reclamation. Cost is the permanent absence of a reclaimed ego. Pressure grows through harmonic accumulation, not coincidence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of self-ownership versus self-transcendence emerges from the custody battle’s dissolution; no direct statement, only the final image of light-bodied potential. Subtext resides in silence and relinquishment. The duplicate’s “I do not want to inherit it” reframes prior pain without moralizing. Resonance lingers in the quiet glow of presence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric, compressed, and consistent; patterned elision (“surrendered his name, his face, even his memories”) is taught early and paid off. Perceptual signature is meditative, selective, and character-bound. Dialogue from Lira and Torvin carries subtext but remains brief and functional. No head-hopping; POV distance stays interior to Kael.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid; metaphoric layering (“synapses igniting in cascades that painted fractal auroras”) is purposeful and peaks at closure. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or pressure. Rhythm modulates with emotional intensity. Occasional elevated diction fits the metaphysical register without register drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise synthesizes ego death, clone custody, and harmonic balance into a fresh metaphysical fable. Risky structure—floating dojo, rewriting history—heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specificity of the duplicate stepping from unbroken glass feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Transformation test: story collapses if any core element is swapped.</comment>
