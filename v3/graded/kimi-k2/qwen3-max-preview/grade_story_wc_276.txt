<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority is embodied and consistent; the fisher’s transliterating trait and cool-headed stance manifest in micro-choices (shaping silence, matching feral pitch). Motivation—catching the goddess’s echo—drives every beat. Final renunciation (carrying, not capturing) is earned and carries felt cost. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in scene, preventing 9+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the echo is released into constellations, reweighting the garden’s grief. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density and cadence tighten until the spike cracks. Orientation is immediate; causality holds. Cost is legible in the garden’s shudder and the spike’s fracture.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Sound wave garden is vivid, selective, and purposeful; every sonic detail constrains movement or supplies resource (sonic strata, choral ferns). Rail spike functions as micro-setting/tool that charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy reflects fisher’s priorities. Spatial choreography is coherent throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—recovering the goddess’s echo—is signaled early and escalates via sonic dissonance and feral lullaby. One decisive tightening: slamming the spike to conduct the buried bass. Cost is visible in shattered chime-blooms and the spike’s destruction. Agency remains with the fisher; no external rescue.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of grief-as-tide emerges through sonic imagery and constellations’ lullaby. Subtext operates in silence-shaping and negative-space lures. Final image of constellations turning gold reframes loss as transference, not possession. Avoids moralizing; resonance lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric, compressed, and consistent; perceptual signature is fisher-specific (transliterating emotions into phonemes). No head-hopping. Syntax and rhythm modulate with pressure—short, percussive clauses during rupture. Diction remains within plausible lexicon. Patterned elision (e.g., “voicing silence”) is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, propulsive, and free of loops. Metaphors are precise (“feral lullaby,” “acoustic wrath”). No filter-verb stacks or register drift. Sentence rhythm accelerates at climax. Final line crystallizes without scaffold. Minor purple flourish in “geyser of broken glass” but does not obscure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Premise—fisher harvesting goddess-echoes via sonic gardening—is non-obvious and fully committed. Tropes (quest, lullaby, constellations) are transformed through acoustic physics and emotional transliteration. Specificity of rail spike and silence-lure creates irreplaceable texture. Risky lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
