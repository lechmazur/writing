<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The titan’s exile, patience, and refusal of the crown are embodied through tactile micro-choices (ink pellet, marginalia, final renunciation). Interior contradiction—grief versus duty—surfaces in the hollow echo of justice. The earned renunciation carries visible cost: she leaves the throne and her people’s adoration. Minor slip: “regally unpretentious” is label-adjacent, though later actions redeem it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the dissolved ink reveals the usurper and reweights the meaning of every hidden rune. Causal chain—riddle placement → librarian discovery → font revelation—holds without gaps. Cost is legible in the titan’s refusal to rule and the people’s belated shame. Mosaic shards (temple, alcove, gallery) are taught early and converge cleanly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The temple library’s dust, starlight, and “books like tombstones” constrain stealth and supply hiding places for messages. The iron gall pellet itself becomes micro-setting when its dissolution in the sacred font alters the coronation ritual. Spatial choreography is coherent: vaulted halls → alcove → gallery. Sensory detail is selective, filtered through the titan’s exile-sharpened attention.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—unmask the pretender—is signaled in paragraph three and tightened through each hidden rune. Agency is exercised via cryptic placement, not force; the final revelation narrows options for both titan and populace. Cost is felt in the titan’s renunciation and the people’s self-reproach. One meaningful escalation: ink in font turns ritual into exposure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: truth as mirror, not weapon. Subtext operates in the lullaby-riddle and the unclaimed crown. Final line—“The crown is not worn. It is carried”—reweights every prior image without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: the titan’s departure and the remaining ink pellet suggest vigilance, not triumph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric, compressed, and consistent: “scaled fingers brushing cracked marble,” “ink bleeding through parchment.” Perceptual signature is exile-attuned—silent constellations, dust older than kingdoms. No head-hopping; focalization stays locked to the titan until the final witness paragraph. Rhythm modulates with pressure: longer cadences for stealth, clipped finality for renunciation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image, motive, and stakes. Figurative language is disciplined—no mixed metaphors. Minor scaffold: “dust motes danced in starlight older than kingdoms” edges ornate but serves atmosphere. Zero loops or synonym churn. Final paragraph crystallizes without clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fantasy tropes—exiled heir, usurper, secret ink—are transformed through the rune-of-drift concept and the titan’s refusal to reclaim power. Specificity of method (marginal ciphers, vellum-wrapped pellet) makes the premise fresh. Risky lyric compression pays off: the ending’s quiet renunciation feels inevitable yet non-generic. No close echoes of famous scenes.</comment>
