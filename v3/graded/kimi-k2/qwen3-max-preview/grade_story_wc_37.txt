<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The keeper’s interiority is vivid—her half-remembered lullabies and barefoot climb embody her fractured mind—but her decisive shift from curator to loom is asserted more than dramatized; the final beat lacks a micro-choice that shows her paying the cost of letting the realm sing through her.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration: the mica releases light and the realm re-weaves itself. Causality is lyrical (Accumulative/Textural lens), each added voice tightening the pattern until the dawn unfurls; the cost is the keeper’s surrender of sole agency, felt in the line “She had not fixed the world. She had reminded it how to hold itself.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The greenhouse’s mica panes and dew-kissed moss are not mere backdrop; the mica hoards light and then yields it, directly constraining the climax. Sensory detail is selective—starlight in moss, citrus bark etched with runes—filtered through the keeper’s memory-starved perception.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Single dominant stake: rekindle communal dreaming. Pressure escalates via accumulating voices joining the song; each new singer tightens the weave, foreclosing silence as an option. The cost is the realm’s relinquishment of isolation, crystallized when the windows crack open.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: shared song as social fabric. The woven dawns shift from shattered fragments to living tapestry without moralizing; the final image of mirrors reflecting “what was reclaimed” reweights the premise, letting resonance do the work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Lyrical third-person limited stays close to the keeper’s sensorium—glowing moss, cool mica under palms—without head-hopping. Syntax lengthens and breathes with the rising chorus, then contracts into the quiet coda, mirroring the musical arc.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid; metaphors (light “hoarded like fireflies pinned behind crystal”) are purposeful and patterned. Minor loop risk in repeated “woven” and “swaddle,” but rhythm modulates under pressure and no artifact clouds the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The mirror-world greenhouse where reflections breathe feels fresh, yet the core insight—collective song as dawn-weaving—is grounded in human need. Risk lies in the lyrical mode itself; it pays off by making the fantastical emotionally inevitable.</comment>
