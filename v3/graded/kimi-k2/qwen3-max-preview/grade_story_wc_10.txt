<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is embodied and specific—her silent grief and resolve manifest in tactile micro-choices (warming the fork, pressing it to bone). The “heat-mapping” method is a credible extension of her expertise; the final smile and palm-to-floor gesture crystallize her earned stance. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, so the 9+ quick test is narrowly missed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the conservatory’s “silent music” reweights the premise that silence equals absence. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—each fork strike layers resonance until the final image of dawn-glow warmth. Cost is palpable in her wordless endurance and the irreversible loss of audible sound.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The winterglass conservatory is not backdrop but instrument: ice beams, frozen vines, and skylight snowflakes all respond to her strikes. Spatial choreography is exact—fountain to alcove to eastern archway—while the thermal overlays tether perception to her POV. The final sunlit glass charges the closing image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove silence is not emptiness—tightens through each fork activation; each vibration forecloses the option of giving up. Agency is cumulative rather than causal, but the final dawn-glow is earned. Cost is felt in irreversible muteness and solitary labor.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the concrete act of “translating” emotion into resonance; no abstract moralizing. The final image of silent, radiant music offers a non-literal answer: presence persists beneath absence. Subtext lives in gesture and thermal color rather than statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited remains tightly anchored to her perceptions; diction is spare, tactile, and frost-edged. No dialogue appears, so voice is carried by rhythmic, sensory syntax that modulates with pressure. The perceptual signature—thermal blooms, bone conduction—is distinct and consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is lean yet lyrical; every sentence advances image or resonance. No loops, no mixed metaphors. Sentence lengths vary to mimic the slow thrum she feels at the end. Figurative language is sparse and precise—“fossilized laughter,” “paused notes.”</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The tuning-fork alchemy of emotion-into-resonance is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis. Familiar tropes—post-apocalyptic quiet, lone survivor—are transformed through her scientific-mystical method and the thermal mapping conceit. Risky lyric compression pays off in the final auroral warmth.</comment>
