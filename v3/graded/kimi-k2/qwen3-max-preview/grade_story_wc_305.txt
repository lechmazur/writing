<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is rich and embodied; the hairpin’s reinsertion crystallizes a credible shift from caretaker to self-reclaimer. The forgiveness beat is summarized rather than dramatized, muting the cost of that choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single-scene arc under Accumulative/Textural lens: the climb → grotto → descent pattern tightens toward the hairpin’s return, a Charged Poise that reweights identity. Closure is legible and carries felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The oak and grotto are sensuously anchored and constrain every move; mist and stone act as tactile pressure. Micro-setting (hairpin as relic) charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reclaiming contentment—escalates through the climb and grotto stillness; the hairpin’s reinsertion forecloses lingering resentment. Pressure is coherent, though external stakes remain abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of cyclical rebirth emerges via embodied ritual (climb, scallop, descend) rather than statement. Final image of descending with “scalloped peace” offers resonant, non-literal closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Lyric, controlled third-person limited; perceptual signature is tactile and arboreal. Rhythm modulates with ascent tension and grotto hush without head-hop or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; metaphors (vineyard hush, wine settling) serve mood without clutter. One paraphrase loop (“carrying…carrying…carrying”) in final paragraph docks minor points.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Familiar grief-healing arc is refreshed by arboreal ascension as cognitive ritual and the scallop conceit. Specificity of caretaker vocation and heirloom hairpin elevate it above template.</comment>
