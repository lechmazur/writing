<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied—drumming on shins, ribs, air—showing contradictory impulses (surrender vs. rebellion) in real time. The shift from passive survivor to active weaver is earned through micro-choices that accumulate cost: each percussive beat rejects the garden’s sedation and invites the entangled to co-author the dream. The only drag is a trace of therapeutic self-diagnosis (“loneliness would multiply inside her like cells in a petri dish”) that momentarily flattens the visceral into the clinical.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the garden keeps the rhythm after she stops, proving the dream now lives outside her body—undeniable conceptual cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout; each drumming beat thickens pattern until the lagoon’s light and garden’s harmony reweight the stake from isolated endurance to shared creation. Orientation is swift—starlight, lagoon rim, experimental subject—within the first 50 words. No causal break; every escalation is a because/therefore of sonic rebellion meeting engineered tranquility.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sound-wave garden and auric lagoon are not backdrop but instrument: every touch triggers chimes, vines, ribs of sculpture that harmonize with her rhythm, directly constraining and enabling the final co-creation. Micro-setting (her own ribs, mossy stone) doubles as tactile anchor. Starlight and liquid-light lagoon refract the 27 faces, charging the final image with irreplaceable visual cost. Spatial choreography is immaculate—perch, sink, drift, return—bodies and sonic objects tracked without drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will the entangled memories drown or sing?—tightens through each percussive refusal: garden’s sedation vs. her drumming. One meaningful deepening occurs when the lagoon’s light climbs her ankles, foreclosing passive observation; she must either drown or conduct. Cost is visible: the garden seizes her rhythm, proving the shared dream can survive without her pulse—permanent externalization of private rebellion. Agency remains hers throughout; no coincidence resolves the tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of borrowed belonging becoming co-authored life emerges solely through image and action—no thesis statements. The drumming motif migrates from solitary protest to collective heartbeat, reweighting “isolation cured” into “isolation transformed.” Final non-literal answer: shared dream is not escape but instrument the world keeps playing after she rests. Subtext resides in silence—when she stops, the garden continues—implying creation no longer needs her suffering as fuel.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third-person lyric remains tight to Gamma-7’s perceptual filter: she notices frequencies, ribs, star-blink like distant monitors. Syntax mirrors cardiac rhythm—long liquid sentences under starlight, staccato fragments when drumming. No head-hop; garden’s “voice” is conveyed through observable harmonic response, not interior trespass. Register stays within plausible post-lab survivor idiom; no academic drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm is musical without metronomic monotony; sentence length modulates with breath of scene. Figurative language is dense yet coherent—auroras trapped in glass, liquid-light tendrils—each vehicle extends the sonic/optical motif without mixed-metaphor collision. Zero paraphrase loops; every sentence advances image or stakes. High information density: one line can layer sensory detail, memory shard, and emotional charge.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Premise of grafted collective consciousness is familiar, but execution freshens it through percussive rebellion and engineered sound-garden that literally harmonizes with trauma. Risk taken: lyric accumulative structure instead of plot reversals, paid off when garden keeps the beat—externalization rarely rendered so bodily. Specificity of 27 named ghosts drags concept out of abstraction. Could edge higher if lab rationale carried subtler ethical thorn, but transformation through drumming is memorable.</comment>
