<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is precise—“tilt of a head before grief” anchors motive in embodied detail. The crisis-actor-to-survivor arc is credible because the erosion of pretense is dramatized through walking the word-patterns. The final refusal to bow crystallizes a cost (social credit, identity) earned by prior choices. One hairline slip: “I realized then” edges toward summary epiphany, not embodied contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the penumbra pools at the sovereign’s feet, reconfiguring power without violence. The accumulative/textural lens holds—each circuit thickens the penumbra and clarifies absence. Causality is intact: the pawnless board, word-walking, and ring-release all converge in the final image. Cost is legible in the sovereign’s tremor and the narrator’s sustained refusal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The whispering gallery’s acoustics and circular floor literally constrain the walking pattern that spells words; the pawnless board catches light and becomes the altar of unbinding. Micro-setting (domed ceiling, slants of window-light) is filtered through the narrator’s historian gaze. Spatial choreography is clean: survivors enter singly, join the circuit, kneel, place rings—no impossible positions. One minor drift: “perfume in an abandoned room” is a stock olfactory cue.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—bearing witness to small gestures—tightens when each survivor adds a glyph; the ring-release is the decisive narrowing. Agency is present in every heel-to-toe arc and in the final act of placing the board before the sovereign. Pressure escalates accumulatively: penumbra thickens, illusions strip, silence becomes syntax. Cost is visible in the woman’s dissolved chain and the sovereign’s tremor.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: the pawnless board reframes sacrifice, the penumbra reframes haunting as accompaniment. Subtext operates in silence—the gallery echoes “luminous absence,” not voices. Final image (“listen” spelled under the penumbra) reweights power without moralizing. No thematic drift; every motif (chess, walking, penumbra) constrains choice or charges closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise—“ghost of speech that never landed,” “benevolently ruthless” coined without cliché. Syntax modulates: long breathless sentences during walking, clipped fragments at the ring-release. Perceptual signature is consistent: the narrator notices micro-gestures, not crowns. No head-hopping; distance stays intimate first-person. One minor cadence echo: “not shadow, not spirit” repeats the negation pattern.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but never purple; each sentence layers image and concept—“silences shaped like breaths.” No loops or scaffold; “heel-to-toe arcs tracing glyphs” is specific and unrepeatable. Metaphors stay coherent: penumbra as “trailing edge of displaced light” is physically accurate and thematically charged. Final line lands with crystalline clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of crisis-actor, pawnless chess, and penumbra feels inevitable yet non-obvious. The interregnum setting reframes absence as incubation, not void. Risk-taking (walking that spells words, silence as syntax) heightens stakes without gimmickry. No close echoes; the voice and concept are singular.</comment>
