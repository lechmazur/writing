<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied; the copyist’s contradictory impulses (precision vs. rebellion, grief vs. hope) play out in micro-choices like calibrating the dial by fingertip heat. Motivation crystallizes through action—her tears activate the resurrection cycle—earning the final broadcast decision with visible cost (ink blurred, thumb singed). Minor slip: “thistled calm” abstracts rather than embodies the final stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the copyist’s first transmission re-weights the premise—she shifts from solitary scribe to networked beacon. Causal chain intact: pirate lyric → tear catalyst → dust resurrection → reciprocal broadcast. No orientation drift; single-scene arc tightens decisively.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ember alcove, mist, and radio glow function as micro-setting that constrains every beat: heat guides tuning, fog cloaks listening, charcoal embers time the sessions. Sensory hierarchy (touch > sight) mirrors the secrecy imperative. Final image of “long, dancing shadows” charges the ending with conducting hands—setting becomes dramatis persona.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“teach dust to tell stories”—escalates from transcription to resurrection to transmission. One tightening: pirate song about her forces the tear-price, crystallizing her agency. Cost is felt (singed thumb, blurred ink) and forecloses anonymity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: memory as insurgent melody against cultural famine. Subtext in the radio’s hidden glow and moth-wing cloth avoids overt statement. Final lyric “copyist weeps in measured time” re-weights prior material without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, tactile, musically inflected (“timpani roll,” “dotted rhyme”). Compression taught early (“note by note, breath by breath”) pays off in final broadcast cadence. No head-hopping; perceptual signature consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density (“salt and static,” “cursive sleep”). Rhythm modulates with pressure—long sentences for transcription, staccato for signal bursts. No figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: pirate shortwave as resurrection engine, dust motes as micro-theater. Risky lyric mode sustained without gimmickry. Transformation test passed—plot fails if elements swapped.</comment>
