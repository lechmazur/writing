<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elira’s interior contradiction—technique vs. unguarded delight—drives every beat; the fresco fragment acts as embodied catalyst, her laughter at the climax is an earned, visible cost. Reflection stays anchored to present tactile cues and alters her next choice. No head-count or relationship crucible required. Micro-choices (angling lenses, pocketing the fragment) reveal value hierarchy under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: density of light/fog/memory increases until the projection reweights the stake—her rediscovered joy. Orientation anchored by word 60; no teleporting props. Closure = Charged Poise: the lingering warmth and tomorrow-promise crystallize options with felt cost (she forecloses pure preservationist stance). Persistent constraint: the fragment-as-key now obligates her to keep painting new joys.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fog-thread, cider-mixed pigments, copper reflectors—every detail is filtered through Elira’s artist-eye and later constrains her optics setup. The orchard’s skeletal arches and moss-caked walls evolve from decay to luminous canvas, mirroring her internal shift. Spatial choreography clean: fragment travels from chapel pit to pocket to scaffold to pocket without drift. Weather (fog as emulsion) directly enables the “exposed film” concept and final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—recover unburdened joy—tightens when ancestral stories raise emotional gravity, forcing her to risk public display instead of private curation. One meaningful deepening: the child’s projected smile warms onlookers, proving the stakes are real and foreclosing her retreat into solitude. Cost visible: she laughs spontaneously, exposing vulnerability to strangers. No coincidence; escalation driven by her iterative lens adjustments.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: art’s purpose is awakening, not archiving. Subtext resides in gesture—child’s palm against stone, old woman’s tear—never sermonized. Final image of fog curling like a “contented cat” reweights earlier decay into living reverence without moralizing. Ambiguity preserved: tomorrow’s new joys are unmapped, refusing tidy thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Elira’s artist-perception: “fingers trailing…as if reading braille.” Syntax lengthens and breathes during luminous crescendo, then contracts at twilight, mirroring projection fade. No head-hopping; dialogue absent, so no voice contamination. Distinct perceptual signature sustained under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings avoid monotony. High information density: one sentence often paints, remembers, and foreshadows. Figurative language is patterned (light-as-paint) and paid off at projection beat. Minor scaffold: “like breath on glass” echoes earlier “breath on glass” but reads as intentional reprise, not loop; no clarity loss at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Freshest synthesis: fresco fragment + fog-as-emulsion + ancestral oral network = living camera obscura. Risky concept executed without technobabble; emotional payoff grounds novelty. Could not swap orchard for generic ruins without breaking optics logic. Slight echo of “painting with light” trope, but cider-honey pigments and palm-warming mural push it past derivative.</comment>
