<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied; the guardian’s contradictory longing for “warm ink” against its feral vigil is palpable. Micro-choices (licking ice statues, pressing pendant to forehead) crystallize values. The final stance—offering paw instead of growl—earns the shift from exile to emissary with visible cost of perpetual uncertainty.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each swallowed landscape tightens the ache until the pendant’s transfer cracks the garden’s stasis. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—boundaries soften into invitations, cost is the guardian’s acceptance of endless homesickness repurposed as compass.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Frozen garden and mist are not backdrop but pressure: cold erodes, mist occludes, statues freeze choice. The pendant’s silver glow and hoarfrost fur are micro-settings that constrain every gesture. Final image—garden exhaling—recharges the initial frost with newfound porosity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: transform homesickness from wound to tool. Tightening occurs when guardian relinquishes the pendant, trading certainty for relational risk. Cost is legible: eternal uncertainty carried “like a lantern.”</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: uncertainty as companion rather than enemy. Subtext lives in gesture—licking frozen cheeks, offering paw—never in exposition. Final image of mist “almost like a smile” reweights the premise without moralizing.</comment>

<comment>Voice is feral-poetic, syntax mirroring the guardian’s hybrid mind: “tasted like static and snow.” No head-hop; perceptual signature remains consistent. Compression and elision (“It did not remember choosing…”) are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet limpid; each sentence layers texture without clutter. Metaphors are precise—“mist coiled like reluctant serpents”—and never muddle causality. No loops or scaffold; rhythm modulates with the guardian’s shifting stance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: a dimensionally exiled librarian-beast reconfigures stolen light-boundaries into friendship. Tropes (guardian, cultist token) are inverted through embodied specificity. Risky lyric structure pays off with crystalline closure.</comment>
