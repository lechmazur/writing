<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied—trembling fingers, smudged ink, heartbeat-tattoo—but the shift from cartomancer to mother is asserted more than dramatized; still, the final micro-choice (pressing palm to earth) crystallizes the arc with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the saucer’s resealing and the child’s voice below reconfigure meaning without exposition; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds, and the cost—surrender of the lost moments—is legible in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The midnight glade above clouds is anchored early and evolves: clouds become spectral hands, moss cradles the palm, saucer becomes threshold—each environmental shift constrains action and charges the final descent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recovering lost time—tightens once: the saucer’s fracture widens into a portal, forcing the choice to enter and release rather than reclaim; the price (permanent surrender of those moments) is felt on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through concrete ritual (hand-tracing) and object (saucer) rather than statement; the final image—descending as mother, ink smudged with earth—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to time’s theft without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet controlled; perceptual signature (willingly perplexed gaze, storm-tasting syllables) remains consistent; no head-hopping; purposeful compression (“cloudbound repentance”) is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; figurative language is selective and patterned (ink, cloud, tracing); no loops or scaffold; occasional elevated diction fits the cartomancer’s idiom and does not obscure causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fusion of cartomancy, tea-set shard, and cloud archive feels inevitable and fresh; the hand-tracing custom transforms a familiar grief narrative into a singular ritual; risk-taking (portal via saucer) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
