<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied; the restorer’s tactile needle-work and her layered silence-concept read as lived-in. Motivation (balance, not redemption) is consistent, and the final renunciation of looking back carries felt cost. Yet the character’s flaw/blind spot remains largely abstract—no on-page contradiction complicates her stance—so the arc edges toward archetype rather than fully individuated psyche.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single continuous scene, causal lens: each knot’s release tightens stakes because the next may “have teeth.” Closure is a clean Earned Stasis—she walks away carrying “grace” and the certainty of endless work; the cost is the open-ended burden made legible in the final line. Orientation is anchored by ~120 words; no teleporting props or causal gaps.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Prism sanctuary is more than backdrop: its light dims when the black knot screams and brightens after the final release, directly mirroring the unknotted silence. Net and needle function as micro-settings that constrain every gesture. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered—salt, lavender, cedar anchor tactile memory without tourist catalog.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Dominant stake—free the trapped hush without tearing the world’s “quiet axis”—is signaled early. Escalation is incremental but causal: each loosened knot raises the risk of a scream like the black one. The final stillness is earned by her continued agency; the price is perpetual labor, stated on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Theme of silence as accumulated, knotted grief emerges through action, never thesis. Subtext lives in gesture: coiling the emptied net into lavender and stone is wordless ritual. Final image of her long, steady shadow offers a resonant, non-moral answer to how one carries unfinishable work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>Voice is lyric yet disciplined: “liquid whispers that pooled around her ankles” teaches the pattern early and pays off in the hush-pools of the climax. Syntax mirrors the careful, surgical rhythm of needle-work. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent and specific to the restorer’s craft-vision.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</question>
<comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; each sentence layers image and stakes. Occasional elevated diction (“spectral hues that hummed against the skin”) risks purple but remains tethered to POV. No loops, no scaffold, no mixed metaphors. Final cadence slows appropriately into the earned stillness.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Premise—restorer who unravels silence from nets—feels fresh yet inevitable. Familiar tropes (ghosts, starlight cathedral) are transformed through the specificity of maritime knots and moon-silk thread. Risk lies in the lyric mode, but coherence never wavers; the synthesis is singular and memorable.</comment>
