<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ripple-mark’s interiority is precise—her bare feet “reading the cave floor like braille” and her refusal to flee but to “find the quiet” give motive force. The echo-chamber stone as extension of will shows embodied choice under pressure. Final renunciation—she “stepped back,” work done—earns stasis with visible cost: the stone surrendered, her map-skin now guiding her deeper alone.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single continuous scene; orientation anchored by word 60. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each absorbed silence increases density until the bloom of hush reconfigures the storm. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration—storm tuned, not banished—cost legible in the stone’s dimming and her solitary onward walk.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Harmonic caves shift from screaming to breathing; ice wall’s fracture patterns literally score the counter-rhythm. Echo chamber stone and glacial seams function as micro-settings that constrain tactics—she must kneel, trace, release. Final image of dawn-mist light cradling the stone charges the reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: restore silence without destroying the energy beings. Pressure tightens as each absorbed tension swells the stone; one decisive deepening—she offers the gathered hush—forecloses her possession of the tool. Cost is the stone’s relinquishment and her continuing exile deeper into caves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges: silence as architecture, not absence; chaos can be tuned, not erased. Subtext in the stone’s relinquishment—quiet must be given away, not hoarded. Final image of the being curled around the stone like an egg reweights the premise without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly inside Ripple-mark’s perceptual filter—“her bare feet reading… like braille,” “cave-rock” face. Syntax mirrors her slowed, deliberate cadence; no head-hop. Distinct texture in phrases like “limestone throats amplifying subterranean winds into choral sighs.”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is spare yet resonant; no loops or scaffold. High density—“stone absorbed not just sound but tension” does triple duty. Metaphors stay coherent: ice “webbed with hairline fractures like a shattered mirror refusing to fall.” Final drip “in slow metronome” lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fusion of geomancy, sound architecture, and energy beings feels fresh; crack-patterns-as-scores is non-obvious. Transformation test: story collapses if caves are generic or stone is mere prop. Risk in quiet climax pays off—storm tuned rather than conquered—heightens stakes without spectacle.</comment>
