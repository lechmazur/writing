<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority is precise and embodied (“voice flat as parchment”), but the performer’s final compliance feels slightly under-motivated—no interior contradiction surfaces in the station scene to justify the seamless pivot. The micro-choice of sealing the bouquet in pine carries cost, yet the emotional void remains more asserted than dramatized. Still, the character’s flaws (performative grief, strategic hollowness) consistently shape tactics, earning a strong mid-band score.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the performer’s “perfectly compliant” renunciation forecloses authentic mourning with visible social cost (certificate, bulletin feature). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each whittling shard and pamphlet-burning beat deepens the pattern of sanctioned erasure. The final “I miss you” whisper crystallizes the reconfiguration under true silence, satisfying the 9+ cost test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Farmhouse dust, turbine shadows, and the pine block’s grain are tactile and selective; the turbines’ mandated hush literally constrains the final whisper, charging the closure. Spatial choreography is clean—shavings at boots, box on counter. Weather and mechanical pauses are integrated into action rather than backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to grieve without punishment—tightens through Compliance visits and the bouquet’s forced transformation. The final sealing act narrows options: authentic sorrow is now literally entombed. Cost is visible (certificate, bulletin exposure), though escalation plateaus slightly in the mid-section.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the collision of mandated joy and ungrieved loss; the bouquet’s combustion and final entombment reweight “permitted” grief as hollow artifact. Subtext thrives in the performer’s flat narration and the officers’ cheery jargon. No moralizing—ambiguity lingers in the ash and beeswax.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is distinctive—clinical, theatrical, yet intimate (“Combustion is cooperation. Ash is amnesty”). Compression and elision are taught early and paid off. No dialogue, but the narration carries subtext and status shifts with the officers.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and rhythmic; each sentence advances image or pressure. No loops or scaffold. Metaphors are precise (“shavings curling like ghosts”) and never muddle causality. The final “lighter, emptier” line lands with crystalline clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The Happiness Decree and enforced “remade hush” feel fresh, not dystopian boilerplate. Grief as bureaucratic compliance is a non-obvious synthesis. Specificity (beeswax-sealed pine, aura-reader) grounds the concept; the ending’s whispered apostrophe transforms prior material.</comment>
