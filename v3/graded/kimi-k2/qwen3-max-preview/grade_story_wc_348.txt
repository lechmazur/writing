<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is embodied and specific; the chemist’s micro-choice to place the chrysalis in her notebook crystallizes her arc. Contradictory impulses (guilt vs. acceptance) act simultaneously in scene. The final renunciation—reframing rupture as rhythm—earns its cost through prior causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the chemist’s stance crystallizes when she decides to redesign the polymer for dissolution. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds; foam patterns, chrysalis, and river braid accumulate to reweight grief into flow. Cost is legible in the final image of “Chrysalis Mesh” named for her daughter.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The braided ravine and foam patterns constrain her insight; the chrysalis functions as micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtering through her scientific gaze. Spatial choreography remains coherent across kneeling, climbing, and departure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transforming separation into connection—tightens when she redefines atonement as rhythm, not repair. Agency drives the shift: her decision to sketch foam geometries and later redesign the scaffold. Cost is visible in the felt weight of “loosened grief” that still moves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: impermanence as metamorphosis, not failure. Subtext operates through the chrysalis and foam, culminating in the non-literal requiem of “Chrysalis Mesh.” The final image reweights the scaffold from failure to necessary vessel without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct—scientific precision braided with lyric attention. Perceptual signature (“symphonic chaos,” “liquid gold”) is consistent and character-bound. No head-hopping; POV remains stable and intimate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; each sentence advances atmosphere or insight. No loops or scaffold; metaphors are coherent. Rhythm modulates with emotional pressure, accelerating toward the final cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of polymer science and grief ritual feels fresh and inevitable. The chrysalis-as-scaffold metaphor transforms a familiar trope through specific lived detail. Risk-taking (lyric science, quiet closure) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
