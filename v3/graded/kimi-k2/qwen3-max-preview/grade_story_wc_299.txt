<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Jasper’s contradictory impulses—mechanical cataloguing vs. the ache for music—are dramatized in concrete beats (cloth to ear, laptop rename). The final shift from insulation to listening is earned by prior micro-choices and carries felt cost: he pockets the cloth next to heartbeat, not toolkit. Interiority stays specific to his sensory bias; no diagnostic labels. Slight reserve: Ruiz functions more as thematic echo than crucible, so relationship pressure is thin.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the cloth becomes tuning fork, Project Echo is christened, and “listen” replaces “count”—all on-page with conceptual cost (foreclosure of pure factual safety). Causal chain holds: cloth glow → ear test → laptop rename → pocket shift. Orientation anchored by word 60; no debt. One shard, single POV, default scope met. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern break (catalogue ritual interrupted) reweights stakes. High-band gate satisfied.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Quarry trailer, diesel tremor, and slanting amber light are filtered through Jasper’s audio-tactile bias; every detail either enables or threatens his insulation protocol. The cloth’s weave density and the valley’s acoustics literally constrain the final choice to “listen.” Spatial track is clean: table → window → corkboard. No sensory checklist; smell and sound selected for urgency. Micro-setting (cloth + harmonica) charges the closing image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will he stay sealed in data or risk feeling music again—tightens when cloth glow triggers ear test, foreclosing the safety of pure measurement. Agency drives escalation: he assigns no catalog number, types new project name, pins cloth publicly. Cost is legible: abandonment of emotional insulation method that defined three years. One meaningful deepening suffices; no external antagonist needed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—resonance from absence, meaning from fragments—emerges through concrete arc: catalogued debris → reclaimed soundscape. Final image (“What’s broken still carries song”) is non-literal reweighting, not moral. Subtext in Ruiz’s “ghosts” line and Jasper’s silence carries implication without exposition. No final-paragraph thesis statement; avoids thematic echo penalty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains tight psychic distance; perceptual signature is audio-engineer precise (“tensile strength, acoustic transparency coefficient”). Rhythm compresses under pressure—single-word paragraph “He listened.” No head-hop; free indirect clean. Register stays within Jasper’s lexicon; “echo valley longing” reads as his coinage. Dialogue minimal but distinct: Ruiz’s jazz background surfaces in “ghosts” and “heartbeat.”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence runs. Figurative language sparse and purposeful—“beast chewing stone” mirrors Jasper’s self-image. High information density: “catalogued rusted mining equipment and broken surveyor’s tools” does world, job, and mood in one stroke. Zero paraphrase loops; no scaffold. Minor filter verb cluster in reflection paragraph but does not touch closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Premise—ex-roadie appraising dead rock in a quarry—feels fresh and specific; transformation test fails if swapped to generic antique dealer. Speaker cloth as tuning fork reverses failure object into generative instrument without gimmickry. Risk taken in quiet lyric ending rather than reunion gig; coherence maintained. Could edge higher with sharper occupational detail that once affected tactics.</comment>
