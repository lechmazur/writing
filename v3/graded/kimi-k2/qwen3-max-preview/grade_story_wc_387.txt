<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority is textured and embodied—e.g., “bare feet cool on slick stone” and the widow’s memory. Motivation (to honor unseen labor) is consistent and intensifies through micro-choices (whistling names, pressing palm to stone). Final renunciation—leaving no mark—earns stasis with visible cost. Minor: no contradictory impulses enacted simultaneously, only alternation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the final whistle threads the song into the world’s hidden labor, reweighting meaning with felt cost (“already fading footprints”). Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each beat layers density until the moonlit firefly net crystallizes. No causality gaps; orientation anchors within 120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Parapet, moon paths, and whisk constrain choices: moonlight dictates her walking line; whisk becomes totem of persistence. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—rain, moss, chalk washed away—mirroring internal state. Final image of fireflies “tracing moon paths” recharges setting as active agent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—bearing witness to hidden effort—is signaled early and deepens through each beat. Escalation is accumulative: each whistle, touch, and observation tightens the weave of acknowledgment. Cost is conceptual (fading footprints) but legible. No external antagonist; pressure is situational and internal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: labor’s invisibility is explored through nets, chalk, widow, fireflies. Final whistle offers non-literal answer—song as net catching wonder—without moralizing. Subtext in silence and gesture (“whispered thanks”) avoids didacticism. Complexity lingers: no tidy moral, only reverberation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; perceptual signature is selective—moonlight, hemp, salt air filtered through mender’s craft. Rhythm modulates with pressure: long breaths in calm, clipped steps on parapet. No head-hopping; POV remains intimate. Compression (“demure audacity”) is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; each line advances image or stakes. Metaphors are fresh yet coherent—“starlight caught in a spider’s thread.” Minor loop: “quiet labor” and “hidden effort” are near-paraphrase; does not obscure closure. No artifacts in final third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: net-mender philosopher who “weaves constellations” turns craft into cosmic meditation. Fireflies as living knots reframe trope without gimmickry. Risk-taking in lyric, accumulative structure heightens resonance. Transformation test: story collapses if any element swapped.</comment>
