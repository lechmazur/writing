<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is gentle and consistent, but her choices remain largely observational; the decisive act of passing the curl is under-motivated by prior micro-choices, softening the felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the curl’s transfer crystallizes the mission’s reconfiguration, and the lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds. Cost is felt but diffuse rather than acute.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Sage Ridge’s sensory envelope is vivid and purposeful; the moss quilt, lichen runes, and cedar air constrain Elara’s low-key posture and charge the final stillness.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—nurturing wonder—intensifies through the eclipse’s pressure, but escalation is external (celestial coincidence) rather than driven by Elara’s agency, blunting the cost clarity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of quiet magic emerges organically from texture and gesture; the final image of the glowing curl in the child’s hands reweights the premise without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Distinct lyric cadence and perceptual signature (“slow tides,” “crushed sage”) remain coherent; no head-hopping, and modulation under eclipse pressure is purposeful.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is lush yet disciplined; occasional stacked modifiers (“low and honeyed,” “velvet pause”) flirt with excess but never obscure causality or dull the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of eclipse-as-ritual and keepsake-as-anchor feels inevitable; risk is modest but the quiet inversion of spectacle into shared stillness is memorable.</comment>
