<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her loneliness is braided into every reed spiral. The moment she presses palms to the arbor and whispers her “truest self” crystallizes her arc with visible cost—she renounces anonymity and accepts the burden of becoming the grafting point. Secondary characters remain lightly sketched yet serve as living proof of the web’s pull. Motivation stays consistent and intensifies toward the final choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the arbor flares, glyphs rewrite, and Lira’s sigil locks into the living tapestry—an irreversible act that forecloses solitude. Causality holds: every reed sculpture, every hidden clue, funnels into this single beat. The pattern is taught early and the final image reweights all prior pleas into welcomes. No orientation debt; transitions are legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The crystalline orchard, obsidian arbor, and reed medium are not backdrop but instruments: roots drink from the crater, glyphs pulse like veins, and reeds become both message and loom. Each sensory detail is filtered through Lira’s maker-eye and constrains her tactics—she must sculpt with wet stalks that tremble like breath. Final image of the glowing moss under twin moons charges the closure. Spatial choreography stays coherent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will Lira knot herself into the web?—is signaled in paragraph three and tightens through each offering left beside her sculptures. The decisive turn occurs when she accepts Vesper’s invitation, trekking to the weeping grove at personal risk (time, exposure, vulnerability). Cost is visible: anonymity forfeited, solitude foreclosed. Escalation is accumulative/textural, density increasing until the arbor flares.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of chosen kinship emerges from every reed and glass collaboration, never sermonized. The final image—Lira handing a reed to new travelers—reweights the entire orchard from private ache to communal loom. Subtext hums in gestures: the moth-lashed child’s shout, the glass-blower’s mercury tears. Complexity is honored; no tidy moral is offered.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, every clause braided like the reeds themselves: “spirals that trembled like breath,” “glyphs that pulsed like veins.” Perceptual signature is consistent—Lira notices texture, tension, luminescence. No head-hopping; distance remains intimate third. Dialogue is sparse but weighted: Vesper’s “You sculpt absence into presence” distills subtext without exposition.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and motion. No loops or scaffold; metaphors stay coherent within the orchard’s logic. Rhythm modulates with pressure—short, urgent clauses for the trek; longer, luminous ones for the arbor flare. Occasional elevated diction (“luminescent ache”) is earned by voice and theme.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The fusion of reed sculpture, crystalline orchard, and memory-loom feels inevitable and fresh. Familiar motifs—wanderer seeking home, elusive artist—are transformed through tactile specificity and communal loom mechanics. Final reconfiguration (Lira becoming the grafting point) arises organically from every prior reed. Risk-taking in structure and lyricism heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
