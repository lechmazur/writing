<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical and embodied; the archivist’s micro-choices (tracing kite tail, murmuring to lavender) reveal motive. Yet the “collective healing” drive stays abstract—no contradictory impulse or visible cost at closure to crystallize her arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each photograph adds density, culminating in a Charged Poise (“case clicked like a promise kept”). Orientation is swift; transitions are seamless. Closure reweights meaning with felt, if quiet, cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lavender, vines, and chimney swifts are selective, sensorily rich, and mirror internal states. The dove-gray case and ruined factory constrain the ritual space, charging the final image. No orientation debt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</question><comment>Dominant stake—“transmute pain into living breath”—is signaled early and deepens through each photo. Pressure tightens via pattern accumulation rather than causal turns; cost is conceptual rather than visceral, limiting upper band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: kites, benches, murals. Final image of vines climbing and swifts arcing offers resonant reconfiguration without moralizing. Subtext in gestures and reflections is deft.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</question>
<comment>Voice is distinctive—measured, tactile, quietly devotional. Syntax modulates with emotional intensity; no head-hopping. Free-indirect texture remains coherent under lyrical compression.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</question>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid; metaphors (“hollows left by vanished hands”) serve pressure. Minor synonym loops (“photograph by photograph, hour by hour”) are pattern-taught and rhythmic, not obstructive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</question>
<comment>Familiar motifs (archivist, healing, ruins) are transformed through sensory specificity and accumulative structure. The quiet alchemy angle feels fresh; risk is modest but coherent.</comment>
