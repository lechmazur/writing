<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction is vivid—“duty demanded suppression, conscience demanded detonation”—and the final calm refusal costs her freedom, yet the emotional turn from trembling to serene feels slightly accelerated; one more embodied beat of hesitation at the Resonance Table would lock the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a clean CR: the letter’s frequency becomes irreversible societal reweighting, cost paid by her arrest and the city’s unstoppable sob; causal chain (wax crack → harmonic pulse → viral shame) holds without gaps; lens stays causal throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Frozen library, cryo-wax scent of iron/jasmine, and the Resonance Table’s marble veins are tactile, selective, and directly enable the climax; snow-muffled silence mirrors the viral quiet of the scandal—setting constrains and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth vs regime silence—tightens the instant wax cracks: one irreversible action forecloses retreat; cost is her incarceration and the Chancellor’s dropped stylus, both legible on-page; no coincidence required.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the premise itself: archives as kindling, confession as contagion; no moralizing line tells us—instead the final graffiti of melting letters keeps the question open while the after-image of shared shame lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to her perceptual filter—breath, scent, frost on glass; rhythmic lift in the long sentence that tracks the viral transmission mirrors the pulse of the Table; no head-hop, no filter-verb clutter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable—parallel triplets (“between past and present…”) serve cadence, not padding; only minor scaffold (“the snow outside the library grew thicker” repeats prior snow image) keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The leap from forbidden love-letter to emotional-frequency epidemic feels inevitable yet fresh; weaponized vulnerability as plot engine transforms a familiar dystopia into singular myth, risking clarity and winning.</comment>
