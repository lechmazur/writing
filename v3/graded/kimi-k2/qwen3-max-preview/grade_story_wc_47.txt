<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is textured and embodied; the amber pendant and moss underfoot anchor contradictory impulses. The final renunciation—placing the viral confession beneath moss—earns its cost through prior pattern study and embodied memory. Motivation (“reclamation”) is consistent but slightly abstract; a sharper internal contradiction would push higher.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the confession’s burial under moss crystallizes a stance of protected vulnerability with felt cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each moss-drip spiral reweights the stake until the final image. No causality breaks; transitions are legible within the single scene.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The abandoned data center’s moss-choked aisles and shattered skylights constrain movement and attention; the pendant’s amber glow and the moss’s velvet texture charge the final image. Specificity is selective and POV-filtered; every detail either guides choice or reappears in the closing tableau.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transforming public shame into private sanctuary—tightens through each sensory beat. The pattern of thaw-drip spirals provides the single deepening that narrows options toward the burial act. Cost is visible in the relinquishing of the confession printout.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the interplay of decay and deliberate cultivation; no explicit moralizing. The moss swallowing the confession offers a resonant, non-literal answer to how public wounds become private soil. Subtext in gesture and image avoids sentimentality.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded; perceptual signature is consistent (“honeyed hush,” “velvety floor”). Compression and patterned diction are taught early and paid off in the final amber streak across the wall. No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates with emotional intensity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; sentences advance atmosphere and choice simultaneously. Occasional lyrical stacking (“cathedral of decay where silence had weight”) risks overwriting but stays within pattern. No loops or scaffold; rhythm accelerates under pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Premise—data center as moss sanctuary—feels fresh and inevitable. The viral confession recontextualized through slow natural reclamation is a non-obvious synthesis. Specificity of moss threading through circuit boards prevents generic swap.</comment>
