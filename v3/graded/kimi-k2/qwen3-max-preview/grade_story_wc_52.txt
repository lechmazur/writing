<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Eleanor’s interiority is textured and embodied; her micro-choice to let the kettle boil dry crystallizes the shift from passive mourning to active containment. The contradiction between her “hauntingly practical” stance and the emotional risk of carving Viktor’s absence is dramatized in the moment she presses chisel to wood. The final Earned Stasis—refusing rescue by tea—carries visible cost and closes the arc. Minor slip: the phrase “harvest lessons from loss” edges toward label-speak before it is re-earned by action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration: the half-formed lion on the sill crystallizes Eleanor’s new stance toward grief. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each wood curl adds density until the final image reweights the mantra “here and gone.” Orientation is swift; causality is internal but legible. Cost is unmistakable in the scorched kettle and the irreversible first cut.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The rain-beaded skylight loft is no postcard; its humidity curls up the stairs and stains sleeves, constraining how long she can work before the grain swells. The ash blank and worn chisel function as micro-setting, guiding tactile choice. Weather and interior pressure interleave, charging the final image with watery gold. One minor drift: “rust-hued peace” is more tonal label than sensory anchor.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to hold grief without being devoured—is signaled early and tightened when she risks the first irreversible cut. Agency is renunciation: letting the kettle scream itself dry forecloses comfort and crystallizes the cost of attention. Escalation is textural—each shaving narrows options until the carving becomes the only vessel left. The price (scorched pot, damp sleeves, irreversible act) is legible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: containment versus surrender, crystallized time versus spilled memory. The lion’s shift from blank to resting form reconfigures “here and gone” without moralizing. Subtext lives in silence—the kettle’s unanswered scream, the unopened cedar chest. Final image offers non-literal resonance: the carving as amber, not tomb.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is tactile, autumnal, and precise—“rain-beaded,” “ash dust,” “fine as a lion’s whisker.” Syntax modulates with pressure: longer reflective coils tighten into decisive fragments (“Let the water boil dry.”). No dialogue, yet the kettle’s scream functions as character voice. Perceptual signature remains consistent and character-bound throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; each sentence layers scent, texture, and motion. Figurative language is selective—“amber holding a wing”—and never muddles causality. Minor scaffold: “here and gone” repeated three times in close proximity, but the pattern is taught early and pays off. No loops or register drift in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The widow-carver of circus lions is fresh, yet grounded in sensory specificity. The transformation of “lion tamer” legacy into quiet wood-craft feels inevitable rather than gimmicky. Risk lies in the lyric stillness; it heightens stakes without gimmickry. One faint echo of familiar grief-craft tropes keeps it from the top tenth.</comment>
