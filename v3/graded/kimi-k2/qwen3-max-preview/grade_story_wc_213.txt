<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The tester’s quiet, methodical interiority is vivid—her refusal to trust sirens, her tactile calibration of the rope, her embodied patience all feel lived-in. Yet the arc is more stance crystallization than change; the cost is atmospheric rather than personal, keeping her just shy of the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the bell tolls only when the sky itself pulls the rope, reconfiguring the valley’s relationship to warning. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each microclimate datum layers until the final cadence shift—and the cost (trust restored, false-alarm past redeemed) is unmistakable in the last image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The wind-polished stairwell, the belfry’s dormant serpent-rope, and the ion-laden air all constrain her every adjustment; the sanctuary’s stained-glass eyes literally watch the final calibration. One more sensory anchor tying the storm’s breath to her own pulse would have nudged it to 9.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—restoring authentic warning without panic—tightens through accumulating sensor data and the rope’s trembling hesitation. Pressure peaks when the storm meets her thresholds, but the personal price feels diffuse; the cost is borne by the valley more than by her body.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: listening as civic sacrament. The bell’s single resonant note reframes seventeen years of fear into promise, a Conceptual Repricing that reweights silence itself. No moral is stated; the final raindrop suffices.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The lyrical third-person hovers close enough to taste stone dust and ion shift; diction is precise yet unshowy (“wind-polished stone dust,” “needle stitching heaven to earth”). Rhythm modulates with pressure—short clauses during sensor twitches, longer breaths as the storm leans in—without ever breaking the spell.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet aerated: each image does double duty (“rope curled at her feet like a contented cat” closes both action and mood). A single mixed metaphor—“bruised purple and silver” clouds—keeps it from perfection.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The conceit of a ritual-engineered storm bell feels fresh, yet its folkloric DNA is recognizable; the specificity of barometric levers and dew-point triggers transforms the familiar. The risk pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
