<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s shift from profit to purpose is credible and embodied in the quiet deliveries; the locket photo anchors his internal contradiction. However, the interiority is occasionally abstract (“felt the weight…in memory”) and the cost of his nightly labor remains more stated than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly with the circular return of envelopes—an earned Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights the premise. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens; each delivery tightens the pattern. One transition (library → docks) is legible and motivated.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The harbor is sketched with salt-kissed air, lantern glass, and mop buckets—selective, purposeful. The library skylight reappears to charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—uplifting the unseen—escalates through each envelope; the tightening is the expanding list of recipients. Cost is felt in Elias’s nightly anonymity and fatigue, though the price could be sharper on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of compassion as circulating tide emerges through concrete acts, not statement. The locket’s reprise reconfigures meaning without moralizing. Subtext in “You are seen” carries quiet power.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays close to Elias’s perceptual quirks—“tides in teacups” is apt and consistent. Rhythm modulates with scene needs; no head-hopping. Dialogue is minimal but natural when present.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and image-rich; occasional lyrical flourish (“salt-kissed air”) is earned. No loops or scaffold. One mixed metaphor (“symphony’s end had not signaled closure, but invitation”) is minor.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The anonymous gratitude chain feels fresh, grounded in maritime specificity. The locket-as-talisman trope is transformed by communal ownership. Risk is quiet but coherent; no gimmicks.</comment>
