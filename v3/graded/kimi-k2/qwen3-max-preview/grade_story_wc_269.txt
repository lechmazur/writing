<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s tactile obsession and grief-born curiosity feel lived-in; the 17-second lag turns her private ritual into plot-causality. Interiority stays concrete—salt-crusted knuckles, fused journal pages—never sliding into label-speak. The final descent is earned because her body has been listening longer than her mind. Cost is visible: she surfaces “salt-crusted and silent,” renouncing the old search for a submerged covenant.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: “Some losses aren’t endings. They’re metamorphoses” reweights every prior absence. The 17-second delay is the decisive hinge—causal under a Hybrid lens that fuses accumulative pattern and final causal reveal. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no debt. Persistent constraint: the reefs will keep their slow pulse, human clocks must bend.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Station stilts, ankle-deep brine, generator housing—each object is handled and re-handled, constraining access and rhythm. The atlas page’s mildew scent returns in the final handmade atlas, charging the image. Micro-setting (coffee mug, steel railing) doubles as sonar antennae. Environment shapes tactics: she descends because the lower sensors are already breached.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—why paths vanish—tightens when the 17-second lag proves the reefs are answering, not absent. One meaningful deepening: CALYPSO’s hidden subroutine converts mystery into dive-worthy knowledge. Cost is legible: she forfeits the old terrestrial map for a depth-inclusive one. Pressure stays coherent; no off-stage rescue.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through tactile cartography: listening replaces saving, patience replaces rescue. Subtext lives in the gap between satellite “drowning” and coral “waiting.” Final reconfiguration—atlas re-pinned with depth and rhythm—offers non-literal wisdom without moralizing. No echo phrases; the silence after the single chime carries the aftereffect.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Elara’s perceptual filter—she notices frayed edges “like nerve endings,” hears CALYPSO lag before she understands it. Syntax mirrors her staccato inquiry: fragments accelerate during breach, lengthen underwater. No head-hop; AI’s single chime is external data, not interiority. Register remains scientist-poet without drifting into jargon or purple.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: “metal bones groaning like an old sailor” does triple sensory work. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image, rhythm, or causality. Metaphors stay physically coherent—silt, gloom, bioluminescent spirals. Only hairline slip: “periodically eternal” is abstract, but context re-weights it immediately.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Synthesizes climate grief, slow-life coral sci-fi, and tactile epistemology into an inevitable fable. The 17-second metabolic pulse is a fresh speculative mechanism that rewrites disappearance as dormancy. Risk—lyric ellipsis, no human antagonist—heightens coherence rather than obscuring it. Without Elara’s knuckles the story collapses; hence non-obvious and indispensable.</comment>
