<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s embodied perception and tactile method are vivid; her calm-as-compass trait is consistent and drives every micro-choice. The final release of the drone crystallizes her arc without overt statement. Minor: the botanist remains a respectful cipher, so relationship crucible pressure is absent.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single-scene causal chain holds: damaged drone → refractive diagnostics → silk-resin patch → flight test → release. Closure is a clear Earned Stasis: the voyage proceeds, Elara turns to the next repair, cost felt in her oil-stained hands. Orientation and lens remain stable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mist, dew-slick iron, copper basin, and prism all constrain method and mood; depot acoustics sync with anchor’s heartbeat to tighten stakes. Micro-setting (workbench, water basin) functions as crucible. No spatial drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—orchids will die without pollination—tightens with each groan of the anchor. Agency is Elara’s deliberate, unhurried repair; cost is the irreversible departure moment when she lets the drone go. One meaningful deepening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of “fractures into flight paths” emerges through tactile repair ritual and light refraction; no explicit moralizing. Final image of drone vanishing into salt sky reweights earlier damage without statement. Subtext in hummingbird-as-redemption.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person limited stays inside Elara’s haptic perception; diction (“iron bones,” “lunar resin”) is character-bound. Rhythm modulates with task tempo; no head-hopping. Voice distinct and sustained.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet clear; figurative language is selective and purposeful. No loops, no mixed metaphors. Sentence rhythm mirrors the drone’s stutter-recalibration-release arc. Clean mechanics.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Blind artisan using refracted light to repair optical sensors is fresh; lunar-resin-silk patch feels invented yet plausible. Premise is specific to this depot and this dawn. Risky lyric compression pays off.</comment>
