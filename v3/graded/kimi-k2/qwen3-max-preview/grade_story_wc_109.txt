<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Oracle’s obsession with “charting absence” is vivid, but her choices remain observational—no decisive micro-choice under pressure; the final descent is atmospheric rather than a crucible that alters her stance or costs her something new.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: she steps into the night she has mapped, the cost crystallized in the “marbled hush” that now welcomes her. Accumulative lens holds—each summarized silence layers density until the final reconfiguration feels earned.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</question><comment>Storm-tossed ridge fort and the flaking booklet are tactile, salt-stained anchors; the ambered hush itself becomes micro-setting that constrains sound and action, charging the final image with felt stillness.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</question><comment>Dominant stake—map the endless night—tightens as the last star gutters; pressure grows through accumulating silences rather than external reversals. Cost is conceptual (she enters the territory she has drawn), but the tightening is more atmospheric than tactical.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</question>
<comment>Theme of silence as cartography emerges organically from the oracle’s method; the final “marbled hush” offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights earlier glyphs without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</question>
<comment>Lyrical, oceanic cadence is consistent and voice-driven; perceptual signature (salt, moth-wing pages, star-thin breath) is distinct and never head-hops. Compression and elision are taught early and paid off in the closing hush.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</question>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is patterned and purposeful. Occasional stacked metaphors (“honeyed resin trapping ancient breath”) flirt with overwriting but never obscure causality or stall momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</question>
<comment>Fusing cartography with silence feels fresh; the drowned cartographer and flaking gold booklet are specific inventions that could not be swapped out. Risky lyric structure pays off in a final image that reconfigures meaning.</comment>
