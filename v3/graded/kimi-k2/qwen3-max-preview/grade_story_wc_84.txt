<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied ("tears tracing paths through dust"); micro-choice of aligning star-trails with chip is decisive. Yet the shift from external mission to internal resonance is slightly front-loaded rather than earned in-scene, softening the cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration: the chip’s final dimming crystallizes her shift from seeking external signal to internal listening. Causal chain holds—each beat (locate, activate, visions, renunciation) tightens stakes under Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Observatory is tactile—dust, velvet-lined obsidian, drone beam—yet its primary role is atmospheric rather than constraint. The celestial dial seam is the single micro-setting that alters tactics, just enough to edge past 8.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“frequency of belonging”—escalates from external search to internal resonance; visions force a visible trade-off (shedding pilot identity). One meaningful tightening suffices; cost is felt in her stillness at the end.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: belonging as self-resonance rather than external lock. Final image of “brilliant dimness” reweights earlier motifs without moralizing; ambiguity lingers credibly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct—precise drone-operator diction (“micron-deviations”) modulating into lyrical awe. No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains sharp under pressure. Compression and elision are taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid; each sentence advances image or pressure. Minor figurative flourish (“brilliant dimness”) is earned and pattern-taught. Zero loops or scaffold; rhythm accelerates with emotional stakes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</question>
<comment>Premise fuses hard-SF relic with mythic resonance; the “type foundry matrix chip” is a fresh inflection on memory-tech. Pilgrim’s role is subtle inversion of mentor trope. Specificity prevents template drift.</comment>
