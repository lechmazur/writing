<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The immortal’s craving for “finality” is clear and consistent, but interiority stays abstract—“ennui” and “wonder” are named rather than embodied. No contradictory impulse is dramatized; the final kneel feels inevitable rather than costly. Still, the arc from boredom to reverence is legible and character-specific.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the immortal steps through the gateway and experiences “quiet thunder,” a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost (loss of sanctuary). Causality under an Accumulative/Textural lens holds—storm, fragment, and spatial mutiny tighten toward the final image. Orientation is taught early via the prismatic escondite and storm.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The prismatic escondite and storm function as micro-setting: walls “breathe hues,” magnetic tendrils “lash,” and the final plain of goodbyes constrains the last gesture. Sensory detail is selective, POV-filtered, and causally active. One minor spatial drift—“ceiling became the floor”—is vivid yet trackable.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>One dominant stake—understanding what lies past farewell—is signaled early and deepens as the storm intensifies. The spatial mutiny is the tightening beat that forecloses retreat. Cost is visible: sanctuary collapses to a point and winks out.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the tension between endless spectacle and the hush of endings. The final “quiet thunder” reweights prior motifs without moralizing. Subtext operates in absences shaped like words, avoiding direct statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is lush yet controlled, with rhythmic cadences that match the immortal’s languid omniscience. Diction stays within an elevated but coherent register. No head-hopping; focalization remains tight.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and musical, but each sentence advances image or pressure. Metaphors are coherent—“whips of ionized regret,” “solidified aurora.” No loops or scaffold. Minor risk of overwriting is offset by purposeful cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of cosmic storm, cursed relic, and spatial rebellion feels fresh yet inevitable. The “doorway past farewell” reframes immortality tropes through specific sensory cost. Risky structure pays off in the final hush.</comment>
