<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority is precise and embodied; the copper-veined storyteller’s contradictory impulses (feed the diamond vs. preserve meaning) play out in micro-choices under pressure. Her final articulation of the lost tongue is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost—her tears and the diamond’s sated dormancy. No stock phrasing; every reaction is filtered through her perceptual signature. The only minor slip is a touch of diagnostic self-awareness in “her motivation was simple, and impossible,” but it is brief and does not undercut the earned closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the canyon’s new responsive echoes crystallize the before/after shift. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of texture increases until the final cadence reweights the stake. Cost is legible in the diamond’s dormancy and the irreversible release of the mother tongue into the world. Orientation is anchored early; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The canyon’s echo-memory and bone towers actively constrain tactics—sound is preserved, layered, and folded, forcing the protagonist to choreograph her ritual around its acoustics. The diamond’s surface and the flock’s flight paths function as micro-settings that charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and urgent; every sense is filtered through her goal. Environment is not backdrop but co-agent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore a dead language—is signaled early and tightened through the diamond’s hunger and the canyon’s echo-memory. One meaningful deepening: the diamond must be fully fed, risking total silence, to let pure texture escape. Agency is hers; she chooses to feed it selectively and then release the sound. Cost is visible in her tears and the irreversible dispersal of the tongue into the world.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: language as texture, memory as resonance, silence as both threat and vessel. Subtext operates in gesture—the diamond’s pulse, the flock’s wheeling—never in statement. The final echo of her word forward, not back, offers a resonant, non-literal answer. No moralizing; complexity is embraced.</comment>

<comment>Voice is distinct, lyrical, and precise; every sentence carries the storyteller’s quiet articulation. Patterned elision (“It did not burn her. It did not whisper. It waited.”) is taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; POV remains tightly bound to her perception. Diction and rhythm modulate with emotional intensity without ever slipping into purple.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet limpid; each line advances atmosphere, character, or stakes. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent—“trapped screams,” “velvet hush of regret.” Sentence rhythm accelerates under pressure and breathes in quieter beats. Final cadence is earned and exact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Premise—using bird-flight syntax and a cursed diamond to resurrect a dead language—is fresh, specific, and fully committed to its logic. Tropes of cursed objects and lost tongues are transformed through grounded sensory detail and emotional cost. The synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking (lyric, accumulative structure) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
