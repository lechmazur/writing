<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied; contradictory impulses (“merrily melancholic surrender”) play in real time. The compass-as-witness choice crystallizes her arc with visible cost. One slip: “broken navigator felt no need to name her course” edges toward tidy self-diagnosis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the compass needle pointing aft reconfigures agency without exposition. Causal lens holds—every beat (poles named, washer taken, paddle strokes) tightens toward the final image. Cost is legible in the relinquished precision of charts.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Salt wind, rusted poles, and kayak hull are filtered through her navigational gaze; each constrains movement or charges the final push-off. Micro-setting (compass glass fogged by breath) doubles as emotional barometer. No orientation drift; spatial anchors hold.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—coherence vs. collapse—escalates via each pole waypoint and the washer talisman. One decisive tightening: turning back to the kayak after Pole Seven forecloses passive regret. Cost is felt in the relinquished certainty of “true north.”</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of navigation by fracture rather than precision emerges through concrete action; no moralizing. The final blurred horizon reweights earlier failures without naming them. Subtext hums in the crow’s washer and the compass’s silent witness.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is salt-cracked, lyrical, and consistent; perceptual signature (“salt wind tangling her hair like unresolved equations”) is character-bound. Compression and elision (“She didn’t look back”) are taught early and paid off in rhythm. No head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; metaphor serves pressure without clutter. One minor loop: “merrily melancholic” appears twice in adjacent beats. Otherwise zero scaffold, high information yield, and cadence that breathes with tide.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: using leaning utility poles as star charts transforms a mundane coastal walk into existential reckoning. Risky lyric mode sustains coherence. Avoids derivative “lost mariner” tropes through specificity of washer, compass fog, and pole naming.</comment>
