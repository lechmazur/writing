<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied; the embroiderer's contradictory impulses (listening vs. acting, hiding vs. revealing) play out in micro-choices under pressure. The final renunciation—continuing to stitch while the coup fails—earns its cost through prior causality. Status dynamics with courtiers and conspirators are sketched economically and shape tactics. Flaws (underestimation, secrecy) drive both success and ongoing danger.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the adjacent possibilities collapse into her chosen reality, flame steady, coup thwarted, yet she is still labeled a fool. Causal chain (flame tremor → stitch warning → tapestry sabotage → royal escape) holds under a Causal lens. One seamless transition into the “layer next door” is taught early and paid off. Cost is legible in the final image—she sleeps amid smoke, victory unrecognized.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Cobalt observatory, eternal flame, and silk constellations are rendered with selective sensory detail that constrains choice (flame as compass, thread as map). Spatial choreography remains coherent across the single scene. Weather and light evolve with tension; autumn leaves scraping walls echo the encroaching coup. The setting charges the final image: observatory now sanctuary, flame steady, truth stitched into walls.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preventing royal murder via unseen threads—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightened when the flame shudders. One decisive escalation: stepping perceptually into adjacent possibilities reveals the Chancellor’s plot and forces the sabotage weave. Cost is visible—she risks being unmasked, yet chooses anonymity. Agency remains hers; coincidence complicates (meteor shower timing) but does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: wisdom disguised as foolishness, truth encoded in overlooked craft. Subtext operates in every stitch—what courtiers dismiss as decoration becomes salvation. Final image reweights the premise: the “fool” is bowed to, yet still silent, her wisdom unread. No moralizing; resonance lingers in the quiet click of the needle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with rhythmic control that accelerates under pressure (“stitched faster, weaving counter-patterns”). Perceptual signature is character-specific: celestial metaphors, tidal cadences, grandmother’s lullaby to dying stars. No dialogue, so focus is on internal texture—clean, consistent, and vivid. Register never drifts; diction stays within the embroiderer’s plausible lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; each sentence layers image, action, and consequence. Metaphors are coherent and purposeful (flame as compass, thread as cipher). No loops or scaffold; redundancy is zero. Syntax modulates with urgency—long lyrical lines give way to clipped beats during the sabotage. Final line lands clean, recharging the echoed silence motif.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Premise—cosmic embroidery that listens to stars and rewrites fate—feels fresh yet inevitable. Tropes (prophecy, hidden genius, palace coup) are transformed through tactile craft and adjacent-dimension espionage. Specificity of silk constellations and aurora strands anchors the fantastical in lived detail. Risky lyric structure pays off: the quiet ending reconfigures meaning without spectacle.</comment>
