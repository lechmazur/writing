<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid—“tremor of certainty” and “seed cracking stone” anchor motive—but the poet’s contradictory impulses remain abstract; no micro-choice under pressure shows how awe scorches palms. The final dance is a bodily enactment of motive, yet the cost is lyrical rather than viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the poet’s single word “Unfold” reconfigures the atrium’s song and her exile into communion. Causality is lyrical, not causal-linear, but the pattern is taught early and held. The cost—her seventeen-year silence—is visible in the hush that answers her.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Cobalt atrium and frozen lake are rendered with synesthetic precision; the quartz pillars literally constrain her motion and later resonate to her touch, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; the barefoot step on marble and the lake’s mirrored constellations track without drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—permission to speak—tightens once: the ban lifts, the colonnade hums louder, and her single word forecloses exile. Pressure is situational and aesthetic; the cost is the long silence already paid, not a new forfeiture, so escalation feels cumulative rather than sharply rising.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the transformation of sacred law into mortal motion; the hymn becomes elegy without didacticism. The final image of lantern-moths at the glass offers a non-literal answer: reverence survives when silence is broken. Subtext lives in the hush itself.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrically compressed yet legible; patterned elision (“lantern-moth hush”) is taught early and paid off. Perceptual signature is distinct—light bent into sound, sound into shadow—without head-hopping. Syntax mirrors the poet’s breath: long spirals, then the single imperative “Unfold.”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence layers image and motion. No loops or scaffold; metaphors are coherent. Occasional elevated diction (“aesthetically driven”) is voice-motivated and does not obscure causality. Final line crystallizes without clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses architectural mysticism with lyric exile; the transformation of a legal ban into a resonant space feels fresh. Risk lies in the lyric mode itself, which pays off in the earned hush. No close echoes; specificity anchors the invented ritual.</comment>
