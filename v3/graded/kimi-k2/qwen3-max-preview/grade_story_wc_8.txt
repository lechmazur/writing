<question>1</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The historian’s interiority is lucid and contradictory—she weeps at symphonies but refuses to derail from evidence, a tension that tightens in the final beat. Micro-choice—fingertip tracing the king’s letter—crystallizes resolve; her resolve to “ask who does it serve” forecloses the myth without triumph yet exacts the cost of public betrayal. Relationship/secondary pressure absent limits score.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise (final step onto platform, no looking back) that reweights the myth’s legitimacy under Causal lens. Linkages (“because” she bears the letter, retreat now impossible) narrow options; cost feels legible—social exile self-assumed. One minor loop—“curated silence” earlier, “curated silence” later—slips against peak control.</comment>

<comment>Station is more than backdrop: brass edge, broken skylight, final petal all materialize to constrain choices and charge closure. Ivy-cracked concrete mirrors internal fracture in a single compressed image, satisfying micro-setting usage.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—truth vs national myth—tightens once via the letter’s reveal; the price is lifelong vilification accepted by the historian. Escalation stays causal under own agency; no external reversals break pressure. Secondary accent (spring timing) not dramatized here.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Noble lies motif emerges through concrete parallels (“every family curates history”), not thesis; theme crystallizes in final invitation to grieve the lie instead of worship it. Complexity lingers without sermonizing.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Voice carries texture: “pit of lies calcified into national myth” and “lantern in a hurricane” reveal a scholarly-lyric fusion that remains consistent yet modulates under pressure. POV holds single focus, no head-hop; late compression (“rose petal mirrors pretense”) tightens style without muddling sense.</comment>

<comment>Sentence rhythm surges naturally—long then clipped to match pulse of discovery. Minor loop: “noble lie” echoed thrice within 150 words; not yet penalized under strict definition but flags attention.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Core premise reframed the myth-dismantling quest into a public imagination reboot (“by drawing parallels”); fresh angle delivered without meta gimmick. Proximity check shows no obvious lifts from famous scenes.</comment>
