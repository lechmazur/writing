<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is evocative but abstract; the librarian’s motives (“to reawaken them”) crystallize only at the end. The scarf functions as charged heirloom, yet her decisive step into the tessellation feels slightly under-motivated—more ritual than wrench. Still, embodied emotion (“humming a lullaby composed of logarithms”) and the final renunciation of retrieval for caretaking give a credible arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the librarian’s entry re-weights stories from archived to living, with conceptual cost—she can visit but never possess. Causal chain is thin (scarf + axiom = portal), yet the accumulative pattern of analog memory holds the lens to the final image. One transition (stacks → amphitheater) is legible and earned.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Scientific poetry library is rendered through tactile specificity—“equations disguised as sonnets,” “scent of old glue”—and the hyperbolic amphitheater constrains her final stance. Spatial choreography is clean; the scarf’s shift from pocket to resonant key charges the closing image. Minor vagueness in tessellation mechanics keeps it from 8.5.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—locate and awaken stories—is signaled early and tightened when she chooses caretaking over extraction. The cost is conceptual (eternal stewardship), visible in the scarf’s luminous re-stitching. Escalation is single but sufficient under Accumulative lens; agency is clear, though external opposition is absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly: analog memory as sanctuary versus digital erasure. Subtext lives in objects (scarf, orbs) and spatial metaphors (hyperbolic “infinite without crowding”). Final image of caretaking reframes prior motifs without moralizing, achieving quiet resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is lyric, precise, and consistent—mathematical diction filtered through elegiac tone. No dialogue; narrative distance stays close third. Patterned elision (“Not metaphorically”) is taught early and paid off. Occasional elevated register (“narrative topology”) risks drift but remains within librarian’s plausible lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet fluid; sentences advance both image and concept. One loop risk—“not metaphorically” used twice—feels intentional rather than artifact. Metaphors stay coherent; no purple overload. Final paragraph’s cadence crystallizes the reconfiguration cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fusion of hyperbolic geometry and narrative ontology feels fresh and inevitable. The Great Data Collapse trope is transformed through tactile analog grief. Risky lyric structure holds; specificity of “non-Euclidean lullabies” anchors the conceit. Minor echo of Borges/Calvino keeps it from 9.0.</comment>
