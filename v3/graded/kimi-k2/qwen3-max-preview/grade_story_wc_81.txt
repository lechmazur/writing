<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The indexer’s interiority is precise—her quiet calibration of mind, the tactile bite of the stamp—yet her contradictory impulses (truth vs survival, renunciation vs witness) never surface in the final ascent beat. Micro-choices (ledger extraction, cross-referencing, final annotation) are visible but framed in declarative summary rather than embodied pressure, blurring emotional stakes moment-to-moment. Endurance is earned but lacks a palpable before/after fracture on the final stair.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration as the stamp becomes covenant seal rather than curio (“accountability, not authority”). The because/therefore chain holds from discovering the Master Index → recording → sealing → vowing to surface, though the ascent stair could carry a sharper final cost image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Silt-choked aisles, kelp-choked skylight, brass vents angled to preserve one book—the drowned library’s architecture constrains every motion and makes rescue impossible without forewarning of air paths. Details are selective, bias-filtered, and serve the closure image of preserved codex rising at the climax.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve truth vs civic erasure—sharpened by the Master Index’s last inscription. One tightening when the stamped notation replaces anonymity with accountability. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral, slightly muting felt price against the scope of submerged city.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Theme emerges organically: truth as testimony, not treasure. “Give the silenced a syntax” reweights the entire archive into one sentence without moralizing. Dappled resolve final image crystallizes stakes and forbids tidy binaries.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>Narrative voice remains calm, analytic, faintly numinous—consistent with the indexer’s tranquilly perceptive stance. Prose is latticed with internal metaphor (“shadows that moved like hesitant thoughts”) yet sustains clarity. Compression and elision serve pressure; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Cadence breathes with pressure escalation; sentences tighten during submersion, lengthen into reverberation at codex opening. Metaphors are exact yet never overwhelm immediacy. Occasional loop in declarative summary is minor; closing vow lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</question>
<comment>The sunken-library-as-archive is familiar terrain, but reframed through the forensic indexing gaze into a fresh moral calculus: not loot but linguistics. Non-obvious survival mechanisms (invisible air ducts, angled vents engineered for decades) feel inevitable in hindsight, charging the preserved codex with real consequence. Bold compression and causal elegance elevate the concept from trope to lived testimony.</comment>
