<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is embodied and specific (phantom twinges, soles registering texture), but the decisive shift from anchor to compass feels slightly under-motivated; no contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene to earn the pearl’s crystallization.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of noticing → sketching → gifting sketches tightens through cadence shift. Closure lands as Charged Poise: “I carry the pearl now, not in my pocket, but in my pulse” reweights prior motifs with felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Arboretum’s decay and cliff-edge exposure constrain choices (barefoot grounding, bench swallowed by ivy) and charge the final image; micro-setting (dewdrop pearl) functions as setting-object that crystallizes stillness.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transforming grief into usable stillness—tightens via sketching ritual and gifting; cost is the irrevocable absence of sister yet acceptance of her laugh as frequency. One deepening suffices under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: ruin/regrowth coexistence, stillness as eye within chaos. Final pearl image offers non-literal, resonant answer without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct—quiet, sensorily precise, lyric without purple drift. Perceptual signature (“how silence can be stitched into something wearable”) remains consistent; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid; no loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Sentence rhythm modulates with emotional crests; final line crystallizes without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of drone-survivor grief with arboretum-as-collaborator; pearl of stillness concept feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Specificity anchors universals; no stock tropes.</comment>
