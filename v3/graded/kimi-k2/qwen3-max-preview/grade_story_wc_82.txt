<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas’s grief is embodied in origami cranes and lantern craft; interiority is vivid, but the final transformation feels slightly under-motivated—his smile arrives without a prior beat of contradiction or cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the sapphire’s fall folds the world, grief into lift. Causal chain holds—each lantern release tightens stakes—though the shadow’s ascent could be clearer one beat earlier.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Floating isle, basilica, and tea garden are not backdrop but pressure: gravity weeps, cups never cool, spires hum. The final drift sideways is earned because the setting’s rules have constrained every prior choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserve vs release the recorded dreams—tightens once: the basilica’s new key forces the dirge and shattering. Cost is visible in the lanterns’ destruction and the shadow’s satiation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme of grief’s alchemy emerges through image, not statement: cranes descending while ascending reweight loss into grace. Final crane’s still-hover reconfigures meaning without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Luminous, lapidary prose carries a distinct perceptual signature—ember-glow eyes, tea-steeped memory—without purple drift. Compression and elision are taught early and paid off in the closing chord.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops, high density: “folded space as they folded air” does double duty. Metaphors stay coherent; rhythm modulates with emotional crests. No artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Dream-recording lanterns, descending cranes, and grief-polished gems synthesize into a singular vision. The sideways drift into a dimension where grief and grace share breath feels inevitable yet unforeseen.</comment>
