<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elira’s interiority is vivid and embodied—ink-stained fingers, saltwater refracting light—yet her contradictory impulses (grief vs curiosity) remain simultaneous rather than alternating. The micro-choice to leave one glass eye as a beacon crystallizes her arc and carries visible cost. Twin absence is felt rather than explained, avoiding diagnostic speak. Only a slight over-articulation of “mathematics of emotion” keeps it from 9+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the orchard’s silence reframed as resonance, the equation on the wall reweighting loss into transformation. Causality holds under Accumulative/Textural lens—each beat layers density until the final image reconfigures meaning. Cost is legible in the relinquished hazel eye and the single fallen fruit. Mosaic shards and glass-eye projection are taught early and paid off cleanly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The cavern orchard is not backdrop but active constraint: bioluminescent sap dims with absence, stalactite drips act as metronomic pressure, and the mosaic stepping stone literally guides footfalls and gaze. Micro-setting—the glass eye atop tesserae pupils—functions as setting-object that charges the final projection. Spatial choreography remains coherent; no impossible positions. Only the brief “far beyond dripping stone” risks spatial vagueness.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—comprehending ambiguous loss—tightens through each beat: from tracing cracks to decoding Aris’s equation. Agency is intellectual yet embodied; the harmonic hum narrows options to a single frequency. Cost is felt in relinquishing the hazel eye and accepting separation as generative. Pressure escalates via pattern intensification rather than external antagonist, fitting Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: loss not as void but as curvature that creates new geometry. Subtext resides in silence reframed as resonance, in the orchard’s withheld breath. Final image—“the glass eye left behind…winked”—offers non-literal answer without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo; no character states the thesis aloud.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise: “droplets…like metronomes counting down to nothing” teaches pattern early. Syntax mirrors Elira’s analytical bent—integrals whispered, variables in cracks—without slipping into academic jargon. No head-hopping; POV remains tightly anchored. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing” risk) stays within conjurer’s plausible lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: every sentence layers image, concept, or emotional charge. Metaphors dovetail (light around mass, saltwater refraction) without muddle. No loops or scaffold; no filter-verb stacks. Rhythm accelerates into the final orchard pulse, then exhales. Only “latent equations” skirts near cliché but is redeemed by context.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: mathematical grief encoded in bioluminescent fruit and fractured mosaic. Trope of vanished twin transformed through geometry rather than sentiment. Risky lyric-accumulative structure pays off in resonant closure. Specificity of cobalt vs hazel eyes, childhood lullaby in minor-major keys—details irreplaceable. Feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
