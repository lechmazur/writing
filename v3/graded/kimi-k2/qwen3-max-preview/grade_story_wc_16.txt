<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The linguist’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her shaking hands, trembling ink well, and micro-choice to test the vowel aloud all reveal the stakes. Motivation (restoring trust) is consistent and escalates from solitary obsession to communal risk. The final renunciation—singing the restored score—carries visible cost (betrayal risk) and earns the closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the communal singing reweights meaning from solitary scholarship to shared harmony. Causal chain holds—betrayal of one harmonic promise caused the Silence; restoring it demands collective fidelity. The glass ink well’s final emptying crystallizes the cost. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: density of musical detail tightens until the chord resolves.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The archive’s acoustics actively constrain tactics—resonance charts, vaulted rotunda, dust motes vibrating—turning setting into instrument. Micro-setting (ink well, slate tablet) is handled tactilely and reappears charged in the final image. Spatial choreography remains coherent; no white-room syndrome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restoring trust via linguistic truth) is signaled early and escalates through each recovered note. The final chord forces a communal wager: sing faithfully or shatter meaning again. Cost is legible—linguist’s voice never wavers, but collective betrayal risk remains. One meaningful tightening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: truth as performative harmony, trust as shared resonance. Subtext operates in the curator’s warning and the chandelier’s single pure tone. Final image (empty ink well casting prismatic shards) offers non-literal reweighting of “promises kept.” No moralizing; ambiguity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with controlled compression (“carefully reckless,” “semantic dissonance”). Perceptual signature is character-bound—dust motes spiraling under vowel resonance. No head-hopping; curator’s brief dialogue carries subtext. Rhythm modulates with pressure: short declaratives at climax.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence advances stakes or atmosphere. Figurative language is purposeful (e.g., “symphonies of truth” literalized). No loops or scaffold; sentence variety supports cadence. Minor elevated diction (“crescendo of musical notation”) fits POV’s scholarly lexicon.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise—legal parchments as musical scores whose harmonic fidelity underpins civilization—is fresh and fully committed. Tropes (lost language, scholar-hero) are transformed through acoustic epistemology. Risky structural choice (story as score) pays off in closure. Specificity grounds abstraction; no derivative drift.</comment>
