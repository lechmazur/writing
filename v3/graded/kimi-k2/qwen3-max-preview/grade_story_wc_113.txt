<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied—"trembling resonance of her cello’s mute body strapped to her back like armor"—but the contradictory impulses are stated rather than dramatized in scene. The final renunciation (playing silently) is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: she leaves the program dry, the ghost dissolved, her purpose crystallized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the ghost’s bow and her silent bowing crystallize a shared performance that reweights the premise—silence now sings. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout; each water-stain magnification intensifies the pattern until the final fermata. Cost is legible in her emptied lungs and the lantern’s dying glow.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The flooded pit, lantern angle, and floating program actively constrain every gesture; the 37-degree tilt is a physical rule that enables the climax. Micro-setting (ankle-deep water, mold-streaked walls) is filtered through her musician’s bias—she reads stains as clefs. The final image of warm water against skin recharges the opening chill.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decode the submerged score—tightens through each magnification of stains until the only option is silent performance. Agency is exercised in the wordless conducting, foreclosing any audible music. The cost is felt in the final “lungs empty, heart full,” a visible forfeiture of sound.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: absence as composition, silence as music. The water-damaged program embodies this without ever stating it. The final non-literal answer—she leaves humming with silence—reweights the entire premise; the flood has composed its masterpiece through her.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; perceptual signature is that of a trained listener—“spaces between notes,” “hollows beneath stages.” Syntax lengthens into breathless cadences under the ghost’s crescendo, then contracts at the fermata. No head-hopping; POV remains locked in her skin.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and musical—“spiraling arpeggios around her legs”—yet every image advances the submerged score motif. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is pattern-taught and paid off. The final paragraph’s quiet exhalation mirrors the earlier “hush of unstruck chords” without redundancy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The premise—floodwater as composer, stains as sheet music—is fresh and fully committed. Ghost-conductor trope is transformed through wordless choreography and silent cello. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; the ending feels inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
