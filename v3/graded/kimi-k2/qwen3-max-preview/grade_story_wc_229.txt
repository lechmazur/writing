<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the blistered fingers, shallow breath, and the vow “carved into her ribs” ground motive. Micro-choice—pressing the cork to her lips—drives the climax with visible cost (knees buckling, cork warm). Flaw: no contradictory impulse in-scene; intent is monolithic, not tested under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final image of Elara breathing jasmine-ghosted air crystallizes the reconfiguration—tenderness now pilots the sea. Causal chain holds: cork test → scent release → ships turn → Elara’s quiet acknowledgment. Cost is felt in her bodily collapse and the empty vial beside the warm cork. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) taught early and intact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cobalt tower, peeling paint, salt silence, and dawn pressure are selective, purposeful. The lighthouse itself constrains her movement (spiral descent, gallery ascent) and supplies the beam that later pulses with her heartbeat. Micro-setting of cork-in-palm and vial scent anchors the sensory climax. No orientation drift; geography remains coherent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Dominant stake—can unshouted intent reroute despair—signaled in paragraph one. Single tightening: the act of uncorking and releasing scent narrows all options to this one gamble. Cost is visceral (knees sink, throat thick with honeyed relief). Agency is hers; coincidence (ships happen to smell jasmine) complicates rather than resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of “tenderness as frequency” emerges from concrete events—fishermen’s nets, captain’s unclenched fists—never stated as thesis. Final image reweights premise: the world heals not by decree but by scent, vibration, silence. Subtext in the gull’s greeting and tide’s whisper carries the resonance without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</question><comment>Voice is lyric yet disciplined; perceptual signature (“salt and silence,” “ghost of rain”) is Elara’s alone. Syntax modulates with pressure—long cadences in calm, clipped fragments at climax. No head-hopping; interior texture consistent. Dialogue minimal but authentic (“Like my mother’s porch… after the storm”) and advances plot via subtext.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Prose is dense, musical, and propulsive; each line layers scent, memory, and motion. Metaphors (“bruised sentinel,” “liquid gold”) are precise and earned. No loops or scaffold; no mixed metaphors in peak beats. Minor register drift (“conceptual repricing”) is isolated and does not dull closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Premise—cork that purifies intent via scent and vibration—is fresh yet grounded in tactile detail. Transformation test passes: story collapses without this exact lighthouse, cork, and scent. Risky lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry. Avoids familiar lighthouse tropes by centering on olfactory metaphysics.</comment>
