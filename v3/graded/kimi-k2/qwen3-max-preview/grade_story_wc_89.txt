<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority is lush and embodied; the whisperer’s contradictory hunger—quiet yet ravenous—drives every micro-choice. The final surrender is credibly rooted in prior refusals and the cookie’s recursive invitation, so the bond’s re-forging carries felt cost. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible not tested. Flaw is static: she never missteps or doubts once spices burn, so tension is emotional, not moral.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer thickens until moon-pulse and ember-spark crystallize the Resonant Reconfiguration. Closure lands with undeniable cost—“anchor” now carries inter-dimensional upkeep. Orientation anchored by line 3; no teleporting props. One soft beat: fortune paper re-appears “each dawn” off-stage, but its return is later dramatized, so causality holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Orchard, moon, and spice-scent are not backdrop but active collaborators—branches lean, gravity bends, petals become ash-fuel. The pear tree’s silver bark and saffron tears constrain how conjuring can occur, charging the final spark. Spatial choreography clean; no floating rooms. Micro-setting (her cupped palms) doubles as crucible, meeting 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reforge bond beyond death—signaled in paragraph 3 and tightened when spices soften reality’s edges, foreclosing retreat. Escalation is textural: each aroma adds density until refusal would shatter the spell, so agency shifts to surrender. Cost is legible: she exits “something in-between,” implying permanent translational existence. No external antagonist, but internal pressure suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particularized scent-memory and cosmic covenant rather than thesis statements. Final image—“universe leaned closer, intimate as a lover’s sigh”—reweights earlier solitude without moralizing. Fortune cookie line could flirt with Echo, but its reprise is recontextualized as invitation, not lesson. Ambiguity lingers: is she now immortal, interface, or conduit?—inviting reflection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tightly bound to whisperer’s synesthetic perception; diction (“ember-feathers,” “cinnamon bark peeled from trees that grew sideways in time”) is unmistakably hers. Rhythm swells with longing, then compresses at the spark-birth, mirroring emotional arc. No dialogue until final exchange, and those two lines carry mythic indirection appropriate to phoenix. Filter verbs absent; perception is immediate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and opening, propelling the ritual crescendo. Figurative language is dense yet each metaphor services the metamorphosis engine; no mixed vehicles. One paraphrase loop—“not to command, but to remember” / “not to loss, but to reciprocity”—reads as intentional anaphoric pattern, not scaffold. Zero typos or tense drift; copy is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Familiar phoenix resurrection is re-angled through aromatheric necromancy and cosmic intimacy, making the trope feel singular. Risk taken: nearly pure lyric accumulation rather than plot reversals, yet coherence holds. Specificity of celestial-market spices and sideways-growing cinnamon roots the fantastical in tactile economy. Could edge higher if whisperer’s pre-loss life were less archetypal.</comment>
