<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The guard’s dreamlessness and mission are vividly embodied; his micro-choice to “charm” the sphere crystallizes motive and cost. Interiority is concrete, but the absence of contradictory impulse under pressure keeps him just shy of 9.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the chess-clock’s tremor and the guard’s softened shoulders reweight the premise with felt cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each shard layers density until the final cadence shift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The glowing dune, chess clock, and archive corridors are selective, sensory, and purposeful; the dune’s bioluminescent petals mirror the guard’s pulse and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is flawless.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“cultivate sparks”—is signaled early and tightened when the guard chooses resonance over extraction. The cost is legible in the sphere’s awakening and the clock’s first tremor.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the guard’s refusal to dream and his act of enabling possibility; the final image of a clock beginning to tick offers a non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, lyric, and consistent; patterned elision (“fractured lullaby,” “syncopated sigh”) is taught early and paid off in the closing cadence. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is unwavering.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and propulsive; figurative language is purposeful and never muddles causality. Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere or stakes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of quantum archive, dreamless guardian, and silence-as-cargo feels inevitable and fresh; the “charm” mechanic redefines agency without gimmickry. Specificity anchors the speculative frame.</comment>
