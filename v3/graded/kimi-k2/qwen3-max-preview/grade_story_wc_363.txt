<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical and specific; the spinner’s contradictory impulse—cling to memory yet dissolve into the weave—drives every beat. Her final renunciation is foreshadowed by the amber bead’s pulse and the loom’s reconfiguration, so the sacrifice feels inevitable and costly. The only minor slip is a touch of diagnostic self-awareness (“she understood”) mid-climax.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the empty chair and hovering bead crystallize the cost without exposition. Causal chain—puzzle → loom rebuild → self-weaving → message arrival—holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens; each shuttle pass visibly deepens the sacrifice. No orientation drift; spatial anchors are clear within 120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The orchard’s moss-slick boulder and curling bamboo leaves physically constrain the loom’s placement and later echo the tapestry’s harmonic resonance. Micro-setting (amber bead as miniature sun) directly charges the final image. Selective sensory detail (scent of plum, ticking beetles) filters through the spinner’s narrowed perception under pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—deliver the message or lose love forever—is signaled in paragraph three and tightened by each thread sacrificed. One decisive deepening: the realization she must weave herself into the pattern, which forecloses retreat. Cost is visceral and on-page: memories transmuted to glyphs, body dissolved.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of love as both tether and sacrifice emerges through image, not statement; the amber bead’s reprise reweights the entire orchard sequence. Subtext in the humming lullaby carries what tears would have broken. Final image of the man’s unexplained warmth avoids moralizing and invites lingering reflection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Lyrical third-person limited sustains a hushed, incantatory rhythm that mirrors the spinner’s trance. Perceptual signature is consistent: attention to shimmer, sap, thread tension. No head-hopping; POV distance remains steady until the final shard, which is cleanly signaled.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet clear; each sentence layers image and motion. No loops or scaffold; metaphors (raveling silence, spilled ink minutes) stay coherent. Occasional elevated diction (“entropy and sorrow”) is earned by the mythic register and never muddies causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Combines star-map jigsaw, loom-magic, and self-sacrifice into an organic whole; the constellation-doorway concept feels fresh yet inevitable. Specificity of the amber bead’s trapped firefly ghost prevents cliché. Risk in the lyric dissolution pays off by charging the final image.</comment>
