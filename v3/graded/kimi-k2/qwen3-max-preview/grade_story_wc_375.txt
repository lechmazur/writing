<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“charcoal-fingered,” “twitch—not from cold”), but the final transformation leans on lyric assertion more than dramatized contradiction; the apology to her child-self lands as earned renunciation with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single-scene causal arc: descent → confrontation → release. Closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the cave’s glow warms and portraits lift away; cost is felt in the broken lock and spent tears.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Crystal cave is not backdrop but active witness; its auroral grief constrains her silence and later gentles, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clean, sensory detail selective and POV-filtered.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—uncork creativity or drown—signaled early and tightened by each remembered face. Agency drives escalation: she kneels, exhales, draws with mind, then with charcoal; cost is the irrevocable release of every stored portrait.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of imprisoned creativity emerges through concrete objects (lock, charcoal) and images (portraits breathing in stone). Final release reweights the premise without moralizing; resonance lingers in the warming cave.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice stays close to the artist’s perceptual signature; diction is controlled, rhythm modulates with emotional rise. No dialogue, so no voice leakage; compression and elision are purposeful and legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet fluid; figurative language serves pressure without clutter. Minor echo (“every…every…every”) forgiven under lyric pattern. No loops or scaffold in peak beats; final line crystallizes momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Familiar artist-versus-censor trope is transformed through geode-cave witness and mnemonic haunting. Specificity of charcoal nub and broken lock feels inevitable; synthesis is fresh, risk-taking coherent.</comment>
