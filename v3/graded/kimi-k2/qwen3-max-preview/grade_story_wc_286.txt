<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The potter’s quiet, unyielding motivation is embodied in every micro-choice—kneeling, tracing, pouring water—yet her interiority remains slightly abstract; the final refusal to fire the kiln crystallizes her arc with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (smoke, wax, thrum) tightens the stake until the final image of the porous pot reconfigures meaning; closure is a Charged Poise with felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The beekeeping oasis is rendered with selective, tactile detail—broken cathedrals of hives, pooled wax—constraining her choice to leave the pot unfired; the lantern glass functions as micro-setting that charges the final glow.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—why places resist change—escalates through sensory accumulation and the bee’s return; the tightening is subtle (renunciation of firing) but carries unmistakable cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: preservation as resonance rather than stasis; the final image of light through fracture offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature—clay-dust fingers, resinous time—sustained through lyric compression; no head-hopping, rhythm modulates with heat and hush.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet fluid—“liquid regret,” “palimpsest of summers”—with zero loops; occasional elevated diction is voice-motivated and never muddles causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of potter, beekeeper, and time-bent oasis; the phototropic lantern glass and unfired vessel transform familiar motifs into inevitable, specific closure.</comment>
