<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s claustrophobia and prudence are embodied in trembling fingers, shallow breath, and the mantra of coordinates; the compass needle pointing at her own chest crystallizes her interior contradiction and earns the final renunciation with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single-scene descent under an Accumulative/Textural lens; the organ’s chord progression tightens the pattern until the key dissolves into her, delivering a Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights space itself. Orientation is immediate, closure legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Starlight shafts, petrified-wood pipes, and the narrowing passage physically constrain her movement; the moving star-dome reconfigures the final image, making the chamber itself an active agent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—retrieve the cipher—tightens when the compass points inward, forcing a trade-off between possession and embodiment; the cost is the surrender of her claustrophobia and the old definition of space.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Spatial mutiny reframed from chaos to liberation emerges through concrete events: walls that once threatened now widen, the key dissolves into flesh, and the organ’s lament becomes a hymn of possibility—earned, not asserted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Lyric, sensorily precise prose mirrors Elara’s cartographer mind; the rhythmic rise of organ chords and the hush of starlight create a distinct perceptual signature without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary from breathless compression in the squeeze to open cadences at the end; no loops, mixed metaphors, or scaffold. Density is high—each image does double duty for atmosphere and stakes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The fusion of claustrophobia, cartography, and sentient architecture feels inevitable and fresh; the “lonely church organ” as self-playing engine of spatial rebellion is a risk that pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
