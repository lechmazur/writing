<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elira’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses (to preserve memory vs. to feel time’s texture) are dramatized in the moment she caresses the halo. The final renunciation—accepting the garden’s symbiotic feeding on her past—earns its cost through prior causality. Minor slip: the “texture” obsession is stated more than tested until the climax.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elira’s acceptance of the garden’s hunger reweights every prior beat. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each sensory beat thickens until the final image crystallizes the cost. Orientation is taught early via the inverted garden, and the halo’s wound is legible on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The living bridge garden is not backdrop but active agent: arches age the walker, roots drink tears, geometry bends perception. Micro-setting (the halo fragment) constrains the final choice. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered; no white-room syndrome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can Elira feel time’s texture without losing her memories—tightens when the photographs disintegrate. One decisive intensification: the halo’s touch collapses the garden and her anchors. Cost is visible (ash, absence) and felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the garden’s consumption of memory to grow beauty; no moralizing. The final image—silver flowers chiming from her tears—offers a non-literal answer: grief is coarse, joy porous, and both are the price of perception. Subtext operates in gesture (caressing the wound) rather than statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lush yet precise, with rhythmic control that accelerates under pressure (“the world stuttered”). Perceptual signature is consistent: Elira notices texture, grain, pulse. No head-hopping; compression and elision are taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; each sentence layers texture without redundancy. One mixed metaphor (“gravity into a question mark”) barely grazes clarity. No loops or scaffold; final image is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: hedge-maze designer + hyperbolic time-garden + retrocognitive synesthesia. The premise commits fully; no retreat into safe metaphor. Risk-taking (inverted physics, memory as thread) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
