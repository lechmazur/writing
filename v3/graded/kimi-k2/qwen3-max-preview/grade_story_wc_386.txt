<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority is precise and embodied (“her breath curling like incense,” “palms flat against the ice altar”); the contradictory impulse—salvage purity yet risk shattering truth—drives the final placement of the globe. Motivation stays character-bound and intensifies under pressure; the smile at the end is earned cost. No relationship crucible on page, but single-POV depth compensates.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of dream-cameo accumulation tightens until the globe’s placement reconfigures meaning. Closure is a Charged Poise—the crystalline window reframes stakes and releases the child’s echo with felt conceptual cost (“truth… can mend”). Orientation and causality are clean; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Glacier shrine, candle-veined ice, and the melted snow globe function as micro-setting that constrains the final act: only the ice window can refract the echo. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered; spatial choreography is exact. The setting charges the final image, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—salvage uncorrupted echo—tightens through accumulating dream fragments until the globe’s placement forecloses further haunting. Agency is renunciation/attention with visible cost: the whisperer relinquishes ownership to the ice window. One meaningful deepening suffices for length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: the ethics of witnessing and releasing memory versus possessing it. Subtext lives in gesture (cradling the warm globe in glacial cold) and silence. Final image reweights premise without moralizing—windows refract, they don’t own light.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet controlled; perceptual signature is distinct (“borrowed starlight,” “blue-veined ice”). Compression and patterned elision are taught early (“she weaves truth carefully”) and paid off at closure. No dialogue, so no voice convergence; internal texture remains coherent under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density (“the sea swallowed the promise, but the globe remembered”). Metaphors are precise and physically coherent. Rhythm modulates with scene needs; final sentence cadence crystallizes closure. No line-level artifacts in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Premise—wreck-diver ghost whisperer who maps dream cameos—feels fresh yet inevitable. Tropes (ghost child, haunted object) are transformed through specific occupational lens and glacial micro-setting. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; synthesis is non-obvious and resonant.</comment>
