<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority is rich, embodied, and contradictory (“confidently uncertain”); the pen’s inheritance and the mentor’s vanishing anchor motive; micro-choice to “unbend” syntax is dramatized; final renunciation carries felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the anomaly settles, pen brims with starlight, history now fluid. Causal chain (planting seeds → anomaly → edits → new stance) holds under Accumulative/Textural lens. Cost is legible in the final whispered line.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Gravitational anomaly is not backdrop but active medium; warped crust, bent light, and narrative gravity constrain every move. Pen functions as micro-setting/tool that charges closure. Sensory selection mirrors POV priorities.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—thresh meaning from regret—tightens via each small edit; pressure escalates as edits accumulate and cost accrues (lost certainties). Agency drives every shift; no coincidence resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of revision-as-redemption emerges organically from the anomaly’s edits; final image (“start dancing with its grammar”) offers resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext in pen’s silence and backward star-whispers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, lyric, and POV-locked; metaphysical register sustained without slippage. Compression and patterned diction taught early and paid off in closure. No head-hopping; perceptual signature sharp.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and propulsive; occasional stacked metaphors verge on excess but serve the lyric mode. No loops or scaffold; final cadence crystallizes without clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of astrophysics, grammar, and regret; “editing history” via gravitational anomaly is non-obvious yet inevitable. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
