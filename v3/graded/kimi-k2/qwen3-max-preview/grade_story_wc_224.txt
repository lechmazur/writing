<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority is textured and embodied; the seer's contradictory longing to bury her own talent while having spent decades resurrecting others' is dramatized through the tactile ritual with feather and stone. The final kneeling beat crystallizes an earned renunciation with visible cost—she gives up the translator role to inhabit the home she once only read for others.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the stone cracks, gravity replaces prophecy, and the archway of her own handwriting reconfigures the bookstore into home. Causality under an Accumulative/Textural lens holds—the feather’s texture seeds the new truth, and the mountain’s architecture breathes in response, all on-page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The mercury-glass surfaces, shifting shelves, and stormcloud atlas are selective, sensory, and purposeful; they constrain movement and charge the final image when the rearranged shelves form the archway. Micro-setting (the stone, the feather) functions as setting when it anchors her feet and redefines space.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“the shape of home”—is signaled early and tightens through each tactile beat until the final reconfiguration forecloses the path of endless translation. Agency is dramatized: she chooses to inhabit rather than interpret, paying the cost of relinquishing her seer identity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: home as frequency, not place. The feather’s dissolution and the stone’s backward-hatching enact the insight without statement; the thunder at the end offers a non-literal, resonant answer that reweights the entire quest.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; perceptual signature filters every detail through the seer’s synesthetic attention (“obsidian wind,” “tactile luminescence”). Rhythm modulates with emotional pressure—long, breath-like sentences at climax mirror the final exhale.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; each image does double duty (e.g., “mercury over glass” evokes both medium and emotional state). No loops or scaffold; figurative language is patterned and paid off. Final line lands with crystalline clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The premise—mountain-bookstore as living memory archive, seer who translates others but not herself—feels fresh and inevitable. Risky lyric accumulation is sustained without gimmickry; the transformation of home from geometry to frequency is a non-obvious synthesis.</comment>
