<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied—her hovering feet, the tablet’s pulse against her chest—but the final integration of “branching selves” is asserted more than dramatized; the cost feels conceptual rather than viscerally paid. Micro-choices (touching walls, speaking confessions) are present, yet the climactic merger with echoes lacks a tangible forfeiture that would push this to 9+. Still, contradictory impulses (fear vs. defiance) coexist credibly in-scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the tablet blooms, selves merge, and a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) crystallizes—“I am the branching.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each corridor deepens pattern until the final image reweights all prior recursion. One causal seam: the “viaduct trembles” beat is slightly abstract, but the conceptual cost (fracturing reality) is legible and felt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The glowing viaduct and suspended raindrops are not backdrop but active constraint—gravity yields, timelines leak, rain freezes—each detail tightens options. Micro-setting (tablet as second heart) charges the final image. Spatial choreography remains coherent; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“conquer the labyrinth of self”—is signaled early and escalates via procedural corridors that force confession and integration. Pressure tightens once: honesty fractures the viaduct. Cost is visible (tablet cracks, reality shudders), though slightly diffuse because the price is existential rather than concrete.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from recursion and fracture: identity as branching paths rather than singular destiny. Subtext lives in the tablet’s blooming petals—confession as seed, not absolution. Final image reweights earlier motifs without moralizing. Avoids tidy resolution; ambiguity lingers productively.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; perceptual signature is distinct—“phosphorescent residue of temporal leakage,” “runes grown like roots.” Patterned elision (procedural corridors) is taught early and paid off. No head-hopping; POV remains anchored in the defier’s sensorium throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; figurative language is purposeful and pattern-driven. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or pressure. Minor risk of overwriting in “liquid starlight” but cadence supports climax. Clean mechanics.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: procedural generation as memory palace, gravity-defiance as metaphor for self-definition. Risky recursive structure pays off in closure. Specificity of “equations inverted, screaming” prevents generic feel. Transformation test passed—plot could not swap names without collapse.</comment>
