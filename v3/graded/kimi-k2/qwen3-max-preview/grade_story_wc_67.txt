<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The ash scatterer’s contradictory impulses—clinging to the mask’s history yet scattering ashes to release memory—are embodied in her micro-choices (bare feet, deliberate scattering). The final motionless sit in the rocking chair is earned by prior ritual, carrying visible cost: she accepts the silence she once feared. Interiority is concrete and character-specific, avoiding diagnostic labels. Only a slight under-articulation of the mask’s emotional weight in the final beat keeps it from 9+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the rocking chair’s stillness crystallizes the gallery’s new silence and reconfigures the scatterer’s stance—she chooses to inhabit absence rather than flee it. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each ash scattering intensifies the gallery’s hush until the final stillness. Cost is legible in the line “the mirage of safety fades.” Pattern taught early and paid off without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The gallery’s hardwood, dim light, and velvet pouch are selective and purposeful, constraining movement and ritual. The rocking chair evolves from motion to stillness, charging the final image. Sensory detail is filtered through the scatterer’s bias—she notices breath in canvases, not patrons. Micro-setting (chair) functions as setting and stakes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—crystallizing emotion before it evaporates—is signaled early and tightened when the woman’s recognition forces the scatterer to witness the cost of her ritual. Escalation is accumulative: each ash layer deepens the gallery’s silence until the chair stops. Agency is renunciation—she sits motionless, accepting the silence. Cost is felt but could be sharper on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the tension between safety as stasis and truth as fragmentary: the mask, ashes, and incomplete portraits embody this without direct statement. The final candle’s trembling flame offers a non-literal answer—truth persists in flickering, not fixity. Subtext operates in the woman’s tears and the scatterer’s refusal to remove the mask. No moralizing; complexity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, lyrical, and controlled: “voice curled around corners like smoke” is character-specific perception. Syntax mirrors the scatterer’s deliberate ritual—long sentences for scattering, fragments for stillness. No head-hopping; POV remains tight. Compression (“bare feet whispering”) is taught early and legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; each sentence layers texture without redundancy. Figurative language is purposeful—“cremated remains of unsent letters” fuses concept and image. No loops or scaffold. Minor register drift in “conceptual repricing” phrase is negligible. Final image is crystalline.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The ash-scattering ritual to freeze ephemeral emotion is fresh, grounded in tactile detail. Transformation test: story fails without the porcelain mask’s history and the rocking chair’s final stillness. Risky lyric compression pays off. No close echoes of famous scenes.</comment>
