<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s contradictory drive—fixing clocks to understand failure—anchors every beat; the final renunciation of his father’s watch crystallizes the arc with visible cost. Interiority is concrete (“hands stained with oil and regret”), yet the admiral remains off-page, so relationship crucible is N/A. Micro-choices (tracing grooves, tossing the watch) reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. Flawed obsession complicates choices to the end.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elias refuses the old certainty, foreclosing return to surface-time, cost legible in the vanished watch. Causal chain holds—compass pulses → greenhouse → cavern → renunciation—without teleporting props. Mosaic shards (surface, cavern, return) are taught early by pattern of threes/fives/sevens and cohere under Accumulative/Textural lens. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Iron-bridge workshop, cracked greenhouse, singing waterfall—each micro-setting constrains movement and charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy (rust, rainwater, phosphorescent moss) filters through Elias’s tinkerer gaze. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from surface to cavern and back. The compass-as-tool functions as mobile setting that rewrites geography.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—impose order vs. embrace uncertainty—tightens when compass refuses north and Elias must choose beneath the falls. One decisive deepening: tossing the watch into the pool forecloses perfect-time obsession with felt cost. Pressure escalates under Accumulative lens via pattern repetition and mythic density. No external antagonist needed; internal conflict suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: “Plans are anchors” reframed by lived experience, not stated thesis. Subtext in compass’s refusal to point north and the watch’s silent sink. Final image—shop sign “Tinkerer of Lost Directions”—reweights premise without moralizing. Complexity preserved: uncertainty embraced yet cost acknowledged.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct, tactile, tinkerer-specific: “gears that refused to turn,” “pendulums that forgot their rhythm.” Rhythm modulates with pressure—long lyrical cadence in cavern, clipped practicality on return. No dialogue, so voice purity remains intact. Perceptual signature consistent throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, propulsive, zero loops; figurative language serves theme (“vines swallowed iron frames like green teeth”). No scaffold or synonym churn. Sentence variety mirrors emotional arc. Occasional elevated diction justified by mythic register.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: clock-repair as metaphysics, compass as anti-map, subterranean fleet lost to certainty. Risky structure—portal fantasy in <800 words—paid off with coherent closure. Specificity of cinnamon-tasting mushrooms and metronome-screwdriver prevents generic fantasy drift. Transformation test passed: story collapses without these exact particulars.</comment>
