<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—creating beauty that must vanish—drives every micro-choice; the mute girl’s trembling hands crystallize the cost. Silas’s whispered counsel deepens rather than directs, keeping agency with Elara. The final renunciation (no archive, only felt echo) is earned and painful.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single continuous scene, causal lens holds: “She wasn’t here to capture images… but to listen” sets the trajectory; each gesture escalates stakes until the click of the empty shutter reconfigures silence into communal music. Closure lands as Earned Stasis—beauty released, memory erased—with the girl’s heartbeat the only surviving record.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Moonlit harbor is not backdrop but instrument: lantern flickers, rope creaks, and wave curves become musical notation. The pier’s spatial choreography stays lucid; the camera’s empty lens reframes perception rather than records. Micro-setting (camera body, pier planks) constrains the final choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—translate silence into vanishing music—tightens when the mute girl appears; Elara’s agency turns the moment into shared creation. Cost is felt: “this music would vanish with the tide.” No coincidence resolves; pressure culminates in the shutter click that releases rather than captures.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from gesture and absence: silence as canvas, memory as erasure. Subtext lives in the empty camera and the girl’s barefoot awe. Final image—“remembered by no one tomorrow, but forever felt”—reweights the premise without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lyrical compression is taught early (“luminous harbor by moonlight shimmered like spilled mercury”) and sustained; POV remains tightly anchored to Elara’s selective perception. Silas’s whisper and the girl’s trembling hands carry distinct rhythmic signatures. No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates with emotional swell.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet fluid; each image performs double duty (“the wind, her conductor”). No loops or scaffold; metaphors stay coherent. Rhythm accelerates into the shutter click, then exhales. Line-level precision supports the musical conceit without purple excess.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: sign language as musical notation, camera as frame not recorder, silence as score. The conceit commits fully; no retreat into metaphorical safety. Risk—ephemeral art—heightens stakes without gimmickry. Transformation test passed: story collapses if any element swapped.</comment>
