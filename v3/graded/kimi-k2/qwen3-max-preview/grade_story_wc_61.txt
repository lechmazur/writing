<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The sentimentalist’s interiority is richly embodied—hands “threaded with starlight,” the gear’s weight felt—yet the arc drifts more than it tightens; the final “troubling serenity” registers as mood rather than a concrete renunciation with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the gear’s transformation from calculator to lighthouse is a Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights the generational pattern. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each sonar pulse layers memory until the final glow—though the cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The nebula garden is never mere backdrop; its petals physically slow the sentimentalist’s descent and absorb/return the pings, making the cosmos an active participant that constrains and enables the final transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—break the generational pattern of burning to be bright—escalates through each pulse and petal, culminating in the gear’s quiet radiance. The tightening is present but diffuse; the cost is poetic rather than sharply material.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: the shift from incandescent violence to bioluminescent gentleness is never preached, only enacted. The final image of the gear as “lighthouse without flame” reweights the entire premise with understated but undeniable force.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The voice is consistently lyrical, its cosmic diction disciplined by tactile detail (“scent of oil and ozone”). Purposeful compression—no dialogue, only vibration—serves the elegiac tone without ever losing clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid; figurative language is patterned and paid off (“petals…fell slower now, as if listening”). One minor loop—“quiet sigh of falling petals” twice—barely grazes momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The premise—an immortal archivist who “sings” memory into wounded artifacts—feels genuinely fresh, synthesizing cosmic SF and quiet elegy without cliché. The risk of a non-causal, lyric structure is fully realized and coherent.</comment>
