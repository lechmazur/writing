<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and idiosyncratic; the engineer’s contradictory impulses (precision vs. chaos) play out in real time as she re-weights the child’s memory. The final act of pocketing the mirror carries visible cost—she accepts the entanglement and the night-long labor ahead—so the change is earned. Minor slip: “synaptic plasticity” is named more than dramatized, a touch of label-speak that keeps her from full 9-band immediacy.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the cracked mirror becomes a lens for inner cartography, re-weighting both her past and the child’s loss. Causal chain holds—each touch re-activates memory, re-routes grief, culminates in the stitched constellation. Orientation is swift; canyon, moon, shale anchor by line 4. One scaffold loop (“She did not weep… She modified them.”) slightly dulls propulsion, but cost is legible on the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Canyon throat, juniper wind, and mercury moonlight are filtered through the engineer’s synaptic map—setting doubles as her own neural terrain, constraining how she can move or think. The broken mirror’s cold edge against ribs in the final paragraph charges the closing image. Spatial choreography is clean; no prop drift. Weather and scent evolve with her pulse, keeping atmosphere functional rather than decorative.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—excavate and re-wire abandoned dreams—tightens when the child’s abandonment memory collides with her own sterile-lab grief, foreclosing the option to remain detached. Escalation is accumulative: each entanglement increases density until the mirror births a new constellation, a visible price. No external antagonist needed; internal pressure suffices. Could use one earlier tangible loss (time, stamina) to push tactics, keeping it just under 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as alchemy of loss: modification without erasure. The submarine-turned-lens motif re-weights from relic to instrument, letting the ending refract “what if” back through prior grief. No moralizing—final smile and wet eyes carry the conceptual cost. Complexity lingers: resurrection is labor, not miracle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person hovers at a tight psychic distance, mirroring her helix mind: long, winding sentences for neural mapping; abrupt fragments (“She modified them.”) for surgical acts. Rhythm accelerates with pulse-aligned owl hoots, then exhales into pebble-laugh. No head-hop; diction stays within her techno-poetic lexicon. Distinctive, pressure-responsive, and taught early.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable; most sentences carry double duty—image plus concept. One paraphrase loop noted (“She did not reject… She modified.”) and one mixed metaphor (“constellation of salvaged hopes” beside “inner seas”) slightly blur the lens. Otherwise, cadence varies, verbs are strong, and no filter-verb clusters gum the climax. Clean copy, high information yield.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fusion of neural cartography with desert archaeology feels fresh; the toy periscope as memory prism is a specific, irreplicable hinge. Risky lyric accumulation pays off in the final mercury pool image. Could edge into 9+ with one more concrete technical detail to ground the “synaptic” premise, but the synthesis already reframes familiar grief-work as physical excavation.</comment>
