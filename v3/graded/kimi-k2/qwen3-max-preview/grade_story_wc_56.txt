<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority is rich, specific, and embodied (“temperature of forgotten time”); the seeker’s contradictory impulse—wait, not chase—drives every beat. The final renunciation (carrying peace, not proof) is earned by the locket’s inscription and costs him the chase-identity he arrived with. No second character on page, so relationship crucible N/A; micro-choices (kneel, watch, not reach) reveal hierarchy of values cleanly. Flaw persists: he’s still a solitary observer, but that stasis is the point and is priced on page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the locket + sundial reweight the premise—lies are shelter, not crime—with undeniable conceptual cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of stillness → glint → salvage → quiet reconfiguration. Orientation anchored by word 60; no teleporting props; causality intact. Cost is legible in final image (“twin relics of time’s dual nature”), foreclosing the legend-chase path.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Canal, reeds, bruised sky, and sundial-as-micro-setting constrain every move: moss-slick edge keeps him kneeling, water temperature times the salvage. Violet light fading is tracked to the angle of the dial, charging the final image. Sensory hierarchy favors touch and reflected light over visual catalog. Spatial choreography clean; no floating props.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understand lies, not catch them—tightens when the locket forces choice: expose or honor the scratched-out face. One meaningful deepening: realization that architecture shelters the liar, not the victim, narrows options and reweights cost. Agency is attention/renunciation rather than confrontation; price is the forfeiture of “proof” as victory. Pressure coherent under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete arc: salvage of a locket rewrites “lies = betrayal” into “lies = fragile shelter,” a conceptual repricing that lingers. No moralizing; final image of twin relics offers non-literal answer. Subtext lives in scratched face and inscription—silence as cathedral. Ambiguity stays purposeful: whose sorrow?—yet cost is felt.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to seeker’s perceptual filter: angles, temperature, slant of regret. Syntax lengthens in calm, compresses under glint (“He didn’t reach. He watched.”), mirroring pressure. No dialogue, so voice contamination N/A. Patterned elision (“serene upheaval”) is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentences do multiple jobs: “Architecture, after all, is structure with purpose” advances theme while summarizing insight. Metaphors (buttresses of silence, stained-glass distraction) stay coherent and brief. No loops or scaffold; no mixed vehicles. Rhythm modulates from long twilight clauses to clipped final walk, propelling exit.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Premise—legend seeker who wants understanding, not glory—flips adventure trope into quiet epistemological heist. Sundial-as-inclinometer rather than clock refreshes time motif. Locket with reverent scratch-out is specific, not stock. Risk: lyric stillness could sag into self-parody, yet here it crystallizes stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
