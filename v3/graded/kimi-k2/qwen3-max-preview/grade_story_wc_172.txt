<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s contradictory impulses—guilt vs empire—are dramatized in the salt-crusted kneel and the whispered mating call; the final release carries a palpable forfeiture of his usual control, earning the Earned Stasis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the salt flat’s glowing cracks reweight Elias’s entire legacy; the map’s dissolution in his pocket crystallizes the cost of irreversible loss. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern taught early and held.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The salt flat’s mineral crust, cracked map, and faintly glowing egg are tactile constraints that guide every micro-choice; the final image of cracks “remembering” charges the ending with irreplaceable specificity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Single dominant stake—atonement through echo—tightens when the map’s fissures converge; the release narrows options to irreversible offering, with visible cost in the dimming shell and dissolving parchment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of hollow grace emerges from the salt flat’s silence and the Skywren’s absent song; the final “echo was enough” reweights the premise without moralizing, leaving resonant ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias; perceptual signature is precise—salt crunching like “shattered glass,” thunder as lullaby—while diction modulates from corporate detachment to lyrical surrender.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language (“sky bruised purple,” “wind through crystal reeds”) is selective and pattern-taught, with zero loops or scaffold; final cadence breathes perfectly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: corporate eco-criminal performs sacrament with extinct egg on engineered salt flat; the drought-as-canvas and map-of-tears transform familiar eco-guilt into non-obvious ritual.</comment>
