<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Librarian’s moon-phase trait and interior contradiction (full-moon clarity vs new-moon doubt) are dramatized through micro-choices—lowering the creel, shelving it under “Waning Wonder.” The cost is soft (waning certainty) but felt; the arc is a credible renunciation of absolute truth rather than a change of heart.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the creel’s glyphs crystallize the librarian’s acceptance of flux, reconfiguring her stance with visible cost—she steps into “silver hush” knowing tomorrow is already gone. Accumulative/Textural lens holds; each beat layers density until the final image reweights the premise.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Atrium’s bioluminescent tide and lunar quartz spectacles constrain action—she times the creel’s baptism to the tide’s pulse. Micro-setting (marble plinth, eastern alcove shelves) tracks cleanly and charges the final image of “salt and starlight.” Specificity is selective and purposeful.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserve wonder amid routine—tightens when the librarian chooses to shelve the creel under “Waning Wonder,” accepting loss as preservation. One meaningful deepening; cost is conceptual (softened identity) but legible under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: wonder survives by molting, not stasis. Final image of the breathing creel offers non-literal resonance—wonder migrates rather than dies—without moralizing. Contradictions are embraced, not resolved.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; perceptual signature filters every detail through lunar-tuned attention (“lunar quartz,” “salt-slick floor”). Syntax modulates with moon-phase wax/wane; no head-hopping. Compression is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; figurative language serves pattern (“tide no ocean claimed”). No loops or scaffold. Sentence rhythm mirrors tidal ebb/flow. Minor risk of overwriting in one clause (“cathedral of salt and starlight”) but does not obscure closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: moon-phase librarian archiving migrating souls via bamboo creel baptism. Tropes (librarian, archive) are inverted—she preserves by letting go. Risky lyric structure pays off; closure feels inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
