<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied; the historian’s awe and oxygen debt are visceral. The statue’s “incisively kind” voice is a consistent, characterizing trait that drives the final choice. Micro-choice—pressing the ampoule against the fracture—earns the closure cost. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene for the statue itself, only stated, keeping it from 9+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the historian becomes “the thread now,” crystallizing the garden’s transformation. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each revelation layers density until the violet light reconfigures meaning. The cost is felt in the statue’s dissolution and the historian’s new burden. No causality breaks or orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The underwater garden is not backdrop; kelp, coral, and eels constrain movement and supply the final image. The statue’s chipped knee is a micro-setting that literally enables the decisive act. Sensory selection is urgent—phosphorescent orchids, rusted trellises—filtered through the historian’s awe. Environment charges the final image with undeniable cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: surface certainty vs. fluid truth. One tightening—shattering the ampoule—forces the historian to accept cascading revelations. Cost is visible: the statue dissolves, the historian’s career narrative collapses. Agency is hers; no coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</question>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: “Truth is not monolith. It is mosaic.” Subtext operates in the statue’s silence and the shifting glyphs. Final image—plankton whispering “Welcome to the nuance”—reweights the premise without moralizing. Complexity lingers; no tidy moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</question>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; “scalpel dipped in honey” epitomizes the statue’s telepathy. Syntax mirrors pressure: long, tide-like sentences slow, then fracture with the glass. No head-hopping; historian’s perception is biased toward wonder. Dialogue is telepathic, goal-driven, and subtextual.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</question>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every image advances theme or stakes. No loops or scaffold. Metaphors are coherent—“sugar in tea” dissolution. Rhythm accelerates with the light cascade. Clean grammar; no artifacts near closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</question>
<comment>Premise—living statue as archivist of ideological collapse—is fresh. Tropes (drowned city, telepathy) are transformed through specificity: coral-grown hearts, jellyfish lanterns. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risky lyric structure pays off with crystallized closure.</comment>
