<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The bell tuner’s interiority is sparse yet embodied—her patience is dramatized through metronomic footfalls and the fork’s weight in her palm. Motivation (“restore shared balance”) is stated early and fulfilled, but the absence of internal contradiction or felt personal cost keeps her just shy of 9.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the fork left in the fountain crystallizes the town’s new equilibrium. The accumulative/textural lens holds—each footstep tightens the pattern until the cobblestones hum on their own. Cost is visible in the tuner’s silent departure, her rhythm now absorbed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Environment, body, and tool merge: the archway fractures knit with dawn, the cobblestones become resonant instruments, and the fork’s final placement charges the image. Sensory detail is selective—moss-slick stones, rusted clock—always filtered through the tuner’s precise attention.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—rebalancing Virelle—escalates through each footfall’s micro-choices; the town’s silence answers back, tightening the loop. The final cost is the tuner’s erasure of her own presence, a felt forfeiture that forecloses return.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: memory as frequency, restoration as resonance rather than resurrection. The fork’s final stillness and the rain “from the air itself” reweight the premise without moralizing, leaving a charged afterimage.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet disciplined—syntax mirrors the tuner’s metronomic gait. Compression (“infinitely patient”) is taught early and paid off in the silent exit. No head-hopping; the town’s ghosts remain external, filtered through her perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive—each sentence layers action, image, and vibration. No loops or scaffold; metaphors (“vibration traveled up her arm like a root”) are precise and coherent. Final paragraph’s cadence mirrors the achieved harmony.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>The premise—tuning a ghost town into existence via footfall rhythm—feels inevitable yet wholly fresh. Risk lies in the abstract method, but the tactile execution grounds it. The fork’s passive final role subverts tool-as-weapon cliché.</comment>
