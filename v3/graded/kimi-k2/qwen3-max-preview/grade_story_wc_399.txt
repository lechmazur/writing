<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The walker’s interiority is textured and embodied (“warm stone floor,” “spent focus”), but her motives remain largely static; the consecration is performed rather than struggled. No internal contradiction or visible flaw complicates the act, so the “earned” quality feels mild. The mask’s asymmetry hints at duality yet never pressures a choice. Overall, a vivid consciousness without a crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final image of hovering clearings reconfigures the pavilion’s meaning with undeniable conceptual cost—the walker’s departure leaves the wisdom sealed and inaccessible to her. Causality is accumulative/textural; each clearing forms through sustained attention, not plot turns. Orientation is immediate; the lattice, dunes, and parapet are anchored by sentence 3. One transition (kneel → rise) suffices.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The pavilion’s petrified vines and buried parapet constrain every gesture; the warm stone and humming gears are not backdrop but active partners. Sensory selection is urgent—sage, ozone, sandstone hum—filtered through the walker’s attunement. The kinetic parapet literally answers her palm, charging the final image. Micro-setting (stone floor, vine-column shadow) guides stance and ritual posture.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve wisdom’s echo—is signaled early and tightened by each conjured clearing; the cost is the walker’s spent focus and ultimate renunciation of access. Pressure is steady but lacks a decisive reversal; the ritual succeeds as planned. Agency is present but not tested against opposition. The escalation is textural—more clearings, more resonance—rather than option-narrowing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through image: wisdom dwells in silence and periphery, not proclamation. The prophet’s earlier words return as a reweighted echo, now embodied in the invisible clearings. Subtext operates in gesture—the half-mask, the palm to stone—without moralizing. Final image crystallizes the cost: wisdom preserved is wisdom the walker herself can no longer hear.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric, compressed, and consistent; syntax lengthens and breathes with ritual tempo. Perceptual signature is distinct—selective attention to “sandstone and wind,” “dry sage and ozone.” No dialogue; no head-hopping. Patterned repetition (“clearings… clearings…”) is taught early and pays off in closure. Register never drifts; elevated diction feels native to the walker’s vocation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid; each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and conceptual work. Metaphors (“pulse like a half-asleep beast”) are precise and sustained. No loops, no scaffold, no mixed vehicles. Minor filter verbs (“she felt”) are voice-motivated and rare. Final cadence—“bare feet pressing into warm sand”—resolves rhythmically without slack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Fusion of kinetic archaeology and mystic preservation feels fresh; the buried parapet as co-ritualist is non-obvious. Tropes of desert prophet and masked wanderer are transformed through sensory specificity and mechanical sympathy. The conceit of “conjured clearings” as psychic hollows is inventive and integral. Risky lyric mode sustains coherence without gimmickry.</comment>
