<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—flunking calculus to watch her mother’s face, then redefining risk after her father’s collapse—are embodied and specific. The interiority is character-particular, avoiding therapy-speak. The final micro-choice of writing “Begin again” in green ink crystallizes her earned stance with visible cost. Only the father’s brief appearance lacks full crucible pressure, keeping it just below 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: “Begin again” reweights the entire quest, foreclosing the old rebellious stance. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each scrawl and lantern flicker tightens the pattern until the final image. The cost is felt in the pressed clover and the erased marker. Orientation is anchored early and never drifts.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The rainwashed library and the mica-pane lantern function as micro-settings that constrain choices: the lantern’s paradoxical glow literally determines what Elara can “see.” Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered. The subway scrawls act as extensions of setting, guiding her mental traverse. Only the financial-district seat feels briefly generic, preventing a 9.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—risk with purpose versus entropy—is signaled early and escalates through each decoded scrawl. Agency is exercised in the decision to leave her own chalk message, narrowing her anonymity and widening responsibility. The tightening is one sustained arc rather than multiple reversals, fitting the short scope. Cost is legible in the trembling chalk and the clover token.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from concrete action: rebellion without responsibility is just another losing bet. Subtext operates in the silent exchange of clover and erased marker. The final image of “Begin again” offers a non-literal answer—widening is not escape but iterative responsibility. A hairline slip toward thematic echo in “responsibility ≠ surrender” keeps it shy of 9.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The voice is distinct—probability jargon filtered through poetic compression (“P(failure)=0 if you redefine success”). Perceptual signature is consistent: Elara notices drainage grates and bench slats, not tourist landmarks. No head-hopping; even the father’s interior is inferred through gesture. Rhythm modulates under pressure, tightening during the scrawl sequences.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid: “shadows now curling gently, like invitations rather than warnings” recharges earlier menace. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative language is precise and pattern-taught. Minor register drift into “conceptual repricing” jargon is voice-motivated and paid off.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of probability theory, subway mysticism, and filial grief feels fresh and inevitable. The lantern’s mica pane and chalked equations transform familiar tropes into a private cosmology. Risk is redefined not as escape but as iterative responsibility—a non-obvious moral calculus. The clover token is a specific, verifiable detail that could not be swapped without loss.</comment>
