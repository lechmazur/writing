<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elira’s interiority is sensory and precise—ledger, fern-tip stylus, mossy delight—but her decisive pivot (from observer to tuner) leans on a soft beat: moonstone-thread hum rather than an action that visibly costs or reconfigures her path; the transformation reads more conferred than wrested.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot follows Accumulative/Textural Drive: descending leaves → dust-thread → living monuments → grandmother’s emergence. Closure lands with Repricing of grief into tangible harmony, yet the grandmother’s appearance delivers the change off-stage rather than via a climactic protagonist-driven beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The suspended canopy (cathedral of petrified roots, ashen sky) is never mere backdrop—its silences and ashen light physically frame Elira’s rituals and constrain her acoustic intimacy. Root-fiber, dew-glass, lichen ledger, and speck-laden shrines form a tactile micro-setting that the final reunion recharges.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Stakes crystallize early: decipher living memory while memory itself erodes. Tension tightens when each leaf-fall carries emotional charge, then again when the grandmother appears, reconfiguring the cost from personal loss to custodianship. Escalation coheres under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Memory-as-ecology is the emergent theme; it grows through the monuments, leaf glyphs, and dust-specks laced with scent and laughter. The final reunion avoids didacticism, leaving a thrum of communal elegy that reweights prior shrines without sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Third-limited prose glides on Elira’s perceptual quirks—mossy delight, root-fiber textures, lunar taste. Long lyrical syntax mirrors swaying canopy rhythm; compression when “thread of silver light stitched” snaps the pacing. Voice persists through the grandmother’s “wind through hollow reeds” without leakage or head-hop.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Few scaffolds, high density: “mossy delight,” “cathedral of petrified roots,” “thread of silver light.” Occasional nominalization (“communion”) is earned. Final paragraph could shed one synonym of “tiny” to heighten beat, but no figurative snag blunts the closing resonance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Seed-to-memory loom is fresh: regional folklore turned into kinetic liturgy. Moonstone speck seeded as dust reappears as luminous thread; transformation feels inevitable in hindsight, underwritten by micro-choices rather than late-world rule changes.</comment>
