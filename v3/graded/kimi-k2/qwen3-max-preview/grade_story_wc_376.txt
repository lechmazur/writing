<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority remains tactile and embodied (“color returned to her cheeks”). Yet she never faces a hard contradiction between her collector drive and the price of witnessing: her “curse” evaporates the moment she reads, so the final stance feels lightly purchased rather than cost-full.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure arrives as a resonant reconfiguration when she vows to “become the archive.” Causality is clean: the map leads to letters → reading restores her → she chooses guardianship. The cost is emotional, explicitly on the page, though external stakes remain abstract.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Greenhouse humidity, glass canopy bruise, orchids under UV: each detail is filtered through the calligrapher’s sensorium and guides navigation (“misted by leaking pipes”). The zinc plate’s hum offers micro-setting propulsion. Spatial logic holds.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“to find where lost conversations go”—is signaled early. Mid-story discoveries of unsent letters tighten the pressure and redefine success from ‘find’ to ‘bear witness.’ The final choice forecloses no external threat; risk is internal-existential, which fits the lens yet softens cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The piece argues that small truths are an aquifer worth preserving; this emerges through concrete acts (reading each origami letter aloud) rather than statement. Final image transforms the original search into an ethical duty—“the oasis would refill… with truth” without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric close narration sustains a distinct perceptual signature—calligrapher’s emotional syntax, synesthetic metaphors—without head-hopping. Compression is purposeful; patterned description pulses rather than clutters.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Syntax dances without overcrowding; every clause advances image or emotion (“murmurs long silenced”). Figurative density tightens in climax beats (letters “folded origami-style into birds, fish, and falling leaves”). Occasional abstract clusters (“environmental details mirror internal states”) are small scuffs, not closure-touching.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The conceit of calligraphy as emotional forensics—ink as memory aquifer—feels inevitable rather than gimmicky. Specificity of “emotional syntax,” ligatures of longing, keeps the premise anchored. No overt genre templates recycled.</comment>
