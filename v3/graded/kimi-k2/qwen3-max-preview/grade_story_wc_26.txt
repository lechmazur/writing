<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elira’s vigil is vivid and embodied; the river stone anchors her tactile memory. Interior contradiction—hope vs. archival detachment—surfaces in micro-choices (embedding the stone). The final renunciation (watching, not halting change) carries cost, though the moment of decision is compressed into one lyrical beat rather than dramatized under rising pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the stone’s pulse reweights the dream-feed, making loss tactile again. Accumulative lens holds—pattern of archival erasure → stone intervention → subtle restoration—each beat thickens texture rather than forcing causal turns. Cost is legible in the final image (“dreams flickered—subtly”). Orientation is taught early via sensory anchors; no ambiguity at exit.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Library-above-clouds is sketched with selective sensory strokes (petal-chandeliers, velvet moss) that filter through Elira’s dusk-attuned gaze. The river stone functions as micro-setting: its weight constrains her final action and charges the closing ripple. Spatial logic stays consistent; no white-room syndrome. One 9+ gate met: recurring object (stone) alters tactics and final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving felt fear within sanitized hope—is signaled in paragraph 2. Escalation is textural: each compared dream-layer thickens the stakes until the silver-thread discovery reweights options. No external antagonist; pressure is archival inertia. Cost is visible in the stone’s implant and the returned bite of wind/lavender—options narrowed for the collective.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges inductively from image pattern: shadow → silver thread → hearth-smoke, tracing hope’s adaptive survival. No explicit thesis; final smile carries ambivalent triumph. Subtext operates through object-transfers (stone into data-core) that reprice the premise. Luminous regret saturates imagery without sermonizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person intimate sustains consistent perceptual signature: “sharp-eyed dusk noticer” filters every detail through crepuscular attention. Syntax lengthens and softens to match twilight mood; no head-hopping. No dialogue, so voice carries all nuance. One 9+ gate met: rhythmic control under pressure (final paragraph cadence mirrors dying light).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet breathable; figurative layering serves accumulative design. No loops or scaffold; each sentence adds texture or knowledge. Mixed metaphors avoided—“petal-chandeliers drifted on thermals” stays physically coherent. One hairline slip: “luminous regret that clung to every archived sigh” edges toward abstraction, but context grounds it.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise remixes familiar memes (shared dreams, cloud archives) but angles them through the dusk noticer’s archival poaching and the stone’s counter-weight, producing fresh conceptual friction. Shadow-as-adaptive-hope trope is re-embodied in silver hair and hearth-smoke, avoiding cliché. Risk in lyric accumulative structure pays off with legible closure. Transformation test: story collapses without stone + shadow synergy.</comment>
