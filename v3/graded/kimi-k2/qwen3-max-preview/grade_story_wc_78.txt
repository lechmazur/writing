<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prophet’s motive—turn obstacles into instruments—drives every beat, but interiority stays broad; Kael’s awe is sketched more than embodied. The final transfer of the mallet crystallizes a credible micro-shift in status and responsibility, yet Prophet’s exhaustion is stated rather than felt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the orchard’s harmonic rain reweights the world’s rule-set with visible cost (the sea’s obsidian density, Prophet’s spent stance). Causality holds under Accumulative/Textural lens; each sonic modulation layers pressure until the final release.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Driftwood orchard and liquid xylophone are vivid, selective, and directly constrain tactics—roots become keys, waves become bars. The setting’s salt-apple resonance charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Dominant stake—will the Prophet transmute the tide of sound—tightens via escalating sonic stakes; each note raises cost until the orchard’s fruit bursts. Agency is continuous; no coincidence resolves the crisis.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Theme of transmuting ruin into music emerges through concrete sonic alchemy rather than statement. Final harmonic rain offers a non-literal answer: survival re-tuned into generative art, with lingering cost felt in the Prophet’s exhaustion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Lush, rhythmic prose mirrors the Prophet’s synesthetic perception; perceptual signature is distinct and sustained. No head-hopping; compression and elision are pattern-taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</question>
<comment>Sentences vary in cadence, propel momentum, and carry high information density. Metaphors are coherent and purposeful; no loops or scaffold artifacts mar the climax.</comment>

<grade>9.2</question>
<comment>Sonic cartography of weather and sea feels fresh, inevitable, and deeply integrated. Risk-taking in fractal cloud-music synthesis heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; transformation test passes.</comment>
