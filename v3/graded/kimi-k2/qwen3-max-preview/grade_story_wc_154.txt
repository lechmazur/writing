<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s contradictory impulses—translator’s precision vs. anesthetic drift—are embodied in the coral’s pulse and the act of pressing it to the cast. The micro-choice to whisper “You’re not forgotten” crystallizes her value hierarchy and forecloses escape; the cost is the ache she now must carry. Interiority stays concrete, never lapsing into therapy-speak. Only the “lotus-hearted ache” label nicks perfection.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the frantic charcoal lines unknot into a shared silhouette, reweighting memory from wound to witness. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each sensory layer deepens until the final exhale. Cost is legible in the cooled coral and the lingering ache. Orientation is immediate; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The mist-clad atrium, glass ceiling, and salt air are not postcard filler; the condensation refracts twilight into “liquid gold” that guides Mira’s slowed gaze to the cast. The coral fragment itself becomes micro-setting, constraining her final gesture. Spatial choreography is clean—no impossible moves. Environment subtly mirrors internal dissolve without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—graft new meaning onto old wounds—tightens as the smudged cast forces decryption under drug-weighted limbs. One meaningful deepening: frantic spirals soften into collaborative curves, narrowing options from escape to witness. Cost is the irreversible ache she now bears. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; no external coincidence resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the coral’s shift from relic to resonance: peace is not signed but witnessed. Subtext lives in the child’s half-buried words and the silence after Mira’s whisper. Final image reweights prior material without moralizing—“the coral still sings” is felt, not stated. Complexity lingers: the wound remains, but its meaning is re-breathed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded in Mira’s translator’s ear—“ceasefire whispers,” “coded grief.” Syntax lengthens under anesthetic haze, then tightens at the whisper. No head-hopping; focalization stays locked. Only the phrase “lotus-hearted ache” drifts toward poetic cliché.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive: “memory and metaphor bled together like ink on wet paper” does double duty. Rhythm modulates with drug weight—long sentences slow, then snap at the whisper. No loops or scaffold; each image advances. Occasional elevated diction (“symbiosis”) is earned by context.</comment>

<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The coral-as-memory-relic is a familiar trope, yet its calcified hope and child-linked decryption feel specific to this voice. The anesthetic liminal atrium freshens the PTSD revisit. Risk lies in lyric compression, not gimmickry. Transformation test passes: swap coral and the story’s emotional calculus collapses.</comment>
