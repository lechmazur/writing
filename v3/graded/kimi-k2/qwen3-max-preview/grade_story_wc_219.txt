<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied (“boots sinking slightly into mossy earth,” “scent of petrichor thick”), but the decisive shift from data-seeker to participant is slightly under-dramatized—more stated than enacted in the final beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the amber left behind crystallizes the reconfiguration of her stance with felt cost. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; the density of footprints, rain, and tower silence tightens toward the final image without causal reversals.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Rain-slick tower, mossy prints, and bronze quiet are vivid and selective; the tower’s stones and lichen subtly constrain her ascent and final stillness, charging the closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“understand the chemistry of homecoming”—is signaled early and tightens through sensory density rather than external opposition; the cost is the surrender of empirical certainty, legible in her leaving the amber.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: knowledge as pilgrimage, truth as emergent convergence. The amber’s fossilized flight reweights the premise without moralizing, achieving quiet resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with a scientist’s perceptual signature—“spectrometer calibrations,” “molecular weight”—and rhythmic control that modulates from skepticism to hushed acceptance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, propulsive, and free of loops; figurative language is purposeful (“bronze quiet sentinel,” “grammar of solitude”) and never muddles causality or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost transmission, chemical metaphor, and anti-institutional pilgrimage; the amber-as-coordinate feels inevitable yet non-obvious, avoiding genre clichés.</comment>
