<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The interior voice is vivid and particular, and Elara’s micro-choices under pressure are concrete. Slight over-articulation of motives (lines like “her belief was not academic, but sacred”) slips toward label-speak. Earned stasis is visible as she chooses to absorb the moment rather than confront fireworks—cost felt in body stillness and warm clasp.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure takes the form of a Resonant Reconfiguration: the diary’s internal map of silences is recovered and accepted, leaving Elara re-weighted. Because/therefore links accumulate—each frequency adjustment tightens options until the clasp yields. Persistent constraint: the ever-louder fireworks drive her to stillness; the cost is her inability to protect tomorrow but acceptance that the night’s harvest is enough. Closure image (empty clasp still warm with surrendered frequencies) legibly lands the cost on the page and reconfigures meaning without exposition.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The shadowed workshop, cobwebbed rafters, and sensory toolkit constrain movement and force acoustic choices. Meteorite iron clasp evolves across the beats—shivering, fracturing, surrendering—charging the final image. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from tuning coil to clasp without drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of protecting authentic silences intensifies as the external firework countdown shrinks time; each frequency test tightens the noose around failure. Final cost is endured: silence is archived yet future access remains perilous under advancing noise. No escalation slippage; the tightening feels causal and necessary.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete act rather than assertion: the cataloguing of silences embodies the core question of empathy. Final image reframes prior material—“she had recovered what mattered”—without sermon. Thematic echo only in the final paragraph is minimal (<0.4) because it reframes prior particulars with embodied cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is consistent, lyrical yet concrete; sensory attention to “hues, weights, and whispered geometries” reads as idiosyncratic perceptual signature. Occasional elevated diction (“surrendered frequencies”) skates close to register lift but stays within believable character lexicon. No POV drift or compression errors.</comment>

<comment>Prose sings with sentence-level propulsion, strong verbs, and minimal repetition. Density is high without overwriting. One near-repeat phrase “tune her own breath to match” at peak could be trimmed but does not stall momentum or blur closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Premise of frequency-tuning to extract silence offers an elegant, non-showy synthesis of speculative craft with emotional stakes. Workshop tools, meteorite clasp, and labeled vials feel organically conceived rather than tacked novelty. Freshness is sustained through concrete specificity rather than ornament.</comment>
