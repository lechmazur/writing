<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority is lucid, embodied, and character-specific (“he had to glance sideways, let intuition stitch together what logic refused to name”). The culminating micro-choice—seal the resin slab and walk away—earns Earned Stasis with clear emotional cost: he exits alone, wonder stored but not shared, a monkish renunciation palpable on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the decisive reconfiguration—“he sealed the last resin slab… left without looking back”—crystallizes the stake; wonder is now archived, the path to public glory irreversibly forsworn. The Accumulative/Textural lens (slow pattern of resonance capture) is taught early and held through the charged final image with felt cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The marble cavern with its quartz veins constrains every mirror placement; light angles physically alter his tactics. The resin slabs’ shelf-life and tone “humming at the ear” provide micro-setting stakes. Final image—the sealed archive below an empty tower—recurs as setting-borne closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</question>
<comment>Single dominant stake—preserve wonder—tightened by the incremental harvesting of tones; the cracked bell tone at dusk intensifies pressure. No coincidence resolves; instead the escalating purity of tones forces the decisive act of sealing and renouncing audience.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</question>
<comment>Thematic question—how to store wonder when the world deafens—emerges through prism geometry and final act of renunciation. No explicit moral; the recharged image of silent archive and humming shards supplies a resonant, non-verbal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</question>
<comment>Lyrical third-person close adheres to the reflective locksmith’s perceptual signature—“peripheral gaze,” “light pooled like spilled ink.” Syntax modulates with breath; no head-hopping; diction remains within plausibly artisanal lexicon until the closing quiet hush.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</question>
<comment>Dense metaphors (“stone seemed to remember”) land cleanly without overwriting; no redundancies; each clause advances stance or atmosphere. Tiny artifact: occasional ornate diction (“harvest of echoes”) but too sparse to mar propulsion or closure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</question>
<comment>Transforms the trope of “archiving memory” into artisanal acoustical alchemy performed with prisms and resin; the image of wonder stocked “not with bread but with glimmers” feels singular. Conceptual integrity held from first glyph to final shard hum.</comment>
