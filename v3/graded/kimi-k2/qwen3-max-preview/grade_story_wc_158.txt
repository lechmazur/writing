<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied (“centuries of longing had carved her bones hollow”), motives stay consistent, and the final renunciation—continuing to sing despite never sleeping—carries visible cost. The shy/unstoppable contradiction is dramatized through her refusal of pilgrims and the postcard’s new line. No headcount issues; single POV is clean.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the postcard’s fresh imperative crystallizes her stance and reconfigures her mission without a physical act. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each stanza calcifies into the shell, density tightens, and the final psalm reweights prior lullabies. Orientation is swift; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Shell, postcard, and bioluminescent canopy are vivid, selective, and constrain choice (she sings into the wind because the shell’s throat channels it). Micro-setting (postcard against sternum) charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy reflects her insomnia-sharpened attention.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transmute war-born pain into beauty—tightens when the postcard commands “They’re listening.” Agency is continuous endurance; cost is perpetual sleeplessness. One meaningful deepening suffices under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of transmuting suffering into beauty emerges organically from ceasefire orchids, fossilized verses, and reef-shadow joy. Final psalm offers non-literal answer: galaxies learning to blush. No moralizing; resonance lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</question><comment>Distinct lyric texture sustained—spiraled syntax, tidal cadence, calcium metaphors—without drift. POV distance stable; no head-hopping. Compression taught early (“time didn’t tick—it spiraled”) and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is pattern-taught and purposeful. No loops or scaffold. Rhythm modulates with scene needs; final paragraph breathes. Minor elevated diction (“psalm of roots and rupture”) fits voice.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>Fresh synthesis: insomnia as photosynthetic engine, ceasefire rooted in orchids, shell as living archive. Risky lyric accumulation succeeds; premise feels inevitable in hindsight. No derivative echoes.</comment>
