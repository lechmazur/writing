<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Gondola operator’s interior logic is vivid: “to teach silence how to comfort” drives every micro-tilt of the gondola and calibrated exhale. He earns the passenger’s release through embodied empathy without speech. Flaw: motivation is stated twice, once as label, once as dramatized cost. Still, his renunciation of words in favor of vibration is credible and paid for.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Single-scene drift under Accumulative/Textural lens: silence deepens from grey fog to silver eddies to clear glass—earned tonal arc. Closure as Charged Poise reconfigures the gondola into vessel rather than void, cost paid in unsent farewell. Storm glass beat is the tightening, not dialogue or event. Only a whiff of outline pacing (“then gondola slowed”) prevents ceiling.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prism terrace, chime-grove, upward waterfall render micro-setting into pressure: crystal floor hums beneath passenger, grove roots transmit subsonic lullaby. Setting literally transmits feeling up the spine, thus constrains outcome. Orienting cues anchor inside first 100 words; no drift. One fresh inflection lifts score: inverted waterfall catching light.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake is passenger’s internal static; silence escalates from fog to clear as glass fluid recalibrates. Meaningful tightening delivered through sensorial deepening, not causal turns. Cost legible in tear and unspoken letter—no tidy resolution. Could cap higher if operator faced an irreversible choice.</comment>

<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges quietly: sanctuary is not absence but conductive presence. Storm glass, terrace geometry, and silence fuse without sermonizing. Final smile reconfigures meaning without stating thesis. Subtext carries in storm-glass glow “golden, complete.”</comment>

<comment>Third-person intimate drifts close but never head-hops; perceptual signature precise: “vial’s liquid coiled and uncoiled in slow spirals.” Syntax mirrors languid glide. Dialogue absent feels intentional rather than omission. One minor register hiccup: “conceptual cost” momentarily nudges reader meta.</comment>

<comment>Ear test passes: syntactic cadence lifts and subsides with emotional tide. No looped phrasing, no scaffold. Over-descriptive drift in violet/indigo shards briefly clutters, but immediately pared. Final line lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Risky fusion of meditative sci-fi and quiet psychological release feels organic, not gimmick. Prism terraces, upside-down waterfall, and storm glass cohere under single metaphor: interior barometric pressure. Fresh without being unrecognizable. One prior echo: “gondola operator” trope in speculative fiction exists; enough specificity saves it.</comment>
