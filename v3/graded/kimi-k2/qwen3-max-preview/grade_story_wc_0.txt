<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elira’s interiority is precise and embodied—her refusal of gloves, her skin learning air currents—but the final renunciation (“I found them here, in the dust”) is more asserted than dramatized, softening the felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens is taught early and held; the logarithmic-spiral payoff reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost. One transition (greenhouse → published papers) is legible, closure lands clean.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Storm-damaged greenhouse is tactile and constraining—broken panes, leaning beams, humidity gradients—directly shaping where dust settles and how Elira moves. Micro-setting (slide, laser) functions as charged object.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—seeing decay as refinement—tightens through each dust layer; the spiral formation forces a crystallized stance. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral, but legible.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of gradual change emerges from fractal dust patterns and neutron-star echoes; final image of “living aurora” reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext of humility is earned through observation, not statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is scientist-poet, precise yet lyrical (“preprocesses reality,” “cosmic symmetry”). Compression and elision are consistent; perceptual signature is distinct and sustained.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language disciplined to pattern (“dust wasn’t inert; it preprocesses reality”). No loops or scaffold; final image crystallizes without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fusion of astrophysics and butterfly-wing nanostructure feels inevitable; risk in turning greenhouse into observatory pays off. Specificity of Madagascan Morpho imperialis dust anchors universality.</comment>
