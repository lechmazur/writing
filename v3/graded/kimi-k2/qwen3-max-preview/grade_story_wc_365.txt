<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elira’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the contradiction between her hunger for truth and the cost of erasure is dramatized in the final beat. The moment she weeps for “unbearable lightness” crystallizes a credible renunciation. Minor slip: the phrase “cyclically spontaneous failure” edges toward diagnostic label-speak, blunting immediacy.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Elira’s knowledge reweights her identity and forecloses reunion with her mother. The green shard’s cooling confirms the cost on the page. Causal linkage holds under Accumulative/Textural lens; each sensory beat thickens resonance until the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The repair bay’s rusted console and residual warmth after transition constrain her movement and anchor the veil-crossing. The shard’s pulse and temperature act as micro-setting tools that charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—retrieve the withheld truth—tightens when the shard flares in Sigma-7. The crystalline data core confrontation forces a single irreversible choice: accept erasure for knowledge. Cost is visible in her ghost-status and final tears.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through the green shard’s journey: truth’s weight is responsibility, not liberation. The mother’s sacrifice reframes prior images without moralizing. Final line’s “woven into her bones” offers non-literal resonance that reweights the premise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; perceptual signature filters every detail through Elira’s synesthetic lens. Compression (“viscous, like stepping through syrup made of memory”) teaches the pattern early and pays off at transition. No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates with pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; each sentence layers sensory data without redundancy. Metaphors are coherent and grounded (“dust motes drift…ghosts of engines”). No loops or scaffold; rhythm accelerates into the veil-crossing and exhales at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The sensory-map-maker premise, shard-as-compass, and mother-across-realities synthesis feel inevitable yet fresh. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specificity of “Sigma-7” and residual warmth anchors universality.</comment>
