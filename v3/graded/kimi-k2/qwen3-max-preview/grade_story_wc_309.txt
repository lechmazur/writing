<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lior’s refusal to automate magic and his tactile bond with the keystone are vivid and embodied; the interior contradiction between failure and wonder is dramatized in the mist-walk beat. The final renunciation—abandoning grandeur for small imperfect charms—earns its cost through prior beats. Minor slip: the “folded light” figure speaks in gentle exposition rather than pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration: Lior’s choice to leave the keystone and embrace small magic reweights the premise with felt cost. Causal chain from unstrapping satchel → mist path → tree → renunciation holds under Accumulative/Textural lens. One transition (spire → cloud hollow) is legible and taught by mist-curl imagery.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>The icebound spire’s frost and ghost-light constrain mood and action; the keystone’s warmth and the apple tree’s dawn-glow charge the final image. Selective sensory triangulation (ozone, thaw, crystal-chime voice) keeps density high. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from balcony to cloud hollow.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—whether magic must be grand or can remain intimate—tightens when mist forces surrender of direction and keystone demands release. One meaningful deepening: tree’s memory-doors crystallize the cost of clinging to old ambition. Agency drives every turn; no coincidence resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: automation vs. wonder refracted through Lior’s imperfect charms. Final image of glowing windowsill flowers offers non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext of “remembered magic” threads through keystone pulse and mist whispers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly anchored to Lior’s perceptual signature—frost tastes like regret, keystone hum matches heartbeat. Syntax modulates with pressure: longer clauses for awe, fragments at the step onto mist. No head-hopping; dialogue minimal and voice-apt.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet lyrical; each sentence advances image or choice. No loops or scaffold. Metaphors (frost as memory, dawn captured in fruit) stay coherent. One near-slip: “brilliant dimness” risks oxymoron cliché but is earned by context.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Familiar “failed mage finds true magic” arc is transformed through automation critique and tactile keystone lore. Mist-walking revival feels fresh because grounded in Lior’s bodily surrender. Specificity of off-key lullaby saving a village rescues trope from generic.</comment>
