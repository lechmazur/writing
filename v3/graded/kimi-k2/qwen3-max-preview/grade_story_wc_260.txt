<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction (to walk or to stay) is palpable in every micro-choice and in her hands reconstructing the tail; the final stance crystallises with a visible cost in her resignation and testimony plan. One small waver: the shift from ‘self-respect vs compassion’ to ‘vigilance over naïveté’ reads slightly epiphanic rather than earned in immediate scene moment and pulls back from 9.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: revelation → tail fragment → quiet ritual → decisive resignation/testimony plan, each beat thickening the ethical weight until closure reconfigures the future. Cost is legible in ‘her resignation—but also a detailed care-plan’—a foretold forfeiture of safety for accountability.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Mist, lantern-glow, moss, resin and quartz powders ground into pigments all filter through Elara’s professional eye and constrain her next actions (limited light, scarcity of proper studio). Environment is not mere postcard; it both shelters and exposes her to the coming dawn decision.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“preserve dignity by leaving vs nurse the animals and risk complicity”—intensifies steadily: each stroke of resin narrows the external option of escape until the renunciation/testimony plan forecloses retreat. Stakes would edge higher with one on-page snapshot of caged animals in peril; as stands, tension remains interior yet credible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The shedding/regeneration metaphor emerges from lived particulars (tail fragment, resin layers) rather than sermon, ending with a charged pause on the glass-cased relic as non-literal answer: “even broken things… could guide you home.” Mild didactic nudge in ‘reconstruction, not redemption’ keeps just under 9+ purity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person limited stays within Elara’s ken; perceptual signature is tactile and pigment-minded. One register slip—“layer by layer, truth by truth”—tempts toward thematic summary but cadence remains controlled. Overall voice coherence is high with subtle rhythmic breathing aligned to the slow ritual.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Sentence music is mostly precise; occasional stacked modifiers (“keratin-curled metaphor,” “mist-curled breath”) teeter close to overwriting. One minor loop in “dawn feedings… frightened eyes calming under her touch, of hatchlings trusting her palm” costs clarity without disrupting closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</question>
<comment>Tail-rebuilding as intimate ethical pivot is fresh and grounded. The fraud-sanctuary plot itself is familiar; the innovation lies in letting restoration miniaturise the whole moral recalibration. Risk in quiet lyricism pays off without gimmickry, but slight generic premise keeps it just below the 8.5 gate.</comment>
