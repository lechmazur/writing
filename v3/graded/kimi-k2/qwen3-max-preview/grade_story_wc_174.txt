<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied; the calligrapher’s shift from aesthetic evasion to accountability is dramatized through the puppet-self and candle-lit rehearsal. Motive intensifies cleanly from past guilt to present resolve, culminating in the earned serenity that costs him his former detachment. Minor slip: Mira remains off-page, so relationship crucible is only implied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise crystallized in the puppet-self confession “I reverse not to undo, but to reveal.” Causal lens holds: every beat flows from prior guilt → argument → exile → rehearsal → earned intent. Cost is legible in the ink-stained gloves and shattered-mirror eyes. No orientation drift; radar dome anchors by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Radar dome’s Cold War ribs and rain-drum Morse code constrain the hush and amplify the candle’s single flame; the skeletal girders literally become grasping fingers in the final image. Sensory hierarchy is POV-filtered and purposeful. Object-as-setting (story stick) doubles as compass and moral gauge, charging closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—ethical accountability in storytelling—tightens through each puppet-show anecdote and peaks when the calligrapher rehearses his own blood-and-honey confession. One decisive deepening: realization that illumination, not erasure, is the cost. Agency is active; no coincidence resolves tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the calligrapher’s arc: ethical storytelling as illumination of who lights the match. Subtext saturates gesture—the sweeping of broken glass with a calligraphy brush—without sermon. Final image reframes prior elegant ink as blood and honey, reweighting the premise with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is urbane yet haunted, syntax mirroring the calligrapher’s controlled strokes and sudden tremors. Distinct perceptual signature—“velvet fog,” “meteor hush”—remains consistent under pressure. No head-hopping; compression and lyric elision are taught early and paid off in the final whispered line.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and propulsive; every sentence layers image, theme, and pressure. Figurative language is disciplined—no mixed metaphors or loops. High information density without scaffolding; candle, stick, and puppet states track cleanly. Final cadence slows to crystallize the earned stasis.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise fuses calligraphy, Cold War ruins, and sock-puppet subversion into a fresh moral inquiry. Risky structure—lyric reflection braided with anecdote—heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Transformation test: story collapses if any element is swapped. Specificity of “button-eyed bureaucrats” and “ink-stained gloves” anchors universals.</comment>
