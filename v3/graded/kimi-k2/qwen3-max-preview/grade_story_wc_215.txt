<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The recluse’s motive—preserve the weight of the unsaid—remains steady; every micro-gesture (cradling the box, bowing to the beekeeper) embodies it. No contradiction drives new stakes, so the portrait is rich but static; the final beat offers gratitude, not a change that costs her anything visible. Still, the interiority is specific and embodied, sustaining a high-band read.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: density of ghost-images and box-hum deepen the covenant rather than force causal turns. Closure lands as Charged Poise—her bow accepts eternal guardianship with the cost of never speaking—felt and legible. Orientation anchors within 120 words; no breaks. One slip: no micro-choice tightens after midpoint; pressure plateaus, capping below 8.8.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Desert ruin, sun-bleached hives, pollen dust, stained-glass light—each filtered through her beekeeper-tinged perception. The box and collapsed apiary double as micro-setting that constrains every gesture; spatial choreography is immaculate. Storm-beat texture in final third recharges opening ash-dune image. Meets 9+ gate: box-light glyphs charge the closing image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—safeguard the unsaid—signaled early; pressure escalates via accumulating apparitions and storm grit that threaten the box. No second option ever emerges, so tightening is tonal, not tactical; cost is implicit in lifelong vigil but not freshly dramatized on-page. Sufficient for short-form accumulative design, yet lacks a late beat that forecloses a live alternative.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme—silence as archive—emerges through gesture, glass-reflected glyphs, and the refusal to speak ghosts’ stories. Final honey-gold projections wordlessly reweight every prior shimmer; no moralizing. Complexity survives: reader questions whether preservation equals prison. Resonance lingers in the body, not the intellect alone.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to her sensorium; perceptual signature is insectile—dust-brushed feet, vibration-reading fingertips. Rhythm swells then thins like wind through hive cracks, taught early and held. No head-hop; diction never exceeds recluse diction. Compressed syntax under storm pressure pays off in final cadence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sentence variety and information density high; figurative layer sustained without muddle. Occasional double adjective (“fractured light...honey-gold glyphs”) edges purple but pattern-teaches the chromatic motif, so forgiven. No loops, scaffolds, or register drift. Minor over-metaphor in “archivist preserving fragile scrolls” line, not in closure zone.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Post-apocalyptic bee-ruin + visible regret-ghosts + unopened glass reliquary feels fresh, not recycled eco-mourning. Conceptual risk—no dialogue, no plot twist—commits fully and lands. Could swap desert for blight-city, so not utterly singular; nonetheless specific detail (pollen sifting specter, charcoal child drawing) personalizes the template.</comment>
