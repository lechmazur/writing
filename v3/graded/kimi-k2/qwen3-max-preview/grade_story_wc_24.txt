<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is precise and embodied; the shepherd’s refusal to accept standard time is dramatized through tactile key-turning and backward counting. Contradictory impulses—reverence vs. rebellion—coexist in the same beats. Final renunciation (leaving pistons dormant) carries visible cost: tomorrow he must repeat the ritual alone. Only minor slip: “eminently peculiar” is asserted rather than proven by action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the harmonic hum suspends time, reconfiguring the premise that surrender is inevitable. Causal chain—whistle → seven breaths → backward count → key reversal—holds without gaps. Orientation anchored by fjord, frost, brass dials within 120 words. Cost is legible in the final image: “suspended seconds” thick enough to taste.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Horizon station’s brass pistons and sea-facing lenses constrain every move; the key’s silver warmth against the chest charges the final image. Micro-setting (key, console, frost-laced gravel) functions as geography. Sensory hierarchy—hiss of hydraulics, cracked ice echo—mirrors internal stakes. No spatial drift; bodies and objects track cleanly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reclaiming surrendered time—tightens through each backward count. One meaningful escalation: 327… pistons slow, dials falter, stakes shift from measurement to reversal. Agency remains protagonist-driven; coincidence absent. Cost crystallizes in the held breath of the fjord.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</question><comment>Theme emerges organically: time as absence, not flow. Subtext in the inscription “Wound against the fall” reframes the ritual as resistance. Final image—temporal horizon—reweights earlier light-duration revelation without moralizing. Complexity preserved: locals’ “mad” verdict lingers, unrefuted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise: “steam like a sleeping beast exhaling,” “razor edges between what was and what might yet be.” Perceptual signature—counting backwards as peeling causality—remains consistent. No head-hopping; single POV stable. Rhythm modulates with pressure: longer sentences for reverence, fragments at 299… when time holds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; every sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Figurative language is selective: “hydraulic arms stilled” compresses motion and emotion. Minor over-description (“granite cliffs,” “basalt promontory”) does not stall momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise—shepherd of seconds—feels inevitable yet fresh. Key-wound reversal of causality synthesizes mechanics and mysticism without gimmickry. Specificity of fjord, brass, frost-laced gravel anchors universals. Risky backward-count conceit pays off in final suspended breath.</comment>
