<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elias’s compulsive precision and quiet guilt are embodied in every tactile detail; the contradictory impulses—perfection vs. surrender—collide in the pendulum pause, producing a credible renunciation that costs him his lifelong identity as winder. Interiority is specific, never diagnostic, and the final barefoot stance on the ridge externalizes the earned change.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias’s refusal to wind re-weights the entire premise—time is no longer a burden to master but a gift to witness. The rake-handle inscription triggers the decisive change; causality holds, cost is felt in the lighter heart and abandoned vocation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The tidal obsidian ridge, brass pendulum housing, and salt-wind are not backdrop but instruments: the ridge’s slick surface and the pendulum’s frozen arc physically constrain Elias’s choice. Micro-setting (the rake handle’s micro-script) charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restoring communal balance vs. personal absolution—tightens once: the storm-fractured rake forces Elias to choose between mechanical certainty and human grace. Agency is clear; the cost is the surrender of his 43-year identity, legible on the page.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges organically: incremental absolution is not perfection but permission to pause. The rake’s hidden inscription and the pendulum’s resumed swing reweight the concept without moralizing, leaving resonant ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, salted with maritime diction and clockwork specificity; perceptual signature is consistent (“salt-wind howling like a dirge for drowned hours”). No head-hopping; compression and patterned elision are taught early and paid off in the final barefoot image.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and propulsive; figurative language is disciplined, never muddled. Minor scaffold—three near-repetitions of “pendulum” within ten lines—dulls momentum slightly but does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The clock-winder who finds absolution by not winding is a fresh synthesis; the rake-handle micro-script as delayed message device is specific and inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
