<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The painter’s insomnia and compulsion to “thresh meaning” are embodied in every brushstroke and sleepless night; her contradictory impulses—clinging to the brooch yet apologizing to it—play out in scene. The final renunciation (sleep at last) is earned by prior causal chain and carries visible cost. Interiority is concrete, never clinical. Minor: the “wryly earnest” shield is asserted more than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the exchange at the tide line reconfigures meaning and stakes while the cost (loss of the brooch, the journal, the sleepless vigil) is felt. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—each artifact intensifies the pattern until the final cadence shift. Causality holds; no teleporting props. Rain-trail mechanics are taught early and pay off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The tidal island is no postcard: salt-crusted floorboards, skeletal pines, stone well defying salinity—all constrain movement and mood. The brooch itself becomes micro-setting, glowing on her smock like a third eye. Final image of seaglass on the pillow recharges prior motifs. Only a faint risk of overwriting in “cathedral arches.”</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—extract meaning from loss—tightens with each artifact until the exchange forecloses further pursuit. Pressure grows accumulatively; no external antagonist needed. Cost is legible: seventeen nights of insomnia, the surrender of her best canvas and brush. Coincidence (finding the journal) complicates rather than resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: grief calcifying into artifact, legacy as exchange. Subtext in the whispered “I’m trying not to ruin you again” carries more weight than any statement. Final seaglass shard reframes the entire pattern without moralizing. Complexity is honored; no tidy binaries.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is painterly, salt-raw, and consistent: “the ocean had become a librarian of loss.” Perceptual signature—colors, tides, fractal shadows—remains character-bound. No head-hopping; compression purposeful. Dialogue minimal but subtext-laden when it appears.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence advances image or stakes. No loops or scaffold. Metaphors (“bruised clouds,” “tide forgets to leave”) are precise and earned. Minor register drift in “spectral” but does not obscure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of climate-grief archaeology and personal insomnia. The amber-brooch-as-emotional-hard-drive is specific and non-obvious. Risky lyric structure pays off in closure. No derivative echoes detected.</comment>
