<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid (“logically emotional to her marrow”) and embodied choices (syncing breath to ice) drive every beat; the final renunciation of force for consonance is earned. No secondary characters on page, so relationship crucible N/A. Micro-choice hierarchy clear: key → Heartstone → harmonic counter-song.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: her stance crystallizes into “keeper of balance” with felt cost (exhaustion, warm key). Causal lens holds: each beat because/therefore tightens until harmonic absolution reweights stakes. No orientation debt; drift-ice marina anchored by word 30.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Drift-ice marina is not postcard; its groans, cracks, and pressure ridges actively guide her steps and seal beneath her soles, constraining tactics. Bioluminescent stairwell and mercury basin charge the final image. Sensory hierarchy tuned to POV priorities—sound over sight—supports theme.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—protect Heartstone from discord—signaled early. Escalation tightens once: metallic sonic harpoon raises cost, forcing her to transmute dissonance into absolution. Agency is harmonic adaptation; price is physical depletion and irreversible shift from engineer to guardian.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges: violence answered not with force but with frequency/understanding. Subtext carried by key’s warmth and Heartstone’s forgiving pulse. Final image of twilight and steady glow offers non-literal, resonant answer without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Distinct perceptual signature: “salt-laced air,” “cerulean light that made her bones ache.” Rhythm modulates with pressure—long lyrical sentences under calm, clipped fragments under assault. No dialogue, so voice coherence judged on internal texture; no POV drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density (“key leapt…slotted into a seam no wider than a hair”). Metaphors precise (“pressure ridges softened like sighs”). No overwriting in peak beats; sonic vocabulary accurate. Final cadence breathes with her pulse.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: lighthouse engineer + harmonic ice + sonic absolution. Tropes transformed—key not just access but tuning fork; Heartstone not MacGuffin but moral agent. Risky lyric compression paid off; closure legible under causal lens.</comment>
