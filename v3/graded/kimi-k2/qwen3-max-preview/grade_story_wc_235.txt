<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority is textured and embodied; the jealousy of past selves is dramatized through concrete micro-choices (reaching for the scroll, strumming the chord). The final renunciation—accepting ragged seams—earns its cost via prior feral nostalgia and ink-stained struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the scroll’s hum against the thigh crystallizes a before/after shift from hunted to hunter of memory. Accumulative/Textural lens holds; each shard intensifies density until the final image reweights chaos into named shape.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Cabin breathes, wind scrapes quills, birch bark darkens—details constrain choices (ink flows only after embodied jealousy) and charge the final scroll image. Selective sensory economy supports the Accumulative drive without clutter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—distill feral nostalgia into narrative—tightens through each shard; the scroll’s refusal then acceptance marks the decisive pressure point. Cost is visible: decades mislaid, grave shrinking to footnote.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: memory’s refusal to be tamed, the alchemy of naming chaos. Final “Mine” reconfigures prior graves and guitars without moralizing, leaving resonant ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Distinct perceptual signature—pine resin, molars vibrating with chords—remains coherent under lyric compression. Patterned elision (time-slippage) is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>High density, zero loops; figurative language is purposeful (“fossilized confession,” “ink-stained fingers trembling”). Rhythm modulates with pressure; no artifacts near closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Lucid-dream chronicler who maps his own collapsing timeline is a fresh synthesis; jealousy of past selves as narrative fuel feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric mosaic pays off with coherent closure.</comment>
