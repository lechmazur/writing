<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Single POV investigator’s interiority is concrete and embodied; patch, wind, and silence act as externalized pressure. Motivation—“to map the next disaster”—is reiterated through micro-choices (planting sensors, stepping into wind). Final stance crystallizes with felt cost: “Let it know I was watching.” No contradictory impulses shown mid-scene, so 9+ gate not met.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: protagonist steps into the wind’s path, foreclosing retreat. Causal lens holds—each beat (survey, note, sensor plan) is because/therefore linked. Orientation anchored by 120 words; no drift. Cost is legible: the silence “was waiting” and he risks becoming Varga’s echo. Minor ellipsis around off-page crash keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Container labyrinth is not backdrop; geometry literally teaches the wind and constrains tactics—wind spikes only at Junction 7. Salt-crusted gravel, rusted steel walls, thermal updraft all filtered through investigator’s professional gaze. Final image of wind “tasting the air” recharges the setting as active antagonist. Environment shapes the closing choice, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prevent next “singular convergence”—is signaled early and tightened when crane reposition is revealed to have “changed its shape.” Escalation is accumulative: each wind reading narrows options until only direct confrontation remains. Cost is visible: investigator accepts becoming the wind’s next student. No external coincidence resolves tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: wind as adaptive learner, investigator as reluctant mentor. Subtext in silence and patch reframes hubris as iterative education. Final image reweights premise—knowledge is not control but mutual recognition. No moralizing; resonance lingers in “Let it learn me too.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>First-person voice is precise yet haunted; technical lexicon (anemometer, thermal differential) stays within professional POV. Rhythm modulates—longer sentences for reflection, clipped fragments under wind spikes. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent. Distinct texture supports pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances story or atmosphere. Figurative language (“wind curled… tasting the air”) is sparse, purposeful, and coherent. High information density: wind vectors, container IDs, time pressure packed into motion. No register drift; technical terms earned. Closure beat is clean, propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Premise—port containers as wind-training maze—is fresh and fully committed. Trope of investigator haunted by last victim is transformed through patch-as-compass and wind-as-student. Specificity of micro-climates and Junction 7 vectors makes concept inevitable in hindsight. Risky second-person address to wind (“Let it know”) pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
