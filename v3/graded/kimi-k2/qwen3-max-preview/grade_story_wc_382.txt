<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The tutor’s quiet, obsessive desire to “write back” to the building is embodied in tactile micro-choices—folding birds, pressing the seal—so motivation stays concrete. The weekly sugar ritual and final exchange of key/ seal crystallize a relationship whose stakes shift from polite fiction to shared covenant. Her flaw—solitary listening turned active dialogue—compounds when she accepts the cost of descent. Closure is earned: she renounces further lies and steps into the basement’s full sentences, cost legible in the seal’s weight and the key’s cold.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single-scene structure holds; orientation is immediate (rooftop garden, meteor shower). Causal linkage: sugar borrowing → tea sessions → revelation → key. Closure is a decisive change—she pockets the key and descends—charged with conceptual cost: she can no longer pretend the building is mute. Lens (Causal) is unbroken; every beat narrows options toward the vault.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is selective and atmospheric: rooftop garden’s meteor streaks, wrought-iron bench, velvet-lined box. Micro-setting (brass seal, clay tablets) functions as tool and translator. The building itself becomes a character whose “sigh” and “whisper” constrain choices. Final image—her descent past the rooftop’s recognition—recharges the garden’s earlier silence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: learning to converse with the building. Pressure tightens when the archivist confirms sentience and offers the key—an irreversible step. No external antagonist; conflict is internalized desire colliding with newly revealed possibility. Cost is felt: she trades safety of half-truths for the vault’s unknown sentences.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: language as reciprocal act, architecture as living text. Subtext saturates the sugar/tea ritual—every lie a scaffold for deeper truth. Final image of the “building sighing” reweights the premise without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: will dialogue liberate or consume her?</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with tactile diction (“tea-stained receipts,” “patina catching starlight”). Free-indirect style stays locked to the tutor’s perceptual quirks. Dialogue is spare and subtext-laden (“Third-floor joists sing in winter”). Rhythm modulates from languid rooftop reverie to clipped final exchange.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; every sentence layers image or stakes. Figurative language is controlled—meteors as “fleeting silver scars,” mortar holding “syntax.” No loops or scaffold. Final paragraph’s cadence slows to mirror her descent, sealing momentum cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Premise—sentient architecture taught through philology—is fresh yet grounded in sensory detail. The sugar ritual as covert research protocol feels non-obvious. Transformation test: swap seal for any generic key and the emotional logic collapses. Risky lyric compression pays off in the rooftop’s final sigh.</comment>
