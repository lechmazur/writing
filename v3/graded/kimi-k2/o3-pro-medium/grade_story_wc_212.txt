<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Alma’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses—furious yet tranquil—surface in micro-choices like exhaling numbers into the vortex. The cost of borrowed time is dramatized as silver threading her hair, a felt price that forecloses youth. Motivation is rooted in lineage and soil, not abstract greed. One slip: the phrase “texture of borrowed time” edges toward label-speak before it is re-earned in the final image.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Alma’s stance crystallizes in the healed mirrors and thawing atrium, with visible cost (her aging). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each restored pane tightens the pattern until the final image reweights the premise. Causality is intact: the vortex, acorn cap, and hatchling all pay off in the ending beat. No orientation debt; anchors are clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The icebound atrium is not mere backdrop; its frost-neutral crystals and reversely-falling droplets constrain Alma’s movements and mirror the entropy reversal. Sensory selection is urgent—embered feathers, scent of extinct spring—filtered through Alma’s seed-saver priorities. The mirrors-as-setting function as micro-setting that charges the final image. One minor drift: “starlight” is repeated without fresh inflection late in the piece.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—harvesting borrowed time—tightens when Alma chooses to age herself to heal the mirrors. Escalation is driven by her agency under the Accumulative lens: each pane repaired increases the density of reclaimed seasons. Cost is legible in silvered hair and the quiet eye of the vortex. No coincidence resolves the conflict; the thaw is earned.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: entropy can be gardened, but only by paying personal time. The oak acorn cap and mirrors reprise with reweighted meaning, offering a non-literal answer to the question of borrowed time’s texture. No moralizing; the final image of Alma tasting “rough, sweet” time invites reflection without prescription. Subtext hums in the hatchling’s oscillating chirps and the scent of extinct gardens.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with a perceptual signature rooted in seed-saving lore (“seasons that no longer existed”). Syntax modulates with pressure—long, breath-like sentences during entropy-weaving, crisp fragments at the crack of shell. No head-hopping; POV remains tightly bound to Alma. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing”) is earned by context.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; each sentence layers image, action, and theme. Metaphors are coherent—vortex as hive of muted suns, mirrors as stored minutes. No loops or scaffold; even repeated motifs (starlight, frost) accrue new charge. One micro-slip: “reversely-falling” is vivid but momentarily jolts rhythm.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of seed-saving, entropy gardening, and dragon-hen lore feels inevitable and fresh. Transformation test passes: the emotional arc collapses if Alma is not a seed saver. Risk-taking in structure (lyric accumulation, mirrors as time-bank) heightens stakes without gimmickry. No close echoes of famous scenes.</comment>
