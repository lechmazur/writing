<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mira’s curiosity is embodied in every micro-choice (adjusting the aid, following pulses, sealing the jar) and drives the arc; the final renunciation—leaving the voices playing for ghosts—carries visible cost (her lantern drained, her solitude) and is earned by prior causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the “reeling hush” becomes a “vigilant hush,” reweighting the premise with undeniable conceptual cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each beat thickens the pattern of listening—until the final cascade of sound crystallizes meaning.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium and seed vault constrain every move (slippery ladders, moss-cooled hatch) and charge the final image; the broken glass and ivy mirror Mira’s internal fracture and eventual acceptance, grounding the lyric close.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—protecting vulnerable voices—tightens when Mira must choose between extracting the boy and preserving the archive; the cost is her drained lantern and the irreversible decision to leave the voices playing, a visible price that reweights options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the seed-archive conceit: memory and care persist only if someone chooses to listen. The final image of music flooding the atrium offers a non-literal answer—remembrance as living sound—without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, lyric, and consistent; sensory selection (“ivy threading iron ribs like green veins”) reflects Mira’s trained ear. Compression and patterned elision (“mist now thick as milkglass”) are taught early and paid off in the final cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence advances atmosphere or choice. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is selective and purposeful, never muddling causality. The final cascade of sound lands clean and resonant.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The “contact tracer for hearts” premise is fresh, synthesized through specific botanical-acoustic lore. The seed-vault archive feels inevitable in hindsight; the incidental heroism motif is embodied rather than declared, with risk-taking that heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
