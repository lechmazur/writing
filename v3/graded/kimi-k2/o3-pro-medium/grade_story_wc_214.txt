<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Janus’s spiritual curiosity and empathic impulse drive every beat; the interior contradiction between protocol and wonder is embodied in the micro-choice to trace rather than seal. The final release of the lantern glass crystallizes his shift from faked strength to vulnerability, with the cost of leaving his own fissures exposed. Minor deduction for one reflective block that slightly exceeds 20 %.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sweep of the broom and each traced arc thickens the pattern until the final image reweights the entire station as monastery. Closure lands with unmistakable Resonant Reconfiguration—Janus’s stance toward his labor and fragility is forever altered, cost legible in the “heartbeat hum” that now emanates from him.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The station, broom, and lantern glass form a micro-setting that constrains every move; the cracked vessel literally channels starlight that guides Janus’s choreography. Sensory selection is urgent yet selective—molten dawn light, ion-charged bristles—filtered through Janus’s spiritual bias. One minor drift: “cathedral-wide corridor” edges toward overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to seal or heal the lantern glass—tightens once when Janus chooses empathy over protocol, foreclosing the safe path. The cost is visible: he risks breach of duty and personal exposure. Pressure escalates under Accumulative lens via density of light and dust patterns rather than causal turns.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of strength-through-vulnerability emerges organically from Janus’s embodied choices; no explicit moralizing. The final image of the station as monastery and Janus as abbot reweights the premise without stating it. One soft echo—“strength is sometimes a patch of vulnerability”—is earned but still triggers a small deduction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with rhythmic control that modulates under pressure—“broom gliding like a low comet” vs. “vacuum howled.” Perceptual signature is unmistakably Janus’s: cosmic janitor who notices dust motes as meteor tears. No POV leakage; every metaphor is character-bound.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and motion. No loops or scaffold; occasional elevated diction (“empathic choreography”) is justified by Janus’s spiritual lens. One mixed metaphor—“lantern glass catch the stellar wind, its shards aligning like petals”—barely grazes clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: cosmic janitor repairing broken starlight with a broom and antique quill-laser feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risk-taking in lyric accumulative structure heightens meaning without obscuring closure. Transformation test passes—plot and arc collapse if Janus is merely “maintenance tech.”</comment>
