<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Wren’s interiority is vivid—her “hauntingly optimistic heart beats like a gull’s wing” embodies the trait and drives her to prick her finger and feed the loom. The contradiction between hope and ruin is dramatized in scene, not summarized. Micro-choices (touching sailor knots, sewing shards) reveal hierarchy of values. Closure cost—blood, opened corridor—earns the endurance/renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of “broken precedents” and orchid imagery tightens toward the final reconfiguration. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—new corridor spirals outward, cost legible in the blood-fed violet thread. Orientation anchored by canyon mouth and tide pools within 120 words. No causality breaks; labyrinth shifts taught early as responsive to intention.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Environment constrains choice: rust-red canyon walls, fossilized knots, and dry tide-pool basins shape what can be salvaged and sewn. Micro-setting (loom, illustration plate) functions as extension of canyon. Sensory hierarchy—iron dust, salt, orchid petals—filtered through Wren’s craft-biased perception. Final open ceiling recharges earlier shoreline projection, making setting inseparable from closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“carve a path from ruin to reverence”—signaled in paragraph 3 and tightened when Wren bleeds onto the loom. One meaningful deepening: discarded precedents become raw material, foreclosing retreat. Cost visible in blood and irrevocable corridor. Agency drives escalation; labyrinth’s shift is response to her intention, not coincidence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete acts: sewing shattered instruments literalizes “broken precedents” as creative fuel. Final image—spiral corridor carrying salt, orchid, dawn—offers non-literal answer to how ruin becomes reverence. No moralizing; resonance arises from reweighted loom and open sky. Ambiguity lingers: corridor invites others, cost already paid.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise: “orchid solace,” “lighthouse-bright” belong to Wren’s poetic-craft idiom. Patterned elision (“sleepwalking paths”) taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; perceptual signature consistent. Rhythm modulates with pressure—long sentences in corridors, clipped beats at loom. Distinct texture sustains 800-word span without monotony.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and stakes. No loops or scaffold; “petals of phantom orchids drift along the torchlight” does triple sensory work. Metaphors coherent—loom, tide, weaving—without muddle. Occasional elevated diction justified by Wren’s poetic lens. Final line lands clean, recharging motifs without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Familiar quest-into-labyrinth transformed through textile poetics and salt-craft specificity. “Broken precedents” as literal salvage material feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric compression sustained without clarity loss. No derivative echoes; voice and world cohere as singular stance. Fresh inflection: loom re-started by blood-thread, canyon as living archive.</comment>
