<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Interiority is concrete and embodied; contradictory impulses around abandonment and duty surface in each motion toward the glass. The micro-choices—pressing the compass to the viewport, killing the last lamp, folding the sketch-ship, shouldering the pack—carry escalating cost and crystallize a hierarchy of values: legacy over safety, ritual over protocol. The final walk-out earns full resonance because the prior beats trace how ritual must also become locomotion; ambiguity and flaw remain intact to the last footstep.</comment>

<comment>The closure is a Charged Poise: the paper ship balanced between station vents and cosmic dark, weighted equally by hope and unquantifiable delay. Under an Accumulative/Textural lens the station, father, ritual, and starlight layer into a single closing image whose cost—the relinquishment of present certainty in exchange for a message that may arrive after a lifetime—is legible on the page.</comment>

<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The viewport glass, the retractable shield, the cooling hull ticks—all constrain choice by exposing the protagonist to vacuum observation after hours of blackout protocol. The compass rose physically guides hand alignment at the lens, and the folded paper ship becomes the final object charged with both message payload and potential drift. The setting is selective, visceral, and stakes-controlling rather than ornamental backdrop.</comment>

<comment>The dominant stake—will ritual survive systemic abandonment—loses no ground to digression; each sensor activation and intercom crackle tightens available options. Agency is embodied in every stroke of charcoal and in the choice to walk out rather than await rescue. Cost accrues in tangible ways: solitude, blackout exposure, forfeiture of scheduled sleep, and the irreversible release of the only ship-sketched message.</comment>

<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as a meditation on exile-as-direction; the subtext lies in how compasses are fictions when orbiting, yet faith remains pragmatic. The final step into the corridor re-weights the earlier belief that “whoever follows true north never drifts,” showing that even drift can be purposeful voyage home. This thematic closure is implicit rather than sermonizing and reframes the accident as temporal geography rather than tragedy to be erased.</comment>

<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Voice is consistent first-person with lyrical compression under stress; sensor hums and “starlight speared the darkness” carry the same breath-tight syntax as “a tear...floated.” Diction never exceeds POV knowledge; the one line of intercom dialogue is filtered through her skeptic microphones may no longer be alive.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Line control is agile; information-dense sentences like “time itself felt stitched and temporally stretched between them and me” do double-duty as sensory image and thematic bridge. No loops or scaffolding; the single paraphrase loop (“the silence echoed again”) is purposeful, teaching the station as a breathing entity.</comment>

<comment>Fresh synthesis: blackout astrophysics station repurposes stargazing ritual as interstellar mail delivery. Risk in choosing an open-ended closure is fully accepted; the novelty withstands the proximity test—nothing feels sampled from standard orbital survivor narratives.</comment>
