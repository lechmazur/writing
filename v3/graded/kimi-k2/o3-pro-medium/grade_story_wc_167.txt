<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her “pockets clinking with shards” and “fingers hovering just above the surface” show contradiction between reverence and urgency. Motivation to finish her mother’s work and “illuminate value in the mundane” is clear and escalates to the decisive repair. The final smile and recognition of “calibration” mark earned change with visible cost. Minor slip: no second on-page character, so relationship crucible not tested.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the prism atrium sings through its fractures, townspeople’s perception tilts, and Mira’s stance crystallizes with cost—“beauty adjusts the axis.” Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of light and pattern intensifies until the final ray ricochets, reweighting meaning. Orientation anchored by line 3; no causality breaks. Cost is legible in the communal wonder and Mira’s steadied breath.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Pearl Bay dawn, the mist-veiled atrium, and the lily pond are rendered with selective sensory detail that constrains tactics—Mira must read the pond’s rings to time the repair. The glass labyrinth’s “reef coral” glow and “fish-scale dust” ground the climax. Micro-setting of shards and tools in her satchel directly enable the final act. Weather and light evolve causally, charging the ending image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“mend what lived behind the cracks”—is signaled early and tightens when the third ring warns repair must finish by nightfall. Escalation is one deepening: the fractures become apertures that refract wonder onto townspeople, costing Mira anonymity and effort. Agency is hers alone; coincidence complicates (storm damage) but does not resolve. Cost is visible in her exhaustion and the irreversible shift in communal perception.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of “illuminating value in the mundane” emerges through glass fragments turned mosaics and the accountant “losing count on purpose.” Subtext in the pond’s plea and the townspeople’s wordless uplift avoids statement. Final image of noctilucent sky reweights the premise: beauty recalibrates perception without moralizing. Complexity lingers in the fragility of the repaired yet still cracked panes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise—“silver breath,” “reef coral glow,” “ghostly sky-glow wrote ledgers”—with rhythmic control that accelerates under pressure. POV remains tightly anchored to Mira’s perceptual bias; no head-hopping. Compression like “dawn kept happening” is taught early and paid off. Distinct diction sustains throughout, modulating from meditative to luminous.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image, action, and theme. No loops or scaffold; “glass never lies” is strategic tell. Metaphors are coherent—“spidering fractures mirrored the town”—and never muddle causality. Rhythm varies naturally; paragraph cuts are purposeful. Zero artifacts in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise of a glazier who repairs social fractures through light refraction is fresh and specific. Transformation test: story fails without Mira’s shard-mosaic alchemy and the prism atrium’s wounded glow. Risk in lyric accumulation pays off when the final ray reconfigures communal perception. No close echoes; synthesis feels inevitable.</comment>
