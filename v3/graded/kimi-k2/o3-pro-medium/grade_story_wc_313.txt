<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is vivid—her “precisely humane pull” and “water can carry memory” belief ground every micro-choice. The pocketing of the label, the lowering of the sluice, and the pinning of the photo all enact her value hierarchy under pressure. The final stance—renouncing official history at personal risk—earns its cost through prior beats. One hairline slip: the phrase “collective silence yields to stories” edges toward summary rather than embodied shift.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Mara’s act of lowering the reservoir reconfigures both physical stakes (water level) and moral stance (whose history survives). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each photograph and artifact layers density until the dawn gallery crystallizes meaning. Causality is tight: because she finds the label and photos, therefore she disobeys protocol. Cost is visible in the final line—“the reservoir will soon swell again”—a looming price she accepts.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The midnight ridgeway, mirrored water, and resurfacing boulevard constrain every move; the pump-house valve is handled, not just described. Sensory hierarchy—moon as coin, star reflections in storefront glass—filters through Mara’s professional eye. The sapphire label reappears pinned under Clara’s smile, charging the final image. No orientation drift; space and object states track cleanly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whose memory survives the next flood—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightens when Mara lowers the sluice. One decisive intensification: the act buys “hours to gather” at the cost of inevitable refill. Agency is hers; coincidence (photos surfacing) complicates but does not resolve. The price—personal risk and temporary ecological strain—is legible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the tension between engineered forgetting and submerged memory; no overt statement intrudes. The final image—lantern light on silt and celluloid—offers a non-literal answer: memory persists in shared curation, not concrete. Subtext in the couple’s toast behind the new dam critiques progress without sermon. Complexity lingers: Mara’s act is both preservation and sabotage.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet disciplined: “mirrored hush,” “charcoal path,” “rotwood pier” feel specific to Mara’s vigilance. Syntax modulates with pressure—long cadence for twilight hush, clipped fragments at the valve. No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains consistent. One micro drift: “collective silence yields” momentarily lifts to omniscient before returning to her lantern-guided POV.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence advances story or atmosphere. Figurative language is selective—“ribs of a long-dead leviathan” earns its place. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Rhythm breathes with scene needs: hush, suction of boots, metallic clank of the gate. Clean mechanics; no typos or pronoun drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The drowned-town premise is familiar, yet the execution—photograph breadcrumb trail, levee warden as archivist of memory—feels inevitable and fresh. Specificity of the sapphire label and the March surname transforms trope into lived artifact. Risk-taking in the quiet, accumulative structure pays off: the dawn gallery is a closure image not seen in similar stories. No derivative echoes; the synthesis is singular.</comment>
