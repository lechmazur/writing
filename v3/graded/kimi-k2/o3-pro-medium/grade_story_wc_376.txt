<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Cressida's compulsion toward honesty—dramatized by wilting near falsehood—grounds every moment-to-moment choice and physically alters her body state; her final gesture planting seeds is earned by this trait rather than imposed. Interiority shows simultaneous hope and bodily dread without therapy-speak. Micro-choices reveal value hierarchy when she trades safety for truthful utterance. One flaw: Fen is less individuated, shifting some relationship crucible into instrumental.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: lost letters → plate → map → “Archive of Unuttered Things” → planter ritual sequence is all because/therefore. Closure image—truth scrubbing the toxic sky while citizens speak openly—offers a resonant reconfiguration, felt cost visible as city atmosphere visibly changes. No info lag; anchors land early under greenhouse glass. The single transition through maintenance tunnels is coherent with pressure intact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Greenhouse’s humidity valves, rusted mail sleds, and bruised-purple sky create tactile constraint: humidity valves hiss against skin, exterior toxins limit exits, mail systems archive voices. Specific object—oasis lily planter—becomes the final crucible, charging the image with cost. No geographic drift; sensory hierarchy tracks Cressida’s attention (condensation on spectacles, floorboards under boots).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>Comment>The dominant stake—speech/lies poison atmosphere citywide—escalates when each planted seed narrows options while literally thinning toxic air. Escalation driven by incremental truthful planting rather than luck; cost is felt as Cressida’s posture “unfurls like a revived vine” under rain. One tightening beat in the Archive: retrieval of seeds directly forecloses return route to greenhouse deceit.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: city archive of unheard words, seeds sprouting as rain scrubbing sky. Candor versus dishonesty is dramatized in bodily wilt, not explained. Final image—unreceived letters “rise in rainbows”—offers non-literal answer that reweights entire premise without moralizing. Ambiguity about whether oasis revives is earned, not evasive.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is precise, lyrical, sensorily attentive: “humidity hissed against glass arches” and “brittle floorboards…onto moss.” Internal texture feels idiosyncratic, not averaged. Tight psychic distance; no POV slippage. Compression taught early (“Where, she wondered, do lost conversations go”) pays off in closure cadence. Dialogue sparse but subtextual (Fen’s shoulders unknotted).</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Strong rhythm and zero loops; sentences serve multiple functions: “Zinc fragment slid perfectly…clicking like a held breath released” moves plot, heightens tension, and enacts object specificity. Imagery grounded: “gilded-leaf calligrapher,” “reclaimed dew.” Only micro flaw: a few elevated Latinate compounds (“reconfigure options”) but they occur early and don’t dull closure beat.</comment>

<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh angle—lost epistolary language literally seeded to regrow atmosphere—feels inevitable after early “lost conversations” hook. Transforms familiar eco-collapse by reframing oxygen-poison as consequence of suppressed truth. Specifics never feel borrowed; world logic (postal archive as biological repository) remains internally consistent without gimmick.</comment>
