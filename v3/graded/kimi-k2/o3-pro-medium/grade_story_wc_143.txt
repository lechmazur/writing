<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Halina’s interiority is concrete: the nervous fog on her visor (beat 14); the refusal to shout when she chooses chemistry (beat 6); the embodied mineral-smell and static on the tongue (beat 31) all show an individual mind. Flawed knowledge—doubt that the archives will ever convey sensorial sorrow—drives her solo commentary. The earned renunciation at the end is visible: she shoulders the silence the drones cannot capture and the cracked grain that will never measure again, accepting the cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each flare and crystalline drift thickens the sense of lastness until the final rosy hush. Closure comes as CR—the “valley’s last unmanufactured morning” is repriced in the reader’s mind; the image of ordinary steam escaping into regulated atmosphere carries undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation is provided by line 2 (“Mons Vesper … outer Luna”) and never breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Moonlit summit supplies the pressure—wind, basalt tremors, Earthlight licking the horizon—and the hourglass grain constrains her trigger timing. Tools are lived in: the cracked vial, the fogged visor, the buzzing drone silhouettes. Description never stalls action; mineral-smell, static on tongue, and frost residue on her visor all filter through her job-trained priorities.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake announced early—“last ice plume freezing upward”—and the conflict escalates as sunrise and drones close, narrowing options. One middle turn: the vial cracks under the mountain’s seismic pulse, tightening Halina’s task to capturing the final phases before the engineered end. Cost is visible when ordinary steam replaces the plume and she walks downslope “carrying within her the silence” already lost forever.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</question>
<comment>Emergent theme: documentation as witness versus engineered oblivion. No thesis is stated; the reader infers it from the plume’s vanishing, the archived negatives, and the drones’ inevitable arrival. Specific images—the grain’s vigil, frost refusing to melt—do the thematic work without editorial commentary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is sustained lunar-engineer precision mixed with elegiac notes: “crystals glittering inside the vapor, catching starlight and reflecting it onto Halina’s suit” shows her trained lens yet allows wonder. Syntax breathes with pressure—short beats during vial activation, lingering cadence on descent. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Line-level craft is dense without artifacts. No synonym loops; metaphors stay anchored (volcano’s final heartbeat, dragon-scale shadows). Sentences vary rhythm—“chemicals mixed, a hiss coiled through tubing”—building urgency without overwriting. All technical terms are accurate and motivated by POV knowledge.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</question>
<comment>Familiar themes (“progress” v. “vanishing natural”) are re-inflected through an unusual pairing—ice geysers beneath heaters and a museum hourglass. The synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight; the closure image of ordinary steam rising after engineered dawn would not land without these fresh particulars. Calculated risk pays off.</comment>
