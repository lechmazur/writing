<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s contradictory awe and terror under Seraphine’s presence are embodied in micro-choices (bowing, steadying among crucibles, cradling the apple). The final renunciation—accepting her dissolution—carries visible cost in his hollowed-yet-resonant heart. One slip: “lovingly venomous” is repeated rather than deepened, a label that never gains new texture.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the apple’s splitting reweighs all prior grief into constellated recompense. Causal chain holds—bead → graft → sky-seeds—each step narrowing Elias’s options until only acceptance remains. Cost is legible in the empty stem he pockets and the dawn steam that ends the greenhouse’s endless night.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The greenhouse’s black condensation and pulse-lit bark constrain every move; the apple’s reflection of winter fields charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—Elias notices what threatens or promises awakening. One minor drift: “moonless sap” is vivid but not re-anchored to any physical source.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—grow the apple of return—tightens once when the bead is set and the fruit swells. Agency is Elias’s: he prunes, cradles, carries, and finally releases. The price is the irreversible loss of Seraphine’s warm hand; escalation is coherent under the Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of debt and recompense emerges through the orchard’s lullabies and the sky-constellations; no moral is stated. The final image of drifting seeds sowing “new chances” offers non-literal resonance that reweights every prior grief without sermonizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lush yet disciplined, with rhythmic control that accelerates under the crystal-ring climax. Perceptual signature is Elias’s: alchemical, tactile, haunted. No head-hop; even Seraphine’s speech is filtered through his awe. Compression like “lovingly venomous” is taught early and paid off in her farewell smile.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; each sentence layers image, emotion, and forward motion. No loops or scaffold; metaphors stay coherent. Minor register lift in “resonant awakenings” is justified by the orchard’s idiom. Final line earns its cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The soul-fruit orchard and centuries-spanning debt are familiar tropes, yet transformed through Elias’s embodied tending and the bead’s cosmic etching. The synthesis feels inevitable: peasant promise → alchemical graft → star-seeded sky. Risky lyric density pays off in the closure image.</comment>
