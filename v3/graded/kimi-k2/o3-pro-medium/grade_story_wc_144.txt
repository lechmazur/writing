<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s blindness is embodied through tactile listening and micro-choices; Rowan’s interiority is thin but serviceable. The final toss of the drone crystallizes her earned mastery and the cost of trust. No contradictory impulses surface in Rowan, capping the score below 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the drone’s flight reweights the depot’s schedule and Mara's authority. Causal chain—diagnose-patch-test-toss—holds under Accumulative/Textural lens. Cost is legible in the hush that “promises future journeys already aligning.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Depot, basins, and mist are filtered through Rowan’s craft-eye; water-refraction mechanic constrains diagnosis. Final image of twin tracks “like polished compasses” charges closure. Slight over-description of dawn light keeps it from 9.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore drone before anchor lifts—tightens via ticking clock. One deepening: gyro imbalance forces tungsten micro-choice. Cost is visible in Vale’s departure and synchronized whistles, but external pressure outweighs internal friction.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of “decoding hidden patterns” emerges through water-listening and brass wings; no moralizing. Final line’s “quiet ripples” reweight premise without statement. Subtext in Rowan’s unspoken awe sustains resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rowan’s voice is tactile, metallic, slightly reverent; syntax mirrors workshop rhythm. No dialogue, so voice carries via sensory filter. Occasional poetic lift (“coastal scripture”) risks register drift but stays controlled.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence advances repair or stakes. Metaphors are precise—“spine freed from pain.” No loops or scaffold. Minor cadence repetition in triple-basin sequence nudges it below 9.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Blind artisan decoding light through water feels fresh; steampunk elements serve character stakes, not décor. Synthesis of rail, sea, and micro-repair is non-obvious yet inevitable. Risk in lyric compression pays off in closure image.</comment>
