<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Tomas’s interior contradiction—ambition vs. grace—plays out in the queen-sacrifice moment; the worry stone’s smoothing registers embodied cost. Motivation (beauty in difficulty) drives every micro-choice; exile is not just backstory but active pressure. The final renunciation (leaving the nexus) forecloses return with quiet but visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the queen-sacrifice and mate sequence reweights exile from wound to vocation. Causal chain holds—each move tightens moral/physical equilibrium under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Cost is legible in the vanished dent and the mandate to depart.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The magnetic stakes, glowing moss, and eclipse function as micro-setting that literally tilts the board; environment constrains every tactical choice. Sensory detail is selective—iron ringing, moonlit dust—filtered through Tomas’s tactical gaze. Final image of lingering magnet-stars charges the newfound calm.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can exile be redeemed through pattern and grace—escalates as each move correlates moral choice to physical pull. One decisive tightening: queen sacrifice narrows options to graceful victory or greedy stalemate. Cost is felt in permanent departure and the smoothed stone.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: beauty arises where opposing forces listen. Subtext lives in the dust-woman’s silent knight and the magnetic stakes’ moral gauge. Final image of cautious king at dawn offers non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is tactician-poet: precise yet lyrical, e.g., “doorway holding its breath.” Perceptual signature—chess notation, silence translation—remains consistent. Compression and elision are taught early and paid off in the closing cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is sparse and purposeful. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances. Rhythm modulates with move-by-move tension, then exhales into twilight calm.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: magnetic eclipse as cosmic chess clock, worry stone as emotional barometer. Risky lyric structure holds; payoff feels inevitable. No stock tropes; exile-as-tutor is particular and lived.</comment>
