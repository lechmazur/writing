<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Protagonist’s interiority is concrete and embodied; the painful static on the lacquer box is a micro-choice that reveals risk tolerance. Bram’s involuntary candor creates immediate status pressure, forcing the protagonist to confess before entry. The final declaration is earned by prior stakes and carries visible cost (tower’s refusal risk). Minor: Bram’s emotional admission feels slightly expositional rather than embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: blackout → tower ascent → riddle → ampoule → reboot. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the city lights return, but the protagonist’s spoken truth reweights the tower’s rule-set. Orientation is anchored by ~120 words. One scaffold: “truth slips from me like rain off slate” is a near-paraphrase of earlier candor motif.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lightning tower’s warm metal, copper air, and violet hive chamber are selective and purposeful. The lacquer box’s static and crystalline heart constrain the protagonist’s tactics. “Nectar dusk” threads from first paragraph to final line, recharging the theme. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible moves.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: restore power before city entropy. Escalation tightens once: ampoule retrieval triggers alarms, forcing ritual declaration with tower refusal as cost. Agency is decision (speak truth) that forecloses stealth option. Coincidence (Bram’s pre-solved riddle) complicates rather than resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: wonder vs routine maintenance. The lacquer box and bottled lightning embody the tension. Final image (“mystery could light hearts”) reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext in Bram’s smile and stamped pass shows cost of emotional breach.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct lyric texture: “nectar dusk,” “storm veins webbed,” “chrome bees.” POV remains first-person singular, no head-hopping. Dialogue minimal but subtextual (“You are here to ask…”). Filter verbs minimal; sensory verbs strong. One register drift: “algorithmic drift into hibernation” edges toward tech jargon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density: each sentence advances image or action. Rhythm modulates with pressure: longer clauses in ascent, staccato during alarms. No loops or scaffold. Metaphors precise (“glass ampoule… like a captured yell”). Minor: “copper and distant rain” repeats “nectar dusk” flavor without new data.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: lightning tower as apiary, drones as chrome bees, bottled thunder as nectar. Riddle-as-maintenance-manual subverts typical quest. Specificity grounds premise: tarnished brass badge, crystalline heart. Risk in candor mechanic pays off emotionally. No derivative echoes.</comment>
