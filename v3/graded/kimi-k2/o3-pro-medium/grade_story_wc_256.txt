<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lio’s embodied interiority (throat scars tightening, knuckles humming) and micro-choice to sing imperfectly rather than purely reveal contradictory impulses under pressure; the final renunciation of performance for connection carries visible cost in the “empty hands and resonant heart.” Secondary pressure from Senka is minimal but sufficient.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of sound and light patterns tightens until the final chord reconfigures the vault from archive to living vestibule. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Earned Stasis—where Lio’s imperfect hum reweights the premise that purity preserves meaning, with cost legible in the “empty hands.” Orientation is clear by line 4.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Selective sensory detail (dusty organ pipes, glacier-blue lens, brass reeds) anchors the micro-setting and constrains Lio’s tactics; the lens and pipes charge the final image as glowing columns of tuned memory. Spatial choreography is coherent; no white-room syndrome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“texture of connection”—is signaled early and escalates through the static surge and Lio’s shift from perfect bell-tone to cracked hum; the tightening forces a trade-off between archival purity and communal resonance, with cost visible in the abandoned dig-site coordinates Senka recites.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: connection as braided light, communal strength. The final image of dawn climbing the pipes offers a non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext in Senka’s tears and the miners’ knocks deepens resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct lyric texture—“velvet thunder,” “slow fireworks”—remains consistent under pressure; no head-hopping. Compression (“laboratory exhales a hush”) is taught early and paid off. Dialogue minimal but subtextual.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High information density with rhythmic variation; no loops or scaffold. Metaphors are precise (“braided light”) and avoid muddle. Final third is clean; no artifacts touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: miners’ ghost rhythms + cathedral bell lore + archival science. The prism-song conceit is specific and irreplicable. Risk in lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
