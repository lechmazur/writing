<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Moira’s contradictory impulses—refusing to consume the fruit alone yet risking its loss by communal pruning—are dramatized in the greenhouse beats; the final renunciation of personal omniscience for shared hope is earned and carries visible cost in her relinquishing the ladle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the communal tasting reweights the premise from scarcity to shared future; the causal chain (seed → pruning → feast → rewired village) holds under the Accumulative/Textural lens, with the greenhouse’s shimmer as the charged final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The rusted greenhouse is not backdrop but active constraint—its iron flakes become micronutrients, its beams dictate pruning posture; the triple moons and comet act as a live clock that forces the pruning to climax at zenith.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—restore communal hope via one seed—tightens through each pruning beat; the celestial alignment creates coherent pressure that narrows the window to a single night, and the cost is the irreversible sharing of potentially godlike knowledge.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of gentle rebellion against despair emerges through embodied action (pruning pain, serving slices) rather than statement; the final image of the ladle left for anyone reconfigures the theme as ongoing stewardship, not victory speech.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is synesthetic and chef-specific—“tasted a memory of rain,” “umami of collective relief”—with rhythmic control that accelerates under pruning pressure; no POV leakage, and the grandmother ladle’s metallic ring threads through the prose like a tuning fork.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>High information density without clutter—“roots dove through rust flakes, seeking iron to flavor future pulp” does triple duty; zero loops, no mixed metaphors, and the final paragraph’s cadence slows to mirror Moira’s release.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The fusion of neurogastronomy with communal myth feels inevitable; the knowledge fruit is not a generic MacGuffin but a synaptic editor, and the greenhouse-as-brain metaphor is fresh, risky, and fully committed.</comment>
