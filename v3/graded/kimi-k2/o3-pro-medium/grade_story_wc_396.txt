<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is embodied and specific—“doubts curled like smoke inside conviction”—and her micro-choice to press the shards together crystallizes the bond. Silas’s pressure on her role as guardian sharpens her stance. The final smile carries earned cost: she accepts shared, not solo, heroism. Minor: Silas’s voice is slightly generic, preventing 9.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the beam projects empathy routes, reweighting the premise under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality holds—mirror glimpse → sprint → hatch drop → shard union—each beat tightening toward the broadcast. Cost is visible: the storm’s pause acknowledges the risk they now shoulder. One causal ellipsis (how Silas reached the lantern first) is tiny.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The lighthouse orchard, ice floes, and leaning mirror are vivid and selective; the mirror’s bark-hang anchors space. The setting constrains the final choice: tunnels beneath the shed trap the anomaly between sea and ruin. Sensory hierarchy narrows under urgency—boots skid, icicles creak. Micro-detail like “stale cider odor mingled with brine” keeps the world tactile.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“map empathy onto action before storm season”—is signaled early and tightened when the emotional cartography is projected skyward. Agency drives escalation: Mara’s decision to follow, to ally, to broadcast. Cost is felt in the swaying tower and the storm’s held breath. One beat of luck (Silas already waiting) is minor.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of collective courage emerges from the shards’ union and the beam’s outreach, never stated. The final image—orchard roots, mirrors, and ice “align in tentative harmony”—reweights the oracle’s shattered prophecy. Subtext in Silas’s eyes “mirrored flickers of the broken crystal” quietly reframes anomaly as relationship. No moralizing; resonance lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise—“pelagic wind sighed”—and stays within Mara’s perceptual range. Compression is taught early (“shadow-laced peacekeeper”) and paid off. No head-hopping; Silas’s dialogue carries slightly less idiom, a minor slip. Rhythm modulates with urgency: short clauses during the climb, longer cadences in the lantern room.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; each sentence layers image, motion, and stakes—“Lightning briefly crowned the horizon.” No loops or scaffold; figurative language is selective. One mixed metaphor—“storm sobbed but did not assault”—is minor and voice-consistent. Final line lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of orchard, lighthouse, and emotional cartography feels fresh and inevitable. The shard-prophecy trope is transformed into a tool for collective action rather than individual destiny. Risky lyric compression is sustained without clarity loss. Specificity—“routes sketched not over landforms but over emotions”—anchors universals.</comment>
