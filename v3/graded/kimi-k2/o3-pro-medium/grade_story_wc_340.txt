<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied; the servant’s contradictory impulses—curiosity vs. loyalty—play out in real time around the diary. The final whispered line lands as a credible micro-choice that alters the power balance and carries social risk. Minor: the “mathematical indifference” label edges toward diagnostic shorthand.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each floor adds density until the diary’s decrypted tenderness reweights the servant’s stance. Closure is a Charged Poise—the shared sunrise reconfigures their orbit with felt but unpaid cost. No causality breaks; elevator halt and diary reveal are causally linked.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Frost-coated mesh, brine-scented goggles, and groaning spire are selective, POV-filtered details that constrain movement and mood. The scattered-light motif recurs to unlock the diary, charging the final image. Spatial anchors are clear by line 5; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—deliver breakfast without violating trust—tightens when the diary appears. One meaningful turn: memorizing and gifting the line “Pain is a lantern…” narrows future options (risk of exile). Cost is legible: Auden’s anguish retreats one step, servant’s status now precarious.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of joy beneath anguish emerges organically from the diary’s confessions and the servant’s risky gift. Final sunrise image offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. No thematic drift; every symbol (goggles, diary, light) reweights at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Distinct lyric texture—compressed metaphors, rhythmic cadence—mirrors the servant’s heightened curiosity. POV remains tight; no head-hopping. Dialogue sparse but subtext-rich; Auden’s single eyebrow lift carries pages of meaning.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is patterned and paid off (“scattered light,” “concertina pages”). No loops or scaffold. One mixed metaphor—“vestibule of his heart”—barely grazes clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: steampunk spire, encrypted diary, and emotional archaeology merge seamlessly. The diary’s mechanical lock responding to light is a non-obvious yet inevitable payoff. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
