<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The shard-mirror archivist is a lucid, contradictory consciousness: “walks backwards when nervous” instantly embodies flaw while active micro-choice (stepping backward toward darkest stacks to outmanoeuvre Harl) shows that motive governs tactics; exile-stakes drive each backward retreat until the final retention—“I stayed” is an earned renunciation whose cost is the refusal of freedom—yet a smear of diagnostic label (“tutoring in endurance”) and late-appearing Inspector flatten secondary dynamics.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: annotated scrolls and shard mirrors accumulate meaning; mirrored fracturing tightens stakes through rhythmic reprise until the dusk-blades sever the warrant—Charged Poise with visible cost: authority sliced but flesh spared, exile reversible yet chosen to remain. Orientation debt waived: spatial anchors (“west alcove,” “behind crates”) and single micro-turn (Rafe’s dusty circle) are legible; only near-closure Inspector arrival skirts coincidental convenience without breakage.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The forgotten library reads as body-territory: “aisles were lit only by an afternoon shadow caught in glass” constrains the climactic weaponization of that same shadow; micro-objects—tea cups, rice-paper scrolls—are tactile tools whose geometries shape choices. Spatial choreography through backward motion is crisp. Only one hiccup: “elderly hull” is vague; hull implies buoyancy yet the library floats—micro-logic gnat that does not disturb closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stake—library’s pardon from reversible exile—is signaled early and tightens through Harl’s invasive audit; protagonist’s agency bends reflective dusk into a blade that slices seal-letter while sparing flesh; choice forecloses immediate freedom by keeping pact with Rafe—felt cost in perpetual curatorship. Pressure grows via mirrors’ multiplying wounds without redundancy; one meaningful escalation suffices for 600 words.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Thematic resonance emerges from the interplay of memory-scar and mentorship: reflective surfaces carry “capacity to scar” reweighting guilt into responsibility. Final image “sway back without breaking” delivers an oblique, embodied answer resonant through prior motifs of tea-geometry—“mappings of bitterness” become curriculum—avoiding moralizing; ambiguity persists about whose scars will heal.</question>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is crystalline, rhythmic—sentences flex naturally around emotional crests; compression (annotating “questions like braille for inquisitive light”) is taught early, paid off at dusk-blades. Perceptual signature is distinctive and unwavering; only Inspector’s dialogue lacks individuation yet brevity keeps it functional. Free indirect folds interiority without filter clutter; tense and stance immaculate.</question>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Line-level craft is disciplined: each sentence performs double-duty—action and reflection—without scaffold loops. Rhythm breathes under pressure: “mirrors shivered... lightning” quickens beat. Occasional near-abstract moments (“theory across porcelain”) stay legible within luminous pattern. Zero syntactic stumbles or mis-anchored pronouns in final third.</question>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</question>
<comment>Fusion of shard-mirrors, tea-geometry tutoring, and backward locomotion yields a singular concept—memory as pedagogy—transforming familiar tropes into lived process. Risk in lyric density and meta-library never feels ornamental; reversal of sentence (“sway back without breaking”) crystallizes fresh insight. Element interaction is inevitable in hindsight; no cliché survives immersion.</question>
