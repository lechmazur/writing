<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kilor’s contradictory motives (obligation vs self-erasure) manifest through tactile embodiment—salt on his boots, stumbles at first contact, hand offered to coral gate. Sel’s remorse travels skin-to-skin, forcing an active choice keep or release. Final renunciation feels earned: Kilor volunteers as living buffer, visible cost when doors seal and his humming replaces armor-clang. No slip touches closure; flaws intensify choice instead of resolving tidily.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens drives increasing density of grief and brine until Kilor discovers the “hollow foam” able to absorb guilt; closure is Resonant Reconfiguration—Earned Stasis as Kilor accepts eternal silence inside coral, foreclosing his own future to reweight Sel’s choices. Orientation stays spatially anchored (“fortress… banquet hall… court-yard”) and emotionally legible despite lyric jumps.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Coral pavilion as micro-setting directly constrains action—its melt-drop bells and growing rifts pressure the trade with Sel’s soul. Rain-scoured fortress provides contrasting brittle/sturdy frame for final image when walls suddenly “skeletal.” Sensory hierarchy (taste over sight) filters through Kilor’s profession, locking detail to motive.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can Sel offload remorse—tightens because the coral exacts an unpayable toll, forcing Kilor to substitute himself. One deepening turn when attempt to sandpaper fails and “regret remained a feral taste.” Cost visible: Kilor walking into jaws while Sel tastes iron remains on tongue. Agency stays causal under Terraria only; coincidence absent; escalation to cataclysm narrowly averted.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</quote><comment>Theme—memory as inescapable seasoning—emerges through Kilor’s and Sel’s embodied tastes without explicit statement. Coral recharges: once a storage, then demands recompense, making remorse immortal commodity. Dulled metal taste on Sel’s tongue offers quiet, non-moralizing question of whether erasure equals absolution. No decorative motifs; imagery always tied to choice or cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Salt-crusted, tide-flavored diction matches Kilor’s perceptual signature. Compressed phrasing—“grief compressed by centuries of frost, forgotten tide”—accelerates under pressure, then widens in final hummed silence. Experimental elision (no quotation for Sel’s whisper) is pattern-taught early and paid off at closure. Consistent POV clings to Kilor’s tongue and nerve-endings without leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rhythm arcs from prickly sibilants to loog-brine hush; no sentence parallels distract. Figurative language accrues density without loop or mixed metaphor. One micro-stumble—“rainwater hissed… forming minute mirrors”—adds line-level charge instead of overwriting. Clean, specific nouns carry weight; no Anglo-latinate drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Synthesis of memory-tasting chef, thawing coral vessel, and desert fortress delivers fresh alchemical fable. Conceptual risk—remorse is squeezed into architecture—feels inevitable because every object and flavor is strained through Kilor’s profession. Derivative route caps defeated by granular sensory specifics and internalized moral calculus. Final image of humming silence in coral feels both bold and earned.</comment>
