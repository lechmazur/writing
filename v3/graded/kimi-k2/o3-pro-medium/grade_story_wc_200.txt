<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Eluan’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the “modestly fearless” trait is tested when the tooth rattles and he must shift from amusing to guiding. The final renunciation—recorking the clear tooth as reminder—carries felt cost. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible waived. One micro-choice (uncorking the vial) directly alters tactics and forecloses half-measures.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the gorge’s echo changes from cries to chuckling beginnings, cost paid in Eluan’s tears and the tooth’s transparency. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of confessions absorbed, cadence shift from distorted chords to resonant twang. Orientation anchored by line 3. No causality breaks; every beat advances texture or stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Echo Gorge, the harp, and the crocodile tooth all constrain choices: the gorge walls bend sound, the harp’s slack strings demand Eluan’s specific progression, the tooth’s glow forms the lattice. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (“pallid rose,” “low smile of a chord”). Final image of sandstone chuckling recharges the setting with new meaning.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—freeing unattended spirits—signaled early. Escalation is textural: each confession absorbed brightens the tooth and tightens the lattice until the final release. Cost is visible in Eluan’s tears and the tooth’s transformation. No coincidence; every intensification arises from Eluan’s agency with the harp.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of laughter as healing emerges through concrete particulars: unfinished punchlines, rehearsed joy. Final image of gorge “humming with beginnings” offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. Subtext in spectral whispers and Eluan’s self-deprecating quip deepens complexity. No thematic drift or overt thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; perceptual signature distinct (“distorted notes arrived sideways”). Syntax modulates with emotional rise—short clauses under pressure, longer cadences in reflection. No head-hopping; POV remains tightly bound to Eluan. Patterned elision (e.g., “ancient mud-dreams”) is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent (“lattice of humming paths”). No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Rhythm breathes with scene needs—acceleration during lattice walk, quiet closure in final line.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—“lost soul collector” using laughter via misaligned harp—is fresh synthesis of mythic and comic. Transformation test: story collapses without crocodile tooth and harp mechanics. Specificity of “crocodile’s tooth from ancient mud-dreams” anchors originality. Risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring closure.</comment>
