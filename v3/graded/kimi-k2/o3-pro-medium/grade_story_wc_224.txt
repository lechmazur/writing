<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“ground glass behind the eyes”), but the arc from buried talents to active seeding is compressed; the shift feels more asserted than earned, keeping the score just below the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly with a Resonant Reconfiguration: the protagonist redefines home as a portable direction. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens; the mountain’s nightly reorganization tightens stakes and the final word seeds the new reality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The mountain-bookstore is tactile and constraining—shelves that breathe, volcanic-glass table, obsidian-lotus stairs—each detail pressures choice. The lost language stone and map-feather function as micro-settings that charge the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“understand the shape of home”—is signaled early and escalates when the nightly shuffle threatens permanent entrapment. The seeding act narrows options and carries visible cost (risk of being sealed inside).</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: home is not a place but a direction one carries. The final syllable reweights prior motifs without moralizing, achieving a quiet Conceptual Repricing that lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise; perceptual signature is consistent (“phosphorescent margins,” “quiet thunder”). Compression and patterned elision are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied rhythm and zero scaffold loops. Occasional elevated diction (“sigils half swallowed by erosion”) stays within the narrator’s lexicon and heightens atmosphere.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The mountain-bookstore as living heart, nightly reality substitution, and the lost language stone form a fresh synthesis. Risk-taking (lyric architecture, non-literal closure) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
