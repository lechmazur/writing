<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Roan’s interior contradiction—inspecting shelters while fearing to live—drives every beat; the embodied shame when he confesses “I inspect shelters because I fear living” crystallizes the arc with visible cost. Micro-choices (kneeling, cradling the shell, tracing words on pearl) reveal hierarchy of values. Only minor slip: the fiancée flashback is summary rather than embodied memory.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Roan’s stance shifts from detached auditor to bearer of collective hopes, cost paid by the confession etched into pearl. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each shell, glow, and confession layers density until the final color chorus reweights the premise. No causality breaks; the hatch opening is earned by the crowning act.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Crystal caves constrain movement and supply the resonant architecture that enables the crowning ritual; the pearl’s mirrored surface literally charges the final image. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered (“torch revealed corridors tiled with quartz”). Only the ferry ride lacks tactile specificity, a hairline slip.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—dissolving internal walls via external ritual—is signaled early and tightens when Roan must choose to add his own confession. The cost is visceral: tears and the irreversible inscription. Agency drives escalation; coincidence never rescues.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of shared vulnerability emerges organically from the spiral of confessions and the final color chorus; no moralizing. The pearl’s glow reweights every prior bunker image into a metaphor for sealed hearts now opened. Subtext in the shell’s “abandoned hopes” lingers without tidy resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is distinct—measured, melancholic, precise (“resonant hush of fog,” “latent radiance”). Perceptual signature filters every detail through Roan’s professional gaze turned inward. No head-hopping; compression and elision are taught early and paid off in the final cadence shift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is lean yet lyrical; each sentence advances story or atmosphere. No loops or scaffold. Metaphors are controlled and purposeful (“cathedral of crystals”). Minor register lift in “conceptual repricing” moment is earned by context.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise fuses bunker-inspection satire with mystical confession ritual; the transformation feels inevitable. Specificity of etched microgrooves and pearl-crowning ritual is non-obvious yet grounded. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
