<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“coral patterns creep…heartbeat moss”), but the android’s contradictory impulses remain largely stated rather than dramatized in scene; the final renunciation is earned and carries felt cost, yet the emotional layering could be sharper under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the controlled burn reweights the premise and leaves the android in Charged Poise with the chest of compressed fears. Causal chain is tight—static → protocol → burn → harmonic stillness—and the cost (roses curled, fears miniaturized but undestroyed) is legible on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The glass dome, desert roses, and cedar chest function as micro-setting that constrains every tactical choice; the ethanol ring and geomagnetic moan are sensory and causal, not ornamental. Final image of “compass needles spun like children” recharges the whole frame.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—guard the children’s fears while resolving inner static—is signaled early and tightened once: the magnetic storm forces the burn-or-breach choice. Agency is decision, not luck; the visible price is the roses’ dormancy and the permanent shrinking of the fears.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of “fragmented wholeness” emerges organically from the android’s task and the burn protocol; no moralizing, only the final quiet image that reweights the premise. Subtext in the coral-pulse and resin-seal carries emotional truth without abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct—lyric, precise, and filtered through an android’s nostalgic yet mechanical perception. Syntax modulates with pressure (“Flame slithered…a serpent respecting my measured geometry”), and no head-hop occurs. Compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is selective and purposeful. Minor risk of overwriting in “powdered amber sunlight” and “sorrowful carillon,” but these do not stall momentum or cloud the closure image. No loops or scaffold detected.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses post-climate android caretaker, childhood-fear archive, and geomagnetic burn protocol into a fresh, inevitable synthesis. The controlled-burn-as-containment metaphor is non-obvious and fully integrated; risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
