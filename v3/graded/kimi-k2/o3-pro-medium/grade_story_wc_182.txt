<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Ora’s contradictory impulses—scholarly detachment vs. rescue reflex—surface in micro-choices (cataloging vs. saving philosophers). The diary’s glow anchors her shifting priorities, but Marrow’s paradoxical guilt feels sketched rather than embodied. Closure cost is legible: the pollen memory is irretrievably spent.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the pollen memory rewrites the register’s ledger and vault access, reweighting the premise of debt. Causal chain (diary → pollen → vault) holds; orientation is clear by line 4. One minor drift: Marrow’s earlier barter is reported, not dramatized.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The mountain-bookstore’s shifting shelves physically constrain movement and force rescues; the diary’s luminescence acts as micro-setting that guides corridor choice. Sensory selection (unheard symphony, bronze vowels) is POV-filtered and purposeful. Final image—the vault yawning—recharges the stone-as-text motif.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake (reach the forbidden library) tightens when the register demands payment; Ora’s pollen sacrifice forecloses future germination knowledge. Escalation is driven by her agency under causal lens; cost is visible in the diary’s blank leaf. Pressure plateaus slightly during rescue detours.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of negotiated debt and inherited consequence emerges from the register transaction and pollen memory, never stated. Subtext lives in the unheard symphony’s shift from warning to forgiveness. Final reconfiguration of “library of unlearned lessons” reframes avoidance as its own cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Voice is textured, syntactically agile, and POV-anchored: “extinct tenses,” “ciphered etymologies of flowers.” Compression (“chapters of stone”) is taught early and paid off. No head-hopping; Marrow’s speech remains distinct from Ora’s interior diction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; metaphors (“shelves bend into a stretcher”) are precise. Occasional elevated diction (“prospective paradoxes”) risks register drift but stays within Ora’s linguist frame. No loops or scaffold; final line crystallizes without clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of Borgesian library, time-debt, and botanical memory; the pollen-as-payment twist feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risky structure (rescue detours inside escalating quest) heightens stakes without breaking causality. Specificity of extinct-tense lullabies anchors the fantastical.</comment>
