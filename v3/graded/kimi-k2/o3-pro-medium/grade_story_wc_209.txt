<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maris’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses—artistic ambition vs. filial debt—drive every beat. The final choice to paint the phosphorescent mural is earned by the cathedral revelation and carries visible cost (fading dawn). Minor slip: “quietly driven” is asserted more than dramatized until the mural scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the mural’s night-bloom answers the grandfather’s riddle and reweights the stake from private quest to communal communion. Causal chain—postcards → cipher → mural—holds without gaps. Cost is legible in the mural’s inevitable fade at dawn.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is selective and sensorily rich; the cathedral’s prismatic chamber and the river bricks constrain choices and charge the final image. Early amber pavilion anchors season and mood. Micro-setting (etched glass) functions as both tool and revelation engine.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—solve the riddle before last snow melts—is signaled early and tightened by the cathedral deadline. One meaningful deepening: decoding the glass redefines the mural’s purpose. Cost is felt in the ephemeral mural and the grandfather’s uncompleted quest.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: night-bloom as communion, not secrecy. Final image reweights prior motifs without moralizing. Subtext in Brother Ellion’s silence and the “umbral tenderness” deepens resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; perceptual signature filters every detail through Maris’s chromatic lens. Syntax modulates with emotional rise. No head-hopping; POV remains stable and intimate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is purposeful and patterned. No loops or scaffold. Minor register drift in “botanical instructions” line, but clarity intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise synthesizes familiar quest with fresh botanical-moonlight science; transformation test passes. Risky lyric compression pays off in the final mural’s silence. No derivative echoes.</comment>
