<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Interiority is precise and specific to Kalen’s longing and regret; the embodied tension when he first plays the flute crystallizes his contradictory impulses. Motivation root-to-ending linkage is clean, and his final modulation feels earned by accumulated beat-to-beat pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Causality holds under a Causal-Accumulative hybrid lens: driftwood → seam → corridor → reconciliation because of rhythm choice. Closure lands directly as a seam seal that reconfigures options with visible breath-cost to the protagonist.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Thunder-Echo Range acts as instrument and witness; the echo chamber architecture dictates where the flute must be played and narrows literal location. Obsidian reprise charges the ending image, meeting the encumbrance requirement for 9-band eligibility.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—redeeming guardianship by facing failure—is signaled early and escalates through literal world-tearing pressure and self-reconciliation with visible cost in the corridor vision. No easy resolution; choices foreclose options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from particulars: failure as loom, self-theft, and self-forgiveness refracted through shifting mirrors. Final image intuitively resonates without tidy moral; the crater silence is a non-literal reconfiguration of cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is textured, compressed under pressure, with lyric pattern taught early (driftwood musical stave) and paid off in closure. No POV drift; syntax and rhythm dovetail with emotional crescendo.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Clean compression, zero loops, high sensory stakes: “molten wheat” before twilight and avalanche hush are vivid without purple overlay. Read-aloud ear shows purposeful variation and kinetic momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The self-shadow theft innovatively repurposes a familiar trauma; quiet corridor revelation and obsidian reprise feel fresh, inevitable under mirrored pressure. Transformation test passes—removing corridor would collapse the entire closure architecture.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Kalen’s shifting choices in corridor, flute modulation, and acceptance re-wire the entire arc; observation devoid of decision moments is never present.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Flute appears in setup, corridor key-beat, and final beat that seals the seam; its gilded reeds re-charge the ending image.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>World-weave actively constrains tactics: the corridor offers branching visions that foreclose a path and reset reality.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>“Avalanchingly quiet” charge—note calm acting as pressure amplifier in the corridor silence, forcing choice.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Uncasing the flute directly triggers the seam and final confrontation; not swappable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Driftwood arrows actively pin the corridor open; each branch directional signal matters to rhythm and closing stitch.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Range supplies the echo chamber constraint and thunder resonance that dictate playful time-lens locale; obsidian payoff in closing stitch.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dusk closure anchors a ticking musical cadence; flute tempo modulates choices under diminishing light.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Harvesting failure is dramatized via corridor self-steal and decision to forgive future-Kalen; friction between obsession and guilt is visceral.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Canyon hush escalates from drum-felt sensuality to enveloping silence that charges the resonant final image; modulation with emotional intensity is spot-on.</comment>
