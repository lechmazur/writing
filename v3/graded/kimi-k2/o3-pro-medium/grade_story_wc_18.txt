<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Haleh’s interiority is vivid—her breathing syncs with the orchard, her fractured sextant hums like “an unfinished mouth”—but the dream remains an external quarry rather than a contradictory impulse inside her; the final fusion is earned yet the cost is more atmospheric than personal.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the resealed sextant and crystallized fog reweight possibility itself. Causality is Accumulative/Textural—each breath-layer thickens until the orchard glassifies. Orientation is immediate; no drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The ruined orchard breathes with Haleh, its glass-bell wind and frost-scarred trunks constraining every inhalation; the fog crystallizing into “glittering panes” directly shapes the final image and her exit.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—capture the runaway dream—is signaled early and tightened through each mirrored flash of lost blossom; the final crystallization forecloses escape and exacts the cost of perpetual permeability between past and present.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of boundary dissolution emerges from concrete acts—mirrors, breathing, refreezing cracks—culminating in a non-moral image of “pathways among those glass mountains”; ambiguity lingers without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise—“the valley were filled with fragile bells”—with rhythmic compression that teaches its pattern early and pays off in the final crystalline cadence; no head-hopping, no filter clutter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and motion without loops. Metaphors stay coherent—“torn wallpaper” fog, “apple seed” perspective—and the final image crystallizes without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fusing mirror-making, broken celestial instruments, and orchard necromancy feels inevitable and fresh; the sextant repurposed to measure “possibilities” rather than stars is a specific, non-obvious synthesis.</comment>
