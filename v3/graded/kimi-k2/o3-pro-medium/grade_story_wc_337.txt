<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Neris’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her tactile handling of mask shards and the net anchors her contradictory impulses. The final bow and heartbeat-applause crystallize her renunciation with visible cost. Minor drift: the actor-spirit’s hunger is summarized rather than dramatized in-scene, blunting the relational crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the mask becomes a vessel, the hush turns lullaby, equilibrium is re-earned. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each knot’s loosening layers density until the final image reweights silence. Cost is legible in the needle’s glow and the net’s sighing stars.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The prism sanctuary, tapestry needle, and fisher-net function as micro-settings that constrain tactics; the net’s salt-smell and star-bleached loops charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; only the “glass moons” remain ornamental rather than choice-shaping.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—ground the roaming spirit—tightens through each unraveled knot; agency is Neris’s ritual labor. One deepening: realizing the spirit is an actor, not fisherman, reframes the debt. Cost is the sanctuary’s held breath and the net’s spent memory.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of recognition versus appropriation emerges organically from the actor’s stolen applause and the fishermen’s reclaimed ovation. Final image of “sand building an island” reweights silence without moralizing. Subtext in the needle’s seawater light and the net’s sigh carries the emotional aftereffect.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; perceptual signature filters every detail through Neris’s restorer-sight. Rhythm modulates with ritual tension; no head-hop. Occasional elevated diction (“interlaced hush”) is earned by pattern consistency.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers sensory and symbolic work. No loops or scaffold. Metaphors stay coherent—“stars bled into the twine” sustains maritime logic. Only minor register drift in “conceptual repricing” phrasing.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: mask-repair as séance for stolen applause, lighthouse-iron needle threading starlight. Risky lyric accumulation pays off in the final woven lullaby. Transformation test passes—plot collapses if any element is swapped.</comment>
