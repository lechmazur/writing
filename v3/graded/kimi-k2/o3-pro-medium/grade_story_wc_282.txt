<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ruen’s interior contradiction—Ministry duty vs. private vocation—drives every micro-choice; the fossil as anchor and the final renunciation of return crystallize a felt cost. Embodied emotion (brine on tongue, visor hues) stays specific, though “be the hinge that sings” flirts with label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer thickens until the blank wall demands inscription. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Ruen seals the corridor, accepting irreversible exile as cost. Orientation is immediate; no causal leaps.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cave humidity, floating water, and fossil glow are not backdrop but instruments that constrain movement and translate emotion into grammar. The obsidian corridor’s blank wall reweights all prior strata, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—becoming the voice of the unknown—tightens when the fissure exhales a new emotion without precedent. Agency: Ruen renounces extraction, sealing the passage; cost is permanent solitude. One clear escalation suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of future-as-unknown emerges through the fossil’s translation work and the corridor’s blank wall; no moralizing. Final image of “words already breathing like surf” reweights prior mapping labor into legacy without statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise: “salt fog curled,” “blushes of ember and violet,” syntax mirroring tidal rhythm. Compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure. No POV drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; each sentence layers sensory data or stakes. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing” risk) stays within Ruen’s professional lexicon. No loops or mixed metaphors in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: dream cartography, hibernating humanity, and fossil linguistics braided into a single mythic arc. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes without obscuring closure; transformation feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
