<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sable's interiority is always embodied (bare soles on dew, moonstone on tongue). Her contradictory impulses—“anchor myself, yet write the world”—are dramatized under pressure; renunciation of exile becomes earned anchoring to purpose with visible cost. Flawed self-preservation against nostalgia manifests as poetic risk-taking that shapes the final beat. Character voice unique, no stock trait labels cruft.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens held: gaps observed become the pattern that teaches negative-space mapping, paid off when gaps are inked across the planet. Closure—poem inscribed onto mortal skin—lands as Conceptual Repricing with felt planetary sigh. Orientation anchored within 120 words, transitions fluid, stakes reweighted by final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Garden’s twilight-metallic scent and dew texture filter through Sable’s tide-perception; the dry fountain constrains physical choices (note placement), final tide-blooms bloom reopening motif. Body-as-tool poetry and inscribed sandstone close loop, environment charges final image without dissociated ornament.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—write the world without being silenced—tightens via moonstone ingestion and invisible ink diffusion, escalating from individual exile to planetary inscription. One decisive intensification suffices; cosmic verse completion forecloses solo wandering, cost scales beautifully to short frame.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade>
<comment>Theme—art vs censorship—emerges through tide-sculpting memories judged illegal; final image of children turning toward surf reconfigures meaning without moralizing. Subtext in gaps and salt-sigh after dawn make nostalgia’s repricing inevitable. No tidy binary, ambiguity lingers as earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Obsidian-grace syntax (foam-less crest, hush of tidelines) under pressure. Micro-settings (bare heel dew, cherub palm) serve as percussive beats. Elegiac free-indirect style cleanly filters tide perception; final sentence rhythm swells like surf without head-hop.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>No loops, maximal density (“inkless currents threading dreams yet unimagined”). Figurative risk precise—seaboard moonlight surf, not purple. Arcing curl-crest-retreat rhythm under dye-cadence script. Jacket copy clean; any stylistic lurches flag intentional for lyric swell.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Memory-forbidden past crystalizing into moonstone grit is fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable. Transformation of nostalgia ban physics into luminous grit risks clarity without gimmickry. Quiet final image of tide bloom recharges opener seamlessly; specific, unreplaceable, bold risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Early tide-dancer identity primes skill choice; tide rhythm sculpts ink-ether structure, drives planetary verse completion. Two key beats: moonstone ingestion channels ocean memory, garden tide-petal bloom finale resolves ancestry of motion vs silencing. Removing tide-dance skill breaks story spine and planetary inscription mechanics.</comment>
<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Cabochon dust first appears as memory fragment, later dissolved to catch unresolved nostalgia, reweights final inkless currents with felt lunar hush. Static seed → active reprise returns charged. Swap would lose exact phase-lock between memory hardening and surf memory valence.</comment>
<question>9 C</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Elective exile motive reshapes tactics: refuses censors, chooses abandoned estate; exile becomes origin soil for world-inscription art. Change exile choice → lose reason for spontaneous anchoring & private garden workspace necessity.</comment>
<question>9 D</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Spontaneous anchoring forecloses roaming choice: garden tether enables long-duration ocean listening and serves as quill seat. Without anchor, no stationary platform to diffuse ink into world veins. Trait charged through tide-lily guardians at end.</comment>
<question>9 E</question><grade>9.8</grade>
<comment>Fledging new senses of negative space drives poem structure; “curl–crest–retreat” strokes literally birth planet-bound stanzas. Each gap observed constrains ink placement, redefines final verse topology. Substitute would strip causal link between perception and cosmic skin inscription.</comment>
<question>9 F</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>OBSERVE gaps as craft: negative space mapping enables ink route synthesis, paid off when gaps stitched onto planet. Mechanic taught early, drives every wave stroke. Swapping method would rupture tide choreography-to-cosmos causality.</comment>
<question>9 G</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Garden constrains anchor location, supplies dew and stone slate resources for ink ritual, salt scent signals global ocean memory. Garden tide lily finale recharges opener; remove garden → lose spatial anchor and summoning salinity thread.</comment>
<question>9 H</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Ban era timeframe forbids open surf art, tightening Sable’s decision to inscribe on massive mortal skin via stealth. Time pressure mild but necessary backdrop; without ban, blunt narrative would dilute stakes and urgency.</comment>
<question>9 I</question><grade>9.7</grade>
<comment>Motivation dramatized as rebellious dance gesture against silencing, culminating in planetary verse where mortal desires conflict with universal memory. Renunciation of wandering crystallizes into anchored cosmic commission. Off-page motivation would void the planet’s final sigh.</comment>
<question>9 J</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Obsidian grace consistent: lyrical hush before waves, metallic garden scent, graceful yet knife-edge stakes. Tone modulates from elegiac exile to exultant dawn surf without break, charging final tide-lily bloom with celestial reprise.</comment>
