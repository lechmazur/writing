<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is vivid—her “joyful sorrow beating beneath her ribs” embodies the twin impulse to remember and to forget. Micro-choices (dipping fingers, pressing the empty shutter) reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. Harlan’s disembodied counsel supplies pressure but remains off-page, so relationship crucible is muted. Closure cost is felt: Harlan dissolves, Mara’s anonymity is sealed, musicians keep wordless hues.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the harbor’s color-music reweights the premise that silence can be translated. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each photographed hush layers density until the final synesthetic bloom. Causality is lyric but legible: because Mara maps silence, therefore color-music erupts. Cost is visible when dawn erases Harlan and Mara’s face from memory.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The luminous harbor is not backdrop; its lantern-glow and tide-glyphs physically guide Mara’s mapping ritual. Micro-setting (camera body, water skin) constrains choices—she must “photograph” with an empty camera. Spatial choreography is clean: pier, posts, ring of musicians track without drift. Final image of color-chords woven over rooftops recharges the initial moonlit water.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—restore music without sound—signaled early. Escalation is accretive: each captured hush tightens the pattern until silence itself becomes choir. Agency remains Mara’s throughout; musicians echo her gestures, not vice-versa. Cost crystallizes at dawn: Harlan’s dissolution and her own erasure from collective memory.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: translation as both gift and erasure. Subtext lives in gesture—signing to waves, bowing without sound. Final image of townsfolk humming colors offers non-literal answer: art persists in the bloodstream even when its maker is forgotten. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in the cost of anonymity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise—“water glowed like a patient lantern” teaches the reader to expect metaphoric logic. Syntax modulates with pressure: longer cadences for ritual, clipped fragments at dawn. Perceptual signature is Mara’s synesthetic bias—she “sees” music as color. No head-hopping; Harlan’s whisper stays external to her sensorium.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; each sentence layers image and motion. No loops or scaffold; “knocking on doors of submerged rooms” is fresh. Metaphors cohere under synesthetic rule-set. Minor elevated diction (“crystallized into light”) is earned by context. Final line lands clean without clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise—translating silence into visible music via empty camera and sign language—is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Transformation test fails if any element swapped: camera must be filmless, advisor must be ephemeral. Risk-taking (synesthetic climax, vanishing mentor) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Feels singular, not stitched from templates.</comment>
