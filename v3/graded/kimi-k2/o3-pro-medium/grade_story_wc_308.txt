<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ithar’s interiority is embodied and specific—tasting flint, aligning heartbeat with stone—yet the contradiction between seeking power and renouncing rule is only asserted, not dramatized in scene. The final renunciation (etching the arrowhead for others) is foreshadowed but lacks a felt cost on the page; it reads as generous rather than sacrificial. Still, the character’s perceptual signature is vivid and consistent, and micro-choices under pressure (planting the arrowhead, humming the dead) reveal hierarchy of values.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the canyon’s map unfurls inside Ithar, reweighting the premise that space can be turned without motion. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each echo, bird wheel, and dust spiral layers density until the final crystallization. Cost is legible in the arrowhead planted as anchor and the vow to share rather than wield power. Orientation is anchored early; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The canyon’s towers of bone, wind-scripted dust, and spiraling birds are not backdrop but active agents: they test devotion, map hollows, and seal the pact. The arrowhead itself becomes micro-setting when planted, constraining the wandering pulse. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered; every detail either guides choice or charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—mastering motionless navigation—is signaled early and tightened through each echo and bird wheel. The deepening occurs when Ithar realizes the world must move instead of him, a shift that narrows options and demands balance. Cost is visible in the arrowhead’s sacrifice and the vow of restraint. Escalation is coherent under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: power gained through stillness must be relinquished to remain ethical. The canyon’s layered memory and the arrowhead’s future journey reweight the premise without moralizing. Final image—birds forming a crown above the planted flint—offers resonant, non-literal answer to the paradox of movement.</comment>

<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with rhythmic control that mirrors wind and pulse. Perceptual signature is distinct: Ithar hears “every era’s breath layered inside the stone.” No head-hopping; compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure. Syntax modulates with emotional intensity without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. Figurative language is selective and purposeful—“dust vines twisted behind them, sketching footprints where none existed.” No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; paragraph cuts are purposeful.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The premise—navigating without moving by persuading the world to move—feels fresh and is pursued to conceptual limits. Transformation test: the story would collapse if the canyon, birds, or arrowhead were swapped for generic equivalents. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry; closure remains legible and earned.</comment>
