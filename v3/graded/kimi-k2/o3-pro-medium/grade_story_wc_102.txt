<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lysander’s longing and spiritual curiosity are embodied in concrete micro-choices—mounting the bead, pacing breath, leaving the tear—each with visible cost. The past-life memory is anchored to present action rather than summary, and the final renunciation feels earned. Interiority avoids label-speak; ache is shown through inverted rivers and sparks. One slip: “spiritually curious heart” edges toward diagnostic shorthand, but the surrounding texture compensates.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the vault is redefined as a field to be seeded, not entered, and the cost is the relinquished bead and the dissolved pilgrim identity. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each breath thickens pattern until the final cadence shift releases light into dusk. No orientation drift; who/where/when are anchored by wisteria, arches, cedar box within 120 words. Causality intact: because he breathes, the arches brighten; therefore he leaves the tear.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The viaduct’s stone ribs and drifting petals are not backdrop but active constraint—brightness blooms only as Lysander exhales, making the setting a participant. Micro-setting (the bead, the tent’s dark screen) functions as extension of body and choice. Sensory hierarchy favors the visual but is filtered through camera-artist bias. Final image of arches as “open arms” reweights the initial bone metaphor, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—locate and liberate unused love—is signaled early and tightened through each breath cycle until the realization that storage is external, not internal. Escalation is Accumulative: density of sparks and brightness increases until the field is revealed. Cost is visible: the bead is left, the pilgrim identity dissolved. No coincidence resolves; pressure is coherent under chosen lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: unsent poems, unheld hands, sparks settling among wisteria. The final image—lanterns of his own making—offers a non-literal answer to where unused love goes without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture (leaving the bead) and silence. No thematic echo in final paragraph; resonance is earned through image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct: lyrical compression, camera-artist perceptual bias, controlled rhythmic modulation under pressure. Patterned elision (“rivers flowing upward, blossoms closing into buds”) is taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; psychic distance stays tight. Diction remains within plausible lexicon of a lens-stained pilgrim.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet clear; each sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative language is selective and purposeful—no purple drift. Minor loop risk in “breathed…breathing” but offset by rhythmic necessity. No artifacts in closure beat; final line lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—photographing the storage place of unused love via camera obscura and breath—is non-obvious and fully committed to. Past-life monk reincarnation could feel gimmicky but is grounded in specific calligrapher detail and bamboo tubes. Risky lyric structure pays off in resonant closure. Transformation test: story collapses without bead, breath method, and inverted vision.</comment>
