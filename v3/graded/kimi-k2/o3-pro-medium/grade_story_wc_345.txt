<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Serafin’s altruism is dramatized through chalked tactics and sleepless vigil, but the narrator’s interiority drifts toward summary (“I feared…”) rather than embodied contradiction at the crucial second bell-ring; still, the earned hush and fused stone show a visible cost that forecloses isolation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the silver mist fuses fractures while the planet “bruised yet blooming” crystallizes the new communal stance. Causal chain holds—bell summons → repairs → mist seals—under a Causal lens, with the persistent cost of permanent vigilance implied by Serafin’s “lantern refusing extinction.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Floating rock arches and pear-glow are never backdrop; they crack, bleed, and are stitched by vines and magnetite, directly constraining every tactic. The orchard planet’s gravity “ancient moods” becomes the rule-set that the final silver mist renegotiates, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—planet’s survival—tightens when arches crack and the nebula threatens. One decisive escalation: second bell-ring transforms command into promise, narrowing options to trust communal bond. Cost is the irreversible vigilance and the bruise the planet now carries.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of chosen kinship emerges from chalked sidewalks and shared hammer beats, never sermonized. Final image of “bruised yet blooming” quietly reweights the premise: salvation leaves scars, family is forged labor. No thematic echo in final paragraph; resonance is purely imagistic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical, cedar-scented diction stays rooted in the narrator’s perceptual bias; patterned elision (“sunlight fully hatched”) is taught early and paid off. No head-hopping; ghost’s chalked voice is cleanly externalized, maintaining POV modesty.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive—“sound like thousands of overlapping butterfly wings”—with zero loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated phrasing (“nebula of respite”) is voice-consistent; no mixed metaphors or register drift in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Altruistic ghost + floating orchard + communal bell-ringing synthesizes into a fresh mythic ecology. The transformation of chalked dawn messages into heartbeat vibrations beneath boots feels inevitable yet non-obvious, heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
