<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses (grief vs duty, solitude vs outreach) act simultaneously in scene. The micro-choice to broadcast the warning crystallizes her arc and carries visible cost—she relinquishes private mourning for communal risk. Mentor backstory is anchored to present action via the telegram cue and alters her tactics. Only a slight over-articulation of “heal with words” keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the communal broadcast reweights isolation into shared witness, cost paid in irrevocable exposure. Causal lens holds—every beat because/therefore linked from telegram to star-alignment to transmission. Orientation is swift; no lens ambiguity. One hairline slip: the phrase “when understanding dawns” edges toward meta-commentary.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The observatory is no backdrop; the dome slit, red chart lamps, and phosphor screen constrain bodily movement and frame the decisive alignment. Sensory hierarchy reflects Mira’s professional priorities—starlight before perfume. Final image of “spoken light” recharges the setting’s tools as instruments of communal healing. Slight excess of lyrical sky description in paragraph one nudges it down.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—decode before misuse—is signaled early and tightened when the star-pulse forces a public broadcast, foreclosing secrecy. Escalation is causal: each observation narrows options until the only path is shared disclosure. Cost is palpable—loss of private grief and exposure to rumor-oracles. No coincidence resolves; pressure is coherent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of shared burdens emerges from concrete actions—ledger, broadcast, replies—not assertion. The final reweighting of “burdens feather-soft” offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. Subtext in the telegram’s fragrance and the star’s Morse-like pulse deepens meaning. No thematic drift; complexity preserved.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct—astronomer’s precision braided with dream-chronicler lyricism. Syntax modulates with pressure: long cadences for grief, clipped coordinates under urgency. No head-hopping; perceptual signature consistent. Minor filter-verb cluster (“she understood then that…”) is brief and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet clear; figurative language serves pattern—star-pulse as Morse, telegram as sunset-trap. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances. Rhythm breathes with scene needs. One mixed metaphor (“silver that felt like private sanctuary”) is minor and early.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fusion of lucid-dream chronicler with stellar cartography feels inevitable and fresh. The telegram-daylily reprises as both memory and catalyst without gimmickry. Risky lyric compression pays off in the final image. No derivative echoes; synthesis is specific and memorable.</comment>
