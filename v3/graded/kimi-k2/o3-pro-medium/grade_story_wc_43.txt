<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is embodied and specific—her palm memory of the shard, her decisive kindness—but the estranged son Mateo remains a silhouette; his reconciliation is off-stage, so relationship pressure is inferred rather than dramatized. Hector’s motivation is clear and intensifies to the final request, yet the cost is felt more by Mateo than by Mara, slightly diluting her arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the looping mundane hymn reweights the father-son stalemate with audible cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each layered sound tightens the emotional density until the final image of “slow applause” clouds crystallizes the new stance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The hovering hospice, vapor roses, and moonlit milk-sea are vivid and selective; the broken vinyl shard functions as micro-setting that constrains Mara’s method and charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Hector’s flawless goodbye—tightens once when the shard becomes the medium for reconciliation; the cost is Mateo’s cracked posture and tears. Pressure deepens rather than reverses, sufficient for the length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory-as-music emerges organically from the bolero fragment and the mundane hymn; the final image of lightning-scented hope offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. Subtext in gesture—Mateo’s trembling palms—carries more weight than dialogue.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Distinct lyric texture: “vapor roses exhaled the scent of hope,” “anchored ship in milk.” POV remains tightly anchored to Mara; no head-hop. Compression and elision are purposeful and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet clear; figurative language is patterned early and justified. Minor scaffold in “pulsing stillness” repetition, but it serves cadence. No mixed metaphors or register drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Familiar hospice setting is refreshed by cloud-level anchorage and music-therapy alchemy; the shard-as-instrument feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk in lyric mode pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
