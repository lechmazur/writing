<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Jarom’s synesthetic trait is woven consistently through choices; the interiority drives micro-decisions under water-pressure. The forfeiture of chromatic hearing functions as earned cost tied to design ambition. Micro-choice at the forge – clutching the silver coil while color drains – crystallizes value hierarchy with visible loss.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens deepens through chromatic density then loss; the final greying of world reweights stakes. Closure lands in the embodied act of humming the betrayal tone as memory-coordinates, paid for by irrecoverable synesthesia. Direction stays legible under lyric escalation without causal leaps.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sunken orchard, pear-lanterns and rust-keel forge are handled bodily (diving bell crawl, coil tucked under suit) and charge the final sensory silence. Objects constrain tactics: the forge accepts only absences, the orchard only memories. Setting coheres as pressure vessel, not postcard.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—design a betrayal-warning—tightens via growing chromatic loss. The decisive tightening is the conscious trade of color-hearing for the precise shatter-note: a visible foreclosing of one option to gain another.</comment>

<comment>Absent sound becomes engine of grace: absence-as-warning is the thematic reweighting, legible without moralizing. The motif remains specific to devices and betrayal physics rather than generic trust lessons.</comment>

<comment>Lyrical compression from “reds hissed like steam” to “gray thuds” patterns teach and payoff closure. POV stays strict; synesthetic vocabulary is character-bound and controlled under pressure.</comment>

<comment>High density figurative bursts stay intentional: aquatic orchard, aurora ribbons, “weeping mouth” violin. No artifact loops; rhythm modulates with descent/ascent breath. Final image “cauterized promise” lands clean.</comment>

<comment>Grafting synesthesia design work onto drowned, memory-fed forge yields non-obvious synthesis. Premise commits fully—betrayal as audible fracture—without gimmickry.</comment>
