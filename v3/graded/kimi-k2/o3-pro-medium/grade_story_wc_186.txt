<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lioh’s longing for lost light and reverence for chance anchor his every micro-choice; the retrocognitive trait forces the shard into his path, yet the internal arc is summary-heavy for its cost—epiphanies arrive in dream-bites rather than embodied struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of star paths and shard memories tightens until the prism’s glow delivers Charged Poise—closure is felt: the world’s “slight tilt” toward the rekindled beam reconfigures meaning with visible cost (the prism cracks further).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Vivid ruin of “ribs of fallen towers,” the tower’s hum, and the shard’s bruising “hush” physically constrain Lioh’s choice (he cups the tremor with bare palms while glass walls sing); the final beacon image recharges the setting’s coastal desolation with mauve and silver.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Single dominant stake: prove coincidences have meaning. Pressure tightens from salvaged lenses to threading slivers into corroded gears—each misstep risks losing “half the resonance”; escalation culminates in irrevocable crack spread and the world’s “lean” toward the beam, cost paid on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: the story equates “errant gestures” with hidden design, resisted moralizing. Subtext is embedded in silence and star-path geometry; final prism cracks-as-windows offer poetic answer without didacticism—though risk of too abstract summary lingers at climax.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Salt-wind, salt-glass prose modulates to lyrical, percussive rhythm— “salt wined / across the ruined coast”—without overwriting. Distinct retrocognitive internal idiom avoids cliché; final cadence “world lean” is earned, not asserted; no register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Line-level craft is near-flawless: vivid verbs, sonic variety, zero loops. One momentary figurative overload (“dawn-colored hum”) slightly thins clarity; otherwise information-dense and breath-perfect.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Collapse-era beacon-keeper searching meaning in cosmic coincidence is well-worn premise, yet prism-as-memory-archive and shard of “hush” offer fresh, specific inflection that feels inevitable by end. Risk does not derail clarity.</comment>
