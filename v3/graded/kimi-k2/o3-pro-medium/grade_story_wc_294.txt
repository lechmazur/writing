<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Eliot’s “quiet eyes” and “polished calm” are embodied through the deliberate ritual of laying out bills; the micro-choice of leaving kyat and krona behind crystallizes his arc. Mira’s exhaustion and soft voice under pressure feel lived-in, and their shared decision to “walk listening” carries visible cost. Interior contradiction is present but lightly sketched; more friction would push this higher. Relationship shift is subtle yet legible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the pair step onto the asphalt neither fleeing nor chasing, having reweighted the LoopPath failure as a living memorial loop. Causal chain—bills as territorial markers → recognition of the union backroad → renunciation of the algorithm—holds cleanly. Orientation is anchored by the rusting circus train within 120 words. One transition (train to service lane) is legible and earned.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The abandoned circus train is tactile: “boxcar doors gaped like spent lions,” wind rattling trapeze chains. Dust-polished mahogany and straw underfoot constrain movement and mood. The kyat and krona left fluttering in the draft charge the final image. Spatial choreography remains coherent; bodies and props track cleanly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—why paths circle back—is signaled early and tightened when the memorial backroad is revealed as the algorithm’s invisible barrier. The tightening is driven by Eliot’s agency: placing bills, recognizing the loop, choosing to walk differently. Cost is felt in the renunciation of the startup’s promise and the open-ended future. One meaningful deepening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: loops of theft, data, and memory are territorial claims that must be respected, not optimized away. Subtext lives in the silence between Mira and Eliot and in the fluttering bills guarding the doorway. The final image of stepping onto the road offers a resonant, non-moral answer. No late thematic exposition intrudes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is textured, rhythmic, and character-specific: “gravel-voiced ballads never mentioned how quiet his eyes were.” Compression like “dust had settled into a polished calm” teaches the pattern early. POV remains single and stable; no head-hopping. Dialogue is sparse but carries subtext: “Data loops are habit loops.”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere simultaneously. Figurative language is selective and purposeful: “spent lions,” “violin softness.” No loops or scaffold detected. Rhythm modulates with pressure—short yips of coyotes, then quiet cadence. Minor elevation in diction stays within Eliot’s reflective lexicon.</comment>

<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of highway-robber legacy, startup collapse, and circus-train liminality feels fresh and inevitable. The territorial-marker ritual reframes both crime and logistics as acts of border-drawing. Specificity—Tanzanian shilingi lion, Icelandic krona—grounds the concept. Risky structure (abandoned circus as memory theatre) pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
