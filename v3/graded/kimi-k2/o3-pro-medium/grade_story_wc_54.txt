<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Milo’s curiosity, embodied in tactile micro-choices (tracing pipes, pocketing the sextant, rotating planters), drives every beat; the internal contradiction between modesty and ambition surfaces in “did not claim victory.” The felt cost—blackened knuckles, letting the stars finish the work—earns the quiet renunciation. A second on-page character is absent, so relationship bullets are waived.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the terminal inhales, pumps cough awake, and Milo records a “humble new equation” whose cost is the relinquishment of spectacle. Causal chain (clog → reroute → resurrect) holds without gaps; the sextant’s final reorientation crystallizes meaning. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Terminal dust, caramel vapor, violet skylight, and the brass sextant glint are filtered through Milo’s engineer gaze; each detail either constrains choice (corroded junction) or charges the final image (lantern light through microdegree marks). The micro-setting of the atrium planters literally steers the redirected flow. No spatial drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can the terminal’s spirit be resurrected via flow?—is signaled early and tightened when Milo forces the atrium doors; the visible price is physical labor and the surrender of personal acclaim. Escalation is single but sufficient under Accumulative/Textural lens: density of sound, humidity, and light reweights the stake.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of hope as engineered flow emerges from concrete action, never sermon; the final equation on a ride voucher reframes prior images without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers—will anything actually grow?—yet the conceptual cost (abandoning grandiosity) is undeniable. No thematic echo in dialogue.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly latched to Milo’s perceptual signature—sugar-water viscosity, microdegree shadows—without head-hop. Syntax mirrors engineer precision: “redirected flows begin their quiet pilgrimage.” Compression and patterned elision (“caramel sigh”) are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet textured; every sentence advances image or stakes. No loops, no mixed metaphors, no register drift. “Lantern light struck the microdegree marks” is both precise and luminous. Minor repetition of “redirected flows” is intentional motif, not artifact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Post-carnival spaceport hydro-resurrection is fresh; the sextant fragment retooled as compass rose is a non-obvious synthesis. Risk lies in quiet lyricism rather than spectacle, and it pays off. No derivative echoes detected.</comment>
