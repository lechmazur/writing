<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Eira’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her contradictory impulses (scientist vs. mystic) play out in real time as she labels clouds, cuts ballast, and finally steps into air. The final renunciation is earned: her belief that memory must be released, not possessed, costs her life and the data itself. One slip: “trembling certainty” edges toward diagnostic label-speak mid-climax.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the sky’s THANK YOU reweights the entire premise, proving empty spaces remember by accepting her sacrifice. Causal chain holds—every beat (string break, ballast drop, tonal transmission) tightens options until only the leap remains. Orientation is immediate; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The gondola’s brass fixtures, telescope, and rushing wind constrain every choice; the final image of clouds spelling THANK YOU charges the setting with conceptual cost. Sensory detail is selective, filtered through Eira’s meteorologist eye. Micro-setting (telescope, ballast bag) functions as setting-objects that alter tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—proving memory inheres in absence—is signaled early and escalates through each labeled cloud and the ballast drop. One decisive tightening: transmitting the notebook as tonal pips forecloses retrieval, making the cost irreversible. Pressure coheres under Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from action: the cost of archiving memory versus releasing it. Subtext in the sky’s final gratitude avoids moralizing. The ending reweights the grandmother’s childhood lesson into cosmic scale without explicit statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is meteorologist-poet: precise yet lyrical (“sorrow condensate,” “forgiveness laminar”). Perceptual signature is consistent—every image filtered through cloud physics and inherited myth. No head-hopping; diction stays within Eira’s lexicon even at altitude.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and propulsive; no loops or scaffold. Metaphors are controlled and purposeful (“brass fixtures glow as if centuries of whispered secrets”). One minor register drift: “conceptual repricing” phrasing in Q2 comment is evaluator language, not text.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of meteorology and mysticism; cloud-labeling as prophecy feels inevitable yet new. Risk-taking (scientist’s suicide as proof) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specificity of lenticular plates and tonal transmission prevents trope recycling.</comment>
