<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is lyrically sketched but remains abstract; her “expectantly resigned” stance is stated rather than embodied in micro-choices. The choir members are sketched as types rather than individuals, so relationships never become a crucible. The final renunciation—leaving the city humming—earns resonance, yet the cost to Mara herself is only implied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the city’s chord persists after Mara departs, reweighting the premise. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of harmony replaces argument—though causality between nightly rehearsals and council surrender is lightly sketched. Orientation is swift and stable; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The velvet library is evoked with sensory precision and functions as acoustic crucible; its “queer acoustics” literally shape the rehearsal tactics. The rosette becomes micro-setting that charges the final image. A few atmospheric phrases edge purple but never stall momentum.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—saving vanishing arts through harmony—is signaled early. Escalation occurs via nightly subtraction of noise, tightening until the council confrontation. Cost is felt in the councilors’ moist eyes and the city’s unfamiliar peace, though Mara’s personal price remains oblique.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: harmony as active subtraction of hatred. Subtext lives in gesture and silence rather than statement. Final image of “stubborn, invisible chord” offers non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical, consistent, and perceptually specific—“dust motes that shone like lanterns.” Compression and patterned elision are taught early and paid off. Dialogue is minimal but carries subtext; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet musical; rhythm modulates with scene pressure. Occasional elevated diction (“denote more than their letters”) fits the choral register. No loops or mixed metaphors; clarity intact at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Premise—choir of exiled debaters taught silence before song—feels fresh and inevitable. Transformation of rosette from mute object to heartbeat is specific and earned. Risk in lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
