<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Gideon’s interior contradiction—shame vs. the need to reach Marina—drives every beat; the compass tremor and ghost-vision crystallize cost. Embodied emotion (shaking hands, uneasy bark) grounds his arc. Final choice to “steer” while surrendering the compass earns renunciation with visible price. Minor: Marina’s off-stage forgiveness slightly softens relational crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Gideon accepts flawed navigation and Marina’s co-steering, foreclosing solo redemption. Causal lens holds: each paddle stroke because of regret, lightning strike therefore forcing apology. Orientation anchored by line 3; no drift. Cost is legible—“quiet currents of power humming above their heads” reweights prior utility-pole motif.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Coastal launch, dripping barnacles, and utility poles are filtered through Gideon’s guilt-tinted perception; poles evolve from mundane beacons to live power lines that spark and constrain. Micro-setting (compass as body-object) charges final image. Sensory hierarchy tightens under storm. No orientation debt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can Gideon cross the bay without compasses or absolution?—tightens when lightning strikes the farthest pole, forcing an apology that narrows options to shared steering. Escalation causal: each paddle because of regret, storm therefore demanding vocalized cost. No coincidence resolves; storm drifts north after his shout.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of navigation-as-redemption emerges from concrete particulars—compass needle pointing down, utility poles conducting literal and moral current. Final image of “quiet currents” reweights premise without moralizing. Subtext in Marina’s lantern and cocoa carries forgiveness without declaration. Avoids tidy moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct lyric-cinematic voice: “barnacles drip silver tears,” “clouds bunched like bruises.” Rhythm modulates with stress—short clauses during lightning, longer cadences in calm. POV remains locked; perceptual signature (navigator’s tool-centric gaze) consistent. No filter-verb clutter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>High density: “plastic hull scraping a chord that sounded like beginning and ending at once” does triple duty. Metaphors precise; no mixed vehicles. Zero loops or scaffold. Final line’s “quiet currents” crystallizes prior imagery cleanly. Occasional elevated diction justified by Gideon’s nautical past.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Familiar redemption arc transformed through nautical specificity and power-line metaphor. Compass that indicts by pointing down feels fresh. Risk taken with storm-as-catalyst lands because causality holds. No derivative phrasing or stock scenes.</comment>
