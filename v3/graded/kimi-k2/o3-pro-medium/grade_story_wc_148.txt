<question>1</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Silas’s motives—driven by shame and the hunger to outwrite ridicule—are cleanly embodied in embodied micro-choices; the interior conflict between inventing truth and discovering it powers the final renunciation without moralising.</comment>

<question>2</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Causal lattice-threading sustains because/therefore flow from theft to confession lattice to labyrinth key. Closure lands on page: Silas’s earned static—choosing truth over escape—repayls ridicule and rescues the missing bodies.</comment>

<question>3</question>
<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Copperlight, salt-pitted iron, birch-tar lattice: micro-setting supplies atmosphere, tactile anchoring, and a recurring charged object that redefines passage shadows in the finale. Limits scope but does its job.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: redeem father’s name and avert warden’s bloodbath. Each beat escalates via lattice use narrowing options; final act crystallises earned static with felt cost when Silas hands over the lattice. Pressure tightens once.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Runs on self-invented redemption vs. inherited shame; avoids grand pronouncements, letting pipe and stone work the theme. Recurring lattice-as-mirror epitomises ambiguity without neat moral resolution—an earned image of hush tucked behind ribs.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Distinct, embodied voice—“salt-ringed like a fading promise”—maintains perceptual signature under pressure. Elision of labyrinth corridors is pattern-taught and crystallised in closure image. No head-hopping or stale confessional cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dense without overflow: salt-coarsened, birch-tar, copperlight images chose specific nouns; no scaffold or loops. Rhythm mirrors rising hush—hover, breathe, flare—then hard landing with grounded “boot heels touched stone; no more hover.”</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Fuses cry-wolf inheritance with Gothic junk motif into fresh synthesis; lattice as portal and penance device transforms folkloric shame into palimpsest of fabricated corridors, then quiet renunciation feels inevitable yet risky.</comment>
