<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Karima’s interiority is vivid—salt bookmarking her coat, gauze-wrapped valve—but her agency is largely observational; the decisive act is the council’s vote, not her own. The contradiction between “reactively visionary” and passive listening is hinted but never dramatized as a cost-bearing choice. Micro-choices (spacing recalls, placing the valve on the sill) are character-specific yet low-stakes. Closure is Earned Stasis, but the cost is collective, not personal.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density of sensory fragments and staggered cadence reweights the stake of collective memory. Closure lands as Charged Poise—the final image of wind threading phantom brass reconfigures the city’s stance toward silence. Orientation is clear by line 4; no causality breaks. One meaningful tightening occurs when the council grants archives, foreclosing exile’s permanence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The ivory harbor is not backdrop but active constraint: mist, gulls, tide-mark room all shape Karima’s method and the final image. Micro-setting (trumpet valve on the sill) charges the closure. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—kelp fires, plum brine—never touristic. Weather and architecture subtly mirror internal hush, guiding choice without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restoring communal memory—is signaled early. Escalation is textural: each recalled fragment tightens the lattice until the council’s vote forecloses exile’s silence. Cost is collective and conceptual rather than personal; a visible price (lost hours) is named but not dramatized for Karima. Agency is diffuse, slightly capping the score.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of absence-as-presence emerges organically from the trumpet valve’s hollow resonance and the staggered recall method. No moralizing; the final image of wind practicing through brass offers a non-literal answer. Subtext operates in silence, gauze, and flickering candles. Complexity is honored—healing is tide-like, not moralized.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is ocean-spray precise: “salt still bookmarking my coat,” “pages too long closed.” Syntax mirrors archivist attention—measured, catalogic. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens under council pressure. Distinct perceptual signature sustained to the final phantom brass thread.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers sensory and conceptual work. No loops or scaffold. Metaphors are controlled—“barnacles dripped silver” is fresh yet exact. Rhythm modulates with emotional beats; final paragraph breathes. Minor elevation in diction stays within Karima’s scholarly lexicon.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Premise—archivist of exile’s silence—is fresh, avoiding post-war clichés. Trumpet valve as hollow conduit for memory is a non-obvious synthesis. Specificity of “plum brine” and “chalk alleyways” grounds universals. Risk in lyric accumulation pays off; no derivative echoes detected.</comment>
