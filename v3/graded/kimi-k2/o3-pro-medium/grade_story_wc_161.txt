<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marietta’s contradictory impulses—fear of betrayal vs. need to trust—are embodied in the micro-choice to release the pigeon; the cost (re-exposure) is felt. Interiority is specific, never generic, and her past exile sharpens present stakes. The final renunciation (burning the papers) seals a path with visible ash. Only the graduate’s trembling plea feels slightly expository, not fully dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: she releases the bird and burns the past, foreclosing retreat. Causal chain holds—meteorite begs safeguarding → dust mapping → flight plan → release—each step narrowing options. Orientation is immediate; no teleporting props. The lens is Causal, and the final image crystallizes cost without exposition.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The attic’s cracked skylight, rafter aerodrome, and velvet stand for the meteorite are not backdrop but tools that constrain tactics and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective—lavender straw, ash like gray snow—and filtered through Marietta’s pigeon-trained eye. Spatial choreography is clean; no floating objects. The setting evolves as diagrams migrate to flame.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can she risk trust again?—is signaled early and tightened when she straps the chip to the bird. One decisive turn: release despite interception risk. Cost is visible in the ash of her rewritten ledgers. Pressure escalates causally; no coincidence resolves it.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of trust as non-ledgerable risk emerges through concrete acts: mapping dust, burning paper, releasing bird. No moralizing; the ash snowfall reweights the motif of “paper trails” into closure. Subtext in the graduate’s cracked shine and the pigeons’ flight pattern carries the emotional aftereffect. Complexity lingers—trust is both bloom and wither.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with rhythmic control—“ash settled like gray snow”—that modulates under pressure. POV stays tight; no head-hop. Diction is character-bound: “perfumed runway,” “runic staves.” Compression is taught early and paid off in the final spiral of papers.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense, propulsive, and loop-free. Metaphors are coherent—“flowers pressed between fading sheets”—and never muddle causality. Sentence variety supports breath and urgency. Only minor scaffold: “bloom and wither” phrase repeats, but it recharges the final image, so forgiven.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Pigeon courier + Mars meteorite + dust musical notation is a fresh synthesis that feels inevitable. The transformation test fails if any element is swapped. Risky lyric structure holds under pressure, and the payoff reconfigures meaning without gimmickry. Specificity—“silver-barred pigeon,” “cathedral dome”—anchors universals.</comment>
