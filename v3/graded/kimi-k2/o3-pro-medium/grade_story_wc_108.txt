<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied; the contradiction between “phobia-ridden” and “studio’s prized” is dramatized in the trembling knees and live-mic confession. The final renunciation—choosing rebirth over scripted death—earns its cost through prior beats of identity fracture and ledger discovery. Micro-choices (climbing down to the child, scanning the cast) reveal value hierarchy under pressure. Only slight over-articulation of “I was nobody and everyone” keeps it from 9+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each beat (ledger discovery → cast decryption → rooftop broadcast) tightens options until the decisive jump. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—live rebirth with felt social cost as crew loyalty flips. Orientation is anchored early; no teleporting props. The engineer’s hidden cables are foreshadowed by the child’s whisper, preserving causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The rusted library roof, corrugated gutters, and glass atrium are tactile and constrain the stunt logistics. The seashell’s spiral and the neon cast function as micro-settings that charge the final image. Sensory selection narrows under crisis—wind rattles gutters, shell hisses—without tourist cataloging. One minor drift: “desert wind” is mentioned once and never felt again.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—survival vs. scripted death—signaled in line 3 and escalates with each revelation. The ledger discovery tightens the noose; the rooftop broadcast forces a public stance with visible reputational cost. Agency drives every turn; coincidence (engineer’s cables) complicates rather than resolves. Cost is legible in the shattered windows and crew mutiny.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of identity-as-construct emerges from the payroll twist and culminates in the “nobody and everyone” confession. Subtext lives in gesture—handing back the cast like a returned sword. Final image of the clinking shell reweights earlier “encouragement” into open-ended warning. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers cleanly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is taut, cinematic, and character-specific: “fear was expensive and courage was cheap” carries studio cynicism. Compression and elision (“I deciphered payroll records”) are taught early and paid off. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens under stress. Occasional elevated diction (“galaxies”) slightly strains POV lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and propulsive; sentences advance plot or atmosphere without loops. Metaphors are precise—“shell catching starlight like a comet tail.” No filter-verb stacks or mixed metaphors in peak beats. Minor scaffold: “I decided the reply would be loud enough for galaxies” edges toward grandiloquence but is earned by context.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Premise of a memory-spliced stunt double facing a monetized death scene feels fresh and specific. The child’s encoded cast and engineer’s cables transform familiar “corporate evil” into lived stakes. Risk-taking—live broadcast rebirth—heightens coherence without gimmickry. Transformation test: story collapses if elements are swapped.</comment>
