<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The summoner’s interiority is concrete and embodied; the act of “pinching the air above the stone” crystallizes motive and cost. Contradictory impulses—duty to silence vs. temptation to speak—coexist in scene. The final renunciation is earned and carries felt cost: he becomes “the quiet cartographer of peace,” a stance that forecloses future speech.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the prophecy is not destroyed but turned inward, sealed in water and folded wings. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of silence increases until the final image reweights meaning. Cost is legible in the summoner’s solitary walk “into the dark stillness that awaited him.” Orientation is anchored early; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The brook, stone path, and paper wings function as micro-setting that constrains every choice: water accepts the ink, stone hides the vowel, wings carry it away. “Terrestrially cosmic shimmer” is not mere backdrop; it pulses in sympathy with the vowel, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; no floating anchors.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—silence must prevail over a syllable that could unmake borders—is signaled early and tightened through each beat. The summoner’s agency drives escalation: folding, releasing, mapping, sealing. The cost is visible in the growing hush and the final solitude. One meaningful deepening suffices; no reversals required.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: silence as active force, not absence. The final image—“a library that had finally lent out its most dangerous book”—reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture and image; no thematic echo in final paragraph. Complexity is honored; no tidy resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet controlled; syntax mirrors the hush: “sanding every edge of noise.” Perceptual signature is consistent—summoner reads gaps “the way sailors read stars.” No head-hopping; POV distance remains stable. Compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and propulsive; each sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. Figurative language is purposeful: “ink lines shimmered inside the paper, forming coordinates that could be read only by mapping silence.” No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Line-level craft supports closure without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of origami, silence-as-weapon, and cosmic shimmer feels fresh yet inevitable. Tropes are transformed: the paper crane is not a wish but a seal. Specificity—“concentric maps nobody had ever walked”—anchors universals. Risk-taking (lyric density, non-causal closure) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
