<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Rua’s interior motive—“to understand why some places resist change”—drives every micro-choice, yet the story leans heavily on poetic affirmation rather than embodied tension, allowing contradictory impulses to remain largely poetic and never dramatized under bodily threat. The final “kiln of moments” is earned, but it feels more revelation than costly decision.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds; closure arrives in the charged stillscape where cups of light are accepted by future bees, reweighting the premise without causal reversal. The Orientation Test is cleanly met, the timeline misfire motif is taught early, and the final image crystallizes stance with felt conceptual cost—the world’s kiln may re-fire the future, at expense of Rua’s own exile.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The abandoned oasis, cracked hives, lantern glass, and kiln bricks all filter Rua’s perception and later physically constrain tactics—lantern orienting, cup molding, kiln location. Sensory palette is vivid and selective, but no single environment element constrains a final choice; capped at 8.8 by gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“why places resist change”—is signaled early; pressure deepens through Rua’s iterative acts but lacks a narrowing trade-off on page. Cost is implied in the future’s abolished hives and Rua’s self-exile, yet a sharper tightening within the single scene would lift it above 8.0.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through accumulated object-relations: broken hive, shard-warmed cups, kiln built from ruins; no moralizing, final image reweights kindness as light that survives scorching. Complexity is embraced; resonance feels inevitable without tidy moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</question>
<comment>Lyrical, textured voice modulates naturally for stress; diction is elevated yet consistent with Rua’s meditative focus. Distinct cadences (“kiln cracked open like sunrise over clay”) and purposeful patterning reward re-reading under the inferred lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</question>
<comment>Prose is dense but cohesive; a few figurative overlaps risk overwriting e.g., “thumbed like bowls” echo, and late beat “thrum of bees of light” skirts redundancy. No figurative muddle reaches closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</question>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of potter-keeper-of-beats-of-time in ruined apiary; premise risks abstraction but is anchored through concrete objects and bodily labor. Transformation feels organic; no close resemblance to familiar templates.</comment>
