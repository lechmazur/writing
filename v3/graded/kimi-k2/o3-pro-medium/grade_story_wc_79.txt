<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Corin’s grief-sharpened drive is embodied in every micro-choice; the cracked sextant and reed whistle act as tactile wounds. Interiority stays specific—dreams of the forbidden note, the burn of sunlight on scalp—without lapsing into label-speak. The final bow and acceptance of soul-hinge cracking earns the cost under Earned Stasis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the mirrors project the spiral path, reconfiguring options while the cost—“every hinge in my own soul must crack”—is felt on-page. Causal chain holds: gate clang → mourning → descent → watchers’ test → revealed vault route. No orientation drift; anchors clear by line 6.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The turtle-shell city, barnacle towers, and basalt watchers are not backdrop but navigational instruments; the pattern-language inlays literally guide Corin’s feet. Final image of light spiraling through translucent plastron reweights the entire setting as a living map. Sensory hierarchy obeys cartographer priorities.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—question the watchers to find Elyth—tightens when the mirrors force Corin to drop the sextant and accept the forbidden note. One decisive escalation: the beam heating the whistle until it sings, shuddering the turtles and revealing the vault path. Cost is the audible crack of self.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of cartography as both wound and compass emerges through concrete particulars: spiral growth, milk-ink charts, mirrors writing on retinas. Final non-literal answer—“questions are doors in light”—reweights the premise without moralizing. Grief and inquiry remain entangled, unresolved yet charged.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is salt-crusted, precise, and lyric without purple drift: “sunlight burn answers onto my scalp.” Perceptual signature of a cartographer—reading keratin tides, noticing fracture dots—remains consistent. Compression taught early (“pattern languages”) and paid off in mirrored light dialogue.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Zero loops; every sentence advances map, body, or light. Figurative language is sparse, purposeful: “molten light on the turtles’ backs, baking algae into incense.” Syntax breathes with pressure—long glide across shallows, then clipped commands at the platform. No artifacts near closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Transforms the lost-expedition trope into a living-cartography myth; turtle-borne city and pattern-language navigation feel inevitable yet wholly fresh. Risky lyric compression succeeds because closure remains legible. Specificity—amber triangles, cobalt spirals, vermilion dots—anchors the fantastical in tactile craft.</comment>
