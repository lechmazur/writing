<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Yara’s interiority is vivid—her furnace-burn childhood and “steady adaptiveness” manifest in micro-choices like pressing palms to warm rock and choosing frost over fire to read the ledger. The contradiction between luminous creation and weaponized glass is embodied, not stated. Final endurance (“glass, once cooled, never doubts”) is earned, but the cost is more asserted than viscerally felt, capping the score just below 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Yara’s escape crystallizes her stance—survival fused with purpose—while the pendant tapping her chest externalizes cost. Causal chain holds: stolen ledger → frost reading → route plotted → hunters evaded. One transition (canyon → arroyo) is clean. No orientation debt; lens is Causal with minor lyric overlay.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The canyon’s acoustic cupping and temperature shifts actively constrain tactics—frost reveals glyphs, dawn glare blinds pursuers. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven: glass artist notices heat retention in stone, moonlight in pendant. Final image of pendant as “silent beacon” recharges setting into symbol. Meets 9+ gate: environment shapes final choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—expose traffickers and survive—is signaled early and tightened when frost deciphers R.V.S. Agency drives escalation: Yara’s frost method narrows options (time-bound) and forces route choice. Cost is present—arrows clatter, pursuit audible—but slightly diluted because physical danger never quite touches her. Still, pressure coheres under causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of creation versus weaponization emerges organically from glass/forge imagery; no explicit moralizing. Final image—pendant tapping heartbeat—offers non-literal answer: survival itself becomes luminous testimony. Subtext in “molten glass reshaping whispers” quietly links art, silence, and resistance. Complexity lingers without tidy resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinctively sensorial and glass-centric: “kiln of nerves,” “anneal rather than shatter.” Syntax modulates with stress—long lyrical lines in calm beats, clipped fragments during hoofbeats. No head-hopping; POV modesty maintained. Compression (“dawn smeared rose”) is taught early and paid off in blinding glare. Rhythm under pressure is flawless.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every image does double duty (“frost unfurled like lace woven by invisible spiders” reveals both beauty and code). No loops, no mixed metaphors. Sentence variety mirrors thermal expansion/cooling. Minor elevation in register (“conceptual repricing” moment) is voice-motivated. Closure line is clean and resonant.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Frost-as-negative-photography to decode fire-erased ink is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis. Canyon acoustics weaponized as stealth tool feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric compression never sacrifices clarity. Transformation test: story collapses without glass artist POV and frost method. Bold yet coherent.</comment>
