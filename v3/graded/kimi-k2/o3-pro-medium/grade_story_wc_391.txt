<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The mapper’s restrained wildness and softly purposeful cadence are embodied in every micro-choice; the narrator’s shift from urgency to stillness is earned through concrete alignment work and a visible cost—the surrender of his impatience. Interior contradiction is palpable yet never slips into label-speak. The relationship functions as crucible: her pressure reshapes his stance, and the final salute seals the change.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the viaduct’s blue arcs unfold “slow as moss,” unyoking the narrator from urgency with unmistakable conceptual cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each beat layers density until the cadence shift at the final image. Causality is intact: lunar vectors → rod placement → hum → revolution breathes. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 4.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Frozen lake, basalt fang, iron beads, and lantern-gold snow are filtered through the narrator’s engineer-eye; every detail constrains footing, alignment, or magnetism. The tuning-fork test on the ice is a tactile diagnostic that guides the detour/advance choices. Final sapphire-framed wolves charge the closing image with witness. Micro-setting (viaduct pier) functions as fulcrum.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will impatience be unyoked?—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightened when the hum begins to breathe. One meaningful deepening: the narrator’s inner drum falters as the revolution inhales. Cost is visible in the relinquished urgency and the blue arcs that “unfold, slow as moss.” Agency remains with the pair; coincidence never rescues.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the concrete labor of aligning rods with moon paths; “promises stretch; borders stop” crystallizes the thematic reweighting without moralizing. Subtext lives in the hush after “patient revolution” and in the wolves’ sapphire silhouettes. Final image reconfigures the premise: stillness as insurgency. No thematic drift or sermonizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, the narrator’s engineer diction fused with winter hush: “basalt fang,” “beads of iron gleaming like seeds.” Rhythm modulates with pressure—short percussive clauses during the crossing, longer inhalations at the end. No POV leakage; perception stays strictly bounded. Dialogue minimal, subtextual, and voice-true.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances image, choice, or atmosphere. Figurative language is sparse, exact: “ice thick as glass spun for giants.” Syntax breathes with the scene’s tempo. No mixed metaphors or register drift. Final line lands with crystalline clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The fusion of geomancy, lunar cartography, and civilizational critique feels inevitable yet wholly fresh. The “patient revolution” premise is not a slogan but an engineered procedure enacted on the page. Risky lyric compression pays off in the final sapphire hush. Transformation test: story collapses if any element is swapped.</comment>
