<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara’s contradictory impulses (to reclaim feeling yet fear it) are embodied in the breathing sync and tear-seeds; the final integration is earned by prior causality. The clones act as externalized facets rather than independent agents, so relationship pressure is minimal. Interiority is concrete, but a touch of therapy-speak (“emotional numbness had been defeated”) nicks the score.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the jar sinks, the sisters become guardians, and Mara’s stance crystallizes with felt cost (tears as seeds). Causality holds under Accumulative/Textural lens; each image deepens the pattern. One minor drift: the dojo’s disappearance feels slightly convenient rather than earned.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The floating rock dojo, brain-jar, and orchid-rainfall are vivid and selective; the jar constrains the final choice by opening itself. Spatial choreography is coherent. A sliver more tactile interaction with the dojo stones would have lifted this to 8.5.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—custody of personhood—tightens through the breathing ritual that forecloses violence; the cost is the dissolution of the clones. Pressure escalates via pattern intensification rather than causal turns, fitting the Accumulative lens. One tightening is sufficient, but the cosmic history-rewrite stays abstract, muting visceral cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: personhood is shared narrative, not possession. The orchid-rainfall reprise reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext is rich in gesture (hand dissolving into orchids). A hairline slip: “personhood thrived only when shared” edges toward statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet controlled; perceptual signature is distinct (“soles skimming the fractured air currents”). Patterned elision (temporal aftershocks, sky scrolls) is taught early and paid off. No head-hopping; POV remains stable. Rhythm modulates with pressure; final cadence is crystalline.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; metaphors are fresh and coherent (“liquid chimed like bells”). Minor loop: “history rewriting itself” appears twice within three lines. No scaffolding or register drift. Read-aloud rhythm is supple.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The ego-death custody battle is a fresh synthesis; clones as externalized facets rather than antagonists feels inevitable. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. One faint echo of “brain in a jar” trope keeps it just shy of 9.0.</comment>
