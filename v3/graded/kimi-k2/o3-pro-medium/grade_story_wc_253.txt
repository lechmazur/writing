<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Marrow’s interior contradiction—silence vs. performative narration—drives every beat; her gift of the lamp crystallizes Ithica’s shift from painted smile to remade hush. The micro-choice to blow across cedar channels (not merely light it) embodies the cost of compliance. Moral ambiguity is embodied, not labeled. Minor: Ithica’s grief remains slightly generalized; more bodily specificity would lift the score.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—each narrated object thickens emotional density until the cedar lamp reconfigures the room’s silence. Closure: Charged Poise—the lamp’s glow reframes the mandate’s rule-set with felt cost (inspectors’ eased shoulders). Causality intact: no teleporting props, no retroactive patches. Orientation anchored by 3rd sentence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Setting is micro-focused: farmhouse shadow, turbine groan, cedar curls. The turbines’ midnight stilling becomes the literal hush that enables the lamp’s glow, constraining the inspectors’ entry. Sensory hierarchy favors sound (groan, rain, sirens) over visual clutter. One slip: “ring of giant wind turbines” could specify spatial relation to farmhouse.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: how to bear grief under mandated cheer. Escalation: turbine shutdown → inspector threat → lamp glow diffuses threat while preserving authentic sorrow. Cost: Ithica risks fine, Marrow risks exposure. Agency: Marrow’s whittling and narration are active, not deus ex machina. One tightening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from silence vs. forced joy; never sermonizes. Final image—lamp glowing in remade hush—offers non-literal answer: sorrow can coexist with compliance when given its own light. Subtext in the dried bouquet’s “promise cost” and inspectors’ unconscious relief. Avoids tidy moral; ambiguity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is textured, lyrical yet disciplined: “steam a ghost seeking its own mouth.” Compression taught early (“blades slicing clouds”) and paid off at closure. POV remains tight third-person limited to Ithica; no head-hopping. Dialogue minimal, subtextual. Rhythm modulates with pressure—short declaratives during sirens, longer cadences during whittling.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence advances image or stakes. Metaphors precise: “laughter printed on cheap paper.” No loops or scaffold. One mixed metaphor risk—“blades slicing clouds into obedient ribbons”—but forgiven for pattern-teaching. Final paragraph cadence mirrors turbine restart, sealing closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses dystopian mandate with quiet magical realism; cedar lamp’s non-flame glow feels inevitable, not gimmick. Transformation test: story collapses if lamp replaced with candle. Specificity of “mandated smile” and “turbine construction death” grounds universals. Risk-taking (silence as performance) pays off.</comment>
