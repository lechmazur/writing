<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The sentinel’s contradictions—guardian yet confessor, witness yet actor—are embodied in smoky coat and gentle nod; each micro-choice (offering apprenticeship, placing ash beside cane) reveals a hierarchy of values and costs.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with the promise to “translate the storm”—a Charged Poise that reweights the premise; the causal chain from bus-departure isolation to apprenticeship holds under the Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The amber pavilion’s lacquered glow leaks into interior metaphor while moon-drenched dew constrains the final vow; specificity makes the micro-setting an active participant rather than backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The vineyard’s mismatched romances escalate from clay courting limestone to the narrator translating fear into patience; one deepening crystallizes stakes without needing reversals.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars—ash carries flavor, mismatches fruit—culminating in a resonant image that offers a non-literal answer to why words matter more than wages.</comment>
<question>6</question>
<grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Distinct perceptual signature in smoke-scented coats and spilled-milk breath; patterned elision taught early (“even ash can carry flavor”) is paid off in the closing hum without ever slipping POV.</comment>
<question>7</question>
<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Syntactic propulsion and density are exemplary—ferment whispers, honey-glow, y-sigh—and zero loops or scaffold mar the closing beat.</comment>
<question>8</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>A quiet-lit apprenticeship born from mismatched solitude feels inevitable; the vineyard’s grammar of loss and bloom synthesizes fresh living material without genre cliché.</comment>
