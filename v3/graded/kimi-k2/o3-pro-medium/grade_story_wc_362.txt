<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ilara’s interiority is embodied and specific—her shiver at borrowed guilt, toes gripping quartz cracks—but the final “ready to translate” moment feels slightly abstract, blunting the cost of what she now carries.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (mist, frost, prism flare) thickens until the final image reweights the premise. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration—the lantern’s remembered swing inside stone—whose conceptual cost is unmistakable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Quartz arbor, frost-rimed sedan, and prism each constrain choice and echo the emotional tide; the lantern’s after-rhythm inside stone charges the final image with earned eeriness.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—proving objects absorb emotion—tightens through escalating sensory evidence; the cost is the inherited shame/joy she must now carry, though the beat is more deepening than reversal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the prism’s shifting emotional cargo; the closing image of lantern-swing inside stone offers a non-literal answer that reweights the entire premise without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise—“mist curled like hesitant ghosts,” “briny heartbeats”—and the perceptual signature remains consistent; patterned elision (truthful lies) is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; only a faint risk of purple in “shame soaked the prism; shame now bled into the frost” keeps it from 9+. Rhythm and clarity otherwise flawless.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Familiar premise (objects hold memory) is transformed through maritime specificity and the final inversion of lantern inside stone; the synthesis feels inevitable yet fresh.</comment>
