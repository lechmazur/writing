<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is vivid—bones vibrating with “restless euphony” embodies motive—but the final renunciation (“trusted the sea to carry her compositions”) is slightly abstract; cost is felt yet diffuse, keeping it just under 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: orchard freed, storm modulated, Mira’s stance crystallized. Accumulative lens holds; each beat layers texture until the final hush reweights the premise with visible effort and salt-stung blossoms.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The floating orchard, driftwood hull, and pear-oil sparks are not backdrop but instruments; their physical states constrain tactics and charge the final image. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true, and every detail tightens the musical conceit.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—turn obstacles into instruments—escalates through storm pressure; Mira’s agency converts gale into counterpoint, narrowing options to “play or perish.” Cost is legible in salt-stung blossoms and the mallet’s warm hum.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of listening-as-creation emerges from concrete acts: tapping chains, dubbing wind. Final image of tomorrow’s score “gathering in the cirrus” offers non-literal resonance without moralizing, though the insight flirts with abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is unmistakably Mira’s—synesthetic, synaptic, ocean-tuned. Syntax surges and breathes with weather; no head-hop, no filter clutter. The lyric elision is taught early and paid off in the storm’s remix.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative layering serves pattern, not ornament. Occasional tidal cadence repetition is intentional, not loop. No mixed metaphors or clarity breaks at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise of musical cartography via fractal dub is fresh, fully committed, and inseparable from character. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without gimmickry; the payoff feels inevitable yet unforeseeable.</comment>
