<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Selis’s interiority is vivid—her needle trembles, her laughter masks calculation, her “foolish” smile is weaponized. The contradiction between public guise and private intent is embodied in micro-choices (dropping the spool, touching flame to absent daybook). Marshal Voren’s brief appearance supplies external pressure that tests her disguise. Cost is felt: she forfeits her daybook and must flee before dawn.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each beat links because/therefore—candle reveals hidden dyes → map exposes troop diversion → Selis must act. Closure is a decisive change: she packs tools and leaves, foreclosing the safety of the observatory. Cost is legible in the final image—“the observatory closed its shutters behind her.” Orientation is anchored within 120 words; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The cobalt observatory, eternal candle, and midnight silk are not backdrop; they constrain tactics—candle’s smokeless light enables hidden stitching, rotating roof synchronizes with planetary spin. Sensory detail is selective and urgent: fog muffles footsteps, gear teeth click like confessions. Final image recharges the echoed silence, now a cost she leaves behind.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve forbidden knowledge before the coup—is signaled early and tightens when the candle reveals the palace’s two-hour vulnerability. One meaningful turn: Selis shifts from passive chart-maker to active conspirator. Cost is visible—loss of daybook, exile from sanctuary. Agency drives escalation; coincidence (Voren’s arrival) complicates rather than resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: knowledge as resistance, wisdom disguised as folly. Subtext lives in gesture—dropped spool, confiscated daybook, laughter that “echoed against the dome.” Final image of the shuttered observatory offers a resonant, non-literal answer: silence preserved until her return. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct—lyric, compressed, tactile: “galaxies bloomed like secrets admitting they wished to be found.” POV remains locked in Selis’s selective perception; no head-hopping. Syntax modulates with pressure: longer cadences for reflection, clipped fragments when Voren appears. Dialogue is sparse but subtext-rich—her “winter curtain for the library mice” line carries layered deceit.</comment>

<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence advances story or atmosphere. Figurative language is purposeful—no mixed metaphors. Rhythm breathes with scene needs: hushed observatory vs. ticking gears. No loops or scaffold; pronouns and spatial tracking clean. Final line lands with crystallized poise.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise—galaxy-chart embroiderer decoding conspiracies via silk and candlelight—is fresh, non-obvious. Tropes (spy-artisan, hidden archive) are transformed through tactile specificity: needle as telescope, candle as code-breaker. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight; risk-taking (lyric density, conceptual embroidery) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
