<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara’s desire to “discover the texture of connection” is clear and embodied in every beat; her climactic act of cutting her own keystone thread is a credible renunciation that costs her the memory of learning speech. Interiority is vivid (“unsettling calm pooled around her boots”) and micro-choices (climbing the ladder, cutting the thread) reveal hierarchy of values. Flawed competence balanced with genuine risk. Secondary characters are off-stage, so relationship crucible not applicable.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Mara’s self-sacrifice slackens the lattice and saves the guests, leaving an aftertaste of possibility. Causal linkage holds—cutting the keystone thread directly prevents collapse. Orientation is anchored early (planetarium, dusk, side door). Drive lens is Causal; each beat follows because/therefore logic. Cost is visible: her inverted memory of learning speech.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Planetarium dome, chalk constellations, and sinew threads are rendered with tactile specificity; the dome’s geometry constrains the entire design. Micro-setting (ladder, scissors) functions as tools that enable the decisive act. Atmosphere of “unsettling calm” modulates with tremors and dust. Spatial choreography is coherent; no white-room syndrome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prevent catastrophic collapse of memory-lattice—signaled early. Escalation tightens when threads threaten to knot into “a single luminous knot.” Mara’s agency drives the resolution; luck does not intervene. Visible cost: she forfeits her first memory. One meaningful tightening is sufficient at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of connection as mutable weave emerges organically from the sinew-thread metaphor and Mara’s final act. No explicit moralizing; resonance arises from the image of loosened threads humming with “forgiving light.” Final reweighting: connection never resolves, only continues to be woven. Subtext operates in gesture and silence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with rhythmic control (“dust motes erupted… glittering sigh”). Perceptual signature is architect-scientific: “equations sliding across constellations.” No head-hopping; POV remains tight to Mara. Compression and elision are purposeful and legible. Dialogue is minimal but natural when present.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is selective and pattern-taught (“quiet lightning,” “furious pollen”). No loops or scaffold. Sentence rhythm modulates with pressure. Occasional elevated diction (“rational enchantment”) is justified by character. Minor risk of overwriting in “semester lullaby” line, but does not obscure closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Premise of memory-altering architecture via muscle-thread constellations is fresh and non-obvious. Combines speculative science with lyric interiority without gimmickry. Specificity anchors universals; the fever-dream architect is individuated. Transformation test: story would collapse if elements were generic. Risk-taking heightens stakes and coherence.</comment>
