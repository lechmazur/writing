<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied; the survivor’s contradictory impulses—rage/grief vs. caretaking of the chord—surface in micro-choices (selecting forks, absorbing the final resonance). Motivation to “rectify every loss” is clear and escalates to the bodily cost of absorbing the chord. The Earned Stasis—choosing to guard silence—carries visible cost and is rooted in prior causality. No second character on page, so relationship bullets N/A.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—color and vibration accumulate until a cadence shift reweights silence. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the chord stabilizes into “luminous silence,” foreclosing noise’s return. Cost is legible in “pain like molten snow” and the survivor’s exhaustion. Orientation is anchored early; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The winterglass conservatory, the tuning-fork case, and the frozen ocean constrain every tactic: pillars limit resonance amplitude, the case becomes the final buffer, the ocean’s cracks respond to the chord. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (“powdered starlight,” “ruby ice-flowers”). Environment charges the final image: the refrozen lattice “whispered promise.”</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: prevent the return of noise from destroying the “unshaken marvels.” Escalation is a single, coherent tightening: each fork raises chromatic intensity until the architecture nears collapse; the survivor’s final act absorbs excess energy, foreclosing the option to leave. Cost is the physical pain and perpetual guardianship.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the concrete act of translating silence into music without moralizing. The final image—two “unshaken marvels bound by luminous silence”—reweights the premise: silence is not absence but a fragile composition. Subtext operates in color and vibration rather than statement; ambiguity lingers about whether noise will ever return.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; perceptual signature is scientist-poet hybrid (“heat-mapping emotions the buds refused to voice”). Syntax modulates with pressure—long, breath-held sentences early, clipped fragments during the final absorption. No dialogue; POV remains stable. Patterned elision (e.g., “after noise becomes impossible”) is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence layers image, emotion, and world-rule. Metaphors are coherent and purposeful (“icicles as thin as harp strings”). No loops, scaffold, or register drift. Rhythm accelerates during the chromatic storm and slows into the final breathing oscillation. Zero artifacts in closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—using tuning forks to vibrate silence into music inside a frozen conservatory—is fresh and fully committed. The synthesis of marine-biology grief with synesthetic botany feels inevitable. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring causality. No derivative echoes; the final “luminous silence” reconfigures familiar tropes into new resonance.</comment>
