<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ash’s contradictory impulses—arsonist’s heat vs. librarian’s tenderness—are embodied in micro-choices (pressing the tapestry to her chest, tracing stitches). The final renunciation of the ember carries visible cost and is earned by prior causality. Minor slip: “analytically intuitive” is asserted more than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: returning the ember reweights the premise and charges the final image with felt cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each artistic breadcrumb increases density until the archive sings. No causality breaks; orientation is taught early via “muted roads.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Desert canyons, basalt shelves, and the obsidian doors are vivid and selective; the cooled lava tube constrains movement and frames the climax. Micro-setting (the bronze lectern) charges the final image. One minor drift: “volcano that birthed the region” edges toward grandiose exposition.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—rescuing the promise—tightens through each artistic clue until the ember’s return forecloses all other paths. Pressure deepens via pattern accumulation; cost is legible in the weeping release. No escalation slack.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of restorative fire emerges organically from Ash’s embodied choices; the final mural reframes her past without moralizing. Subtext in slashed eyes and stitched pupils carries unresolved guilt and mercy. No thematic drift.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise—“heat bloom like memory,” “volcanic tenderness”—with rhythmic control under pressure. Perceptual signature is consistent; no head-hopping. Experimental compression (“Return what was taken, and the books will sing again”) is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is patterned and purposeful. One minor loop—“flames licked a library whose windows spelled HELP in smoke” slightly restates prior image. Otherwise zero scaffold, high information density.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Transforms the trope of the redeemed arsonist through tactile archive lore and a living-fire mural. Specific synthesis of book-love and pyromania feels inevitable. Risk-taking (murals answering murals) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
