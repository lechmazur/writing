<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Liora’s sensory-driven interiority is vivid and consistent; her contradictory impulses—sell the data vs. guard the corridors—are dramatized in the final renunciation with visible cost. The profession “corridor echo cartographer” is not just label but shapes every perception and micro-choice. One minor slip: the diary dust moment leans summary rather than embodied reaction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Liora’s vow to guard the corridors forecloses comfort and carries felt weight (“inheritance humming around her”). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of echoes and artifacts reweights the stake without causal reversals. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is selective, sensory, and purpose-built: the ivy-veiled passage’s acoustics literally guide Liora’s route and house the climactic recorder. Micro-setting (charred hearth, crystalline speaker) constrains action and charges the final image. One brief lapse: “fractal geometry” is more label than felt space.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Dominant stake—preserve or sell the sonic legacy—is signaled early and tightens once: the recorder’s anthem forces the choice to stay. Cost is visible in the renunciation of polar-lake comfort. Escalation is textural, not causal, but coherent under the chosen lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of legacy as living echo emerges through concrete particulars—diaries, bricks, children’s voices—never stated. Final image (“walls are awake”) offers resonant, non-moral reweighting. Avoids sentimentality; complexity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, lyrical, and perceptually anchored in Liora’s synesthetic ear-compass. Rhythm modulates with pressure; no head-hopping. Compression (“recording silence so dense it pressed back like velvet”) is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is pattern-taught and never muddles causality. Zero loops or scaffold. Minor register drift (“conceptual repricing” risk) avoided; diction stays within Liora’s sensorial lexicon.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Premise—echo cartographer mapping wall-dreams—feels fresh and inevitable. Children’s stored anthem reframes ruin as resilience without gimmickry. Specificity throughout prevents trope drift.</comment>
