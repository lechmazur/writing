<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Silas’s penance-mission is vivid, but the students remain types; only Tarek is named and he acts once. Interior contradiction is implied (“solemn as the abyss yet pointing outward”) yet never dramatized in-scene; the final certainty feels bestowed rather than earned through visible flaw-cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the city’s corridors literally widen after the beam is found, reweighting the premise with undeniable cost. Causal chain holds: salvage → Knot → trench → beam; no teleporting data. Orientation is taught early via “bathed in algaic luminescence” and pays off at the widening corridor image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Micro-setting—the hollow anchor link—constrains every tactical choice and charges the final image when it glows inside the alien column. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: Silas notices weight, resonance, then geometry. Spatial choreography is clean across the swim to trench and return.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“awaken memories into skill or permanent night”—is signaled early and tightened when the vectors bend toward the trench, foreclosing the option to stay in abstract study. Cost is visible: they risk drowning in barnacle-resin rebreathers; success rewrites the curriculum, eliminating the old safe path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the image sequence: folded metal → unfolded horizon. No moralizing; the final widening corridor reconfigures meaning without statement. Ambiguity remains: aliens as tutors or bait—the story refuses to resolve, inviting reflection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tightly bound to Silas’s perceptual filter: “quiet halo where imagination could dock.” Syntax lengthens and breathes with underwater tempo; no head-hop. Compression (“dawnless hour”) is taught early and paid off in the widening corridor.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentences open with concrete nouns, no scaffold loops. One mixed metaphor—“edge geometry… mouth of a shell, forever opening”—is strained but does not touch the closure beat. High density: each sentence advances image or causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The lunar-steel anchor link as astrolabe feels inevitable yet unforeseen; lunar gravity memory inside an abyssal city is a fresh synthesis. Risky lyric accumulative structure is taught early and holds to the final widening corridor, heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
