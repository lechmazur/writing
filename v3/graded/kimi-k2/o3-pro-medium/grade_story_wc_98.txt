<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The checker’s interiority is vivid and embodied—seed hums in pocket, ribs tremble—yet the “luminous doubt” never sharpens into contradictory action; choices are largely observational until the final carve-a-mast beat, which feels slightly under-cooked relative to the lyrical stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the seed’s sprout reconfigures the mission from verification to midwifery, and the boat-shaped petal image crystallizes the new imperative with felt cost—departure before monsoon. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; each waypoint adds memory-density until the pattern breaks into living root.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Jacaranda petals, tide-pool shrines, orchid suns—each micro-setting constrains the next ritual step and reappears in the final image (blossoms closing like eyelids). Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered; no static postcard moments.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will the island remember before rain erases everything—tightens via each artifact recovered; luminous doubt escalates into the irreversible choice to sail. Cost is legible: the checker must leave the ridge unguarded to keep memory alive.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through the seed’s metamorphosis: memory is not archival but ecological, requiring risk and motion. Final boat of petals offers a resonant, non-moral answer—memory steers futures—without overt statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise; perceptual signature favors synesthetic leaps (“colors seeped from moonlight”) and restrained diction. No head-hopping; compression (“I hurried to carve”) heightens urgency without clutter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; each sentence layers image and consequence. Occasional poetic stacking (“pale gold veined with violet”) stays purposeful and pattern-taught. No loops or scaffold detected.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The reality-checker conceit, seed-as-midwife, and memory-as-boat synthesis feel inevitable yet fresh. Risky lyric structure pays off in the final reconfiguration without gimmickry.</comment>
