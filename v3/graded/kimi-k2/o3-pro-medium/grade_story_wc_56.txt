<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority is consistently character-driven; “private hunger” drives every beat. The sundial in pocket aligns motives to later action and flaw. No clunky self-analysis—only embodied cost at Lock Nine.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands solidly: salvage leads to ledger copy, exposing architectural lies with a perceptual cost foreclosing legend-seeker anonymity. Causal chain holds under the Situational lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Canal mist, box, and lock gate pressure choice; height-specific limestone constrains salvage. Details tailor POV bias and charge final confrontation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—expose hidden atrocities—tightens via salvage/ledger discovery, not coincidence. Pressure forces stance crystallization and a visible price for broadcasting truth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from uncovering lies as architecture, not exposition. Final image of boat mirrored in sunlit water offers resonant reweighting of silence’s cost—serene yet damning.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Muscular lyricism frames focalized perception (“mist luminous as breath made visible”). Dialogue minimal but crisp; station man exchange carries subtext without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Rhythm swells/retreats with pressure; high information density without loops. Metaphors specific to scene (“cold tears” limestone) and closure. No overwriting during peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Risky quiet ending that crystallizes quiet defiance elegantly. Mythic canal legend transformed via material evidence; fresh synthesis outweighs familiar tropes.</comment>
