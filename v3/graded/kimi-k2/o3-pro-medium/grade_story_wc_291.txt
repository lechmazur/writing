<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Samara’s interiority is concrete—her inability to recognize faces collides head-on with her hyper-precise sketch memory, creating pressure in every beat. Methodical numbering acts as embodied flaw, not label, and it drives her final tactic: counting beats to break both suspects. The cost is legible on the page: she exchanges face-blind safety for a new, vertiginous empathy she “cannot see but feels bloom in the air”.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens selected. Every beat tightens from ribbon trace → oily contour → heart sketch → unification strategy, each a because/therefore link. Closure arrives as Decisive Change: dual confession under Samara’s empathic geometry, with clear social cost (case reopened, suspects broken, empathy won).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The quarry shadows and misted acoustics cage the suspects while the mask ribbon doubles as micro-setting when it stains the pool, but the quarry itself never physically constrains action enough for 9-tier.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—missing evidence/solution—escalates via procedural pressure: each procedural micro-reveal narrows options until dual confession becomes inevitable. Visible costs accumulate: suspects lose control, Samara loses her emotional shield.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of empathy forged from opposites emerges through object and action (heart sketch, dual confession), not statement. The ending reweights the ribbon’s violet perfume from clue to human cost without any final moral tag.</comment>

<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person controlled interiority delivers Samara’s perceptual signature—synesthetic counting, graphite contour tracing—without head-hopping. Phrasing is rhythmic yet never ornamental (“empathy… invisible yet unmistakable”). Mercado’s brief dialogue stays distinct via clipped investigative syntax.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Muscular sentences advance multiple tasks—e.g., “Dye spiraled outward, revealing a hidden oily film” carries sensory, plot and thematic weight. Zero loops or near-duplicates; strong verbs carry every line. A minor figurative excess (“mist twirling like pale serpents”) grazes 9+ gate but does not obstruct clarity.</comment>

<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of face-blind sketching + cold-case arson + ribbon dye readout delivers a fresh investigative engine that no stock premise replicates. The unification mechanic (oppositional suspects fused into a single-heart sketch) feels inevitable in hindsight yet non-obvious at setup.</comment>
