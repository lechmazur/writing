<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The feline POV feels lived-in—"steering my paws outdoors," "breathed the chill into my lungs"—but interiority flirts with excess lyricism. Micro-choice to internalize the garden’s cold is embodied, yet the homesickness label abstracts rather than burdens. Guardian role is more posture than vocation; stakes lack feral bite. Still, the final pocketing of the pendant shows earned presence, cost foreclosed in “enough certainty.”</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via rising density: cold → pendant warmth → carrying garden inside. Orientation anchors within 40 words through spatial cues and POV animal body. Closure delivers Charged Poise as guardian elects perpetual openness—“thresholds travel.” Pendant and waiting loop into the final breathing image, charging the aftereffect with cost that forecloses sheltering certitude.</comment>

<comment>Frozen courtyard and rime-coated statues are sharply sensed, then literally internalized as breathable weather; the garden becomes portable micro-setting that constrains the ending choice. Spatial layout stays coherent across small moves. Description occasionally veers ornamental beneath pressure but avoids full artifact.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—friendship with uncertainty itself—escalates through concrete images of thresholds, blank margins, and the mist-shape’s silence. Pendant-activated elastic distance poses causal squeeze, but escalation glides on lyric accumulation more than tightening beat; felt cost is present yet slightly diffuse.</comment>

<comment>Theme of uncertainty-as-friend emerges organically via motif chain—pendant spiral, margins of blank parchment, dawn hesitation—until guardian re-prices waiting itself as portable home. No overt moralizing; resonance resonates quietly from the final breathing-garden image.</comment>

<comment>Language texture is lyric without sprawl; syntactic lilt matches feline curator of silence. Repetition (“garden in mist” / “carrying the frozen garden in mist inside my breathing”) is purposeful echo, pattern-taught by breath motif. Slight poetic inflation but never falters clarity.</comment>

<comment>Sentences dance; no scaffold loops. Occasional near-luxurious phrasing—e.g., “foggy lucidity clung”—edges purple yet passes ear test. Propulsion steady, no buried beats. One mixed metaphor (“boundary … stood like a bookmark”) tolerated under lyric license.</comment>

<comment>A library cat guardian who shelves uncertainty re-sets a familiar trope into quiet ritual. Pendant-door, breathing garden, and uncertainty-friendship synthesize with understated assurance; nothing could be swapped without collapse. Fresh angle holds with minimal gimmickry.</comment>
