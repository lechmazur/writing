<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kestrel’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“futuristic nostalgia pulsed in Kestrel's chest”), but the renunciation at the end is slightly under-motivated; the murals hint at clarity over power, yet the leap from seeing to renouncing feels compressed. Still, her micro-choices (planting the shard, slicing it) are character-specific and carry visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The causal chain holds: ruby flake → coordinates → waterfall → solvent reveal → orchard → choice → scattering seeds. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the throne stays unclaimed, the stair becomes communal, and the cost is the erasure of footprints and orchard transparency. One seamless scene with clean orientation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Setting is tactile and selective: “rust dunes where solar panels lay shattered like ancient stained glass” grounds us; the waterfall-as-lens and bioluminescent orchard constrain tactics (must dissolve paint, must plant shard). Final transparency of orchard recharges the opening image of digital snow.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—claim or leave the throne—is signaled early and tightens at the sigil’s demand. Escalation is one deepening: the helix freezes until Kestrel’s renunciation completes it. Cost is explicit: she forfeits personal sovereignty and erases her own trail.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of stewardship over sovereignty emerges through action, not statement; murals foreshadow, orchard tests, and the final scattering embodies the idea. The ending’s image—stairway glowing for all—reweights prior quest without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with controlled rhythm (“whispering of forgotten epochs”). Perceptual signature is consistent: Kestrel’s tech-augmented sensorium filters every image. No dialogue, so compression and sensory diction carry the load cleanly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; metaphors are fresh and coherent (“water writes, paint listens”). No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances. Occasional elevated diction (“sallying”) fits the lore-keeper persona.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of post-satellite myth, augmented-reality orchard, and communal sovereignty feels inevitable yet fresh. Risky lyric compression pays off; no derivative echoes. Transformation test passes—story collapses if any proper noun or image is swapped.</comment>
