<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Eron’s promise to the dead astronomer and his ankle-ache anchor interior stakes; the contradictory pull between duty and wonder is embodied in every step. Micro-choice—offering the sextant to the cedar—earns the earned stasis of setting the mop aside. Yet the trees remain archetypal observers rather than relational crucibles, limiting depth.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the labyrinth exhales, the sextant mends, and Eron’s stance crystallizes on the balcony. Causal chain holds—promise → mapping sorrow → tree witness → release. The pin-drop silence functions as taught pattern that unlocks passage without violating lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Stormlit tower, moonlit orchard, and the cedar’s knot-hole eyes are vivid and selective; the sextant itself becomes micro-setting that constrains the final charting. Spatial choreography is coherent across descent and ascent. Weather and moonlight actively heal both trees and ankle, charging the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—release quantified sorrow—tightens when Eron chooses to deconstruct the maze’s memory vaults; cost is the irreversible straightening of corridors and the foreclosed path of endless custodial duty. One meaningful deepening suffices; no external reversals needed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: sorrow hoarded by human design versus sorrow released through arboreal witness. Final image of dew-soaked constellations reframes the mundane miracle without moralizing. Subtext lives in the sextant’s vapor and the orchard’s silent rings.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded in maintenance idiom—“mop, toolbox, astronomer’s broken sextant.” Syntax modulates with pressure: short clauses during the pin-drop moment, longer breaths beneath the trees. No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains Eron’s throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive—“brass regrew, mirrors cleared”—each image does double duty. Occasional elevated diction (“cathedral pews”) is earned by ritual tone. No loops or mixed metaphors; cadence accelerates at climax then settles into quiet closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: labyrinth custodian + quantified sorrow + arboreal absolution. The sextant’s transformation from broken relic to healing conduit feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risky lyric compression pays off in the final mirror-leaf constellation.</comment>
