<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s interior contradiction—keeper vs releaser of secrets—drives every beat; the paper-boat surrender is earned by prior guilt and yields visible lightness. Embodied emotion (“breathed outside her ribs”) is specific, not therapeutic. Secondary pressure from Arun is minimal but sufficient for the scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each salvaged object layers density until the filament reconfigures meaning. Closure lands with Conceptual Repricing—the redistribution of secrets costs Mara her hoarded identity. Orientation is anchored by lotus temple and rain within 120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Lotus temple, mirrored shards, and floating envelope stones constrain movement and echo theme; the pond receives the paper boat, charging the final image. Sensory selection is POV-filtered and purposeful. Spatial choreography is clean.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—how to carry secrets—tightens when the filament offers communal release; the cost is the forfeiture of private control. One clear deepening, no reversal required. Pressure remains coherent under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of secret-keeping as isolation emerges through objects and action; the final image of the drifting boat reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext in mirrored corridors and humming coil avoids statement. Resonance lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Distinct lyric texture—“prismatic quiet,” “watery echoes”—sustained without purple drift. POV modesty maintained; no head-hop. Compression and patterned elision taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentences advance multiple duties. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful. Final paragraph cadence crystallizes the shift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: ghostwriter + public-art confession coil turns familiar tropes of secrecy into communal music. Specificity of salvaged tapes and envelope stones anchors universals. Risky lyric structure pays off in closure.</comment>
