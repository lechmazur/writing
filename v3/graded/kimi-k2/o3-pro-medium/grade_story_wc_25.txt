<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marlin’s gait-based perception and “calculated spontaneity” credo are embodied in every micro-choice; the final renunciation—letting the ladder vanish—costs him immediate access to the smuggling route and is earned by prior beats. Interior contradiction surfaces when curiosity collides with professional caution. Liora’s presence sharpens the crucible, but her interiority is only gestured at, slightly limiting depth.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the ladder clangs shut, the corridor disappears, and the pair walk away having weaponized silence—cost is the sealed mystery they now carry. Causal chain holds: key → aperture → radios → ladder → misdirection → trophy. Orientation is immediate; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Container maze, stormlight, and the brass key form a tactile triad that constrains every move; the key’s final insertion into the zodiac coin re-weights the entire setting. Sensory hierarchy is POV-filtered—auroral hiss, salt air, metal yielding “with the hush of velvet.” Spatial choreography is exact; no white-room drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove whispers outrun shouts—tightens when patrol footsteps threaten exposure; the protagonists must trade immediate safety for evidence. One clear escalation: the ladder descent and subsequent misdirection that vacates the guards’ path. Cost is the sealed route and the latent danger of microphones they know are listening.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: silence weaponized as resistance against surveillance capitalism. The whisper/shout motif reframes from playful experiment to political tool without a single explicit statement. Final image—“silence, practiced well, is the loudest song”—reweights the premise with conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is Marlin’s perceptual signature: synesthetic gait-reading, grease-pencil cartography, auroral synesthesia. Syntax modulates with pressure—“voice low as tidewater,” “ladder descended like a secret verdict.” No POV leakage; dialogue is spare, subtext-laden, and rhythmically distinct between speakers.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet limpid; every sentence advances image or tactic. Figurative language is selective—“auroral canyons,” “closing parenthesis”—and never muddles causality. No loops, scaffold, or register drift. Final paragraph’s cadence slows to crystallize the Charged Poise.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The smuggling of silence via de-mic’d radios feels freshly sutured to port noir and geomagnetic spectacle. Transformation test fails if any element is swapped: the gait-recognition, zodiac coin, and folded-map corridor are irreplaceable. Risk-taking (lyric container-myth, causal whisper-network) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
