<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Ira’s interior contradiction—yearning to send the laugh yet knowing the toll—drives every shuttle pass; her embodied aging under the loom is specific and costly. The final renunciation is earned: “the loom spinner expired like a candle finishing its letter” forecloses her path with visible sacrifice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the laugh departs, silence snaps free, Ira’s life is spent. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each weave thickens pattern and cost until the final image reconfigures meaning. Orientation is immediate; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The orchard’s puzzle-edge ley lines and the loom’s ancient wood constrain Ira’s method; the bamboo bowing to launch sound charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective, urgent, and filtered through her tactile craft.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—deliver the laugh across impossible distance—tightens via each shuttle pass that ages Ira a season. The visible price (her life) escalates under Accumulative pressure; no coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of memory-as-sacrifice emerges through Ira’s embodied weaving and the bead’s reweighted glow; the final image offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. Subtext operates in silence and amber light.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Distinct lyric texture—“raveling silence,” “stoically sparkling bead”—remains controlled under pressure; no head-hop or register drift. The loom’s rhythm mirrors Ira’s waning heartbeat, voice coherent throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image, cost, or cadence. Figurative language is sparse, purposeful, and never muddles the closure beat. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with the shuttle strikes.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of loom-craft, puzzle geometry, and sacrificed silence feels inevitable and fresh; no template echo. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
