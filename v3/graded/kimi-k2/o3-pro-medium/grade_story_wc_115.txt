<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied; the narrator’s skeptical creed collides with embodied belief (“gravel in my mouth”). Caleb’s swallowed-logbook guilt is dramatized through tactile ritual with the valve wheel, and the final micro-choice—folding the wheel away unsold—earns a credible renunciation with felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the spinning beads ratify Caleb’s confession and reweight remorse into measurable “SHIFT SETTLED.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern density (radio callers, Morse, beads) tightens until the final cadence shift. Cost is legible in Caleb’s lighter sigh and the narrator’s vow to keep the wheel private.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Chill tunnel, rusted girders, brass beads—selective sensory triangulation anchors the scene. The valve wheel doubles as micro-setting and tool, constraining the final ritual; its brass beads literally spin to register pressure change. Spatial choreography is clean; no orientation drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—quantify swallowed guilt—escalates via spectral labor rumors and the bead-spinning test. One decisive tightening: the beads’ Morse confirms “SHIFT SETTLED,” foreclosing further doubt. Cost is visible in Caleb’s lighter breath and the narrator’s private custody of the wheel.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of guilt-as-industrial-residue emerges through concrete objects (ledger dissolved in gut, beads as timecards). Final image reweights the premise: remorse can be weighed but not monetized. No moralizing; resonance arises from the valve wheel’s last click.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: the narrator catalogs radio static and nicotine insomnia with idiosyncratic precision. Syntax modulates from dense compression to hushed, breath-paced lines under fatigue. No POV drift; free indirect style stays coherent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet textured; every image advances atmosphere or stakes. No loops or scaffold; “comet tails of graffiti” and “carbon copy blue” are precise. Rhythm mirrors drowsy alertness—long breaths then sharp clicks of beads. Occasional elevated diction (“Conceptual Repricing”) fits reflective beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: swallowed logbook + spectral factory timecards + beaded rosary-wheel as guilt scale. Tropes of haunted industry are transformed through bodily metaphor and radio-caller data-mining. Risky conceit stays legible and emotionally grounded.</comment>
