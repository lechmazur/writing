<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s interior contradiction—duty to archive vs. need to witness—drives every beat; embodied seizures and micro-choice to descend anchor motive. Final renunciation of remote safety costs her bodily autonomy and is earned by prior retrocognitive pain. Secondary apparition pressures her stance, crystallizing the ledger as revolt. No slips, but limited page space keeps contradiction from full bloom.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the lagoon testimony reweights the archive’s purpose, cost paid in irreversible seizure and tear-stained recorder. Causal lens holds—each beat because/therefore—diary → coordinates → descent → parley → ledger. Orientation anchored by zeppelin shadow at open and close; no drift. One tightening suffices.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Obsidian lagoon constrains the final choice—its black mirror enables temporal parley and indexes memory cost. Zeppelin and dunes are sketched with selective sensory economy; moonlight on glass charges the closing image. No static catalog; every detail filters through Mara’s urgency. Micro-setting (recorder, armband) supports stakes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—recover suppressed testimony—signaled early; pressure tightens when Mara chooses descent over remote archiving, foreclosing safety. Agency drives escalation; soldiers’ erasure is countered by her embodied risk. Cost visible in seizures and tear evaporation. One meaningful turn suffices under causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: documentation as insurgency. Subtext in driftwood dashes and forbidden dove armband; no moralizing. Final image—dawn lagoon now “storied”—reweights premise without statement. Complexity preserved: silence once saved lives, yet truth now demands voice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Distinct lyric texture—ink that “refused chronology,” “moonset lit ridges”—sustained under pressure. POV stable; perceptual signature filters every detail through archivist’s taxonomic gaze. Dialogue minimal but rippling syllables fit apparition. No head-hop or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose propels: high density, zero loops, rhythmic variation under seizure beats. Metaphors precise—“word-kayak across the ages.” No mixed vehicles or scaffold. Final line crystallizes without clutter. Minor elevated diction justified by archivist voice.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Floating library, retrocognitive ink, and temporal parley synthesize into fresh mythos. Tropes transformed: archive as airship, ghost as time-crystal. Risky lyric compression pays off in closure. Specificity—Freedom Cartographers, seaweed parentheses—anchors universals.</comment>
