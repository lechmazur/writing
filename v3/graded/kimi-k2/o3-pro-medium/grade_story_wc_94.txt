<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied; the poet’s contradictory impulses (rage vs. composure) play out in micro-choices—resetting the timer, stitching the map into his coat. The final renunciation of publication in favor of sky-speech is earned and carries visible cost. No second character on page, so relationship bullets waived.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each tick of the timer layers density until the final dictation reweights silence into language. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—he leaves having “published himself to the sky,” foreclosing print-publication with felt cost. Orientation is immediate; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Observatory, storm, and timer form a micro-setting that constrains breath and choice; altitude literally rarefies lungs. The storm’s “wounded photograph” image charges the final reconfiguration. Every sensory detail is filtered through the poet’s perceptual bias—no tourist catalog.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—honest articulation of pain—tightens with each tick; the envelope’s discovery deepens rather than resolves, forcing a crystallized stance. Cost is legible: he forfeits editorial approval and carries unshareable maps next to his ribs.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: scars as geography, censorship as weather. Final line “We breathe so scars can speak” offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. No thematic drift; ambiguity is purposeful and earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct—compressed, lyrical, storm-drunk. Syntax mirrors the poet’s rarefied breath and ticking urgency. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent and charged.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is patterned and paid off (“cartography of scars” returns in the envelope). No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances image or stakes. Minor register elevation is voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—censored poet uses storm and timer to out-publish censors—feels fresh and inevitable. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring closure. Specificity of “ink that refused erasure” anchors universals.</comment>
