<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Milo’s interiority is vivid—his midnight whistle, the hush “leaning forward,” the beetle-heart—yet the final choice (burying the case under Rowan’s hand) feels slightly under-motivated; we sense his empathy but not the precise internal pivot that makes this act inevitable.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the tapestry map leads to the unmarked grave, the chess king and letter are restored, and the hush modulates to lullaby. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each re-sewn thread releases a memory that tightens the pattern—while the felt cost is the sleepless, century-long vigil Milo accepts.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The cemetery’s “blue velvet” night, the cobalt silo’s corrugated walls, and the yew’s steaming soil are selective, sensory, and purposeful; the silo itself constrains the final repair of the tapestry, making setting an active participant rather than backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—restoring unfinished intentions—escalates as each decoded thread narrows Milo’s options until only the spade and sovereign case remain. The pressure is coherent under the Accumulative lens; the cost is the irreversible night of labor and the exposure of Rowan’s buried regret.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: unfinished grief seeks a gardener’s hands, and completion brings not triumph but a quieter haunting. The final whistle harmonizing with the echoes offers a resonant, non-moral answer that reweights the entire tapestry.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The voice is textured, lyrical, and consistent—“lunar milk,” “month-old thunder”—with controlled psychic distance. Compression and elision (“hours pass, or perhaps centuries”) are taught early and paid off in the dawn hush, never breaking orientation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each image does double duty (“grainy scent of forgotten harvests” evokes both silo and memory). No loops, no mixed metaphors, and the final cadence—“bright and sure”—releases the accumulated gloom with rhythmic precision.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of cemetery caretaker, whispered unfinished lives, and textile cartography feels inevitable yet fresh. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; the story could not survive relocation or renaming without collapse.</comment>
