<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Serah’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses (duty vs. rebellion) act simultaneously in scene. The final smile folds the cost of complicity into a single charged image. Minor slip: “rumour insisted” is summary rather than dramatized trait.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: blackout → descent → shard geometry → lattice surge → simultaneous unlock. Closure is a decisive change with felt cost—the fort “strangely lighter of heart” yet Serah pockets an empty holder. No orientation debt; spatial anchors arrive by ~120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fort Lumen’s blackout and stained-glass corridors are not backdrop; the blackout disables the original plan and forces the lattice improvisation. The sundial’s “impossible forty-three degrees” physically constrains the shard placement. Micro-setting (bronze holder, parchment circles) doubles as tool and setting, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—silent liberation—signaled in paragraph two. Escalation tightens once: blackout nullifies electrical surge, forcing geometric improvisation. Cost is visible in the empty holder and the hush that swallows Serah’s smile. Agency drives every turn; coincidence complicates but does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of quiet rebellion emerges through concrete particulars: locks “click open in unanimous forgiveness,” revolution “honoring its vow of silence.” Final image reweights the premise—freedom is not fanfare but an unlatched door. No moralizing; resonance arises from embodied action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, tactile, and POV-locked: “lanterns meant to burn like captive suns dimmed to sullen embers.” Syntax modulates with pressure—short clauses during lattice surge, longer lyric lines in reflection. No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains Serah’s throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence advances stakes or atmosphere. Figurative language is selective and purposeful—“lattice lightning crawling like curious vines.” No loops or scaffold; rhythm breathes with scene needs. One mixed metaphor (“saluting the vigilant lock sentinel with quiet, grateful metal”) barely grazes clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: lock-picking mysticism meets electrical insurgency in a stained-glass fortress. The blackout-as-catalyst and lattice-through-sundial geometry feel inevitable in hindsight. Specificity—“copper pins cradle quartz shards”—anchors the fantastical in tactile reality. Risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
