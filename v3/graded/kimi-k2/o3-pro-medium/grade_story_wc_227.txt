<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Brielle’s interior contradiction—doubt alloyed with duty—drives every micro-choice; the key ring charm embodies the mentor-shaped void and physically alters her stance under pressure. The final self-inflicted kintsugi crack is earned by prior causal chain and carries visible bodily cost. Minor: the mentor vanishing “into the brine” is summary, not dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the workshop steadies, gears sync to her heartbeat, and the acid air tastes “of storms forgiven.” Causal linkage holds—each narrated scar tightens the stakes until the last seam is her own flesh. Accumulative lens is taught early and paid off. No orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The floating acid workshop, cistern, and corroded hinges are vivid, selective, and constrain tactics (acid vapor limits breath, gears tilt under the statue’s shift). Micro-setting (key ring, calipers) functions as charged objects. One minor drift: “acid sea” physics rules stay implied rather than tested.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transmute rupture into revelation without erasure—tightens each time Brielle chooses to exhale pain into gold. The final self-repair is the decisive turn that forecloses retreat. Cost is visceral (lungs, flesh, mentor absence). Escalation is steady, lens-coherent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of mending-through-fracture emerges from embodied action; no moralizing. The phoenix breastplate and “storms forgiven” reweight prior fire imagery with earned resonance. Complexity lingers: the mentor remains lost, the world still broken outside the workshop.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is alchemist-poetic, syntactically varied, and filters perception through urgent sensory triage (“sulphurous mist lapped at the gears”). No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens under acid-lung stress. Distinct diction—“kintsugi intentions,” “quilt memories”—remains character-bound.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is pattern-taught and paid off (“molten gold trickled from her lips”). No loops or scaffold. Minor register spike: “conceptual repricing” diction in “dire enchantment thickened the air” but fits lyric mode.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: acid-sea alchemy workshop + kintsugi as lived praxis. The statue’s pockmarks as palimpsest language is non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight. Risky self-gilding climax heightens stakes without gimmickry. Transformation test passes—story fails if any element swapped.</comment>
