<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Maren is a vivid, consistent subject whose kindness and mechanical warmth propel every beat; the internal contradiction—curiosity versus care for the beasts—tightens with the lever pull and powers the earned renunciation. Emotions are embodied (gloved fingers, cold metal thrumming, guilt crystallizing into apology); no therapeutic labels disrupt. The final promise to gain consent first crystallizes her value hierarchy at visible cost, satisfying Q1.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—“promised the sleeping leviathans that any future sideways journey would begin with their consent”—the lens is Accumulative/Textural: layered sensory patterns reweight moral stakes. The tilt-and-return sequence is coherent; orientation is clear within 120 words and the temporal drift is earned step-by-step, so no penalty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The cryo-mist, spinning turbines, and violet twilight sheets function as micro-setting tools that physically constrain choice (the iced lever slips at different angles under pressure). Each sensory selection tightens the chronal tilt and provides immediate bearings. The body-in-motion choreography through the foundry and spar is spatially precise.</comment>

<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—prove the temporal hypothesis without harming the specimens—escalates exactly once when the violet sheets start overlapping midnights. That single meaningful tightening forces Maren to reweight ethics over curiosity, with the cost legible: disorientation among leviathans and her own apology.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The theme—ethical knowledge has price—emerges in concrete particulars: breath stacking like flipbook pages and her promise of consent. No moralizing voice states a thesis; meaning crystallizes in the final reprise: she carries “icy warmth in her pockets like twin suns”—a metaphor whose emotional cost is felt.</comment>

<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The perceptual signature is distinct and pressure-tuned: “sky foundry,” “poets navigate silence,” “dormant lung awaiting dawn” all issue from a mechanic-poet mind. Rhythm modulates with danger, and the diction stays within Maren’s plausible lexicon; only the word “unzipped” flirts with self-conscious metaphor yet fits the moment.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Sentences propel with high density and varied rhythm; occasional poetic stacking (“iced over… entrusted warmth”) is voice-motivated and never glazes high-pressure beats. No loops, filter-verb clusters, or mixed metaphors dilute the closing image. Clean mechanics and purposeful elision keep the prose luminous.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The sideways-time theory fused with mechanic ethics is fresh; the archived snowflakes and magnosaur migration maps are original synthesis rather than trope recycling. The final gesture of returning the deck of cards closed, while keeping fingerprints, feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky conceptual move pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
