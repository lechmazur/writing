<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Protagonist’s interior contradiction—grief locked against the need to release it—drives every beat; the micro-choice to surrender the memory is embodied in the tear-cooled night air and the opened door. Guardian’s silence functions as active pressure, not absence. Cost is felt: the memory is gone, the water keeps the light, and the brother’s echo is transmuted rather than erased.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the protagonist’s stance toward loss is reweighted when the new constellation of possibility appears on the water. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each shutter flicker layers density until the final image crystallizes. Causality intact: the memory is traded, the pattern is released, the city sees stars. Cost is legible in the “half-spoken secret” now spoken and spent.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dock, boathouse, mirror, and water form a micro-setting that constrains every move: slick planks dictate footing, the barred boathouse enforces secrecy, the mirror’s angle determines what light survives. Cobalt after-rain hue and reflected lampfire are not backdrop but instruments the guardian manipulates. Final image of lantern-boat sadness floating “lit from beneath” charges the closing beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will the protagonist release the memory—tightens once, irrevocably, when the mirror aligns and the shutters enact The Ferryman. Escalation is textural: each added glint narrows the option of keeping the secret. Agency remains with the protagonist; the guardian only channels the choice. Price paid on the page: the memory is unspooled into light, grief externalized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the concrete act: pain as map, not cage. No statement, only the reconfiguration of starlight on water and the protagonist’s new capacity to “carry no mirror yet reflect everything.” Subtext lives in silence, mirror flashes, and the whispering shutters. Final image reweights the premise without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with rhythmic compression that teaches its pattern early (“thick as unspoken promises”) and pays it off in the hush between shutter beats. Perceptual signature is consistent: the narrator notices moisture, iron, geometry, and withheld sound in character-specific hierarchy. No head-hop; guardian’s interior is sensed only through external gesture and mirrored light.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence layers image or stakes. Figurative language is selective—no mixed metaphors, no loops. “Lantern boat” and “patient stars” are earned by prior patterning. Syntax modulates with pressure: longer coils of reflection contract into single-beat shutter taps. No artifacts in the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise—trading memories for starlight via shutter choreography—is fresh, yet grounded in tactile detail. The dental mirror repurposed as optical instrument feels inevitable, not gimmicky. Risk-taking in silent dialogue and accumulative patterning heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Specificity of the cobalt dock and the half-spoken secret prevents template drift.</comment>
