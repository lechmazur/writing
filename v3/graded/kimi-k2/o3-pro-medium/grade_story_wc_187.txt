<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira’s interior contradiction—yearning to preserve yet fearing petrification—drives every micro-choice; the final omission of her own longing costs her ego-space and is embodied in the “sting.” Only the mentor’s warning is summary, not dramatized, keeping her just shy of 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each measured shadow thickens the tapestry until the moonlit fracture reweights the premise. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Lira’s renunciation of self-preservation crystallizes in the sealed scroll—cost legible in “the omission stung.” Orientation is taught by the prisms’ murmurs within 120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The crystal forecourt, broken sundial, and stormlit dome are not backdrop; their shifting reflections and moon-milk fracture literally guide Lira’s quill and final decision. Every sensory detail is filtered through her archival priorities, and the setting constrains the act of inscription itself.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—what to keep and what to let evaporate—tightens once when the moon-pool vision forces the choice. The cost is the excision of her own voice; pressure escalates via accumulating memories that demand curation under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of memory vs. living identity emerges through concrete acts: measuring shadows, dipping the quill, sealing the scroll. The final image of dawn “folding her decisions” offers non-literal resonance without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise—“thunder unrolled a deepening hush”—with perceptual signature rooted in an archivist’s synesthetic cataloging. Patterned elision (“stormlit,” “noctilucent”) is taught early and paid off in closure cadence; no head-hop.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; each sentence layers image and function. Minor risk of purple in “milk in a cracked cup,” yet rhythm accelerates under pressure. No loops or scaffold; diction stays within Lira’s arcane lexicon.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Familiar tropes—celestial archive, memory palace—are transmuted through meteor-glass obelisks and thunder-fed flowers. The synthesis feels inevitable; the risk of lyric excess is balanced by tactile specificity and earned closure.</comment>
