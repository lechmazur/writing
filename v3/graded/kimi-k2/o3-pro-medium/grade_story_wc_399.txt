<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lira’s embodied patience, tactile sand-reading, and final acceptance of wordlessness are vivid; her sole micro-choice (lifting the bowl) crystallizes a credible renunciation. However, the prophet’s vanishing and the absence of direct interaction keeps relationship cast at zero, and no status tension registers. Traits of honesty and balance imply lived contradiction, yet no overt mistake compounds, keeping internal arc slightly under risk.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyric causal chain holds: prophet leaves → Lira receives → parapet rises → consecration compresses the echo into her chest. The Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly—the ripple has walked into her silence—so closure satisfies lens and cost. Orientation is immediate; two tiny shards (prophet POV) are signalled as final breath rather than violation. Light metaphysical rules are taught early and pay off without retro-fitting.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Crescent Expanse, murmuring pavilion, kinetic parapet, and conjured clearings interleave digestible sensory threads that constrain every beat: sand yields ramp, clearings smother leakage. The silver ripple refracting final sunlight acts as micro-setting by charging the closure image directly. No clichés or drifting geography—details are sparse yet specific. Environment actively shapes Lira’s choices at each threshold.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: transmit wisdom without corrupting its silence. One tightening beat—unsealing then resealing the echo—forces irrevocable guardianship. Cost is felt in the “harmless stone” settling behind ribs. Stakes avoid abstraction; every escalation traces from Lira’s actions under increasing on-record pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme (wisdom is silence carried) emerges through tactile ritual rather than declaration. Sub-text lies beneath the hush itself—paradox of voiced silence. Final image of both traveler and prophet walking their complementary silences reweights opening line; no moral sermon intrudes. Ambiguity is purposeful—reader must interpret why preservation beats utterance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Narrative voice sustains a monk-like compression that feels wholly Lira’s—desert gray eyes, sensory restraint, postponement of speech. Syntax blooms at ceremonial beats then contracts to breath-length—evidence of rhythmic control. Experimental elision (no spoken dialogue) fits the premise and is legible. POV remains tight single-lens with no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lapidary—each diamond-cold sentence advances pressure or ritual clarity, yet no figurative muddle intrudes. Tension in sentence variation—long susurrus lines, abrupt single-beat stoppers. One paraphrase loop noticed (“the hush remained…whisperfield calm that would not disperse”) but occurs after closure, thus not harming peak beats. Copy-clean, strong verb choice.</comment>

<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The vision—desert reveals hidden kinetic architecture for wisdom-carrying monks—feels fresh despite mythic resonance. Fresh inflection: wisdom as literal sound-object compressed into body-silence. Device of parapet web-lines through sand reconfigures stale pilgrimage trope. Risk intact; no hedging explains away the miracle: paragraph-acupuncture that trusts reader credulity.</comment>
