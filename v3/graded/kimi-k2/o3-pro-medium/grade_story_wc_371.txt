<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is textured and embodied; the contradiction between cataloguing loss and planting renewal is dramatized in the seed-planting micro-choices. The final renunciation—leaving applause behind—earns its cost through prior guilt and the bread-sharing ritual. Minor slip: “absolution is always tenuous” edges toward label-speak, though it is immediately grounded in Madam Ko’s root metaphor.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (mint, vines, steam) accrues until the final moonlit image reweights the stake. Closure is a Charged Poise—Elias’s vow to keep pulling the veil—whose cost is the perpetual, unnoticed labor ahead. Orientation is swift; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The courtyard’s vines, basin cracks, and lantern constellations constrain every move; the bread crust’s chimney-soot scent anchors vanished time. Final moonlit rivulets charge the closure image, making the setting indispensable. Spatial choreography is flawless.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding sacredness in the ordinary—tightens when Elias confesses his sterile complicity; the deepening is the shift from noticing to planting. Cost is legible: perpetual, unseen insurgency. One meaningful intensification suffices under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete acts: seedballs and bread crumbs re-sacralize the mundane. Final image of moonlit soil threads back to “ordinary relieved of its disguise” without moralizing. Subtext in shared silence and steam-dragon carries the weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Elias’s “heuristically gentle” testing of soil, scent-tracking, synesthetic warmth at the door. Syntax modulates with emotional pressure; no head-hop. Dialogue sparse but subtext-rich.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and thematic work. No loops, no mixed metaphors. Minor elevation in “sacrament” is earned by ritual context.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Guerrilla gardening as quiet revolution, vanished-bakery relic, and tea-house caretaker synthesize into a fresh angle on stewardship vs. witness. Risky lyric compression pays off in the final moonlit weave. No derivative echoes.</comment>
