<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Liora’s skeptical affection is embodied in micro-choices—rolling the blister pack, cupping the candle-thought—yet the final renunciation (slowing breath to sever the link) feels slightly under-costed; we see the tactic but not the visceral price. Interior contradiction is vivid, but the moment of yielding to “willowglass hope” could carry more bodily consequence to fully earn the Earned Stasis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the studio darkens except for one ember of possibility, reconfiguring the stake from proof to guarded continuation. Causal chain holds—pill → link → intrusion → shutdown—under a Causal lens, with a clear, felt cost: tomorrow’s stricter barriers. Orientation is swift; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The light-painting studio is more than backdrop; shutter arrays and geode sliver actively constrain tactics and color the final ember. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered (“citrus and graphite on the palate”). Micro-setting (geode against sternum) charges the closure image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—illuminate pathways without corporate trespass—tightens when the metallic intrusion forces protocol two. One decisive turn: Liora slows breath to sever the link, trading wonder for safety. Cost is visible (darkened studio, deferred tomorrow), escalation coherent under Causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Theme of skeptical wonder emerges through embodied experiment rather than statement; the final ember reweights prior motifs without moralizing. Subtext in the shared pulse data and the “temporary eclipse” invites reflection on risk and restraint. No thematic echo in final paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct—precise yet lyrical, scientific diction fused with sensory metaphor (“fractally precise spirals,” “willowglass hope”). POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Compression and elision are taught early (“static shock snapped… timer sounded”) and paid off in the hush-dark ending.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers action, sensation, and concept. No loops or scaffold; metaphors are coherent (“lighthouse watches tides”). Rhythm modulates with pressure—longer cadence for wonder, clipped for intrusion. Minor elevated diction (“conceptual trespass”) fits Liora’s lexicon.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Telepathy-via-biometric-light-painting is a fresh synthesis; the geode as lightning rod and the shutter algorithm feel inevitable yet non-obvious. Corporate intrusion reframes wonder as vulnerability without gimmickry. Specificity throughout prevents trope drift; removal of any core gadget would collapse the logic.</comment>
