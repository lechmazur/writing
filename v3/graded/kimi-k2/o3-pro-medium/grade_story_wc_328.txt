<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Milo’s interior contradiction—grief vs. scientific detachment—drives every micro-choice; the moment he seeds his resentments into the phone, motive crystallizes with visible cost. Juniper’s presence supplies relational pressure that alters the final stance. Only the brother’s reappearance feels slightly gift-wrapped rather than earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the Loamling’s laughter reweights Milo’s grief into song, with the arrowhead’s chirp and the erased tapes as felt cost. Causal chain holds—confession → conductor → transformation—under an Accumulative/Textural lens. No orientation drift; anchors clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The underground garden is not backdrop; its mulch, lamps, and thyme actively conduct the transformation. Micro-setting (flint arrowhead, cordless phone) constrains the ritual and charges the final image. Sensory selection stays urgent and POV-filtered.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Dominant stake—turn bitterness into shared laughter—tightens once when Milo offers his resentments as seed. Cost is the erased mission logs and the irreversible fusion of Devon with the Loamling. Agency drives escalation; coincidence complicates but does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of grief transmuted into communal delight emerges through concrete ritual rather than statement. Final image of “thawed sunlight” reweights prior frost without moralizing. Subtext in the static confessions and arrowhead sparks carries the conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet disciplined, with a perceptual signature tuned to fungal damp and mineral sparks. Syntax modulates from hushed descent to charged incantation under pressure. No head-hopping; POV stays locked to Milo’s sensorium.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; figurative language serves pattern rather than ornament. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances stakes or texture. Occasional elevated diction (“gravitationally playful”) is voice-motivated and consistent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of cryptid lore, grief ritual, and eco-poetics; the Loamling as grief compost feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risky lyric compression pays off in the final reconfiguration. No derivative echoes.</comment>
