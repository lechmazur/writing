<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is vivid—trembling fingers, bruised awe, heartbeat offered as metronome—yet the “lullaby” motive remains slightly abstract until the final sacrifice. The porcelain head functions as memory-jar and catalyst, grounding her contradictory impulses. The renunciation of her own pulse is earned and costly, though the mentor’s warning feels more thematic than causal.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the gears re-tune time at half a notch gentler, paid for by Mara’s surrendered heartbeat. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each image (tide, puppet, lighthouse breathing) layers density until the final lullaby reweights everything. No orientation drift; causality is lyric but legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The lighthouse, dusk tide, and breathing shutters form a micro-setting that actively constrains choice: the lantern’s beam exhales stories, the pane of hush becomes a humming membrane. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered. The environment is indispensable to the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—soften the apocalypse—tightens through eight remaining revolutions and the irreversible heartbeat cost. One meaningful deepening: the black key’s insertion reconfigures the mechanism and forecloses Mara’s mortality. Agency drives escalation under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: mercy as imperfect music that can delay oblivion. The cracked bell, lullaby, and golden vein of forgiven sin reconfigure meaning without moralizing. Final image of the lighthouse guiding futures yet unwritten offers non-literal resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet disciplined, with rhythmic control that accelerates under pressure (“gears stuttered, then sang”). Perceptual signature is distinct—salt wind inhaled by shutters, bruised awe modulating with each beat. No head-hopping; compression and elision are taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence layers image or stakes. Metaphors are precise—“tide crawled like a tired creature,” “pane of hush”—and never muddle causality. Minor loop risk in “bruised awe” repetition is offset by tonal necessity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses apocalyptic clock-tuning with puppet-memory alchemy; the synthesis feels inevitable. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without obscuring closure. Specificity of the porcelain head’s journey from emperors to ghosts anchors universals.</comment>
