<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mirielle’s vocation and her private hunger for “meaning in the margins” give her a sharp, active lens; the clipboard micro-choices (noting glyphs, accepting chalk) externalize interior stakes. Palimpsest functions more as oracle than counter-pressure, so relationship-as-crucible is thin, yet her final decision to sketch beside the drain crystallizes a cost (she steps from observer to participant). Interiority stays concrete, avoids label-speak, and the emoticon-chalk keys feel idiosyncratic rather than generic.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the chalk gift rewrites Mirielle’s vocation from name-vendor to sentiment-archaeologist, cost legible in the final image of her first public sketch. Causal chain—contract, invisible letter, chalk transfer—holds; no teleporting props. Orientation is clean within 120 words. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of “margins > text” intensifies until the closing reweighting; no ambiguity at exit.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Arcade dawn is filtered through Mirielle’s courier-bred attention to light, scent, drone ozone; details braid into action (sunrise stripes on bench guide seating, chalk only reveals under violet light). The clipboard serves as micro-setting that constrains every beat. Spatial choreography is clean; no floating rooms. Environment is not merely painted but used—UV glow and mail slot materially enable the invisible-letter gambit.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: will Mirielle keep collecting fragments or risk authorship? Tightening occurs when Palimpsest hands her the chalk—tool converts observation into potential publication, narrowing safe distance. Cost is loss of anonymity, shown in her public sketch at close. Pressure is coherent under Accumulative lens; no off-stage resolution. Could use one more intermediate beat where she hesitates/erases to push tension past 8.0.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of “margins outliving official text” emerges through chalk, emoticons, UV ink—never sermonized. Final image of sidewalk glyphs beside storm drain reconfigures earlier “margins” motif from private notebook to civic graffiti, implying future erasure yet present witness. Ambiguity is productive: is she preserving or defacing? No tidy moral. Subtext in Palimpsest’s cracked phonograph voice and limp implies bodily obsolescence without exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Mirielle; perceptual signature vivid (“fragrance of futuristic nostalgia,” “sunrise painted thin stripes across their shadows”). Syntax flexes with pressure—long reflective sentences early, shorter percussive clauses during chalk transfer. No head-hopping. Dialogue sparse but voice-distinct: Palimpsest’s archaic cadence vs Mirielle’s contractual directness. Free indirect blends cleanly: “she realized he was writing codes…”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable; metaphors mixed only when intentional (“voice cracking like an old phonograph”). No loops or scaffold. Strong verbs: “slid the parchment halfway, paused as though listening to centuries whisper.” One paraphrase hiccup: “emptied now of destination” echoes prior “last letter” beat, but minor. UV/chalk mechanics explained through action, not exposition. Final line cadence lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses cyber-courier culture with pre-digital nostalgia; emoticon-labeled chalk is a fresh, specific artifact. Palimpsest name and “annotate the world before it forgets itself” could feel writerly, yet grounded in his limp, blank parchment, and courier-slot ritual. Risk taken: invisible ink letter whose content reader never sees—works because closure focuses on Mirielle’s shift, not message. Transformation test passes: story depends on courier guild, surface mail, chalk glyphs—swap medium, arc collapses.</comment>
