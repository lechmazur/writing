<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s contradictory impulses—tidy endings vs. the messy promise to Declin—are dramatized through micro-choices (placing the ring, pressing her palm to his spine). The final renunciation of daylight is earned and carries visible cost. Interiority is embodied and specific; only the “shadow keeper” label edges toward abstraction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Declin’s passage reweights the sanctuary and Mara’s vocation. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each breath-sculpting beat thickens pattern until the final image rinses soot without erasing history. Cost is legible in the “loaded emptiness” that now knows how to breathe.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The sanctuary’s charred stones, rusted ring, and starlight through the oculus constrain every gesture; the setting literally teaches breathing. Spatial choreography is clean; the ring’s placement and the doorway’s absence guide the climax. Micro-setting (altar nail, bronze mouth) functions as charged object.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—teaching suffocation to breathe—tightens through each failed/achieved mist-sphere. One meaningful deepening: the sphere holds, then drifts to the threshold, forcing Mara’s renunciation. Cost is felt in her calm acceptance of the burned bridge.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of stewardship-as-grief emerges from concrete acts (ring placement, breath lessons) without moralizing. The final image—sanctuary darkness inhaling easily—offers a non-literal answer: wounds can learn lungcraft. Subtext in gesture and silence sustains ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet disciplined; perceptual signature filters every detail through Mara’s vocation (“bruised memories… first editions”). Syntax modulates with pressure—long exhalations vs. brittle fragments. No head-hopping; POV remains stable and embodied.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; figurative language serves pattern (constellations of soot, smoke learning cursive). No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Rhythm breathes with the scene’s inhalations/exhalations. Minor elevated diction (“lamp light behind parchment”) stays within Mara’s librarian-poet lexicon.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The premise—teaching the dead to breathe via scar-linked breath-sculpting—feels fresh yet inevitable. Familiar grief tropes are transformed through the sanctuary’s liminal physics and the ring’s bronze mouth. Risky lyric compression pays off in the final reconfiguration.</comment>
