<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Ezra’s interior contradiction—archivist vs. pawnless player—drives every micro-choice; the nod he records is a visible cost that seals joint stewardship. Calypso’s benevolent ruthlessness is embodied in the recorder placement and the cataloguing of hesitations, not merely labeled. Relationship crucible forces Ezra from lone pilgrim to co-custodian with a single neck-muscle gesture.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the gallery’s whispers shift from guarded secrets to shared archive, cost paid by Ezra’s forfeiture of sole authorship. Causal chain—pawnless board → kinetic script → joint stewardship—holds without gaps. Orientation is secured by line 3; no debt applied.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The whispering gallery’s acoustic curve literally channels choices (footstep-spell, echo-chess) and supplies the final microphones that reconfigure power. Marble tile temperature under Ezra’s palm is a micro-setting that constrains the decision moment. Sensory hierarchy is POV-filtered and purposeful.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—who will own memory—tightens when Calypso’s cataloguing exposes Ezra’s hesitations, forcing the joint-stewardship offer. Escalation is causal: each echo-scraped move narrows options until the only live path is shared custody. Cost is the surrender of sole narrative control, visible in the signed nod.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the tension between preservation and ownership; the final image of newborn pawns of story reborn in language reframes history as collaborative listening. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers over whether the alliance will survive the next crown. Subtext operates in the kinetic script and the recorder’s red light.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with rhythmic compression (“luminous absence,” “nomadic penumbra”) taught early and paid off in the final hush. Perceptual signature is Ezra’s—every detail filtered through an archivist’s hunger for micro-gesture. No POV leakage; dialogue is spare and subtextual.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and motion. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is patterned and purposeful. Read-aloud rhythm modulates with stakes—longer cadence for reflection, clipped for the CHECKMATE footfalls.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: acoustic architecture as living archive, chess without pawns as metaphor for history missing its expendable witnesses. Kinetic spelling via footfalls feels inevitable yet surprising. Risk in lyric density pays off; no derivative echoes.</comment>
