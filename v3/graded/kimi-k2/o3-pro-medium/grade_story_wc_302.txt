<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“heart trembling with cautious exuberance”), but the final renunciation—surrendering the watch—feels slightly under-motivated; we see the cost (loss of the timepiece) yet the emotional ledger isn’t fully dramatized on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the missing second letter reorders time inside the library, and the protagonist’s silent acceptance reconfigures her stance. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density and cadence shift at the silverleaf mirror—while the felt cost (abandoning the watch) is legible in the final beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The fog, glowing shelves, and silverleaf mirror are selective, sensory, and purposeful; the library itself constrains choice by demanding silence. Spatial choreography is coherent, and the setting charges the final image without ornamental drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding the library—tightens when the second letter proves to be the missing temporal keystone. One meaningful deepening occurs as silence becomes the price of access; the cost is visible (loss of voice, then of the watch) and narrows options under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of unspoken words emerges organically from the library’s architecture and the protagonist’s renunciation. The final mirror image offers a resonant, non-literal answer—her own silences released—without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet controlled; perceptual signature is consistent (“veiled dreamer,” “wings of quiet paper”). Patterned elision (backward letters, mirrored cipher) is taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with only minor figurative excess (“mist brightened ahead”). No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. The final cadence breathes appropriately.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The premise—library of unspoken words accessed through temporal delay—feels fresh and inevitable. Risky lyric structure is fully committed; the silverleaf mirror reweights earlier motifs without gimmickry.</comment>
