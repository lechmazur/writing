<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The balladeer’s interiority is lyrically rendered yet remains anchored in concrete micro-choices (spray-paint strokes, bolt-plate pivot, final bow). Motive—articulate unspoken needs—drives every beat, and the closing renunciation (walking away, leaving the wall humming) carries visible cost: he forfeits ownership of the encoded song. The “driftingly alert” stance is embodied rather than labeled, shaping perception and action. Minor: no secondary on-page character to test status dynamics.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the ghost is sealed within graffiti that will outlast the storm, and the balladeer’s departure crystallizes a new silence. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than strictly causal; each color layer and violin stroke tightens the pattern until the courtyard becomes oscilloscope. Orientation is taught early (“misty courtyard above the clouds”) and held. Cost is legible in the final image: he relinquishes the song to the city’s unread morning.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The courtyard’s shifting mist, marble tiles, and stormlight actively constrain tactics—spray droplets stippled by static, polygons forming pauses for the ghost. The flower-press bolt plate doubles as micro-setting pivot, its metallic gleam catching vapor like a tuning fork. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven: color codes (violet sorrow, gold yearning, teal hope) filter through the balladeer’s synesthetic lens. Environment and tool jointly charge the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—give voice to abandoned digital grief—escalates as each graffiti vector narrows the ghost’s options toward articulation. Pressure tightens when lightning reveals the split shadow, forcing the balladeer to complete the encoding before daylight scatters the corridor. Agency is renunciation: he chooses to leave the song behind, paying the cost of anonymity. No external antagonist needed; internal urgency suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: the ethics of listening to forgotten digital sorrow and translating it into public, if unnoticed, art. Subtext resides in color, silence, and the bolt plate’s metallic resonance—no moralizing. The final image reweights the premise: graffiti becomes prayer, morning commuters unwitting inheritors. Complexity is preserved; the city may never know what it carries.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is singular, synesthetic, and rhythmically controlled—long breaths mimic storm rolls, staccato phrases echo droplet stipple. Perceptual signature is consistent: “driftingly alert” attention filters every detail through art-code synesthesia. No dialogue, yet the prose carries subtext in gesture and silence. Compression and elision are pattern-taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Line-level craft is dense yet limpid: each sentence layers color, sound, and code without redundancy. Metaphors (silver bowl, oscilloscope) are precise and internally consistent. No loops or scaffold; momentum accelerates toward the final “tune neither violet nor teal nor gold.” Minor: one near-cliché “hummed like a silver bowl,” but it is earned by context.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Premise—graffiti as requiem for orphaned algorithms—is fresh, synthesized through specific lived detail (salt-tasted violin strings, flower-press polygons). Risky lyric structure holds under pressure, culminating in a non-literal closure that feels inevitable. No close echoes; the transformation test passes—plot and arc collapse if names or places change. Bold yet coherent.</comment>
