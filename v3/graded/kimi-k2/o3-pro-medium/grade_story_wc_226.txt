<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Vera’s contradictory need to remember her failures while bargaining for forgiveness is embodied in her spiral-painting and poem-exchange; the Marshal’s shift from law-bound to co-creator is credibly seeded by the dust ritual. Both carry visible cost—her forfeited absolution, his torn warrant—yet interiority occasionally drifts toward poetic abstraction that blurs micro-choice granularity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the spire’s mirrors crystallize their joint poem into prismatic truths, foreclosing ritual compliance. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each refracted stanza deepens the pattern until the Marshal’s warrant becomes meaningless confetti. One minor drift: the Marshal’s sigil damp attempt feels like a skipped beat rather than a causal setback.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The canyon’s bone towers and pearl grit are tactile constraints—Vera’s sandals kick up dust that literally colors the negotiation. The spire’s mirrors charge the final image, reweighting the setting from ominous judge to collaborative canvas. Spatial choreography is clean; only the orchard flashback momentarily dilutes present-mist immediacy.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth versus erasure—tightens when the spire demands memory as payment; Vera’s refusal escalates through each spiral of pigment and stanza. The Marshal’s alliance narrows options, forcing a joint poem that costs both their prior certainties. Pressure is coherent, though the external threat of arrest dissolves almost too cleanly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Forgiveness as creative exchange rather than erasure emerges through the spirals and refracted light; no moral is stated, only mirrored. The final image of myriad partial truths avoids tidy resolution while charging the premise with undeniable conceptual cost. Subtext thrives in the Marshal’s silence as he scatters his own law.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Lush, controlled lyricism—“choir rehearsing regret in subterranean chambers”—is consistent with Vera’s artist-perception; the Marshal’s clipped mutter distinguishes his voice without breaking texture. Patterned elision (e.g., ritual details withheld) is taught early and paid off in the mirrored closure. No head-hopping; POV remains anchored to Vera’s senses.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences braid sensory precision with metaphoric propulsion—“dust refracted sunlight into brief stained-glass ghosts”—without overwriting. Zero loops or scaffold; each line advances stakes or atmosphere. Only a single mixed metaphor (“hammered glass” after “ricocheted”) nicks perfection.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The conceit of trading poems for absolution reframes the pilgrim trope through a defiant artist and a lawman seduced by color. Risky lyric density pays off when the canyon itself becomes co-author. Specificity—charcoal-stained finger, crimson dust—anchors the mythic frame in tactile reality.</comment>
