<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction vivid (paradox “closure seeker who opened wounds”), embodied pain steers choices; motivation anchors every act but late shift from self-study to altruistic conduit slips emotional continuity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens maintained; coffee-ring map and hourglass create repeating pattern whose final reconfiguration (miracle’s transfer) reads as Resonant Reconfiguration with felt physical cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Frosted hourglass and tower at dawn are atmospheric yet materially constrain micro-timing; micro-setting (body as map) and plants as antenna fuse to limit Odelia’s movements and charge final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Single stakes—restore the child’s miracle—escalate via successive micro-slits beneath sutures; each slice raises pain and narrows options until only transfer remains, paid with her own bleeding.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of “truth not silence” woven through scars and miracles emerges from action, never sermons; final moment reframes the Surgeons’ error into understated moral repricing: closure comes by relinquishment.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Lyrical, sensory-tight first-person voice holds cadence and POV; chlorophyll riddles and “meteor hush” sound individual and taught; no leakage beyond her skin and no head-hop.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Rhythm, precision, and compression excellent; occasional stacked ornamental metaphors (“bloomed like poppies,” “chlorophyll riddles”) never stall the closure image; clean transitions and no scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Grafts fantasy (miracle sponge) onto medical realism without cliché; reversal of healing into willed reopening carries fresh moral calculus; nothing is swappable without destabilizing premise.</comment>
