<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Maren’s curiosity and risk-embrace are embodied in tactile choices—cracking the seal, adjusting the terrarium vent—yet her interiority drifts into thematic exposition (“innovation did need hush”) rather than contradictory impulse. The final whispered gratitude shows earned stance but lacks visible cost; the seed’s glow is more wonder than consequence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the storm-born silence thickens into the seed’s glow, each sensory layer reweighting the premise. Closure lands as Charged Poise—Maren photographs the sprout, whispering thanks—where the cost is the surrender of secrecy and the embrace of unknown odor. Orientation is swift; no causality break.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The workshop’s shelved gears and moonlit brook are filtered through Maren’s puzzle-maker eye; every object is potential mechanism. The terrarium becomes micro-setting that will later vent stench, constraining airflow design. Spatial choreography is clean; the brook’s murmur threads the hush without clutter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: safeguard creative space vs. risk of olfactory chaos. Pressure tightens when the seed germinates within minutes, forcing immediate tactical sketching. The cost is the irreversible commitment to a stench-driven room; escalation is single but sufficient under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme—discomfort as catalyst—emerges from the corpse-flower paradox and Maren’s sketches of scent-based locks. Final image of “every unlocked tomorrow begin to turn” offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. Subtext whispers through the skull-bloom seal and pollen-like phrase settling in her mind.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is precise, tactile, slightly arcane—“orthogonal approaches,” “pollen inside her mind”—consistent with a riddle-smith. Syntax modulates from languid dusk description to clipped design notes. No dialogue; no POV drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers sensory detail or design logic. Occasional elevated diction (“enigmatic,” “orthogonal”) fits the POV. No loops, no mixed metaphors; “storm-born silence” recurs with earned weight.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: escape-room design meets botanic horror in miniature. The corpse-flower seed as both puzzle-box and map feels inevitable yet surprising. Risk—embracing rot as mechanism—pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
