<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Milo’s interiority is vivid and embodied—his “wistfully pragmatic” stance shows in every micro-choice (wedging seashell shards, guiding Nara’s hands). The contradiction between caretaker tenderness and pragmatic risk-taking drives the final decision to bring Nara below. Cost is felt: the prism now demands a living steward, foreclosing Milo’s solitary freedom. Only a slight over-articulation of “protected vulnerability” keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the prism’s crack seals under Nara’s touch, reweighting the city’s light and Milo’s role. Causal chain holds—rose petal → brass tooth → prism repair → shared stewardship—each beat narrowing options. Cost is explicit: “the prism’s fissure widened… required a living steward.” No orientation drift; lens is causal throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Harbor, tower, and mirrored chamber are rendered with tactile specificity; moonlit water and algae-slick ladder constrain Milo’s movements. The prism itself becomes micro-setting that charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; no white-room gaps. One minor over-description (“billions of captured moonbeams”) nudges it below 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore light for Nara—tightens when the rose fails and the prism threatens collapse. Escalation is causal: each repair attempt increases the cost of stewardship. Final choice to bring Nara down crystallizes the trade-off. Pressure is coherent; no coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of shared caretaking emerges organically from Milo’s actions; no explicit moralizing. The rose, brass tooth, and prism accrue meaning through use, culminating in Nara as co-gardener. Final image of the glowing new rosebush reweights the premise without statement. Subtext in gesture—Nara’s trembling hands steadying the prism—carries the emotional charge.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet grounded in Milo’s pragmatic perception; syntax mirrors the “rhythm of oars in water.” No head-hopping; POV remains tightly focalized. Occasional elevated diction (“luminescence seeped”) is consistent with the harbor-at-night register. One near-cliché (“spent match”) keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; figurative language is selective and purposeful. No loops or scaffold. One mixed metaphor (“light coursed like sap”) is minor. Rhythm accelerates under pressure, then softens at closure. Clean mechanics throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Transforms the familiar “dying sister needs light” trope into a living stewardship myth anchored in harbor infrastructure. Brass tooth and prism feel inevitable in hindsight. Risk of bringing Nara into the tower pays off emotionally. Specificity of place and tool prevents cliché.</comment>
