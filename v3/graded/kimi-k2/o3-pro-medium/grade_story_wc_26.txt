<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Eira’s interiority is embodied in her “softly deliberate” gestures and the trembling palms that cradle the stone; her contradictory impulse—leave the sanctuary to save a grandmother who may not exist—drives the single decisive choice. The cost (irrevocable exile from the library) is felt on the page when she returns soaked and shining. Motivation is rooted in lineage and hope, not label-speak. Only the narrator’s passivity and slight emotional ventriloquism keep it from 8+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the grandmother’s silhouette gains partial solidity, the library accepts the book, and Eira’s exile is irreversible. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each reel, each pollen mote, each luminous tear layers density until the final image reweights the premise. Causality is intact: because Eira descends, the metamorphosis completes. Minor drift in POV pronouns near the end prevents 8.8.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The glass-rooted library, cloud veranda, and pollen-desk are not postcard backdrops; they constrain choices (no return once rain is touched) and supply tools (telescopes, ink-leaves). Sensory hierarchy is POV-biased: the narrator notices “perfumed pollen of paragraphs” and “stratosphere thermals.” The river stone’s glow charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; only a touch of floating geography during the descent keeps it shy of 9.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—preserve the shape of hope by proving the grandmother still walks—is signaled early and tightened when Eira must choose exile to gather the stone. Agency is hers alone; coincidence complicates (the silhouette appears exactly where the peddler stood) but does not resolve. The cost is legible: she cannot re-enter the library. One meaningful deepening suffices for 600–800 words.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: reels, pollen, river stones. The final image—petals erasing the border between archive and sky—offers a non-literal answer to how memory survives forgetting. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers. The phrase “keep noticing dusk” is earned, not asserted. Slight over-reliance on luminous regret as mood descriptor nudges it down.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet controlled; perceptual signature is consistent—“obsolete passwords,” “patient comet,” “dusk instead of oxygen.” Compression and elision are taught early (“after dreams become shareable”) and paid off. Rhythm modulates with pressure: longer cadences in the library, clipped descent. No head-hopping. Minor template cadence in “we decided… we climbed…” costs 0.1.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence advances image or stakes. Metaphors are precise—“stone heavy with possibility, or perhaps with forgiveness.” No loops or scaffold. One mixed metaphor (“wings of dusk”) under stress costs 0.2. Grammar and tense are clean; paragraph cuts are purposeful. Final line avoids explain-everything.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The premise—a skyborne library that archives shareable dreams via silent film reels—synthesizes familiar tropes into a singular vision. Risky lyric compression is fully committed; the shadow unbound is not a gimmick but the engine of stakes. Specificity anchors universals: obsolete passwords, linen-clad children, regulation reservoir. Transformation test passed; story fails without these exact particulars.</comment>
