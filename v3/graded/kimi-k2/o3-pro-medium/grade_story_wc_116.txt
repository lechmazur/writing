<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The chronicle keeper’s interiority is vivid—"neutrality felt like treason"—and the oath to witness without judgment creates a clear, contradictory impulse that culminates in the final refusal to intervene. However, the cost of that refusal is more asserted than embodied; we see the rising water but not a palpable forfeiture that scars the narrator.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the narrator re-commits to witnessing while the city drowns, a choice foreclosed by prior causality. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of mirrored selves and digested journals reweights the stake—yet the cost, though legible, is slightly diffuse.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>From moss-furred shelves to obsidian walls, every setting beat is filtered through the keeper’s biased perception and constrains choice; the mirrored refuge literally reconfigures the final image. Sensory hierarchy is tight—torchlight, mildew, black glass—anchoring orientation early and evolving with the drift of seasons.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—witness versus intervention—tightens once when the floodwater rises and the oath forbids action. Pressure is coherent under the Accumulative lens, but the visible price (lost journals, blank swan) feels symbolic rather than tactical; still, the narrowing of options is unmistakable.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the keeper’s stance: memory versus erasure, the ethics of bearing witness. The final image of the boat sliding onward reweights the premise without moralizing, letting silence itself become the resonant answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is distinct—archival, slightly fevered, with rhythmic control that modulates under pressure (“reality felt thinner, yet steadier”). Perceptual signature is consistent; no head-hopping or register drift. Compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is selective and purposeful. Minor scaffold appears (“I unfolded, refolded, and the corridors unfolded with me”) but does not obscure causality or dull the final image. No mixed metaphors or loops in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The origami-swan-as-map, the regenerative silence, and the mirrored refuge synthesize into a fresh, inevitable whole. Risk-taking—folding corridors, digesting journals—heightens stakes without gimmickry; the concept commits fully and pays off in the final drift.</comment>
