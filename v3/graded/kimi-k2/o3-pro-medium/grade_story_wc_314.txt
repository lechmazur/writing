<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sera’s contradictory impulses—yearning for transcendence yet clinging to mortal tenderness—are dramatized in the orchard climb and crystal choice; the embodied cost (pulse-tempered flame under collarbone) is visible and earned. Interiority is specific, not diagnostic. Only the “secretly sentimental” label is slightly external, but the pressed violets under beakers rescue it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Sera’s compromise (flame caged, not freed) reconfigures her future and the orchard’s fate. Causal chain—starling warning → climb → memory exchange → tempered flame—holds under Accumulative/Textural lens. Cost is legible in the final hush and muted waterfall colors.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The orchard’s moonseeded bark and wind-chimed leaves actively constrain Sera’s ascent and the memory exchange; the crystal’s pulse beneath her collarbone becomes a micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered. No orientation debt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve mortal tenderness without destroying orchard equilibrium—is signaled early and tightened when the crystal’s inner flame threatens both. One meaningful deepening: Sera’s heartbeat tempers the flame, narrowing options to a wick, not blaze. Cost is felt in the orchard’s sigh and her new hush.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of balance between logic and intuition emerges organically from Sera’s micro-choices; the final image of “wonder learning restraint” offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. No thematic echo in final paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with controlled compression (“river-light turned solid”). Perceptual signature is alchemist-specific: equations in starlings, theorem memories. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; figurative language is patterned and paid off (“threads of silver light…etched a stable figure-eight”). No loops, no mixed metaphors. Rhythm modulates with pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemy, starling augury, and orchard memory-exchange; transformation trope is reweighted by refusal rather than ascension. Specificity of moonseed bark and pressed violets anchors universals. Risky lyric mode succeeds.</comment>
