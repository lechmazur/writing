<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maris’s interiority is precise and embodied—her “fingers readjust a crooked volume” and she “counts texture as well as numerals.” The contradiction between her tranquil logic and the rising flood is dramatized, and her final stamp carries visible cost. Yet the absence of any second on-page character limits relational crucible depth.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the red stamp on the condemned codex forecloses return and seals the library. Causal chain—blackout disables floodgates, water surges when codex is lifted—holds under a Causal lens. Cost is legible in the collapsing shelves and her exile above.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The drowned library is rendered through tactile specificity—“salt breeze filtering upward through cracks,” “bioluminescent algae clung.” The setting actively constrains choice: darkness forces echo-mapping, rising water forces retreat. The ink stamp and codex function as micro-settings that charge the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—truth versus forgery—is signaled early and tightened when Maris detects fresh ink grooves. One decisive turn: lifting the codex triggers flood. Agency remains hers; coincidence (blackout) complicates but does not resolve. Cost is the sealed archive and her exile.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of “reclaimed stillness” emerges through action: each authentic stamp restores silence amid war-born lies. Final image—the bleeding red proof against dawn—reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext in marginalia and algae light invites reflection on manufactured history.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet disciplined, with rhythmic control—“pulse of dripping water,” “dappled resolve.” Perceptual signature is consistent: Maris notices by texture, echo, and salt. No POV leakage; compression (“Tonight her task was complicated…”) is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers sensory and conceptual work—“algae light dimmed, and water surged.” No loops or mixed metaphors. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing”) is voice-motivated. Final cadence shift—“fragile pages”—lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Forged chronicles hidden in a drowned archive is fresh; the indexer who reads by texture transforms a familiar post-apocalyptic trope. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without gimmickry. The red stamp as both tool and verdict feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
