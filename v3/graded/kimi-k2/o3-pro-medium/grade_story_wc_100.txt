<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s “inadvertently stubborn” streak is dramatized through tactile micro-choices—tracing cracks, reciting names—culminating in the renunciation that costs him the surface world. Interiority is concrete and profession-rooted; the final ledger entry embodies the price. No contradictory impulses are shown in-scene, so the 9+ quick test is narrowly missed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elias’s refusal to ascend reconfigures both the living and the drowned, with the coat on the lectern as visible cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of light, silence, and shelved grief tightens until the final exhalation. No causality breaks; every beat follows “therefore” logic under watery physics taught on-page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The basalt plinth, coral tomes, and bioluminescent script constrain Elias’s ritual choices; the lens itself becomes micro-setting that charges the final beacon. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered (“muffled hush,” “singed wick”). Spatial choreography remains coherent across impossible descent and dry-boot miracle.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—giving rest to ignored distress signals—is signaled in paragraph four and tightened when Elias recites names, trading his own future for theirs. One meaningful deepening suffices; the price is the irreversible occupation of impossible space. Agency drives every escalation; coincidence complicates but never resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the undertaker’s vocation inverted: the living must bury themselves so the dead may lie still. The final image of the ledger with coordinates reweights every prior burial without moralizing. Subtext operates in silence and shelved books; no thematic echo is spoken aloud.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is weathered, maritime, and precise—“salt fire,” “guttering lanterns,” “singed wick willingly drowning.” Syntax lengthens underwater, then compresses at the end, mirroring pressure. No dialogue, so single-POV coherence is flawless; perceptual signature is distinct and sustained.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet limpid; every sentence layers image, action, and consequence. No loops, no mixed metaphors. Rhythm modulates from storm-beat cadence to submerged hush, then final stillness. The closing “calm no storm could exhume” crystallizes without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The premise—an undertaker becomes librarian to unburied grief—feels inevitable yet wholly fresh. Tropes of underwater cities and ghost-lights are transformed through Elias’s vocational lens. Risky occupation of impossible space is earned by early patterning; the final ledger entry is a non-obvious synthesis that recharges the opening parcel.</comment>
