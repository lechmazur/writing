<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses (to reveal vs preserve the monks’ myth) surface in the trance and in her final speech. The cost—publicly shattering the glacier’s halo—is dramatized and paid. Minor slip: the monks remain collective silhouettes rather than individuals, so relationship crucible is thin.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the glacier becomes translucent, the keeper walks free, and the monks’ worldview is permanently altered. Causal chain holds: because Mara exposes the tomb, the glacier yields its prisoner. Cost is legible in the monks’ collective gasp and the petals’ thaw.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ice shrine, snow globe, and glacier wall are not mere backdrop; they constrain every move and finally crack open to reveal the trapped corridors. Sensory specificity is selective—resin smoke, frozen petals, refracted candlelight—each filtering Mara’s perception and charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—free the keeper or perpetuate denial—is signaled early and tightened once: Mara’s decision to expose the glacier. Escalation is causal and irreversible; the price is the monks’ shattered ideal. No reversals needed; one decisive tightening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of truth versus curated beauty emerges organically from the keeper’s entrapment and the monks’ denial. Final image—pilgrims seeing themselves in the drifting glitter—offers a non-moralizing, resonant reweighting. Avoids explicit sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with a perceptual signature rooted in Mara’s wreck-diver sensorium (“borrowed starlight,” “rust-ed lies”). Syntax modulates with pressure; no head-hop. Experimental elision (dream navigation) is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image, emotion, and forward motion. No loops, mixed metaphors, or scaffold. Occasional elevated diction (“resinous smoke,” “constellation”) remains within Mara’s plausible lexicon and serves atmosphere.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Premise synthesizes ghost-whispering, glacial entombment, and miniature lighthouses into an inevitable whole. Risky lyric compression pays off: the melted snow globe reconfigures from souvenir to soul-prison. No derivative echoes; transformation feels specific and earned.</comment>
